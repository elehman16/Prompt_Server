combined with routine physiotherapy in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome through
subjective, physical, and electrophysiological studies. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty
patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (totally 32 hands) were assigned two groups:
treatment and control groups. In both groups, patients received the routine physiotherapy.
In addition to the routine physiotherapy, patients in the treatment group received
neuromobilization. The symptoms severity scale, visual analogue scale, functional status
scale, Phalen&#x02019;s sign, median nerve tension test, and median nerve distal sensory and motor
latency were assessed. [Results] There were significant improvements in the symptoms
severity scale, visual analogue scale, median nerve tension test, and Phalen&#x02019;s sign in
both groups. However, the functional status scale and median nerve distal motor latency
were significantly improved only in the treatment group. [Conclusion] Neuromobilization in
combination with routine physiotherapy improves some clinical findings more effectively
than routine physiotherapy. Therefore, this combination can be used as an alternative
effective non-invasive treatment for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Carpal tunnel syndrome</kwd><kwd>Neuromobilization</kwd><kwd>Electrophysiological measures</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most well-known entrapment neuropathy in the upper
extremity. In CTS the median nerve is compressed in the wrist<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is characterized by pain, tingling, numbness, and motor weakness
distal to the wrist in severe CTS, particularly in the first three digits, which is enhanced
at night<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. CTS is more commonly found in individuals who perform repetitive
hand activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the sensory
symptoms often appear in prolonged activities of the finger and wrist flexor muscles.
Patients with CTS rarely complain of actual weakness of the affected hand<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The evaluation of CTS is mainly based on the clinical findings, i.e., those of subjective
and physical examination, and electrophysiological studies<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to the high prevalence and medical cost of treating patients with CTS<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, its diagnosis and timely treatment are very
important both for physicians and patients. Often, a non-invasive treatment protocol
including medication, modifications to occupation and activities of daily living, rest
splint, and physiotherapy are recommended for patients with mild to moderate CTS<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some efficacy has been reported of CTS
treatments using physiotherapy modalities such as low power laser therapy, transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), therapeutic ultrasound, rest splint, etc<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some findings in CTS pathophysiology,
including reduced gliding and motion of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, abnormal
strain on the median nerve during upper extremity movements, and possible peripheral
adhesion of the median nerve or even fibrosis of intranerve connective tissue, have provided
new insights into how CTS can be effectively treated<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been observed
that the median nerve glides longitudinally during upper extremity movements<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in entrapment neuropathies, e.g.
CTS, the longitudinal gliding of the nerve is partially limited<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
adhesion, fibrosis and possible scar tissue, namely nerve pathophysiological problems, may
cause difficulty for peripheral nerve adaptation in certain postures and movements. This, in
turn, may lead to limitation of nerve trunk motions relative to surrounding compartments as
well as a reduction in the normal gliding of nerve fibers and fascicles relative to each
other and connective tissues<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It seems that the immobilization of the wrist with a splint, or physiotherapy modalities in
order to reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation are of important modalities of CTS
treatment. However, they are unlikely to restore the normal function of the median
nerve<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neuromobilization maneuver has recently been used to treat nerve entrapment syndromes. It
consists of a series of therapeutic active and passive movements aimed at restoring the
normal mechanical properties of the nerve in common postures and during extremity
movements<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the studies of
non-invasive CTS treatment, only a limited number have used neuromobilization maneuvers to
relieve the symptoms of CTS, and these studies have reported contradictory results. Rozmaryn
et al. reported the efficacy of tendon and nerve gliding exercises in the treatment of
CTS<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Akalin et al., did not
observe any significant difference in the splint vs. the combination of splint, tendon and
nerve gliding exercise<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
there is no consensus on the efficacy of neuromobilization maneuvers in CTS.</p><p>Any pathology that reduces the nerve motion and normal strain may produce an abnormal
tension in the corresponding nerve in common postures and during extremity movements<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The key point in the management of CTS is
that the treatment protocol should consider all relevant structures surrounding the
nerve<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, a successful
neuromobilization maneuver for treatment of CTS would consist of specific neuromobilization
techniques, widening of the carpal tunnel, and flexor tendon gliding exercises, and these
additional interventions might have been ignored by previous studies. Thus, taking this into
account, it would appear that neuromobilization maneuvers help to restore longitudinal
motion of the affected nerve<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has
considered neuromobilization maneuvers for the treatment of CTS with regard to basic
principles: removing structural obstacles, i.e., widening the carpal tunnel and stretching
the transverse carpal ligament; applying an oscillatory neuromobilization technique (not
sustained) to the elbow joint (not to the wrist) with the median nerve relatively
stretched;, and passively performing neuromobilization at wrist adhering to the basic use of
neuromobilization, i.e., first performing neuromobilization more proximally from the wrist
and then proximal to the wrist<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in the present study we investigating the
efficacy of a neuromobilization maneuver combined with routine physiotherapy and compared
the results with those of routine physiotherapy in patients with CTS through subjective,
physical, and electrophysiological examinations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In a randomized clinical trial, registered in IRCT with the number of 138903094052N1, 20
patients with mild to moderate CTS (totally 32 hands) ranging from of 18 to 65&#x02005;years old
were recruited. Diagnosis of CTS was confirmed by both clinical and electrophysiological
findings. The latter included a median nerve distal motor latency &#x0003e; 4.4&#x02005;ms and a median
nerve distal sensory latency &#x0003e; 3.7&#x02005;ms<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> prior to the intervention. Patients were excluded from the study if
they met any of the following criteria: a positive compression test at the proximal area,
systemic peripheral neuropathy, a history of carpal tunnel release, metabolic disorders such
as diabetes or thyroid diseases, pregnancy, previous steroid injection into the carpal
tunnel, or atrophy of the thenar muscle. The qualifying subjects were first informed of the
study purpose and the protocol. Written, informed consent was then obtained from all of the
subjects, and the protocol was approved by the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences Ethics
Committee. Individual characteristics such as age, sex, weight, height, duration of disease,
and history of any underlying diseases were recorded prior to the intervention.</p><p>Twenty patients (32 hands) were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 16 hands),
which received routine physiotherapy including rest splint, TENS, and therapeutic
ultrasound, or the treatment group (n = 16 hands), which received a neuromobilization
maneuver in addition to the routine physiotherapy.</p><p>For the control group, a short cock-up splint was applied with the wrist in a neutral
position (0&#x000b0;). The patients were instructed to wear the splints at night and during the day
for a period of 4 weeks, as much as possible. TENS was administered for 20&#x02005;min each session,
3 days a week at a frequency of 80&#x02005;Hz, with a pulse duration of 60&#x02005;&#x000b5;s, and at an intensity
that produced a comfortable tingling sensation. Therapeutic ultrasound was administrated to
the palmar carpal tunnel area for 5&#x02005;min per session, 3 days a week at a frequency of 1&#x02005;MHz,
with an intensity of 1&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and a duty cycle of 20%.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned routine physiotherapy, patients in the treatment group
received the neuromobilization maneuver as described below.</p><p>Preliminary stage: transverse wrist extension mobilization was applied along with thumb
extension and radial abduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Transverse wrist extension mobilization along with thumb extension and radial
abduction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1017-g001"/></fig>) and followed by finger flexor tendon gliding exercise. It was passively applied 3
times in each session, for 30 sec each time, 3 days a week. Patients receiving this maneuver
were positioned so that there was no tension on the median nerve, i.e., head and neck placed
in a neutral position and the affected arms positioned at the subjects&#x02019; side. As the
intervention progressed, the maneuver was applied in a position with increasing tension on
the nerve.</p><p>Main stage: a neuromobilization maneuver including oscillatory elbow flexion-extension was
carried out. In order to increase tension on the median nerve, the position of the
arm-forearm-wrist-elbow was altered during the neuromobilization maneuver, depending on the
patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p> Median nerve tension test (MNTT) for a representative subject: Shoulder depression
(1), Shoulder abduction (2), Forearm supination and shoulder external rotation (3),
wrist and finger extension (4), and elbow extension (5)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1017-g002"/></fig>). The maneuver was applied 3 times in each session, with 15 repetitions of
oscillatory elbow flexion-extension each time, 3 days a week.</p><p>The electrophysiological measurements and clinical examinations, consisting of the Boston
questionnaire, Phalen&#x02019;s test, visual analogue scale (VAS), and median nerve tension test
(MNTT), were carried out for all patients before and after the 4 weeks of the intervention
program. The study was double blinded: the participants were not aware of the details of the
intervention in the groups. Also the staff performing the electrophysiological measurements
and analyzing the outcome measures were also blinded to the group allocations.</p><p>A commercially available EMG recorder (Medelec Synergy, Viasys 2005) was used for
electrophysiological studies. Distal sensory latency (milliseconds; DSL) was measured in the
standard way, in which the examined wrist was stimulated and the peak latency was recorded
14&#x02005;cm away in the middle finger. Distal motor latency (milliseconds; DML) was measured from
the wrist to the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The environmental temperature was kept
constant for all measurements. Electrophysiological measurements were performed by the same
physiatrist for all patients.</p><p>The Boston questionnaire consists of a symptoms severity scale (SSS) and a functional
status scale (FSS), and it was answered by the patients. SSS is evaluated by 11 questions
concerning pain, tingling, night symptoms, numbness, and hand weakness and responses range
from no symptoms (1 point) to symptoms too severe to perform activity (5 point). The average
of these 11 scores was used to quantify the severity of patients&#x02019; symptoms. FSS consists of
8 questions concerning functional activities and responses range from functional activities
with less deficiency (1 point) to functional activities with high deficiency (5 point). The
average of these 8 scores was used to quantify the patients&#x02019; functional status. VAS was used
to quantify the pain. Pain was rated from 0 to 10, which indicated no pain and maximum pain,
respectively.</p><p>For Phalen&#x02019;s test, the patients&#x02019; affected hand was passively flexed at the wrist and kept
flexed for 60 seconds. Phalen&#x02019;s test is considered positive if patients report increased
sensory symptoms in less than 60 seconds in the first three digits. Phalen&#x02019;s test was
performed once for each patient. MNTT was also performed for the patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. With the patients in the supine position
and their elbows kept at 90&#x000b0; flexion, MNTT was carried out with consecutive motions as
follows: 1) the shoulder girdle was slightly depressed downward, 2) the arm was abducted
slightly more than 90&#x000b0;, 3) the forearm was fully supinated and the shoulder externally
rotated, 4) the wrist and fingers were extended, and 5) the elbow was slowly extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig 2</xref>). The test was stopped if the signs or symptoms
of CTS (including pain, tingling, or numbness) appeared or increased in the thumb or the
first three digits, and the elbow extension angle was then measured. MNTT was conducted
three times, and the average measurement was used in the analysis. The tests were separated
by a 2-min rest interval. When the first four stages had been completed, the elbow was moved
through the range of extension, and the elbow extension angle was measured using a
goniometer at the time of reproduction or increase in hand symptoms.</p><p>The mean, standard deviation, and percentage improvement in outcomes were calculated for
all patients in the control and treatment groups. Statistical analysis was performed using
Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). The
data for each group were tested for the normal distribution with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. The outcome measures of each group before and after the intervention were compared
within and between groups using the paired t-test and the independent t-test, respectively.
The improvement in each outcome measure after the intervention was normalized to the
corresponding value prior to the intervention and used to compare the outcomes between
groups. The McNemar test was used to compare Phalen&#x02019;s sign before and after the intervention
within and between groups. Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05 in all
analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 32 hands of 20 patients with CTS were studied. The patients had a mean (&#x000b1;SD) age
of 46.7&#x000b1;11&#x02005;years and duration of CTS symptoms of 19.6&#x000b1;15.9 months, and they all completed
the 4-week intervention protocol. The outcome measure showed a normal distribution in both
groups. The comparison of the mean values of the outcome measures between before and after
the intervention in the control group showed that there were significant decreases in SSS,

physiotherapy improved SSS, VAS, MNTT, and Phalen&#x02019;s sign in patients with CTS at the end of
the 4-week intervention. The improvement in these outcomes may be attributable to the
physiotherapy modalities having decreased pain and in inflammation or edema in the carpal
tunnel. The effectiveness of physiotherapy modalities for pain relief and sensory symptoms
in patients with CTS has been reported by some studies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have reported that splints keep the wrist in a
low pressure position for the carpal tunnel, that TENS activates the gate control mechanism,
and that therapeutic ultrasound decreases inflammation resulting in improvements in SSS,
VAS, and Phalen&#x02019;s sign in patients with CTS<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, improvement in MNTT
may also be ascribed to the effect of physiotherapy modalities which have not been reported
in the previous studies.</p><p>We did not observe any improvement in the hand functional status scale in the control
group, possibly indicating that hand function is affected by several factors, such as
sensory signs and symptoms (pain, tingling, and numbness), nerve tension and gliding
capabilities, nerve conduction and muscular strengths.</p><p>Owing to differences in CTS severity, the number of the treatment sessions, and the
duration of symptoms in patients with CTS, different results have been reported regarding
the effects of physiotherapy modalities on electrophysiological parameters. In a study on
CTS patients with 8 months duration of symptoms, who were treated with ultrasound in 20
sessions, there was significant improvements in median nerve distal sensory and motor
latencies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in another study of
CTS patients with 48 months duration of symptoms, there were no significant improvements in
electrophysiological measures after 10 sessions of therapeutic ultrasound<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The presence of abnormal
electrophysiological findings may indicate that the underlying pathology causes pysiological
and structural damages such as demyelination and axonic damage<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The control group in our present study demonstrated no
significant improvement in electrophysiological parameters, suggesting that
electrophysiological parameters might not be affected by physiotherapy modalities alone. It
seems that other factors, not considered in the present study, such as age at CTS onset,
duration of CTS, ergonomy, and occupation might influence the effectiveness of routine
physiotherapy on electrophysiological parameters.</p><p>In addition to finding significant improvements in SSS, VAS, MNTT, and Phalen&#x02019;s sign in
patients with CTS in the treatment group, this study also found significant improvements in
the FSS and distal motor latency, indicating that the neuromobilization maneuver improved
hand function. A literature review of the effects of tendon and nerve gliding exercises for
the treatment of CTS revealed that rest splint along with exercises involving gliding of the
median nerve significantly improve Phalen&#x02019;s sign, grip, pinch, muscle strength, FSS, VAS,
and SSS<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, intracarpal tunnel pressure was decreased after
1 minute of active hand and wrist exercises<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, which might in turn lead to an improvement in clinical findings
due to regulation in venous return and distribution of edema in the nerve<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, contrary to the tendon and nerve gliding exercises described by
Totten and Hunter<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, we used transverse
wrist extension mobilization along with thumb extension and radial abduction, followed by
finger flexor tendons gliding, and then by oscillatory elbow flexion-extension. The possible
mechanism behind the effectiveness of the neuromobilization maneuver on CTS symptoms might
be associated with decreases in intracarpal tunnel pressure and intra- and extra-median
nerve edema, improvement in axoplasmic circulation, and release of nerve adhesion<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The significant reductions in MNTT and FSS in the treatment group, compared with the
control group (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), suggest that adaptation
mechanisms occurred in the patients who received the neuromobilization maneuver, as they
could place the affected limb in the median nerve stretched position without any symptoms at
the end of the 4-week intervention. The reduction in MNTT and FSS may also be associated
with a decrease in median nerve tension during movements and upper limb activities. We
expected to observe a great decrease in median nerve tension after the neuromobilization
maneuver intervention, because the stretched position of the median nerve in each session
formed the basis for performing the neuromobilization maneuver. This newly formed position
might have had an adaptation effect on the patients, resulting in an improvement in hand
function.</p><p>It needs to be pointed out that although SSS, VAS, and Phalen&#x02019;s sign were not significantly
different between the two study groups, their improvement percentages were higher in the
treatment group than in the control group. Furthermore, these improvements may be sustained
for a long period of time by the patients who received the neuromobilization maneuver
compared with the routine physiotherapy<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, this could not be verified in the present study because we
did not perform a follow up.</p><p>There are several limitations of this study that should be considered in future studies.
First, we used two CTS hands in patients with bilateral CTS due to the limited number of
participants enrolled in our study. In other words, we recommend investigating only one hand
in each CTS patient. Second, we did not follow up the patients to monitor the consistency of
the treatment effects. Further research is needed to study the systemic effects of the
neuromobilization maneuver on different aspects of CTS considering the above mentioned
limitations, including greater numbers of patients, and a wider range of CTS severity based
on the electrophysiological measurements.</p><p>In conclusion, routine physiotherapy including rest splint, TENS, and therapeutic
ultrasound seems to improve the symptom severity scale, visual analogue scale, median nerve
tension test, and Phalen&#x02019;s sign in patients with CTS. On the other hand, the
neuromobilization maneuver in combination with routine physiotherapy improved the functional
status scale and the median nerve distal motor latency. Therefore, this combination can be
used as an effective non-invasive treatment for patients with CTS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Priganc</surname><given-names>VW</given-names></name><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The relationship among five common carpal tunnel syndrome
