Current evidence informs us that patients report ongoing physical and psychological problems, and a decreased quality of life, for up to 5&#x02009;years after their original illness.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These problems start early, with muscle wasting occurring during the first week of critical illness and being more severe among those with multiple organ failure.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The aetiology of critical illness neuromyopathy is multifactorial, with both direct (toxic) and indirect (immobility/disuse atrophy) causes being implicated.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Limiting the period of immobility and promoting movement and exercise are therefore intuitively attractive strategies to prevent muscle weakness and enhance recovery.</p><p>The concept of early mobilisation has developed in parallel with a better appreciation of the need to avoid over sedation, the importance of delirium and the value of spontaneous breathing trials.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> However, there are few randomised controlled trials of interventions delivered in the intensive care unit (ICU) on which to base clinical practice. In 2009, a landmark trial by Schweickert and colleagues found that early physical and occupational therapy in mechanically ventilated patients in the medical ICU was safe and well tolerated, and resulted in better functional outcomes at hospital discharge, a shorter duration of delirium and more ventilator-free days compared with standard care.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A recent multicentre trial in the surgical ICU also found that early, goal-directed mobilisation shortened patient length of stay and improved patients&#x02019; functional mobility at hospital discharge.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>However, longer-term benefits have not yet been established<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> and systematic reviews have identified a need for large randomised controlled trials to further explore early mobilisation therapy, including longer-term outcomes and the ideal intensity and timing of exercise.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Our hypothesis was that patients would report a sustained benefit in their physical health if they received more intensive physical rehabilitation in ICU compared with patients who received physical rehabilitation typical of that provided at the time. In an attempt to test this hypothesis, we undertook a randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of two different intensities of early rehabilitation therapy&#x02014;intensive versus standard&#x02014;on the recovery of physical health-related quality of life at 6&#x02009;months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a randomised, parallel group, allocation-concealed, assessor-blinded, controlled trial in mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in the UK. The trial had ethical approval from Newcastle and North Tyneside 2 Research Ethics Committee (11/NE/0206) and was registered (ISRCTN: 20436833). A full trial protocol has been published.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they were aged 18 years or older and had received 48&#x02009;hours or more of either invasive or non-invasive ventilation. The original (and registered) version of the protocol listed 48&#x02013;72&#x02009;hours but the upper limit was removed 2&#x02009;months into recruitment as the time window proved too narrow and eligible patients were being missed, especially at weekends. The exclusion criteria were as follows: end-of-life care; acute brain or spinal cord injury (or admitted following brain or spinal cord surgery); multiple trauma if mobilisation therapy was judged unlikely to be possible; burns; rapidly progressive neuromuscular disease; patients enrolled in another clinical trial without a co-enrolment agreement in place; and patients previously enrolled in this trial. Patients who had suffered a cardiac arrest could be recruited if the clinical team believed that there was a possibility of recovery. Patients were approached and written informed consent was obtained either from the patient or from a personal consultee, which was usually the next of kin.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Participants were randomised, using a web-based randomisation system, in a 1:1 ratio, using permuted random block allocation to either intervention or standard care group. Randomisation was stratified by admitting ICU, type of admission (surgical or medical) and the participant&#x02019;s prehospitalisation independence level using the Katz Index of independence in activities of daily living (0&#x02013;3 was &#x02018;low&#x02019;, 4&#x02013;6 was &#x02018;high&#x02019;). Owing to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to mask the participants, research physiotherapists or the wider clinical team to the treatment group. Study outcomes at ICU discharge were assessed by the research physiotherapists (unblinded). Study outcomes at hospital discharge and at 3 and 6-month follow-up were assessed by research nurses who were blinded to the treatment group. To avoid accidental unblinding, the research nurses would ask the participants not to reveal their treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Procedures</title><p>All physical rehabilitation sessions were preceded by a sedation hold (or titration) with a target Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of &#x02212;1, 0 or&#x000a0;+1&#x02009;and a safety screen.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The physical rehabilitation therapy provided in the study included functional training and individually tailored exercise programmes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> All physical rehabilitation therapy was provided by experienced critical care physiotherapists. The intervention group had a target delivery of 90&#x02009;min of physical rehabilitation per day (Monday to Friday), split between at least two sessions. The standard care group had a target of 30&#x02009;min of physical rehabilitation per day (Monday to Friday). Days when physical rehabilitation was able to be delivered were termed &#x02018;treatment days&#x02019;. The session was stopped immediately if the participant met any of the stopping criteria; otherwise, the session continued until either the target time was reached or the treating physiotherapist judged it appropriate to stop. The physical rehabilitation therapy received by the standard care group was the same as that provided normally in participating ICUs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Respiratory physiotherapy was given as standard in both groups.</p><p>The treating physiotherapists collected data on the time participants were actively engaging with physical rehabilitation and the type of exercise/mobilisation completed; these times do not include the time required for session set-up and preparation, rest and recovery between exercises or passive range of movements. They also recorded the maximum strength demonstrated in both upper and lower limbs and/or the maximum mobility level reached during each session. Limb strength was measured using the Oxford Scale. The mobility levels achieved were defined as follows: (1) unable to sit supported; (2) able to sit supported; (3) able to sit out in a chair safely; (4) able to stand to transfer with support; (5) able to mobilise independently.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>Following discharge from ICU, both groups received routine ward-based physiotherapy and an exercise diary to continue independently on discharge from hospital. Any participant readmitted to ICU received standard physical rehabilitation during their first and&#x000a0;any subsequent readmissions. Participants were followed until hospital discharge and invited to attend a follow-up at their hospital 3 and 6&#x02009;months after randomisation. Follow-up questionnaires could be completed by telephone if participants were unable to attend in person.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the Physical Component Summary (PCS) measure of the 36 item Short Form survey&#x000a0;(SF-36) (version 2) Quality of Life questionnaire at 6&#x02009;months.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Secondary outcomes were as follows: the Mental Health Component Summary (MCS) measure of the SF-36; physical ability at ICU discharge (Modified Rivermead Mobility Index)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>; length of ICU and hospital stay; exercise capacity (6&#x02009;min walk test)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; functional status (Functional Independence Measure)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; hand grip strength; and survival status and place of residence at 3 and 6&#x02009;months following randomisation.

Allowing for a mortality rate of 40% and a further 10% loss to follow-up required 154 in each group (308 participants in total). We used univariate analysis to calculate basic summary statistics and multiple linear regression to adjust for the effects of covariates, including stratification variables. Kaplan-Meier and the log-rank test were used to compare survival between the groups at ICU and hospital discharge as well as at 3 and 6&#x02009;months. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute unadjusted and adjusted HRs for overall survival. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

At 6&#x02009;months, 62 (41%) participants in the intervention group and 54 (34%) participants in the standard care group contributed primary outcome data, a total of 116 of the 154 (75%) expected from the original sample size calculation. In the intervention group, 43 (29%) had died, 11 (7%) had withdrawn and 34 (23%) were lost to follow-up, while in the standard care group, 56 (35%) had died, 5 (3%) had withdrawn and 43 (27%) were lost to follow-up. Including participants who had withdrawn from the study in the denominator, primary outcome data were collected for 62 of 107 (58%) participants alive at 6&#x02009;months in the intervention group, and 54 of 102 (53%) participants alive at 6&#x02009;months in the standard care group.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2016-209858f01"/></fig><p>The study groups had similar baseline characteristics (t<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">able 2</xref>) although the proportion of males in the intensive group (54%) was lower than in the standard care group (63%). The majority of participants in both groups were admitted to ICU as an emergency rather than as planned postoperative admissions. Participants in both groups were divided equally between medical and surgical admissions, and had similar severity of illness scores. Prehospitalisation independence levels were high, with 135 (93%) of the intensive group and 144 (93%) of the standard care group being functionally independent (Katz Index 6) at baseline. Before randomisation, participants in the intervention group had been on ICU for a median (IQR) of 6 (4&#x02013;9) days compared with 5 (4&#x02013;8) in the standard care group. Participants in both groups had been ventilated for a similar number of days before randomisation (median 4 days in both groups).</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Characteristics of study participants at baseline</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intensive&#x000a0;

At a participant level, the median (IQR) number of days from enrolment to the first day when physical rehabilitation was received (excluding passive range of movement exercises) was 3 (1&#x02013;6) days in both groups. In total, the intervention group received a median (IQR) of 161 (67&#x02013;273) min of physical rehabilitation on ICU compared with 86 (31&#x02013;139) min in the standard care group. The majority of the extra time was given to strengthening exercises over functional retraining. Physical rehabilitation was delivered on 57% of study days in the intervention group and 40% of study days in the standard care group. Study days were defined as the number of calendar days between the date of enrolment and the date a participant was recorded as being ready for ICU discharge (if unavailable, the actual date of ICU discharge was used) and therefore include weekends, when no physical rehabilitation service was provided. On days when physical rehabilitation was able to be delivered (&#x02018;treatment days&#x02019;), the intervention group received a median (IQR) of 23 (16&#x02013;28) min of physical rehabilitation per day compared with 13 (10&#x02013;17) min per day in the standard care group. The distribution of physical rehabilitation time delivered on treatment days differed between two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). The majority of treatment days in the standard care group included less than the target of 30&#x02009;min physical rehabilitation, with 82% of treatment days including 20&#x02009;min or less. In the intervention group, which had a target delivery of up to 90&#x02009;min per day, the time delivered was more variable but only 8% of treatment days included greater than 45&#x02009;min of physical rehabilitation.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Physical rehabilitation time delivered per treatment day.

Secondary outcomes were also similar between groups across all follow-up time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">table 3</xref> and online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S1</xref>). Only one secondary outcome, the Functional Independence Measure at 3&#x02009;months, was significantly different between groups, although this should be interpreted with caution given the multiple tests. With regard to the loss to follow-up, there did not appear to be any differences in baseline characteristics between participants who were and those&#x000a0;were not able to complete the primary outcome measure (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S2)</xref>. We undertook a post hoc analysis using multiple imputation for the primary outcome measure but the results were the same (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S3</xref>). There was no significant difference in overall survival between groups at any time in the 6-month follow-up period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6</xref>). This analysis was robust to adjusted and unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. By 6&#x02009;months, most participants had been discharged home, although seven in each group remained in hospital.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-209858.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><p>

We found no difference in either the primary outcome of self-reported physical health at 6&#x02009;months or the secondary outcomes, including measures of functional ability and independence, length of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality at 6&#x02009;months. Our results are similar to those of the two other randomised trials that included long-term assessments of physical function.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 23</xref>
</p><p>This study has three main limitations. First, the absolute difference in the amount of physical rehabilitation received by participants in each arm of the trial was smaller than anticipated and possibly insufficient to produce a measurable difference in outcome.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This was due to both the amount of physical rehabilitation received in the standard care group and factors that prevented more rehabilitation being delivered in the intensive group&#x02014;the two principal reasons being a difficulty in achieving optimum levels of sedation (to allow rehabilitation to proceed safely) and participant fatigue. Most rehabilitation sessions ended due to participant fatigue, either at patient request or at the decision of the physiotherapist. Staff availability was not a major factor in understanding why the intervention was not delivered as intended as physiotherapists were available Monday to Friday. Second, we underestimated the difficulty in following up survivors of critical illness beyond discharge from hospital; only 116 of a planned 154 participants (75%) were able to contribute primary outcome data at 6&#x02009;months. This proportion of loss to follow-up reduces the precision of the results and could introduce bias, although the baseline characteristics of those who did and did not complete the SF-36 questionnaire at 6&#x02009;months were similar. There is also a variable amount of missing data for the secondary outcomes as those completing follow-up by telephone were unable to complete the 6&#x02009;min walk test and grip strength assessment. Third, it was not possible to blind participants, physiotherapists or other clinical staff to the intervention, which could have introduced bias.</p><p>This study also has several strengths. Compared with the existing literature it is relatively large; to our knowledge only the recent, single-centre trial by Morris and colleagues is of a similar size.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although the absolute difference between groups was smaller than anticipated, the intervention group did receive a more intensive physical rehabilitation regime than the standard care group. Despite the loss to follow-up, the majority of participants underwent comprehensive assessments at ICU discharge, and we collected complete data for ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality to 6&#x02009;months. Finally, the research staff undertaking assessments at, and after, hospital discharge were blinded to the study group.</p><p>It is useful to compare our findings with those of the other published trials. An important study by Denehy <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was unable to show an improvement in outcome at 6&#x02009;months, probably because the usual care group received a high level of physical mobilisation therapy.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Participants in our standard care group received physical rehabilitation on 40% of study days, with 70% of rehabilitation sessions including active exercises, a greater intensity of physical rehabilitation than the &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; recorded in other countries.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> On the other hand, participants in the intervention group received physical rehabilitation on 57% of study days an identical percentage to that reported in the intervention group by Morris <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> but less than that reported by others.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 28</xref> Although physical rehabilitation times are not widely reported in other trials, the intervention group received a median (IQR) of 23 (16&#x02013;28) min which is broadly comparable to the mean (SD) &#x02018;session times&#x02019; of 31 (7) min in the study by Moss <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and the median (IQR) 20 (0&#x02013;41)&#x02009;min of &#x02018;active exercises&#x02019; received in a pilot study by Hodgson <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The proportion of patients lost to follow-up at 6&#x02009;months is similar to that reported by Moss <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> at the same time point and also by Schaller <italic>et al</italic> at 3 months.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Other trials, however, have achieved much better rates of follow-up to 6&#x02009;months.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 28 29</xref> Finally, a large proportion of screened patients were ineligible for the trial, most commonly because they had not received 48&#x02009;hours or more of either invasive or non-invasive ventilation, although other exclusion criteria applied. Because of the size of our trial, we chose eligibility criteria aiming to include patients at high risk of physical impairment following discharge from ICU while excluding those who would be unlikely to benefit from the intervention. The result was a trial population which represented a relatively small subset of critically ill patients. The proportion of exclusions in other rehabilitation trials varies but the trial by Morris <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> also reported a high proportion of exclusions with 4804 patients screened for 300 patients randomised.</p><p>There are five other possible explanations for why our results did not support our hypothesis.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The patient population&#x02014;which was heterogeneous, older, with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation&#x02014;may have been predicted to have the worst levels of disability after critical illness and, on the whole, have been unresponsive to the intervention.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The primary outcome measure, which showed wide variation within groups, was flat for the first 3&#x02009;months and increased slowly in both groups by 6&#x02009;months. A very similar recovery trajectory was seen in a cohort study of patients recovering from severe acute pancreatitis<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and in the RECOVER trial.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In contrast, the recovery trajectory in a large cohort study of younger survivors with acute respiratory distress syndrome&#x000a0;(ARDS) was more rapid, with an early improvement in the same PCS outcome measure.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is possible that the intervention was not started early enough and that muscle weakness was already well established.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The median (IQR) duration of ventilation at randomisation was 4 (3&#x02013;7) days with a further 3 (1&#x02013;6) days until the first physical rehabilitation was received, excluding passive range of movements. In our experience, these delays occurred for a number of reasons: we did not have the resources to recruit patients at weekends; the eligibility criteria required patients to received 48&#x02009;hours or more of either invasive or non-invasive ventilation before randomisation, although we usually approached surrogate decision makers before this; and in patients who were recruited, many were too unstable to achieve the required level of sedation and pass the safety screen to begin physical rehabilitation. This timescale from ICU admission, to enrolment, to active rehabilitation is comparable to some studies,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9 23 25</xref> although other investigators have succeeded in delivering much earlier rehabilitation therapy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7 28</xref> The results from previous studies are not consistent but it would appear that the trials which have managed to deliver very early mobilisation have found improved outcomes up to hospital discharge,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> while trials which intervened later have found no significant effect. The exceptions to this observation are the trial by Burtin <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> which recruited patients from their fifth day in ICU and found improved physical outcomes at hospital discharge and the trial by Morris <italic>et al</italic>

</p><p>Further improvements in physical rehabilitation will require a better understanding of the different phenotypes of critical illness and their varying recovery trajectories. Rehabilitation may then be better tailored to the individual, with perhaps the most intensive therapy aimed at younger patients, with less comorbidity, who have seen the biggest loss in function compared with baseline. New technology may enable patients to tolerate more physical rehabilitation in a way that fits flexibly with their other needs. Future work is needed to explore the barriers and facilitators to patients attending follow-up appointments, as well as ongoing work to determine the best outcome measures for rehabilitation trials.</p><p>In conclusion, this study set out to test whether an increased intensity of physical rehabilitation above that already delivered as standard in our region could lead to improved long-term patient outcomes. We were not assessing some physical rehabilitation versus no physical rehabilitation but rather &#x02018;intensive&#x02019; versus &#x02018;usual care&#x02019;, both of which included care delivered by specialist critical care physiotherapists 5 days a week. It proved more difficult than expected to increase the intensity of rehabilitation above this baseline, due to participant fatigue and the inability to provide rehabilitation at weekends; this may have limited the impact of the intervention. The loss to follow-up at 6&#x02009;months may have introduced bias and limits the confidence in our findings. In this context, ICU-based physical rehabilitation did not appear to improve physical outcomes at 6&#x02009;months compared with standard physical rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would also like to thank Mark Deverill for his contribution to the health economic section of the original grant application, Joanne O&#x02019;Connor for her help with the health economic analysis, Peter Clayton for Excel consultancy and the Trial Oversight Committee for their support.
