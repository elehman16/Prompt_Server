These newer techniques represent the advent of essentially scarless, more pain-free, better cosmesis and early return of function for the patient.</p><p>SILS or Single &#x02014; Port-Access [SPA] proposes to offer an even better cosmesis since it leaves no visible scar as it is hidden in the umbilicus. However, the technique is more demanding as dissection becomes more difficult due to clashing of instruments, loss of normal triangulation, restricted vision and depth of dissection. Special large port, angulated instruments and scopes are needed for better dissection. All these factors lead to a steeper learning curve and increase the risk of wound-related complications including hernia formation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In two-port mini LC/four-port LC, compared to SILS, surgery becomes much easier due to restoration of triangulation, learning curve becomes shorter, causes minimal violation of anterior abdomen leading to lesser post-operative pain and cosmesis is comparable.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] With the newer techniques, the need for more sophisticated instruments escalates the cost of surgery and limits the use of these minimally invasive techniques to a few centres. Two-port mini LC scores over the conventional techniques as it requires minimal new instruments and can be performed at all laparoscopic centres without any new cost inputs, and simultaneously achieve the goal of minimal access surgery.</p><p>The present study was carried out as very limited data was available for evaluating the feasibility of this technique in LC compared to the conventional laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was carried out over a period of 18 months in a single surgical unit at a teaching hospital in New Delhi. All patients with gallbladder stones attending the surgical OPD were evaluated. All symptomatic patients with BMI &#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , ASA Grade I/II, Age &#x0003e;12 yrs were included in the study. Patients with BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , previous major abdominal surgeries, ASA Grade III/IV, refused consent, features of acute cholecystitis, choledocolithiasis, pancreatitis and malignancy on clinical and USG examination were excluded from the study.</p><p>Evaluation of patients included a detailed history, a thorough physical examination and investigations which included a complete haemogram, kidney function test (KFT): Blood urea, serum creatinine, liver function test (LFT) &#x02014; serum bilirubin, ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, serum proteins &#x02014; albumin, globulin, serum electrolytes, Na+/K+ and random blood sugar (RBS). A USG abdomen was done to confirm the gallbladder calculi, measure its wall thickness, common bile duct (CBD) diameter and stones and features of acute inflammation or malignancy.</p><p>An informed written and verbal consent explaining that he/she has understood the procedure was obtained at least one day prior to surgery. It was a double-blinded randomised study, and patients were assigned to a particular group based on closed envelop randomisation method just before the beginning of surgery. Patients were divided into two groups; <italic>Group A</italic> &#x02014; patients undergoing standard four-port LC; and <italic>Group B</italic> &#x02014; patients undergoing two-port mini LC.</p><p>The surgery was performed by a team of two surgeons with adequate experience in a single surgical unit.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Operative Technique</title><p>Pneumoperitoneum was created using CO<sub>2</sub> gas by placing a Veress needle followed by placement of a transumbilical/subumbilical/supraumbilical 10-mm port with abdominal pressure maintained at 12 mm Hg. A zero degree 10-mm laparoscope was passed and the operative difficulty was assessed based on the degree of inflammation, adhesions, condition of gall bladder wall, presence of fistula formation with neighbouring organs/structures (duodenum, CBD, colon, stomach, etc).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Four-Port LC</title><p>The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and tilted to the left and surgery proceeded as standard procedure. A 10-mm trocar was placed in the epigastrium to the right of the falciform ligament with two additional 5-mm ports in the right upper abdomen two finger breadths below the costal margin in midclavicular line and anterior/midaxillary line at the level or just below the umbilicus. Dissection of the gallbladder was performed by the standard technique by first grasping and lifting the fundus, followed by dissection of the cystic duct and artery. Once the &#x02018;critical view&#x02019; of these structures was obtained, these were clipped and divided. The gallbladder was removed from its bed using electrocautery and retrieved through the epigastric port.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Two-Port Mini LC</title><p>Following the placement of umbilical port, instead of a 10-mm, a 5-mm epigastric port was placed. Two special 2.3-mm alligator graspers (Stryker Corporation, USA) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] were used transabdominally for grasping the fundus [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] and Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder for its retraction and manipulation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>], respectively. Using the standard Maryland laparoscopic instrument, the cystic duct and artery were dissected as in the four-port technique [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. For clipping the cystic duct and artery, a 5-mm clip applicator was used with 200-mm clips. In case of wider cystic duct, single-hand suturing of the duct was done with 2/0 silk. Alternatively, the position and size of the scope was changed to a 5-mm 30&#x000b0; scope through the epigastric port and clips (300/400 mm) were applied through the 10-mm umbilical port. The structures were divided and dissection proceeded by reversing the laparoscope and dissecting instruments to their original sites. Gallbladder specimen was retrieved through the umbilical port by rail-road technique or using 5-mm 30&#x000b0; scope through the epigastric port and 10-mm jaw forceps from the umbilical port.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Needlescopic grasper used in &#x02018;two-port&#x02019; laparoscopic cholecystectomy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMAS-10-190-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>First grasper to retract fundus</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMAS-10-190-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Second grasper at the neck of gallbladder</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMAS-10-190-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Cystic duct dissection and division</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMAS-10-190-g004"/></fig><p>The ports were closed in layers &#x02014; sheath with 2/0 vicryl and skin with 3/0 nylon in both procedures.</p><p>At completion, 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was left in the gallbladder fossa and the port site was infiltrated with 1 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine as local anesthetic.

In fact, post-operative pain is the limiting factor for the delay in discharge in day-care cholecystectomies. The idea of scarless surgeries has led to increased acceptance of the procedures among patients. Reduced port surgeries may seem more costly procedures but by achieving higher bed-patient ratio, reduced parental analgesia and with one less assistant they may indeed be cost-effective on a long-term basis. Two-port mini LC using conventional instruments can afford the benefits of reduced port surgeries without cost escalation.</p><p>The main advantage of two-port mini LC as described in the present study is the ease of performing the technique, and principles of surgery remain similar to the conventional four-port LC. Compared to this, other reduced port surgeries such as NOTES[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and SILS[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are technically more demanding as dissection becomes more difficult due to clashing of instruments, loss of normal triangulation, restricted vision and depth of dissection. Special large port, angulated instruments and scopes are needed for better dissection. All these factors lead to a steeper learning curve, and hence, operating time.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The port sizes in our study were 10 + 5 + 2.3 + 2.3. Various port sizes have been used by other researchers, which might require more sophisticated instruments [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. There is no standard size of the ports, and we chose the above size simply to use the normal four port LC instruments.</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of various variables in two-port surgeries</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMAS-10-190-g011"/></table-wrap><p>In the present study, the use of two ports and graspers did not increase the operative difficulty as the mean duration of the procedures was similar in both groups. Operative time varies with different studies as few require less and few more than the conventional technique.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The operative difficulty based on the status of gallbladder, adhesions around the gallbladder fossa and elsewhere in the abdomen, Calot's triangle and cystic duct anatomy was similar in both groups in our study.</p><p>The incidence of intra-operative and post-operative complications was similar in comparison to other studies; however, it is not reported by any other study. The present study had a single incident of CBD injury in the two port mini LC. It would be difficult to attribute the same to the use of two ports, as it was the only case which happened in the entire study group. Besides this, no other major intra-operative complication was noted in the entire study group. The conversion rates from two port mini LC to four port LC and open cholecystectomy in many studies are in the range of 23% to 38%.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The conversion rates from two port mini LC in our study were less than the other studies. The main reasons in our study for conversions were difficult anatomy due to dense inflammation from cholecystitis and one CBD injury. Instrument failure was seen in few early studies, and we had no episode of instrument failure. A planned two-port surgery must be given up in the event of such difficult anatomy on initial diagnostic exploration or hindrance to proceed further during the course of the dissection.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A conversion can be with additional ports or with open cholecystectomy.</p><p>Reduced pain due to reduced number and sizes of the ports has been established by researchers such as Cheah <italic>et al</italic>. and Bisgaard <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] By omitting two 5-mm ports resulted in decreased post-operative pain in the first 24 hours. This has been observed by many other studies, which have also shown reduced pain in reduced port surgery compared to conventional four-port LC. The post-operative pain was assessed by VAS, which is the same method used in other studies. The pain was recorded during the patient's stay at hospital. The post-operative pain in our series was significantly lower in the first 24 hrs only, and not later. However, a large cohort of the study was discharged by 24 hrs (Group A 89.5%, Group B 92.7%). This was further supported by less requirement of analgesia and the early return to their activities in the two port mini LC in contrast to the four port LC.</p><p>The mean length of hospital stay was same in both groups. This was in agreement with other studies[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. Even though we did not perform these procedures as outpatient procedures but with well defined, well set protocols, in our view, these can be performed as day-care procedures.</p><p>Cosmesis has been one of the reasons for easy acceptance of laparoscopic surgery among the patient population. Smaller and lesser incisions have led to minimal scarring and improved cosmesis.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] But non-existence of a uniform scale to evaluate cosmesis severely hampers direct comparison between various studies. We used a scale of 0-10 to assess cosmesis as done in most studies, with 0 being worst and 10 being the best. In our study, we had a nurse blinded to procedures and the patient's own score which minimised bias. The final score was arrived at by calculating the mean of the two scores. In our study, the cosmetic score was significantly better in two port mini LC, which is similar to other studies where cosmetic benefit was studied.</p><p>In our conclusion, LC can be performed with two-port technique using 10-mm umbilical, 5-mm epigastric and two 2.3-mm graspers in properly selected cases and optimise the benefits of minimal access surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
