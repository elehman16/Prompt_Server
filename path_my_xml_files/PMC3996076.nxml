Both are associated with vulnerability to loss of mentalization (awareness of one&#x02019;s own and others&#x02019; emotional state). In BPD, Mentalization Based therapy (MBT) has been found effective in reducing symptoms. In this trial we investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MBT adapted for Eating disorders (Mentalization Based Therapy for Eating Disorders (MBT-ED)) compared to a standard comparison treatment, Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM-ED) in patients with a combination of an Eating Disorder and either a diagnosis of BPD or a history of self-harm and impulsivity in the previous 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We will complete a multi-site single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) of MBT-ED vs SSCM-ED. Participants will be recruited from three Eating Disorder Services and two Borderline Personality Disorder Services in London. Participants allocated to MBT-ED will receive one year of weekly group and individual therapy and participants allocated to SSCM-ED will receive 20 sessions of individual therapy over 1&#x000a0;year. In addition, participants in both groups will have access to up to 5&#x000a0;hours of dietetic advice. The primary outcome measure is the global score on the Eating Disorders Examination. Secondary outcome measures include total score on the Zanarini BPD scale, the Object Relations Inventory, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Measures are taken at recruitment and at 6&#x000a0;month intervals up to 18&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first Randomised Controlled Trial of MBT-ED in patients with eating disorders and symptoms of BPD and will provide evidence to inform therapy decisions in this group of patients. During MBT-ED mentalization is encouraged, while in SSCM-ED it is not overtly addressed. This study will help elucidate mechanisms of change in the two therapies and analysis of therapy and interview transcripts will provide qualitative information about the conduct of therapy and changes in mentalization and object relations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN51304415">ISRCTN51304415</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Borderline</kwd><kwd>Anorexia</kwd><kwd>Bulimia</kwd><kwd>Mentalization</kwd><kwd>Self-harm</kwd><kwd>Psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>Attachment</kwd><kwd>Personality</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd><kwd>Eating</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Patients with eating disorders (ED) combined with symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) present particular therapeutic challenges. Symptoms include weight loss, bulimia, self harm, emotional lability and impulsive behaviours. During treatment, while some symptoms may improve, others can worsen. Therefore treatment needs to address both the eating and personality disorders, and individuals with both conditions are more likely than those with eating disorders alone to have a complicated course with atypical disorders and migration from one disorder to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Borderline Personality Disorder has been shown to respond to Mentalization Based Therapy (MBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] which targets vulnerability to loss of self-reflectiveness (mentalizing) which is thought to occur in both BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and Eating Disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This project will test whether MBT is an effective treatment for this troubled group of patients.</p><p>Eating disorders are among the most common causes of ill health in young people, affecting some 3-4% of women and 0.3% of men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The morbidity associated with eating disorders is of several types. Low weight, electrolyte imbalance and nutrient deficiency leads to serious physical problems which can be fatal if extreme. Other problems include depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], social isolation, family, relationship and occupational difficulties and a substantially reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. BPD has a prevalence of 0.7% but a roughly equal sex distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It has a broad impact on psychological, family and social functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Symptoms include mood fluctuations, including depression, outbursts of anger, deliberate self harm, suicidal behaviour and disturbed relationships.</p><p>The two sets of conditions occur together more commonly than would be expected. The combination of Eating and Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms was noted by Lacey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] who found that 80% of a series of patients with bulimia nervosa engaged in at least three self damaging behaviours and coined the term &#x0201c;Multi-impulsive bulimia&#x0201d;. The proposed trial will study this group, although the criteria and the name given, (ED with symptoms of BPD), differ. Lacey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Zeeck et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] pointed out their very severe morbidity and the difficulties in treatment they present. The direct and indirect costs of these problems have not been reported, although the costs of ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] are both high. Moreover, there is some evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that engagement in treatment of patients suffering from both disorders is poor.</p><p>It has been shown that nearly 30% of ED patients meet criteria for any personality disorder, while 6.2% have BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the present study, patients with ED complicated by some of the most damaging BPD symptoms, namely suicidal behaviour, deliberate self harm and impulsive behaviours (although not always fulfilling all BPD criteria) will be included. A review of recent patients treated at the Eating Disorders Unit at the main study site, St Ann&#x02019;s Hospital, suggested that some 20% of patients seen fulfilled study criteria. Treatment of eating disorders has a limited evidence base: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder is the only treatment for which NICE has cited class A Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For Borderline Personality Disorder, Mentalization Based Therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] have shown benefit in RCTs. NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] calls for more Randomised Trials to evaluate all these and other therapies. For patients with both ED and BPD, DBT has shown promise in small pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. MBT has a theoretical basis in attachment theory and deficits in primary attachments have been shown in both Eating Disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Borderline Personality Disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Sk&#x000e5;rderud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] has argued for the importance of impaired mentalization and the relevance of MBT in in anorexia nervosa. MBT therefore has a theoretical basis which may have significance for the aetiology as well as the treatment of ED/BPD. We have therefore used MBT in the current trial, adapted for participants with Eating Disorders and the modified therapy is called MBT-ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM) was developed as a control therapy in trials of treatment for anorexia nervosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We chose it as a control treatment because it is a manualized treatment that approximates to treatment as usual for eating disorders. In the current trial patients can have any eating disorder diagnosis, and so the Therapy manual for SSCM was adapted for use with any eating disorder and the modified therapy called SSCM-ED. Except for the paragraph headed &#x0201c;Control condition&#x0201d; below, we have used the terms MBT and SSCM in this paper to indicate the modified therapies used in the study.</p><p>The intended participants in this trial suffer from complex problems which can adversely influence clinical care. We therefore embarked on a randomized controlled trial of Mentalization Based Therapy against Specialist Supportive Clinical Management in patients with a diagnosis of an eating disorder and either BPD or symptoms of BPD and here present the protocol for that study.</p><sec><title>Objectives of the trial</title><sec><title>Primary objective</title><p>To ascertain whether Mentalization Based Therapy is clinically effective at reducing observer rated symptoms of Eating Disorder, using an accepted measure, the Eating Disorders Examination, in patients with combined eating and borderline personality disorder symptoms up to 18&#x000a0;months post randomisation compared to Specialist Supportive Clinical Management.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>1.

Participants may be underweight, normal weight or overweight, although because of the increased risk of physical decompensation those severely malnourished (with a BMI of under 15) are excluded. We will therefore be assessing the effectiveness of MBT in patients with different eating and weight problems. In addition to their eating disorder, we anticipate that most participants will have current self harm and impulsive behaviours and a sub-group will fulfill all criteria for BPD. In addition, a group of participants will fulfill criteria for BPD without necessarily experiencing self harm or impulsivity.</p><p>The initial introduction to the study will come from the treating clinician. If interested in obtaining more information, the clinician will provide the Participant Information Sheets and Carer Information Sheets. At least 24&#x000a0;hours later, the potential participant will be approached by a member of the research team and if still interested, an interview time arranged. At that meeting the study will be described, outstanding questions answered and the potential participant asked to sign the consent form which will be countersigned by the member of the research team.</p><p>The participant will then receive the following interviews:</p><p>Eating Disorders Examination (EDE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]</p><p>Reflective Function Questionnaire (RFQ)<sup>a</sup></p><p>Reading the mind in the eyes test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Object Relations Inventory (ORI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Acts of Deliberate Self Harm Inventory (ADSHI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>MINI International Neuropsychiatric Schedule (MINI), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Zanarini-BPD (ZAN-BPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Euroqol (EQ5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales -21 (DASS 21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Modified Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Adult Service Use Schedule (AD-SUS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Big Five personality Inventory (BFI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Apart from the MINI and the SCID II which are only administered at baseline for diagnostic purposes, all instruments will be repeated at 6, 12 and 18&#x000a0;months post randomization.</p><p>The original signed consent form will be retained in the Investigator Site File, with a copy in the participants&#x02019; hospital medical notes, and a copy retained by the participant for their information.

Trial Management Committee (TSC): This will manage the day to day running of the trial and comprise the Chief Investigator, the Trial Manager and relevant members of the research team, as appropriate. It will meet weekly.</p><p>2. Independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC): This will have an open and a closed session at each meeting. The chair will be an independent academic and members will include an independent Eating Disorders expert and an Independent general Academic Psychiatry expert. The Chief Investigator and the Trial Statistician, who will provide reports, the Trial Manager and the Trial Statistician will be in attendance. Of the latter, only the Trial Statistician will attend the closed part of the meeting. In the closed part, summaries of follow-up assessments and adverse events, will be available for each of the treatment groups (labelled a and b). iDMC meetings will be held annually, or more often if required and the chair will advise the Trial Steering Committee of their recommendations regarding continuation, stopping early or modifications to the protocol.</p><p>3. Trial Steering Committee (TSC): The TSC will be chaired by an independent expert and members will include experts in Eating Disorders and General Psychiatry (different from those in the iDMC) as well as user and carer representatives, a lead trust representative and the Chief Investigator, who will provide a report, the Trial Manager and the Trial Statistician. Meetings will be annual, or more frequently should the need arise.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation, allocation concealment and protection against bias</title><p>Due to the nature of the intervention blinding of participants and therapists will not be possible. However the Trial Statistician and Research Workers responsible for the collection of the assessments will remain blind to treatment allocation during the trial and primary analyses. Participants will be asked to be careful not to divulge what sort of therapy they have had, or other information that could interfere with the Research Worker&#x02019;s blindness to treatment group.</p><p>Following completion of the baseline questionnaire, patients who consent to take part in the trial are randomly allocated to MBT or SSCM (ratio 1:1) by sites via an online system based at the King&#x02019;s Clinical Trials Unit based at the Institute of Psychiatry in London. The method of randomisation of participants will be by block randomisation stratified by BMI (15.0-18.5, 18.6-24.9, &#x0003e;25) and service type (eating disorders unit or personality disorders unit). Randomly varying block sizes will be implemented in order to maintain pre-randomisation allocation concealment.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety monitoring</title><p>Safety will be monitored in several ways.</p><p>1. Physical safety: Clinical features that influence safety such as weight, muscle strength, serum potassium and electrocardiograph will be identified at initial assessment. Monitoring will be done at intervals recommended by the Centre Clinical Lead. If changes occur, they will be discussed in supervision and if appropriate, with a Clinical Centre doctor. Monitoring will be done at the Clinical Centre, or by the GP. If the latter, agreement in advance will be obtained from the GP to do the monitoring tests. The therapist will be responsible for making sure that safety monitoring is carried out and results obtained and interpreted by an appropriate professional, generally a doctor. Significant results will be communicated to the GP.</p><p>2. Self harm and suicide: If a participant discloses thoughts of self harm or suicide during a therapy session, these will be explored in the session. Following the session the findings will be discussed with a supervisor, a doctor, or senior clinical staff at the Clinical Centre and appropriate action decided upon. This could include a session shortly after the current session, either with the therapist or another staff member, a referral for urgent psychiatric assessment or a referral for crisis management.</p><p>3. Safety outside clinic hours: Clinic Centre staff will be available during office hours, 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday. Outside these hours participants who are concerned about their safety for any reason will be asked to contact their GPs or, if urgent, to attend Accident and Emergency, calling an ambulance if necessary.</p><p>4. Management of crises: Urges to self harm, actual self harm or suicidal intent: During office hours patients will call their therapy centre and speak to a staff member. If necessary the patient will be seen as soon as possible by a staff member. When the patient is seen, support will be given, necessary medical treatment arranged in consultation with a physician and a risk assessment made to inform a decision on referral on to local crisis services for possible admission either to a psychiatric ward or a crisis facility if available. If admitted, the Therapist will maintain contact and the patient returned to the outpatient care of the therapy team as soon as possible as long as the level of risk is thought to be acceptable by the treating team consultant psychiatrist, the Centre Clinical Lead and the Therapist.</p><p>5. Physical symptoms: Weight loss, increasing abnormality of physical tests or any other worrying symptoms, will be discussed with the team physician and a management decision made. This might include increased frequency of monitoring, a physician review and consideration of increased dietetic advice, day hospital attendance or inpatient admission. The latter could be to a general hospital nutrition unit, a general adult psychiatry bed or an eating disorders bed.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>All participants will have an allocated psychiatrist, a key worker/therapist who will also provide individual therapy and a dietician who will provide up to 5&#x000a0;hours of advice over the duration of the trial the timing of which will be agreed between the participant and the therapist. From recruitment, Participants will receive treatment for 12&#x000a0;months (MBT group) or up to 12&#x000a0;months (SSCM group).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental condition: mentalization based therapy</title><p>This treatment is based on the Intensive Outpatient Therapy model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The Therapist will provide a weekly 50 minute individual MBT session. During therapy the Therapist will be responsible for making sure that physical measures are monitored (e.g. at the clinic, or by the GP), consulting with the clinic physician as required. Participants will also attend weekly group Mentalization Based Therapy for 90&#x000a0;minutes. Therapy will last for 12&#x000a0;months after which patients will be reassessed by a member of the trial clinical team and referred for further management if required. Each MBT group will have a maximum of 10 participants. Participants will be considered compliant of they attend at least 50% of individual and 50% of group sessions offered.</p><p>Other treatments: Families and carers will be offered attendance at existing support services as will control families, and attendance will be monitored. Should patients access treatment outside the trial, this will be monitored and specified at the 6 monthly interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Control condition <bold>-</bold> specialist supportive clinical management</title><p>SSCM was developed by McIntosh et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] as a standard treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) and has been used in several AN trials.

It has been modified in collaboration with Dr McIntosh to cover eating disorders in which underweight is not a feature. This extended form has been called SSCM-ED. SSCM has been found to be an effective intervention for anorexia nervosa. It is symptom focused and lacks attention to mentalization or relationships. Hence, it represents a comparison treatment that offers the control participants a proven treatment, which does not aim to alter the specific target symptoms which are addressed in MBT. SSCM offers 20 sessions that can vary in both length (30<bold>-</bold>60&#x000a0;minutes) and frequency (2 per week, to 1 per two weeks depending upon clinical need). At the end of the 20 sessions, therapists can offer a few more sessions if required (up to 6) before ending. Participants will be considered compliant if they attend at least 50% of sessions offered.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Therapy training, supervision and adherence</title><sec><title>Mentalization based therapy</title><p>Staff providing individual therapy will have a basic clinical training (e.g., Mental health nursing, psychology or social work, art therapy, medicine), will have undergone an introduction to MBT and and treated at least one patient using MBT under appropriate supervision for 6 months.

This calculation is based on the conservative assumption of a zero correlation between baseline and post treatment scores on the EDE and allows for clustering within therapy groups and 25% attrition. The effect size (1.07) was based on a minimal clinically important difference, at 18 months post randomization, of 1.5 on the EDE, with a pooled standard deviation of 1.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Patients with symptoms of both BPD and Eating Disorder are treated by separate services addressing nutrition, drug abuse, self-harm and mood and impulse control and other problems. In this study, Mentalization Based Therapy which has been found effective in patients with BPD alone, will form the core of the treatment which will be administered by a single team, with the help of emergency services as needed and all participants will receive dietetic counselling. If effective, the treatment would be relevant to the care of many seriously ill, often young people who utilize substantial health care resources across several health sectors and who are currently regarded as untreatable by some clinical staff. Because of the efficacy of Mentalization Based Therapy in BPD, services offering MBT have been developed in many parts of the UK, and the project could encourage collaboration between such services and eating disorder units so that individuals with both Eating Disorder and BPD symptoms can be offered effective treatment.</p><p>Currently a patient with a combination of an eating disorder such as bulimia nervosa and a BPD may be referred to an eating disorders unit, a general psychiatric team for management of self-harm and depression, a psychotherapy service, a substance misuse service for help with cocaine or [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] alcohol abuse and may also present to the GP, or A and E for emergency treatment of suicidal or self-harming behaviour such as a drug overdose or self-cutting. There is no established treatment for this group, although both specialized inpatient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and outpatient psychotherapy have been tried. If MBT-ED is found to be helpful, it could be provided wherever staff trained in outpatient delivery of the approach are available. Training for the treatment of BPD using Mentalization Based Therapy is already being provided on a fairly large scale, and the same could be achieved for the treatment of patients with both Eating Disorder and BPD using the newly developed MBT-ED. Existing training for MBT requires a short (3&#x000a0;day) course which, together with specialist MBT supervision allows staff to take on patients and to co-facilitate MBT groups in a clinical setting with usual NHS provision of resources. The patients are already being referred and seen by Mental Health Staff including nurses, psychologists and doctors, and these staff could be trained in the new approach and patients helped to avoid crisis care, including inpatient admissions. Existing staff time, which is currently not used effectively because of poor compliance and crises, would be redirected to a treatment approach that could lead to long term improvement and a reduced need for health care, currently provided in diverse and sometimes poorly co-ordinated services.</p><p>The Aetiologies of both Borderline Personality Disorder and Eating disorders are incompletely understood. It has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] that experiences in infancy interacting with genetic and developmental processes, can contribute to deficits in mentalization which are found in these conditions, raising the possibility that there may be a contribution to their aetiology which is located during the first decade of life. This study, by investigating mentalization and object relations in participants undergoing different forms of therapy may provide useful information which bears on these ideas.</p></sec><sec><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>a</sup>The Reflective Function Questionnaire.
