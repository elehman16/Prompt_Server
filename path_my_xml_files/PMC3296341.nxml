The concepts of <italic>Ayurveda</italic> are expressed with <italic>Gunas</italic>. <italic>Samanya</italic> and <italic>Visesa</italic> are usually expressed in terms of <italic>Gunas</italic>; the classification, description, and function of <italic>Dravyas</italic> depends upon <italic>Guna</italic>; <italic>Karmas</italic> are manifested forms of <italic>Guna</italic> and <italic>Samavaya</italic> is the eternal, intimate relation of <italic>Dravya</italic> and <italic>Guna</italic>.

One of the concepts is <italic>Guna</italic>, which has multifold meanings according to its use, in social, cultural, philosophical clinical, and literary fields.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>In <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, <italic>Gunas</italic> have been classified under various categories like <italic>Adhyatmika Guna, Gurvadi Guna, Paradi Guna, Visistha Guna</italic>, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] For the treatment purpose, <italic>Gurvadi Gunas</italic> are widely used. The <italic>Guna</italic> is related with <italic>Dravya</italic> in a <italic>Samavaya</italic> relationship. <italic>Guna</italic> exists till the <italic>Dravya</italic> keeps its existence. Similarly <italic>Dravya</italic> is also related to <italic>Guna</italic>. If the <italic>Dravya</italic> has no proper quality, it has no value.</p><p>The functional property of <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic> is <italic>Sneha, Mrduta</italic> (softness), and <italic>Ardrata</italic> (malleability).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] It stimulates <italic>Kapha</italic> and normalizes <italic>Vata</italic> and also increases <italic>Mala</italic>. Similarly, the functional property of <italic>Ruksa</italic> is dryness. The property of <italic>Ruksa Guna</italic> is to increase the properties of <italic>Vata</italic> and normalizes the properties of <italic>Kapha</italic> and also decreases <italic>Bala</italic>, <italic>Varna</italic> (normal color). In the general treatment, two principles are adopted, i.e., <italic>Santarpana</italic> and <italic>Apatarpana</italic>. The increased elements are treated by opposite <italic>Guna</italic>. So if <italic>Ruksa Guna</italic> is increased then it is to be managed by <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic> and vice-versa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] So diseases can be treated by applying the two <italic>Gunas</italic>, and drugs for the required patient can be selected by applying these <italic>Gunas</italic>.</p><p>In this study, the condition selected is <italic>Rasa-raktagata Sneha</italic> (hyperlipidemia) for the assessment of the selected two <italic>Gunas</italic>. Though the disease is not described in <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, but the <italic>Laksanas</italic> find a scattered description. Lipids or the fat molecules can be compared to <italic>Sneha Ansa</italic> of the body, which is essential for body existence. As <italic>Susruta</italic> says</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="Ayu-32-200-g001.jpg"/></p><p>When the <italic>Sneha</italic> is in a normal condition, it gives unctuousness, invigoration, luster, strength, and corpulence to the body, but when it is in a disturbed state, disease occurs, which can be termed as <italic>Rasa-raktagata Sneha</italic> (hyperlipidemia). Cholesterol is a fatty substance (a lipid) that is an important part of the outer lining (membrane) of cells in the body of animals. Cholesterol is also found in the blood circulation of humans. It originates from two major sources: dietary intake and liver production. Dietary cholesterol comes mainly from meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. Organ meats, such as liver, are especially high in the cholesterol content, while foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. After a meal, cholesterol is absorbed by the intestines into the blood circulation and is then packaged inside a protein coat. This cholesterol&#x02013;protein coat complex is called a chylomicron.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>The liver is capable of removing cholesterol from the blood circulation as well as manufacturing cholesterol and secreting cholesterol into the blood circulation. After a meal, the liver removes chylomicrons from the blood circulation. Between meals, the liver manufactures and secretes cholesterol back into the blood circulation.</p><p>Hence the assessment of <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic> can be possible in hyperlipidemia patients in objective and subjective criteria and <italic>Ruksa Guna</italic> drugs can be used for treatment. So this work was done to establish the two <italic>Gunas</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Conceptual study</title><p>For this study, the basic and conceptual materials were collected from the <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> classics, namely, <italic>Brihatrayee</italic> and <italic>Laghutrayee</italic>, other texts, literature in Modern science concerned with these principles, scientific journals, dissertations, research papers, etc.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Plant material</title><p>The plants selected had <italic>Ruksa</italic>, the dominant property in <italic>Rasa Pancaka</italic>.

<italic>Dhatu</italic> flows interruptedly on the, <italic>Tvaca</italic> as well as whole body with the help of <italic>Srotas</italic>. If <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic> increases in <italic>Rasa Dhatu</italic>, then the <italic>Snigdhata</italic> of the skin increases too. So the <italic>Snigdhata</italic> will be seen in the body. In this study, maximum <italic>Snigdhata</italic> was seen at <italic>Lalata</italic> and <italic>Karna Pradesa</italic>.</p><p>According to the aim of the treatment of hyperlipidemia, serum HDL should be increased. The change in serum LDL was very mild, but an increase in serum HDL was not observed. In the control group, there was no change except for a minor change in serum cholesterol. It can be said the hypothesis is positively supported by the result of lipid profile test. In the treated group, better results could have been found if the duration was increased, up to 3 months, as the 45-day treatment duration may be not sufficient for getting the desired result in the case of serum LDL.</p><p>As weight and BMI both are interrelated, as weight reduced, BMI also reduced. In the medicinal Group A, results were seen due to the exercise, diet control, and the <italic>Ruksa</italic> drugs.</p><p>The prepared drug was not toxic to the body as after the administration of Group A, there was a decrease in serum uric acid with the decrease in weight. So it is a safe drug and is helpful in peripheral arterial diseases.</p><p>The <italic>Ruksa Guna</italic> prepared drug in Group A was able to decrease the <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic> of the body as well as helpful in increasing the <italic>Dipana Pacana</italic> activity of liver. As the serum alkaline phosphatase level reduced by 14.94%, it seems the liver function was increased during the period of medication.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the end, it can be concluded that hyperlipidemia can be treated by <italic>Ruksa Guna</italic> property drugs assuming the condition to be an increase in <italic>Snigdha Guna</italic>. On the basis of the Guna concept, the applied medicine of <italic>Ayurveda</italic> could be developed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Acharya</surname><given-names>Vaidya Jadavaji Trikamaji</given-names></name></person-group><article-title><italic>Agnivesa</italic>, &#x02018;<italic>Caraka Samhita</italic>&#x02019;, revised by <italic>Caraka</italic> and <italic>Drdhabala</italic> with &#x02018;<italic>Ayurveda DipikA</italic>&#x02019;
