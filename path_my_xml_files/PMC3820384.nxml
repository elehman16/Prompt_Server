training and motor imagery training on recovery from chronic stroke. [Subjects] Thirty
patients (who were over six months post stroke) participated in this study and were
randomly allocated to three groups. [Methods] The action observation training group
practiced additional action observation training for five 30-minute sessions over a
four-week period. The motor imagery training group practiced additional motor imagery
training for five 30-minute sessions over a four-week period. Electroencephalogram were
used to compare brain waves between the three groups. [Results] The action observation
group showed significant changes in relative alpha power in Fp1 and Fp2 and relative beta
power in Fp2 and C3. [Conclusion] Action observation induces higher levels of cognitive
activities than motor imagery and physical training. Action observation is expected to be
more effective for stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Action observation</kwd><kwd>Motor imagery</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Therapeutic approaches to stroke recovery include neurodevelopmental treatment, functional

as an alternative intervention that can complement the limitations of motor imagery

is based on mirror neurons that are active both when people perform an action and when they
watch it being performed, is a cognitive intervention technique that is applied to patients
with motor disorders as well as athletes and healthy people to improve and learn motor
skills, and it is known to be effective in enhancing functional activities in the

criteria were enrolled in this study. For more information about subjects, refer to <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Detailed inclusion criteria were as
follows: (1) having a first-time ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, (2) over six months since
onset, (3) able to walk independently more than 10 m, (4) more than 24 points on the Mini
Mental State Examination, and (5) fewer than 36 points on the Vividness Motor Imagery
Questionnaire-2. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) severe cognitive disabilities, such
as unilateral neglect, dementia, and depression, and (2) severe aphasia. After baseline
measurements were obtained, patients were randomly assigned to groups by selection using
sealed envelopes.</p><p>Participants in the action observation group participated in 20 sessions of 30-min
observation training five times per week. The training program of the action observation
training group consisted of viewing a task video for 20 minutes, followed by physical
training with a therapist for 10 minutes based on the video. The models in the of videos
were normal adult males and females in their 50s, which was similar to the mean age of the
patients, so as to raise their levels of concentration with regard to understanding the
motions. The training program consisted of four stages, according to the content, including
trunk flexion, trunk rotation, sit to stand, and crossing obstacles.</p><p>Participants in the motor imagery group had attended their training for 30 minutes, 5 times
a week for 4 weeks. Motor imagery was conducted for 20 minutes according to the motor
imagery program played through a computer speaker, and the participants then underwent
physical training for 10 minutes based on the training contents. All participants in this
study underwent neurodevelopmental therapy for 30 minutes, twice per day, five days per week
for a period of four weeks, according to the schedule of the institution in which they were
hospitalized. The exercise program included training of the trunk for learning supine to
rolling movements, sit to stand, and normal gait pattern.</p><p>A Poly-I (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Korea) was used to take EEG measurements. Measurement of
EEG is likely to be influenced by internal factors, such as eye movements and blinks and
hiccups, and external factors, including temperature, illuminance, noise, and smell of a
room; therefore, measurements were performed in a separate quiet space with a constant
temperature and illuminance. Measurements were taken before and after the training. Each EEG
measurement was recorded for one and a half minutes while the subjects were instructed to
maintain a comfortable posture with the eyes closed and refrain from speaking or moving in
order to minimize interference from artifacts.</p><p>EEG electrodes were attached to four places on the scalp using the monopolar derivation
method. The four places included frontopolar 1 (Fp1), frontopolar 2 (Fp2), central lobe 3
(C3), central lobe4 (C4), occipital lobe 1 (O1), occipital lobe 2 (O2) in order in
accordance with the International 10&#x02013;20 system. Moreover, a reference electrode and a ground
reference electrode were placed behind the right earlobe and the left earlobe, respectively.
The electrodes used were gold-plated disc-shaped EEG electrodes (ElefixZ-401CE, Nihon
Kohden, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>For EEG data analysis, a quantitative analysis was conducted using Telescan2.98 (Laxtha
Inc., Daejeon, Korea). Among the overall EEG raw data, 70 seconds of each measurement after
excluding the first and last ten seconds was analyzed. Raw EEG data were converted into
frequencies using a fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then relative alpha power (8&#x02013;13/4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz)
and relative beta power (13&#x02013;20/4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz) were analyzed.</p><p>SPSS statistical package version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for
statistical analysis.Pairedt-tests were used to determinewhether the changes in relative
alpha power and relative betapower between before and after trainingdiffered significantly
within a group.One-way ANOVA was used to determine whether values that changed between
before and after training differed significantly between the three groups. The LSD test was
used for posthoc analysis. An alpha level of p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of relative alpha and beta power between groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="2"/><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Action observation<break/>training group<break/>(n=9)</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Motor imagery<break/>training group<break/>(n=9)</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Physical<break/>training group<break/>(n=9)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="6" colspan="1">Relative<break/>alpha</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fp1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0864 &#x000b1;

activity during action observation training, motor imagery training, and physical training
by observing changes in EEG during each type of training.</p><p>EEG signals can be divided into spontaneous potentials (SP) and evoked potentials (EP).
Then SPs can be classified into five types according to the frequency domain, among which
alpha power, between 8&#x02013;13&#x02005;Hz, is usually detected in a comfortably conscious state when an
individual is relaxed, comfortable with the eyes closed, or meditating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Alpha power increases in a relaxed state or a state of a
moderate level of awareness, while it decreases as the intensity of cognitive activity
increases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to the results of this study, a lower occurrence frequency of alpha power was
observed inthe action observation group, compared with the motor imagery group and the
physical training group,and significant differences were revealed between before and after
training in Fp1 and Fp2. This suggests that even though motor imagery induced an increase in
cognitive activity, action observation training led to a higher level of cognitive activity
than motor imagery or physical training did. In C3 and C4, decreases in relative alpha
power, though not significant, were observed as in the other areas. Such responses in the
parietal lobe indicate that brain activity occurred not in a localized area but across all
brain areas while information about stimuli given during observation were processed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Action observation is known to activate
the cerebral cortex more effectively than motor imagery because it involves the direct
activity of multisensory systems and forms clear motor representations of given tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the action observation
group was encouraged to watch the task video, composed of several stages, intensively for a
certain period of time and then to understand the order of the motions and details in the
mind. In comparison, the motor imagery group was instructed to imagine relevant motions
based solely on auditory signals. Therefore, subjects who had not normally experienced the
motions in real life presumably found it difficult to form clear representations of the
tasks. In addition, decreased concentration during motor imagery training may have hindered
learning, and this is probably why the action observation group showed a relatively lower
occurrence frequency of relative alpha power than the other two groups. Beta power, between
12&#x02013;35&#x02005;Hz, is detected when an one is engaged in solving problems that require concentration
including when one's cognitive effort increases with the purpose of performing difficult
tasks, one is thinking logically, or one's conscious activity regarding the body rises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In most cases, alpha power is suppressed,
while beta power increases, when an individual is executing tasks that require concentration
rather than remaining in a stable state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.The activation of beta power is known to reflect an increase in
cognitive function resulting from cognitive information processing activity at an intense
level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pfurtscheller et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed the occurrence frequencies of
beta power in the sensorimotor area while subjects were imagining foot, hand, and tongue
movements. The results revealed that there was no significant change during the imagination
of tongue movements, while the occurrence frequencies of beta power significantly increased
during the imagination of foot or hand movements. These results suggest that the intensity
of cognitive activity required can vary according to the characteristics of the task. The
action observation training program adopted in this study was composed of task-oriented
training categories, such as a trunk exercise while sitting, horizontal weight shift while
standing, level walking, and obstacle crossing while walking. These types of training are
thought to have increased the subjects' levels of cognitive activity required to understand
the motions. Furthermore, action observation training, unlike motor imagery training, allows
participants to identify the differences between their internal plans and observed models
while observing their motions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
activation of such a feedback mechanism can raise the level of cognitive activity in
participants. The results of this study also suggested that the action observation group
showed higher relative beta power values than the other two groups and indicated significant
differences in Fp2 and C3 between before and after training. In the premotor cortex, the
neurotransmission process occurs in real time from the cerebral cortex to relevant muscles
both when people perform an action and when they watch it being performed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, and such activity of the cerebral cortex
seems to have enabled the action observation group to show relatively high levels of
relative beta power.</p><p>The results revealed that action observation training induced higher levels of cognitive
activity than motor imagery or physical training did. The effectiveness of motor imagery
training has been proved in various fields. Nevertheless, for stroke patients and others
with central nervous system injuries, in particular, motor learning through action
observation training is expected to be more effective in terms of the provision of easier,
clearer representations of motions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bobath</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Observations on adult hemiplegia and suggestions for
