Consequently, they are less able to intuitively understand societal norms as their typically developing peers.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The current policy to assist social and academic development is to include them in mainstream classrooms,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but there is growing evidence to suggest that without support such placements increase the risk of isolation and rejection.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>A Social Story is a non-intrusive, easy to implement intervention that appears to be effective for providing social information to children with ASD.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A Social Story is a brief, individualised narrative that details a social situation and guides the child's behaviour through visual supports and text.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> They are commonly used in schools in the UK and have been recommended by a review of evidenced-based interventions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Their design uses 10 criteria to ensure that the story's structure and content is descriptive, meaningful, safe and constructive for those reading it.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These criteria include rules for the type and balance of sentences throughout the text as well as specific language to avoid.</p><p>Until recently, research exploring the effectiveness of Social Stories has mainly been through use of single case design methodology. There is a paucity of good quality, comparative evidence of Social Stories particularly within school settings as highlighted in three systematic reviews of effectiveness.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> These reviews indicated an overall positive effect with individual case studies on a number of social and behavioural outcomes. Wright <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> also reported on seven between-group studies, four of which were randomised controlled trials (RCTs).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref> However, the literature is largely US based and the studies have generally failed to successfully follow Gray's criteria. In particular, interventions have tended to lack an individualised story constructed for the specific needs of the child and were vulnerable to selection and reporting bias.</p><p>From this evidence base and the recommendations of Kasari and Smith,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> there was a strong justification to conduct a well-designed, ecologically valid, large-scale RCT on the effectiveness of Social Stories which used individualised stories within a school setting. However, the individualised nature of Social Stories leads to complexities for their measurement and delivery. Therefore, there is a need to first conduct a feasibility RCT. Consequently, we designed the Autism Spectrum Social Stories in Schools Pilot Trial (ASSSIST) as a two-phase study to first adapt and develop the intervention for a UK population. In phase 2, we examined the feasibility of conducting a full scale trial. This paper focuses on the second phase of ASSSIST to assess the feasibility of delivering a RCT comparing the manualised Social Stories intervention with an attention control for children with ASD in mainstream schools. The feasibility objectives included recruitment, retention, outcome selection, sample size estimation for full trial and acceptability of intervention training and delivery among teachers, parents and children.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Feasibility trial design</title><p>The feasibility study was a single-centre, unblinded, cluster RCT, comparing the feasibility of measuring the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Social Stories at altering the behaviour of children with ASD in a mainstream school setting with a comparator group using an attention control. The study had a nested qualitative study to examine acceptability. The study was conducted between November 2011 and October 2014.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>For each participating child, there was an associated teacher and parent who completed questionnaires and delivered the intervention. For ease of reference, these are called participant groups (one child, one parent and one teacher). We use the term teacher to refer to any school staff member designated to work with the participating child on the study (encompassing teaching assistants and special educational needs coordinators, as well as class teachers).</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Participant groups were included if the child: (1) had a diagnosis of ASD given by the multidisciplinary, multiagency York Autism Spectrum Disorders Forum or other equivalent bodies using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> research diagnostic criteria, (2) was aged between 5 and 15&#x02005;years, (3) attended mainstream school and (4) exhibited social interaction difficulties that resulted in problems at school as reported by parents or teachers.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Participant groups were excluded if: (1) the child had used Social Stories in the preceding 6&#x02005;months, (2) the child was likely to move schools in the following 4&#x02005;months and (3) either the parent or teacher of the child had taken part in the qualitative interviews or focus groups conducted in the first phase of ASSSIST.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size</title><p>We aimed to recruit a total of 50 participant groups.

Professional educational and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) clinical staff associated with the research team delivered the training in Social Stories in a CAMHS setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Qualitative component</title><p>To examine the acceptability of the intervention and the trial process, we purposively sampled parents (or carers) and their children in receipt of intervention (or comparator) from participants in the feasibility RCT (n=10). This sample included parents who were actively involved in supporting the intervention at home. We recruited five parents/children from the control arm as a comparator to examine the trial processes. We purposively sampled from the group of professionals who were delivering the intervention (n=5) to achieve a rounded picture of the intervention delivery from all key stakeholders across a series of cases from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Three alternative recruitment procedures were used to identify and recruit participants: contact through schools, contact through parent groups, and referrals from clinicians and local authority staff.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Feasibility trial process</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Goal setting meeting</title><p>A goal setting meeting (GSM) was arranged for all eligible participants to set a unique goal for the child to achieve by consensus between the teacher and the parent, and second, to define and operationalise specific behaviours that they hoped to increase and decrease. The GSMs lasted &#x0223c;90&#x02005;min.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>To minimise contamination bias, cluster randomisation by school was adopted. Following completion of baseline measures, school randomisation using minimisation was used to account for the numbers of children with ASD, levels of support, the socioeconomic position of the area in which the school was situated (as measured by the deprivation indices) and the school's academic achievement (as measured by their value added measures). Allocation to groups was conducted remotely by York Trials Unit.</p></sec><sec id="s2g3"><title>Intervention</title><p>An individualised Social Story was created for each child in the intervention arm (23 in total) to achieve an identified goal. The stories were created by the participating teachers with support from parents and researchers during a training day. All participating teachers left this training day with a fully constructed narrative for the Social Story that had been examined and validated by an expert trainer. Guidance was provided on how to format the story to individualise it to the particular child's needs (eg, story book format, power point slides or on a single sheet of A4 paper). All adult participants in the intervention arm also received a copy of the Social Stories training manual developed in phase 1 of ASSSIST.</p><p>The delivery of the intervention within schools was conducted by the participating teacher in accordance with their knowledge of the child's needs and abilities with support and advice from parents. The guidelines given to participating teachers were to read the story with the child three times a week at school for 2&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2g4"><title>Comparator group</title><p>Participating teachers in the comparator group were asked to choose a typical age appropriate story of interest to the child (without any social information relevant to the goal) and were given similar guidance on reading it to those in the intervention group. Restrictions were not imposed on the length of this story but the teacher was advised to spend between 5 and 10&#x02005;min of time reading with the child. A letter detailing how to present this story was sent to the teachers and parents and this included a date to start delivering the attention control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Outcome measure selection</title><p>Baseline questionnaires were given to participants in the GSM to be completed either at the end of the session or at home. Follow-up questionnaires (including all baselines measures) were sent to all participants at 6 and 16&#x02005;weeks following the start of the intervention (or control). Participating children of all ability levels were asked to complete some measures to assess the feasibility of collecting data from this population in a larger trial.</p><sec id="s2h1"><title>Potential primary outcome measures</title><p>The following measures were considered as potentially appropriate to be selected as the primary outcome in a full scale RCT and were therefore administered as part of the feasibility study:

Four of these (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and peer problems) were combined to obtain a total difficulties score ranging from 0 to 40. The mean and SD of this composite score was used in the analysis. It has strong reliability and validity as a dimensional measure of psychological constructs.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The scale was completed by participating parents, teachers and older children (11&#x02013;15&#x02005;years).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2):<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The SRS-2 identifies social impairment associated with ASD and quantifies its severity. It is a 65-item scale and each item has four response options giving a score of 0&#x02013;3. SRS total raw scores range from 0 to 195 and higher scores indicate increased social impairment.

This was included as a measure of perceived effect of the intervention. It was completed by all participants including the children.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A behavioural frequency measure (BFM), designed by the research team, to enable individualised goals and measured on five-point Likert scales. The points on the scales gave an indication as to the frequency of the behaviour from &#x02018;never&#x02019; to &#x02018;very frequently&#x02019;.

Examining the items relating to health services use at baseline, 6 and 16&#x02005;weeks showed a high proportion of missing responses. Owing to the construction of the questionnaire, it was not possible to assess whether missing values represented no service usage. The feasibility of collecting resource-related information from participating teachers was promising to inform an extended perspective as they provided a good indication of school grades, the level of pupil productivity and how often participating children did not attend school.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Power calculation for full scale trial</title><p>Calculations were undertaken based on the SRS T-score total score using the change in score from baseline to 6&#x02005;weeks. We chose this measure to base our calculations on as the subjective nature of the goal-based measure makes it more difficult to state that an observable change is clinically significant. <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011748TB5">Table&#x000a0;5</xref> showed the descriptive summary of the SRS total scores. The intervention group's scores changed by 5.28 (7.17) and by 1.95 (6.79) in the comparator group from baseline to 6&#x02005;weeks. Using the difference in the change in scores of 3.33 (5.28&#x02013;1.95), a sample size of 72 in each group would be required at 80% power to detect a difference of 3.33, assuming that the common SD is 6.975 using a two-group t-test with a 5% two-sided significance level. Allowing for 80% response rate, we require 90 participant groups=total sample size of 180. It was deemed inappropriate to continue with a cluster design and inflate this total further.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016011748TB5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Total SRS score for paired data at baseline and 6&#x02005;weeks</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">Baseline</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparator</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.59</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.75</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77.30</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.53</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">6&#x02005;weeks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparator</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.37</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.28</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.84</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">Difference (6&#x02005;weeks to baseline)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparator</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.95</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.79</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;5.28</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.17</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>SRS, Social Responsiveness Scale.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Summary of findings</title><p>The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of conducting a RCT examining the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Social Stories compared with an attentional control for children with ASD attending mainstream schools. To accomplish this, we examined methods of recruitment; the randomisation process; trial logistics; participant retention and completion of measures; and qualitative feedback. The results were generally positive but the process indicated substantial areas which needed improvement to scale up to a fully powered trial.</p><p>We tested three methods of recruitment and all three showed a degree of success. We were able to recruit to a target of 50 participant groups within the specified timeframe of 12&#x02005;months. Recruitment was most effective when contacting schools directly. However, other strategies such as recruitment through parent support groups and professional referrals further augmented this process.</p><p>All participating teachers and the majority of parents attended a training session, completed a Social Story and reported that they successfully delivered the intervention within the intervention period. We were able to improve the trial logistics and speed up the process of participation through the removal of an outcome measure that required more time to administer, explain and complete than might be feasible for a full scale trial.</p><p>Retention of participant groups was good, with only one participant group withdrawing before randomisation. Questionnaire completion rates were highest for participating teachers, and good for participating parents. This is consistent with the findings of previous studies in the area.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, the feasibility of collecting questionnaires from child participants was questionable due to low response rates and parent reports of low validity. Two outcome measures, the SRS-2<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and the custom-made goal-based measure, showed high levels of completion rates (for teachers), good face validity and a trend in the desired direction indicating that they would be suitable for use as primary outcome measures in a full scale trial. Power calculations were conducted using the SRS-2 to give a total required sample size of 180 participants for a full scale trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations of the feasibility study</title><p>There was a substantial delay in treatment for some participants. This delay was attributed to a combination of reasons such as the difficulty in arranging GSMs, teacher availability for training, the requirement for diary completion and the cluster design. This was substantially improved by the removal of the diary measure and could be improved further by using simple randomisation in a full scale trial.</p><p>Intervention fidelity with regard to if the stories remained consistent to the criteria throughout the delivery was only partially assessed. It would be important to include a time point for all stories to be checked again after delivery if a full scale trial were to be conducted.</p><p>We did not collect data on the child's ability levels and this might be considered a limitation. We chose not to do this as we wanted to use a pragmatic, inclusive approach to explore if collecting data from this population of children was feasible. Consequently, it was deemed unnecessary to increase participant burden by the inclusion of these measures.</p><p>A further limitation was that this sample was obtained from only one NHS Trust resulting in potential for minorities to be under-represented. This would need to be addressed in a future full scale trial by expanding the study to a national level through use of multiple sites.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite the limitations, this study is the first to systematically evaluate the feasibility and acceptability for examining the effects of Social Stories in a school environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to examine this intervention while still retaining the individualisation process central to their design. We have successfully developed and refined a Social Stories training package for use in mainstream school. This training package which consists of a manual and a training day has the potential to help children with ASD overcome some of the social difficulties they experience at school in a non-expensive non-intrusive way, subject to its being shown to be effective and cost-effective in a future trial. Were this to be demonstrated, the intervention could be made widely available to educational and community settings across the country.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the schools and parents who took time to be a part of this study.
