According to the clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathological classification (CEAP) definition, the reticular veins are included in the C1 class and are mainly associated with aesthetic complaints. Several invasive techniques are used for treatment, including mini phlebectomy, laser ablation, and radiofrequency ablation. However, a wide range of sclerosing agents may serve as minimally invasive alternatives, promoting chemical sclerosis of the vein wall. Although this technique is routinely performed around the world, there is no consensus on the most efficacious and safe chemical agent to be used.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Inclusion criteria are women between 18 and 69&#x000a0;years old with at least 10&#x000a0;cm long reticular veins in the lower limbs, on the outer side of the leg/thigh. Patients with CEAP 2 to 6, or with allergies, pregnancy, performing breastfeeding, or with any dermatologic or clinical problems will be excluded. Patients with venous ultrasound mapping showing involvement of saphenous trunks and/or a deep venous system will also be excluded. Patients will be randomized into two groups, one receiving 75% pure glucose and the other group receiving 0.2% polidocanol diluted in 70% glucose. Just one limb and one session per patient will be performed. The sclerosing agent volume will not exceed 5&#x000a0;mL. Clinical follow-up will include visits on days 7 and 60, always with photographic documentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This project aims to enroll 96 patients and subject them to a double-blind treatment after the randomization process. The design is intended to evaluate efficacy through a primary end point and safety through a secondary end point. Forty-eight patients have currently been enrolled. Preliminary results for these patients showed that 25 received treatment, 2 were excluded, and 22 returned after 7&#x000a0;days and showed no greater adverse events. To date, establishing efficacy criteria has not been possible, and no patients have reached the 60-day return point. These data may help doctors choose the best chemical agent for the treatment of reticular veins.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02054325">NCT02054325</ext-link>, 3/02/2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1745-6215-15-497) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Glucose solution</kwd><kwd>Hypertonic</kwd><kwd>Sclerosing solutions</kwd><kwd>Sclerotherapy</kwd><kwd>Telangiectasis</kwd><kwd>Varicose veins</kwd><kwd>Veins</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>According to the definition of the clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathological classification (CEAP), the reticular veins are included in the C1 class and are mainly associated with aesthetic complaints. Several invasive techniques are commonly used for treatment, including mini phlebectomy, laser ablation, and radiofrequency ablation. However, a wide range of sclerosing agents may serve as minimally invasive alternatives, promoting chemical sclerosis of the vein wall. Reticular veins have a diameter no greater than 3&#x000a0;mm and are straight, bluish, and located in the subcutaneous tissue of the lower limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They have the same complex etiology of all types of primary venous insufficiency such as hormonal issues, family history, and standing position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, despite its common occurrence, the condition remains poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Sclerotherapy is the preferred treatment for some patients because of its simplicity and reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and consists of an intraluminal sclerosing agent application to trigger endothelial injury, with subsequent luminal occlusion of these segments. Many agents, such as hypertonic saline and hypertonic glucose as hyperosmolar sclerosing agents, as well as ethamolin&#x000ae; and polidocanol as detergent agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], are known to be effective. Hypertonic osmotic solutions cause dehydration and destruction of endothelial cells. Hypertonic dextrose (or glucose) and sodium tetradecyl sulfate are commonly used due to their low cost and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Conversely, polidocanol acts as a detergent on vein wall lipids, destroying the cellular cement and causing endothelial maceration; this process effectively occludes the vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Due to its efficacy and manipulability, the use of polidocanol is quite common throughout the world. Usually, it is mixed with a wide variety of diluents, such as distilled water, air, or hypertonic glucose. However, some collateral damage can occur from these mixtures, including necrosis, hyperpigmentation stains, allergic reactions, and systemic disorders. Chest pain, cough, anaphylaxis, scotoma, and gas embolization are unusual, but serious adverse events have already been reported in other studies due to this agent, although these issues are commonly related to miscalculated dosages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Chemical sclerotherapy is slightly painful and the discomfort is limited to the puncture site, which warrants a free anesthesia procedure. The procedure is usually well tolerated by patients and has a rapid recovery period. However, the use of sclerotherapy for reticular veins is controversial because of its association with blemishes and other risks. However, evidence of these risks is equivocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that various formations of polidocanol are effective in the performance of sclerotherapy for reticular veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Results from our study have shown positive effects in the treatment of reticular veins using a 0.2% polidocanol solution and 70% hypertonic glucose. Additionally, there was a low occurrence of stains and no major collateral effects. The Food and Drug Administration approved polidocanol as a medicinal sclerosing agent in the United States in 2010, and was soon followed by several European countries. The formulation of polidocanol described above is available for sclerotherapy in Brazil despite the lack of appropriate scientific literature on this treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the benefits and safety of a reticular vein treatment using a formulation of 0.2% polidocanol with 70% hypertonic glucose in Brazilian patients.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>We hypothesize that 0.2% polidocanol plus 70% hypertonic glucose is superior to 75% hypertonic glucose alone in promoting the disappearance of reticular veins of the lower limbs. Moreover, we hypothesize that 0.2% polidocanol plus 70% hypertonic glucose is not inferior to 75% hypertonic glucose in terms of safety.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, triple-blind trial to compare the safety and efficacy of two sclerosing agents (0.2% polidocanol plus 70% hypertonic glucose versus 75% hypertonic glucose) in women over 60&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patient enrollment and randomization</title><p>A convenience sample of patients undergoing treatment for mild varicose veins will be employed. Patient information will be entered into an electronic database, and participants will later be contacted to attend an outpatient evaluation. In the first evaluation, patients who have a reticular vein measuring at least 10&#x000a0;cm long in the outer-side of the leg and/or thigh will be invited to join the study. The sample size was estimated to be 96 treated limbs (see &#x0201c;Statistical analyses&#x0201d;). All subjects will be informed of study risks and will be required to sign an informed consent form approved by the institutional review board. The random allocation schedule will be generated using the computer program Stat Trek (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stattrek.com/Tables/Random.aspx">http://stattrek.com/Tables/Random.aspx</ext-link>).</p><p>Two groups will be established for the treatment of reticular veins, including either 0.2% polidocanol diluted in 70% glucose or 75% glucose alone. A trained nurse will store all data and remain in charge of arrangements, such as preparing the solutions used in the treatments, throughout the duration of the study. Solutions will be prepared in a specific room (different from the office) using sterile 10&#x000a0;mL syringes. Syringes will be identified according to a random number given to each patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethics</title><p>This trial is being conducted in accordance with the principles of Helsinki&#x02019;s Declaration, ISO14155 and Good Clinical Practices guidelines.

Two additional lines will be drawn parallel to the first one, with one marked at 7.5&#x000a0;cm anterior and the other at 7.5&#x000a0;cm posterior, which define the limited area for treatment (600&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In this area, one or two reticular veins, measuring from 10&#x000a0;cm to 20&#x000a0;cm in total length, will be treated with a minimum of 10, and a maximum of 30, punctures and with 5&#x000a0;mL as the maximum volume of medication over the treatment duration. Each puncture will not exceed 0.3&#x000a0;mL of volume.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Photographic registry</title><p>Photos of patients will be taken to register the early and late results of the treatment area (pre-treatment).

The target area, described above, will be photographed before treatment (pretreatment) to prevent a possible time bias related to the patient&#x02019;s illness. Patients will be placed in a standing position on a platform with the target area facing the camera, which will be placed 1.0&#x000a0;m away. A high-definition standardized scale (attached to the platform) will be used to perform all measurements. The room will be arranged with ideal lighting.</p><p>Pictures will be stored in files for later analysis using ImageJ&#x02122; software. Each photo will be identified with code numbers (according to the randomized number of the protocol), matching the moment of the study (Day 0 (D0) and D60). ImageJ software will be used to measure the length of the treated veins by turning pixels into centimeters using a 2&#x000a0;cm line drawn upon the standardized scale. Measurements will be taken from the photos before and after the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Treatment (D0)</title><p>After the photographs are taken, the two groups will be treated similarly to eliminate all the reticular veins in the area of the selected lower limb. All procedures will be performed by the same physician. A rigorous conventional sclerotherapy technique will be followed, consisting of careful injections to prevent leakage of fluid into the subcutaneous tissue. The procedure will be performed until veins become undetectable. The maximum volume allowed per puncture will not exceed 1&#x000a0;mL. A 3&#x000a0;mL luer-lok plastic syringe BD&#x000ae; will be used with a 13&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 Terumo&#x000ae; needle (27&#x000a0;G1/2). Bandages will be performed with a cotton ball (approximately 0.3&#x000a0;cm in diameter) attached to a square piece of plaster tape (measuring approximately 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;cm) right after the completion of the procedure to stop backflow. Before discharge, the target area will be submitted to elastic compression using a 1.5&#x000a0;m long elastic band (Atadress&#x000ae;) for one day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>All treatment data will be gathered, including the minimal volume of solution necessary for the whole disappearance of all the reticular veins in the target area, number of punctures, location of the target area, possible allergic reactions, and existence of minimum varicose veins in the target area. Additionally, a form will be given to the patient to fill out to report discomfort or pain triggered by the treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Patients will be given careful oral and written instructions on how to proceed after treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

Adverse events that will be directly analyzed at the secondary endpoint (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) are stains (limited to the target area), hematomas (limited to the target area), edema, and phlebitis (limited to the target limb). DVT is a severe, but unusual, complication with few existing reports documenting its effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, this complication will also be recorded if it occurs. All of these data will be collected during medical visits (D0 to D60).</p><p>The photos taken at the end of the study (D60) will be used to evaluate irreversible skin changes such as hyperpigmentation.

However, polidocanol is associated with some reports of adverse events such as gas embolism and deep venous thrombosis. Pain, local edema, stains, phlebitis, and ulcers are minor adverse events related to these agents. If any other relevant effects occur, they will be reported to the Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Preliminary results</title><p>Forty-eight patients are currently enrolled; 25 patients have received treatment, 2 patients were excluded due to selection error, and 22 showed no major adverse effects during D7. However, the majority of patients had small local hematoma. Nevertheless, determining the efficacy of the sclerosing agent is currently not possible, given that no patient reached D60. We expect to answer some questions regarding the safety and efficacy of these sclerosing agents, including the advantages and limitations of each. Finally, we hope to determine the superiority of one agent over the other.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Funding</title><p>This study has received financial support from &#x0201c;Sao Paulo Research Foundation &#x02013; FAPESP&#x0201d;, under protocol number 2012/11034-0.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several studies have shown sclerotherapy to be feasible in the treatments of reticular veins using various sclerosing agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, none has investigated the effects of polidocanol diluted at 0.2% in 70% glucose when compared to 75% glucose, commonly used in these procedures. Our goal is to compare the safety and efficacy of these two agents, as well as to determine a possible superiority of one over the other. Secondary endpoints consist of evaluating pain triggered by the sclerosant agent, as well as the occurrence of adverse events like phlebitis and stains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, we intend to report the occurrence of &#x0201c;difficult to treat&#x0201d; hyperchromic stains in patients submitted to this type of treatment. This information, analyzed judiciously, will help vascular surgeons and dermatologists choose the best therapeutic modality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial has been actively recruiting patients since September 2013.
