Decreasing sodium intake has the potential to prevent or delay the development of hypertension and improve blood pressure control, independently of blood pressure lowering drugs, among hypertensive patients. Despite guidelines recommending a low sodium diet, especially for hypertensive individuals, sodium intake remains higher than recommended. A recent systematic review indicated that the efficacious counselling methods described in published trials are not suitable for hypertension management by primary care providers in Canada in the present form. The primary reason for the lack of feasibility is that interventions for sodium restriction in these trials was not limited to counselling, but included provision of food, prepared meals, or intensive inpatient training sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a parallel, randomized, controlled, open-label trial with blinded endpoints. Inclusion criteria are adult patients with hypertension with high dietary sodium intake (defined as &#x02265;100&#x000a0;mmol/day). The control arm will receive usual care, and the intervention arm will receive usual care and an additional structured counselling session by a registered dietitian, with four follow-up telephone support sessions over four weeks. The two primary outcomes are change in sodium intake from baseline, as measured by a change in 24-hour urinary sodium measurements at four weeks and one year. Secondary outcomes include change in blood pressure (as measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring), change in 24-hour urinary potassium, and change in body weight at the same time points.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Though decreasing sodium intake has been reported to be efficacious in lowering blood pressure, there exists a gap in the evidence for an effective intervention that could be easily translated into clinical practice. If successful, our intervention would be suitable for outpatient programs such as hypertension clinics or interprofessional family practices (family health teams). A negative, or partially negative (positive effect at four weeks with attrition by 12&#x000a0;months) trial outcome also has significant implications for healthcare delivery and use of resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02283697">NCT02283697</ext-link>) on 2 November 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0794-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd><kwd>Salt</kwd><kwd>Sodium</kwd><kwd>Dietary modification</kwd><kwd>Dietary counselling</kwd><kwd>Lifestyle modification</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Hypertension is highly prevalent among adult Canadians (about 20&#x000a0;% in those aged 20 to 79&#x000a0;years), and is the most important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events, in particular stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The relationship between sodium intake as assessed from 24-hour urinary sodium and age-related increase in systolic blood pressure (BP) has been well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, decreasing sodium intake has the potential to prevent or delay the development of hypertension and improve BP control, independently of BP lowering drugs, among hypertensive patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. With this in mind, it is not surprising that the restriction of dietary salt intake for the prevention and management of hypertension is a strongly endorsed health measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, Health Canada survey findings indicate that the current average salt intake among Canadian adult males and females ranges between 6.5 and 9&#x000a0;g (or between 2,600 and 3,600&#x000a0;mg of sodium)/day, with men consuming more dietary salt than women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, according to the 2014 Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) guidelines, sodium intake should not exceed 2,000&#x000a0;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Indeed, an individual would have to reduce their sodium intake by 50 to 70&#x000a0;%, depending on their hypertensive status, to reach the CHEP recommended target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>This magnitude of salt intake reduction to levels envisaged by the CHEP is projected to have a significant impact on BP level and on adverse vascular outcomes of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is estimated that 1.65 million deaths worldwide were due to cardiovascular causes from a daily sodium consumption of more than 2&#x000a0;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is also estimated that the associated healthcare cost savings would amount to 10 to 24 billion US dollars annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given the proven relationship between the dietary sodium intake and hypertension, the known risk of adverse outcomes of hypertension, and the individual and public health financial, health, and social benefits of low salt intake, it is somewhat surprising that salt intake remains stagnantly high over the last several decades, despite many public health efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Canadian adults are mostly diagnosed with high BP during routine annual check-ups with their family physician. Family physicians are expected to establish the diagnosis and to initiate hypertension therapy. Since the majority of hypertensive patients in Canada have mild and uncomplicated hypertension, primary care physicians also continue to manage a significant proportion of patients with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, with regards to the treatment of hypertension, family physicians are really the &#x02018;front-liners&#x02019;, who introduce both lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions to individual patients and make further adjustments in therapy to achieve target BP. The CHEP provides detailed guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension to Canadian family physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These guidelines include specific algorithms for the diagnosis and management of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the setting of very busy primary care practices, these algorithms are crucial to facilitate making the diagnosis, initiating and maintaining hypertension therapy, and ensuring that patients are engaged and informed.</p><p>However, in contrast to the specific algorithms provided for the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of hypertension, algorithms on how to achieve the rigorous targets for dietary sodium intake are absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. CHEP specifically endorses the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] because it is well described, reproducible, and leads to sustainable decreases in salt intake. However, what is not clear from the guidelines is details about the most efficacious method of counselling on dietary sodium restriction to achieve potentially very rigorous targets, how to assess compliance and progress of an individual patient with regards to sodium intake restriction, and finally how to include these potentially time-consuming tasks into the daily routine of busy Canadian family physicians. Indeed, lack of time and inadequate compensations have been reported as the strongest barriers to providing nutrition guidance by US and Canadian primary practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These results should not come as surprise once one appreciates how much time primary care physicians in North America have &#x02018;available&#x02019; for their patients. For example, results of the National Review of Medicine 2006 Practice Management Survey showed that majority of family physicians in Canada see 26 to 50 patients per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Further, 42&#x000a0;% of 700 responders reported an increase in patient load in the last 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent systematic review indicated that there are well-described, and therefore, easy to reproduce counselling methods on efficacious low sodium diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, none of these counselling methods are suitable for hypertension management by primary care providers in Canada in the present form. The primary reason for the lack of feasibility in the outpatient settings in Canada is that interventions for salt restriction in these trials was not limited to mere counselling, but included provision of food, prepared meals, or intensive inpatient training sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Hence, given that data from clinical trials support the efficacy of dietary sodium reduction in lowering BP, but with a paucity of research into clinically feasible and logistically simple methods of implementing this, we have designed a pragmatic clinical trial to test if the addition of lead counselling by a registered dietitian, in comparison to usual care, results in a change in dietary sodium intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is designed as a pragmatic, parallel, open-label, randomized controlled trial with blinded endpoints. Since the intervention is a counselling session, blinding will not be possible. However, the primary outcome of the study is a change in urinary sodium, which is an objective endpoint, and the laboratory personnel performing the measurement and the research personnel analyzing the measurements will be blinded to treatment assignment.

The dietitian will assess the patient&#x02019;s eating habits and identify factors involved in high sodium intake, focusing on portion size, processed food, snacking habits, eating out, and reading labels. Apart from counselling tailored to the cause and source of high sodium, a handbook with advice on decreasing sodium in diet will be provided. This will be followed by four weekly, 30-minute long follow-up sessions by telephone to provide support, address compliance, and answer any questions raised by patients and family members.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measurements</title><p>We will evaluate dietary sodium intake by measurement of 24-hour urinary sodium before and after counselling. We will not allow changes in diuretic therapy within a week prior to counselling and throughout the four weeks of the trial duration, and patients in whom an urgent change in diuretic therapy is anticipated will be excluded from the trial. This approach will ensure that baseline 24-hour urinary sodium reflects steady state and represents 24-hour dietary sodium intake. Similarly, changes in 24-hour urinary sodium four weeks post-intervention will reflect changes in patients&#x02019; dietary sodium intake with no interference of the effect of diuretics. In studies using the DASH diet and longer follow-up periods, the effect of intervention is attenuated once the food is not provided to the patient, and so does the effect on BP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hence, we will have the sodium intake re-assessed 12&#x000a0;months post-intervention to assess for the long term effectiveness of this method.</p><p>24-hour ABPM will be done before and after dietary counselling within 24 to 48&#x000a0;hours of 24-hour urinary collection for sodium. This will allow us to correlate any changes in dietary sodium intake with changes in overall BP load. In addition, we will also measure changes in 24-hour urinary potassium, and changes in body weight. Lastly, a simple one-page survey will be administered to all patients to assess their perceptions of potential barriers to dietary sodium reduction at the end of the 12-month follow-up period.

While we anticipate little or no loss to follow-up at four weeks, it is possible that there might be as much as a 30&#x000a0;% loss at 12&#x000a0;months. The minimal clinically important difference according to the CHEP guidelines is a 40&#x000a0;mmol reduction. Our review of the literature identified a range of possible standard deviations from 31 to 51&#x000a0;mmol. To be conservative, we assumed 51&#x000a0;mmol for the sample size estimation. Adjusting for multiple testing, this means that we would need 42 patients per group to have 90&#x000a0;% power in a t-test. In order to ensure this many patients at 12&#x000a0;months, we will recruit 60 patients per group.

Hence there a need for an effective counselling method on low sodium intake pragmatically using available healthcare resources that can lead to a successful and sustained lower sodium intake.</p><p>Our approach took inspiration from a proven strategy of a one-time intensive counselling session followed by weekly telephone reminders which significantly improves adherence to BP lowering drug treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This new but proven method is adapted for counselling on low salt intake as we believe that if it is successful, it would be suitable for outpatient programs such as hypertension clinics or interprofessional family practices (family health teams). This study will also assess the long term efficacy of our counselling strategy, as well as more important outcome with regards to BP control population-wide. A negative, or partially negative (positive effect at four weeks with attrition by 12&#x000a0;months) trial outcome also has significant implications for healthcare delivery and use of resources. A completely negative trial should lead to a search for new methods to change patients&#x02019; most intimate behaviors such as dietary habits. A partially negative trial may just indicate that further interventions are necessary to help with persistence for some or all patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Trial status</title><p>Trial recruitment is anticipated to begin in June 2015. The responsibility for study design, data collection, interpretation, and writing of the report and decision to submit the report for publication resides with the research team, and not the funding body or sponsor. The research team will have access and control over the trial dataset. The findings of the trial will be disseminated using presentation at national conferences (Canadian Hypertension Conference, Canadian Society of Nephrology) and by publication in peer-reviewed journals. We will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist, along with the extensions for pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and non-pharmacologic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], in preparing the final report. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria will be used to determine authorship of the final trial results, with no usage of any professional writers. Trial participant-level data and statistical codes will be made available on request.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_794_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
