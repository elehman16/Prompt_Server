Inclusion criteria of the study were: (1) age of 18&#x02013;60 years, (2) acute closed femoral shaft fractures, and (3) minimum follow-up of six months. Patients with open fractures, head injuries, pathological fractures, ipsilateral femoral fractures of proximal &#x00026; distal segments (i.e. AO type 31 &#x00026; 33), ipsilateral tibial fractures and fractures associated with bone disorders were excluded from the study. Patients unfit for autologous donation (platelet count &#x0003c;130&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L) and patients with thrombocytopenia were also excluded from the study. An informed consent has been obtained from all the participants for inclusion, and the study was authorized by the local ethical committee and performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000.</p><p>After detailed history and examination documentation, Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs including full extent of femur from hip joint to knee joint were obtained. This helped with fracture classification and preoperative planning. Fractures were classified according to AO and Winquist and Hansen classification. As per AO classification, 33 fractures were type 32A, 38 type 32B and 1 type 32C. According to Winquist and Hansen classification, 33 fractures were type I, 31 type II, 7 type III and 1 type IV. Patients were subjected to all relevant preoperative investigations and were taken up for surgery as soon as he/she became fit for anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Grouping and treatment</title><p>Surgery was performed under spinal/general anesthesia. Interlocking nailing (closed or open) was done in all patients. Open nailing was done only in patients in whom closed nailing failed or C-arm image intensifier was not available. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the two groups using a computer generated sequence of random numbers, as follows: study group A (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;33) treated with intramedullary nailing &#x00026; PRP injection/gel application in the same setting, and control group B (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;39) treated with intramedullary nailing without PRP application. Both groups were further divided into two subgroups depending upon if closed or open intramedullary nailing was done. The study group comprised of subgroup A1 (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14) operated with closed intramedullary nailing and PRP injection at the fracture site under radiological control and subgroup A2 (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19) operated with open intramedullary nailing and PRP gel along with fibrin membrane application at the fracture site.

A total of 70&#x000a0;ml of blood was drawn from the antecubital vein. Blood was anticoagulated with citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA) with a ratio 1:9 to the blood. After 10&#x000a0;min centrifugation at 2000&#x000a0;rpm, the blood was layered in three basic components: red blood cells, platelets, and platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Because of the different sediment coefficients, the red blood cells were at the lowest level, the platelets were in the middle and the PPP was at the top. Red cells layer was drawn from the tube. The remainder was agitated for few seconds and underwent a second centrifugation at 2800&#x000a0;rpm for 10&#x000a0;min. The blood was then centrifuged into two layers; the supernatant was PPP while the lower layer was concentrated platelets. About three quarters of the supernatant was collected as PPP in separate vials and was used to make autologous thrombin. The residual was PRP (approximate 12&#x02013;14&#x000a0;ml). PPP and 10% calcium gluconate was mixed (0.2&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;ml calcium gluconate/ml of PPP) and the solution was kept at room temperature for 12&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min. Autologous thrombin gets settled at the bottom of the vial and was collected after removing the fibrin membrane formed at the top of the vial.</p><p>PRP was activated by addition of autologous thrombin (0.2&#x000a0;ml/ml of PRP) and subsequently calcium gluconate (0.2&#x000a0;ml/ml of PRP). This activated PRP was taken in a syringe and injected at the fracture site under radiological control in closed intramedullary nailing cases. In open intramedullary cases, the fibrin membrane prepared from the PPP was dipped in liquid PRP. At the end of nailing, the PRP was activated as above and was allowed to stand for 12&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min at room temperature till it transformed into PRP gel, which was applied locally at the fracture site intraoperatively. The fibrin membrane was then used to cover and contain the PRP at the fracture site.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Follow-up</title><p>All patients had perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.

PRP has been shown to stimulate osteoblast proliferation in&#x000a0;vitro and to enhance bone repair, presumably because of the high levels of autologous growth factors. PRP supplemented with fibrin glue to obtain a platelet gel might confine growth factor secretion to a chosen site.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Another advantage of PRP is its versatility, that is, it further permits local delivery of growth factors nonoperatively by infiltrating the fracture site with activated liquid plasma.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Addition of calcium gluconate promotes the gradual formation of native thrombin, mimicking the physiologic clotting process and enabling a more sustained release of growth factors.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The present study aimed to evaluate the role of PRP in biologic enhancement of healing in acute femoral shaft fractures radiologically.</p><p>In the present study the mean cortex to callus ratio was higher in group A as compared to group B in all months (except sixth month) but the difference was only statistically significant in third and fourth month. This finding suggests that PRP application enhances fracture healing to some extent. It also points towards the short term action of PRP in osteogenesis. Furthermore interesting findings were noted in mean cortex to callus ratio between the four subgroups. In the second month, the mean cortex to callus ratio was highest for subgroup A1, followed by subgroup B1. Both of the two subgroups were operated with closed technique. The intervention used (PRP) in the subgroup A1 had given it an additional advantage over subgroup B1, but failed to produce a statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.000). When these two subgroups were compared to subgroup B2, statistically significant difference was observed (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.009 and <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.037, respectively), which probably reflects the advantage of closed nailing over open reduction and internal fixation.</p><p>At third month subgroups A1 &#x00026; B1 were comparable to each other (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.000), but continued showing a statistically significant difference in the cortex to callus ratio when compared to subgroup B2 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.000 and 0.000, respectively) reflecting the advantage of closed reduction over open reduction. Subgroups A1 &#x00026; B1 had a better mean cortex to callus ratio when compared to subgroup A2 but the difference was statistically insignificant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.082 and 1.000, respectively). But when subgroup A2 was compared to subgroup B2 (both operated with open reduction technique) statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006) was observed which supports the positive effects of PRP and fibrin membrane in fracture healing in open intramedullary nailing. The initial lag period in the callus formation in subgroup B2 could be explained by the difference in the operative technique, complete loss of fracture hematoma, soft tissue damage during surgery and more blood loss. Subgroup A2 was comparable to subgroup B2 in these aspects but had an advantage of PRP and fibrin membrane which would have given it an artificial hematoma effect and growth factors right at the fracture site, which explains the significant difference between the two subgroups.</p><p>At fourth month, subgroups A1 &#x00026; B1 were found to be comparable to each other (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.000) and showed no statistical significant difference in the mean cortex to callus ratio when compared to subgroup A2 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.377 and 1.000, respectively). Subgroup B2 showed a rapid increase in cortex to callus ratio in this month, to make up the initial lag. However, subgroup A2 failed to retain the significant lead over subgroup B2 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.259) which points towards the short term action of PRP in osteogenesis. Only statistically significant difference was observed between subgroup A1 &#x00026; B2 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002), indicating advantage of closed reduction.</p><p>At fifth month subgroups A1 &#x00026; B1 were found to be comparable to each other (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.000) and showed no statistical significant difference in the mean cortex to callus ratio when compared to subgroup A2 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.984 and 1.000, respectively).

Why are the results in the literature so controversial? The reason for the failure of PRP in other studies might be that the potency of the growth factors liberated by PRP is too weak to induce bone formation in defects with low regenerative capacity. Clinical and animal studies that found positive effects for PRP were mostly performed in well-vascularized cancellous bone defects where an abundant presence of precursor cells can be assumed.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Some studies also used PRP in combination with autografts<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> or a matrix with an additional intrinsic osteogenic effect.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>When considering the fibrin matrix, if degradation of a scaffold does not align with the rate of bone regeneration, healing may be impaired by either a lack of a scaffold, or an excessive volume of intact scaffold. Fibrin supports angiogenesis by providing a matrix scaffold which supports cell migration and provides chemotactic activity. The structure of a fibrin clot may affect its ability to perform as a suitable scaffold for cellular attachment,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> while the binding of thrombin and growth factors to the fibrin fibers also support healing as a standby release mechanism during primary clot degradation.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In subgroup A2, we used fibrin membrane to act as scaffold and retain various platelet derived factors.</p><p>Several reasons have been proposed responsible for the controversial results of PRP clinical and experimental outcome. It was assumed that PRP alone cannot induce bone formation but can support osteogenesis in the presence of precursors cells.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This may explain the success of PRP observed in cancellous defects or in combination with autogenous grafts. However, this limitation will prevent PRP from becoming an attractive alternative for the reconstruction of major diaphyseal defects with low regenerative potential. One may argue that the lack of effect of PRP might also result from an insufficient platelet concentration. The growth factor content of PRP depends on the technique used for platelet concentration and the final thrombocyte count. Only few authors have investigated concentration-dependent effects. Schlegel et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> found somewhat better results with higher (6.5-fold compared to normal blood) than with lower platelet concentrations (4.1-fold) on bone regeneration in skull defects of minipigs. Whereas, Weibrich et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> assessed the effect of platelet concentration in PRP on peri-implant bone regeneration in rabbits and concluded that only significant difference in bone regeneration was seen with intermediate platelet concentrations [(2&#x02013;6)&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;the concentration in whole blood i.e., 503,000&#x02013;1,729,000 platelets/ml PRP]. They concluded that at lower concentrations, the effect was suboptimal, while higher concentrations might have a paradoxically inhibitory effect. The subclinical result in the present study might be due to inadequate PRP dose or suboptimal platelet concentration.</p><p>Present study has its own limitation. The number of subjects in each subgroup was small and we used only single dose of PRP. Future randomized controlled studies needs to be conducted in a larger population to standardize the procedure, PRP dose and platelet concentration to have a better result.</p><p>In the light of findings of the present study, we conclude that PRP has no effect on femoral shaft fracture healing treated with closed intramedullary nailing. However, PRP and matrix scaffold provided by fibrin membrane may provide an artificial hematoma effect initially in open or failed closed intramedullary nailing. This effect of PRP fades off in later follow-up months with no difference in fracture union at six months. The results obtained here do serve as a preliminary research and future controlled studies with larger sample size are warranted to accept or refute the osteogenic properties of PRP in acute fracture healing.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bostman</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Varjonen</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vainionpaa</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Incidence of local complications after intramedullary nailing and after plate fixation of femoral shaft fractures</article-title><source>J&#x000a0;Trauma</source><volume>29</volume><year>1989</year><fpage>639</fpage><lpage>645</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2724381</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loomer</surname><given-names>R.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Meek</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>De Sommer</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Plating of femoral shaft fractures: the Vancouver experience</article-title><source>J&#x000a0;Trauma</source><volume>20</volume><year>1980</year><fpage>1038</fpage><lpage>1042</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7452747</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Calori</surname><given-names>G.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tagliabue</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gala</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Application of rhBMP-7 and platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of long bone non-unions: a prospective randomised clinical study on 120 patients</article-title><source>Injury</source><volume>39</volume><year>2008</year><fpage>1391</fpage><lpage>1402</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19027898</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roldan</surname><given-names>J.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jepsen</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone formation in the presence of platelet-rich plasma vs. bone morphogenetic protein-7</article-title><source>Bone</source><volume>34</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>80</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14751565</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sanchez</surname><given-names>A.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheridan</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kupp</surname><given-names>L.I.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is platelet-rich plasma the perfect enhancement factor?
