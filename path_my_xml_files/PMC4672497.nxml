The current recommended treatment regimen for the radical cure of <italic>P. vivax</italic> includes a schizontocidal antimalarial, usually chloroquine, combined with a 14&#x000a0;day regimen of primaquine. The long treatment course frequently results in poor adherence and effectiveness. Shorter courses of higher daily doses of primaquine have the potential to improve adherence and thus effectiveness without compromising safety. The proposed multicentre randomised clinical trial aims to provide evidence across a variety of endemic settings on the safety and efficacy of high dose short course primaquine in glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is designed as a placebo controlled, double blinded, randomized trial in four countries: Indonesia, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Ethiopia. G6PD normal patients diagnosed with vivax malaria are randomized to receive either 7 or 14&#x000a0;days high dose primaquine or placebo. G6PD deficient (G6PDd) patients are allocated to weekly primaquine doses for 8&#x000a0;weeks. All treatment is directly observed and recurrent episodes are treated with the same treatment than allocated at the enrolment episode. Patients are followed daily until completion of treatment, weekly until 8&#x000a0;weeks and then monthly until 1&#x000a0;year after initiation of the treatment. The primary endpoint is the incidence rate (per person year) of symptomatic recurrent <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasitaemia over 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up, for all individuals, controlling for site, comparing the 7 versus 14-day primaquine treatment arms. Secondary endpoints are other efficacy measures such as incidence risk at different time points. Further endpoints are risks of haemolysis and severe adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has been approved by relevant institutional ethics committees in the UK and Australia, and all participating countries. Results will be disseminated to inform <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria treatment policy through peer-reviewed publications and academic presentations. Findings will contribute to a better understanding of the risks and benefits of primaquine which is crucial in persuading policy makers as well as clinicians of the importance of radical cure of vivax malaria, contributing to decreased transmission and a reduce parasite reservoir.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01814683?term=IMPROV&#x00026;rank=2">NCT01814683</ext-link>.

Unlike <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria, <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections form dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) which cause relapses of the infection weeks to months after the initial attack. In South-East Asia relapse rates commonly exceed 50&#x000a0;%, making relapse the main cause of vivax illness. Recurrent episodes of febrile illness and haemolysis inflict a significant public health burden particularly in vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and young children. The first line treatment of vivax malaria is a combination of chloroquine (providing blood schizontocidal activity), and primaquine (providing liver hypnozoitocidal activity). Primaquine, an 8 aminoquinoline, is currently the only licensed drug with activity against hypnozoites. An important constraint on the global deployment of primaquine is its potential to cause haemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd), which typically occurs in 2&#x02013;15&#x000a0;% of patients in endemic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Individuals with less than 10&#x000a0;% of G6PD enzyme activity are at risk of life-threatening haemolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] whereas the haemolysis in those with milder variants may be negligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In practice the lack of available robust diagnostics for G6PDd, concerns over drug toxicity, and the misperceived benign nature of <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection results in healthcare providers rarely prescribing primaquine even when recommended in policy. The lack of a safe and reliable radical cure of <italic>P. vivax</italic> is a major threat to current malaria control and elimination efforts.</p><p>The main determinant of primaquine efficacy is the total dose of primaquine administered, rather than the dosing schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The 14&#x000a0;day regimen was chosen to reduce the required daily dose to mitigate the risk of haemolysis, which is related to the individual dose administered. Previous trials have demonstrated that the standard low dose regimen of primaquine (3.5&#x000a0;mg/kg total, amounting to 15&#x000a0;mg once daily in adults) fails to prevent relapses in many different endemic locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For this reason the 2010 WHO antimalarial guidelines now recommend a high dose regimen of 7&#x000a0;mg/kg (equivalent to an adult dose of 30&#x000a0;mg per day), although many countries still recommend lower doses for fear of causing more serious harm to unscreened G6PDd patients.</p><p>Shorter courses of higher daily doses of primaquine have the potential to improve adherence and thus effectiveness without compromising efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Primaquine also has relatively weak but clinically relevant asexual stage activity against <italic>P. vivax</italic> so larger daily doses may substantially augment chloroquine&#x02019;s blood stage activity in areas of low level chloroquine resistance. In Thailand directly observed primaquine (1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day) administered over 7&#x000a0;days was well tolerated and reduced relapses by day 28 to 4&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is encouraging but not definitive since many relapses present after one month, hence studies with longer follow-up are needed to distinguish whether relapse was prevented or deferred. If the efficacy, tolerability and safety of short-course, high-dose primaquine regimens can be assured across the range of endemic settings, along with reliable point-of-care G6PDd diagnostics, then this new primaquine regimen would be a major advance in malaria treatment improving adherence to and thus the effectiveness of anti-relapse therapy.</p><p>The radical cure of <italic>P. vivax</italic> in patients with known G6PDd is challenging. Current WHO guidelines recommend a weekly dose of 0.75&#x000a0;mg/kg for 8&#x000a0;weeks which mitigates primaquine-induced haemolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] whilst retaining efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The weekly dosing schedule was derived from studies in the USA in a small number of healthy adults with the mildly primaquine-sensitive African A- G6PDd variant. Since host vulnerability to haemolysis varies between the over 100 different G6PDd variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the available evidence is inadequate to ensure the universal safety of a 0.75&#x000a0;mg/kg dose either as a single dose, as advocated for reducing the transmission of falciparum malaria, or a weekly dose for the radical cure of vivax malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Due to the long duration of standard primaquine treatment regimens, courses are difficult to supervise, are poorly adhered to and lack effectiveness. The proposed multicentre randomised clinical trial will provide evidence across a variety of endemic settings on the safety and efficacy of high dose-short course primaquine in G6PD normal patients. In a parallel single arm study data on the safety of weekly primaquine in patients with G6PDd will be obtained. The study aims to generate evidence that will directly inform global public health policy for the radical cure of <italic>P. vivax</italic>. A better understanding of the risks and benefits of primaquine is crucial in persuading policy makers and clinicians of the importance of the radical cure of vivax malaria that will reduce the parasite reservoir and decrease transmission.

However, in participating centres where the G6PD result is not available on the day of enrolment, regimen allocation and administration of the study drugs will be on Day 1. Participating centres can decide whether they prefer to give PQ on Day 0 immediately following schizontocidal therapy or on Day 1 following the start of the schizontocidal therapy. It is important that once a decision is made for each site there will be consistent adherence to the chosen starting day within that site.</p><p>Once G6PD results are available, those testing normal will be randomized in the 3-arm main study whereas, G6PD deficient participants will be enrolled into an observational (non-randomised) open-label arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomization</title><p>A randomization list for participants will be prepared centrally at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU), Bangkok, Thailand. Randomisation will be in blocks of 20 for each dosing band.

There will be 20 individual patient drug kits in a box.</p><p>The study staff responsible for generating the randomization list and for selecting code letters for the study agents will not be involved in any other way in the conduct of the trial and will not be present at the study site.</p><p>Randomisation to determine the regimen allocation will be carried out as soon as a participant is enrolled and will be based on his/her weight. The first drug kit in the relevant box will be given to the first patient; the second drug kit will be given to the next patient in that weight category and so on. The number on the drug kit will be the unique drug randomisation number. It will be recorded onto the CRF as well as the subject number.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Blinding</title><p>Primaquine and primaquine placebos have been manufactured specifically for the study. In order to conceal the allocation of primaquine versus placebo and dose regimen of primaquine, the study will use 7.5&#x000a0;mg and 15&#x000a0;mg tablets primaquine and a placebo with similar appearance. Primaquine will be administered as a single daily dose: 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg/day &#x000d7; 14&#x000a0;days or 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/day &#x000d7; 7&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Medication for blood stage infection</title><p>All study participants will receive blood schizontocidal treatment administered as either chloroquine (total dose 25&#x000a0;mg base/kg) or an artemisinin based combination treatment (ACT), depending on local recommendations and known chloroquine efficacy. Chloroquine (each tablet containing 155&#x000a0;mg of base) will be given at initially (4 tablets or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg for children) and then at 6&#x02013;8, 24 and 48&#x000a0;h (2 tablets or 5&#x000a0;mg/kg for children). Artekin&#x02122; (each tablet containing 40&#x000a0;mg dihydroartemisinin and 320&#x000a0;mg piperaquine) will be given at 0, 24 and 48&#x000a0;h. Artemether-lumefantrine (CoArtem&#x000ae;) is another ACT in use in some countries. One tablet contains 20&#x000a0;mg of artemether and 120&#x000a0;mg of lumefantrine. Dosing will be by weight administered twice daily for three days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Study treatment</title><p>Primaquine is an 8-aminoquinoline with cidal activity against the gametocytes and hypnozoites of <italic>P. vivax</italic>. It is essentially a pro-drug that is extensively and rapidly metabolized to carboxyprimaquine with only a small fraction of the parent drug excreted unchanged. However, little is known of the pharmacokinetics of the metabolites that are responsible for both its antimalarial activity and toxicity. Its principal metabolite, carboxyprimaquine, is formed as a result of oxidative deamination, which is thought to involve both the cytochrome-P450 enzyme complex and monoamine oxidases (MAO). Primaquine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) reached within 3&#x000a0;h. It is cleared by hepatic biotransformation, with an elimination half-life of 8&#x000a0;h. The pharmacokinetics of primaquine does not seem to be time-dependent, showing similar kinetics after repeated dosages. The most important adverse effect is acute haemolytic anaemia in patients with G6PD deficiency. Primaquine may also cause abdominal pain if administered on an empty stomach. Other side effects include nausea and vomiting. Uncommon effects include mild anaemia and leucocytosis. Primaquine causes methaemoglobinaemia (levels of up to 18&#x000a0;% are reported, normal level is &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;%), but this seldom causes symptoms in healthy individuals and is self-limiting.</p><p>Eligible G6PD-normal patients will be randomized to two primaquine regimens and the control arms in a ratio of 2:2:1.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Primaquine regimen 1: 14&#x000a0;days of supervised primaquine (7&#x000a0;mg/kg total dose) administered once per day (0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Primaquine regimen 2: 7&#x000a0;days of supervised primaquine (7&#x000a0;mg/kg total dose) administered once per day (1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg OD) followed by 7&#x000a0;days of supervised placebo</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Control Arm: 14&#x000a0;days of supervised placebo</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>G6PD deficient arm</title><p>Eligible G6PD deficient participants will be enrolled into an observational (non-randomised) open-label arm. Aside from standard blood schizontocidal therapy, these participants will receive a single supervised weekly dose of primaquine 0.75&#x000a0;mg base/kg weekly for 7&#x000a0;weeks i.e. 8 doses (6&#x000a0;mg/kg total dose). During an 8-week treatment regimen haematological screening and clinical assessments will be made prior to each weekly dose of primaquine. Haemoglobin concentration will be assessed using HemoCue&#x02122; (Angelholm, Sweden) done on Days 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21 etc. in the G6PDd arm. The proportion of subjects completing all 8 doses will be classified as &#x0201c;safely treated&#x0201d;. Subjects deemed at risk with further dosing will not be treated further with primaquine.

If the repeat dose of ACT / CQ is also vomited within one hour, the patient will be stopped oral treatment and will be given parenteral rescue treatment.</p><p>When the patient is able to eat and drink normally, they will continue with their study drugs to complete their courses of both the schizonticidal treatment and the primaquine/placebo or open primaquine. Drugs which have been vomited will be counted as administered treatment on that day.</p><p>Patients may develop persistent vomiting, even after the acute phase of illness. In this case the primaquine/placebo will be stopped and restarted once the vomiting has resolved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Subsequent assessments</title><p>Patients will be seen daily until PQ treatment is completed, weekly until week 8 and then monthly until 1&#x000a0;year after enrolment. For the weekly visits a window of 3&#x000a0;days either side will be acceptable for the scheduled follow up. For the monthly visits, 7&#x000a0;days either way will be acceptable. Some subjects may be unable to attend the clinic or be away from home. If such patients own a mobile phone, they can be contacted and interviewed by phone to complete a symptom questionnaire to assess safety outcomes. The most important adverse effect of primaquine is haemolytic anaemia in patients with G6PD deficiency. Haemoglobin concentration (from finger prick sampling by HemoCueAB&#x02122;, Angelholm, Sweden) will therefore be checked regularly.</p><p>Methaemoglobinemia will be assessed using a non-invasive oximeter (Masimo) at baseline, daily for the first three days then D7 and 13/14. MetHb will be measured in a subgroup of patients at two selected sites in the first instance; thereafter, the Masimo machine will be moved to another site. To reduce the risk of unblinding of patient allocation, metHb concentrations will be measured by a research team member who will not be involved in other patient assessments. These data will be recorded in a register and not on the case report form to reduce the risk of unblinding the treatment regimen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Recurrent episodes of malaria</title><p>Participants will attend the study centre according to the scheduled times and will also be encouraged to report to the study centre in the event of any illness. The blood film will only be read immediately if the patient is symptomatic (i.e. has a fever or a history of fever in the preceding 24&#x000a0;h); this mirrors the real world scenario of passive case detection when patients only present to a clinic if they are sick.</p><p>If the patient is well at a routine follow up the blood film will be stored and processed at a later date in the reference laboratory. This will provide data on asymptomatic parasitaemia and how often it resolves spontaneously; this has important implications for understanding the transmission of malaria back to the community.

Based on these assumptions, a total sample size of 1200 evaluable patients, randomly allocated to receive a primaquine regimen (600 patients in each treatment arm), followed for one year will provide a power of 80&#x000a0;% to show non-inferiority or, equivalently, that the two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval for the difference in incidence rate of malaria between the two arms excludes an excess rate of 0.07 infections per person-year or more in favour of the 14&#x000a0;day regimen.</p><p>A further 300 patients in the control arm will also be followed for one year.
