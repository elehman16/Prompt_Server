ED visits were primarily for acute febrile syndromes (32.6%) or pain (20.3%), followed by substance use issues (19.4%), trauma (18%), mental illness (11%), and social access issues (4.4%). Compared to those not utilizing the ED, users were more likely to be white, older, and unmarried, with less trust in their physician and poorer perceived physical health but greater social support. In multivariate models, ED use was correlated with moderate to severe depression (IRR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.80), being temporarily housed (IRR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.54), and alcohol addiction severity (IRR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.21) but not any surrogates of HIV severity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>EDs are frequent sources of care after prison-release with visits often reflective of social and psychiatric instability.

The stepwise elimination model, which used various factors from the predisposing, need, and enabling/disabling domains, was found to be the best fit using AIC and BIC criteria. Participants who used the ED were more likely than non-ED users to be older, white, not married, and experiencing moderate or severe depression. Participants who used the ED expressed lower levels of trust in their physician, had poorer self-perceived physical health, and lower mean lifetime alcohol severity scores. Participants who used the ED were not significantly different from non-ED users in terms of any HIV biological outcomes.

The period of transition from prison to communities has been shown to be destabilizing, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Binswanger1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Baillargeon3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Baillargeon4" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Springer5" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and our empiric study of ED use provides additional evidence of medical, psychiatric, and social vulnerability during this transition period. This study substantially adds to existing published literature by illustrating how ED use is often driven by psychiatric and social instability after prison release, even for individuals with well-controlled HIV.</p><p>Although our sample was relatively small, our findings are likely applicable to other populations of released prisoners with HIV in the U.S. A recent retrospective study in Rhode Island, for example, found significantly higher rates of psychiatric and substance use-related ED visits by released prisoners overall as compared to a general adult population. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> Adding to this existing literature about the post-incarceration period, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Binswanger2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> our results further demonstrate the powerful impact of substance use co-morbidities, specifically drug or alcohol relapse, on ED use during this transition period. High prevalence of active substance use is reflected in our finding that 19% of ED visits were primarily for intoxication. Moreover, a significant proportion of visits were for trauma, wounds, accidents, exposure, and homelessness that are often indirectly related to active substance use.<xref rid="pone.0042416-Shults1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042416-Prekker1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> Surprisingly, greater lifetime severity of alcohol use disorders was protective against ED visits, perhaps because individuals with long-term alcohol misuse are either socially isolated or are &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; in spite of their substance use. Our data suggest that active intoxication and drug/alcohol relapse are more important markers of healthcare utilization than lifetime substance use severity. Hazardous drinking was not found to be associated with ED use in univariate or multivariate models. Post-incarceration, individuals may not have had time to relapse to alcohol use at a level of severity equal to that of baseline. While hazardous drinking was not significantly associated with increased ED use, more severe alcohol use disorders (e.g. harmful drinking, alcohol dependence) may be, and is a topic that warrants further exploration in future studies.</p><p>Overall, in our cohort of released prisoners with HIV, social instability factors are disproportionately represented reasons for visits compared to the general U.S. adult population in the most recent national surveys on ED use. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Niska1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> It was somewhat unexpected, therefore, that temporarily housed participants had a significantly longer time to first ED visit than their housed or homeless counterparts and that they were half as likely as housed subjects to visit the ED. In other words, extremes of housing stability (i.e. being either homeless or permanently housed) were associated with ED visits sooner after release from prison. This counterintuitive finding may be related to the fact that the majority of temporarily housed were at least staying with family or friends and therefore experienced less social isolation, which appears to have had a protective effect against ED visits immediately following prison-release. It might appear to be the case that the temporarily housed group, based on our definition, included a disproportionate number of individuals entering drug treatment, but sub-analyses confirm that those entering treatment included only nine subjects and being temporarily housed remained protective even after removing them from the analysis.</p><p>Regardless of housing stability, HIV-infected released prisoners overall are not dissimilar to other community-based vulnerable populations with HIV in terms of their heavy reliance on EDs for care. One recent study confirmed that &#x0201c;hard-to-reach&#x0201d; HIV populations, including the medically indigent, commercial sex workers, active substance users, homeless persons and prisoners, were significantly more likely to have had two or more ED visits in the prior 6 months (19.3% vs. 12.3%) when compared to a random sample of PLWHA. In another study, injection drug users in community settings having access to and utilizing low-threshold health services on a mobile health van reduced ED use, especially for those who were HIV-infected and had underlying psychiatric co-morbidity. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Pollack1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> Importantly, these &#x0201c;hard-to-reach&#x0201d; individuals experienced excessive housing instability, unemployment, prior heroin/cocaine use, and mental illness. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Cunningham1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> In other community-based samples, recent ED use has also consistently been associated with homelessness and untreated substance use disorders, social and medical co-morbidities faced disproportionately by released prisoners. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Masson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Kidder1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Palepu2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> As a co-morbid condition, HIV itself may be a less important driver of healthcare utilization: participants in our study with HIV viral suppression at baseline were <italic>more</italic> likely to have an ED visit following release. This finding did not reach statistical significance in a step-wise multivariate model of ED use, though the study may have been underpowered to detect a difference.</p><p>Our finding that increased ED use is associated with social access issues, mental illness and active substance use highlights the importance of addressing these factors as released prisoners adjust to community life, often in a destabilizing environment, after imprisonment. Notably for future research, these issues are amenable to interventions that might include provision of permanent housing, treatment for substance use disorders, or linkages to psychiatric care after release. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Springer6" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> Multiple possible explanations and interventions have been proposed to improve HIV treatment outcomes during the immediate post-release period. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Springer3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> Previous research has confirmed that effective treatment of opioid dependence using buprenorphine during the 3-months post-release resulted in stabilized HIV treatment outcomes. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Springer4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> Another recent study further demonstrated that retention in buprenorphine treatment was significantly associated with reduced ED use in a cohort of opioid dependent patients accessing mobile healthcare services. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> Though findings here did not demonstrate an impact of buprenorphine prescription on ED use, this may be explained in part because ED utilization appears to be more of a function of retention on buprenorphine, rather than receipt of a prescription. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> In this sample, recent data confirm that retention on buprenorphine at 12 months was only 48%, but was associated with viral suppression. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Springer7" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> Contributors to this low retention rate should be explored in future studies. The extent to which effective treatment of other substance use disorders affects HIV outcomes, however, has yet to be studied. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Springer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Ideally, such interventions would shift healthcare utilization from repetitive, episodic care provided in an ED and towards continuous primary and preventative care or, alternatively, to facilitate ED provision of a broader array of resources to those patients with highly comorbid social and psychiatric needs.</p><p>The finding that participants with higher lifetime alcohol use severity were less likely to use the ED overall seems counterintuitive, yet among this group that used the ED, their ED visit was significantly more likely to result in hospitalization. This complements national-level findings that alcohol-related ED visits are four times more likely to result in hospitalization compared to non-alcohol-related ED visits. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Shults1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> Overall, 23% of all ED visits in this study resulted in hospital admission, a rate almost double that of the general U.S. emergency patient population. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Niska1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> In fact, it is a rate comparable to that reported in studies of frequent ED users with 6&#x02013;20 annual visits. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Ruger1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> The decision to admit any patient from the ED to the hospital is certainly multi-factorial and may be based as much on availability of hospital- or community-based resources as on medical acuity. The significantly high rates of hospital admission in this cohort, however, attest to the great social, psychiatric, and medical needs of this patient population resulting in high demands placed on healthcare systems.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study is a comprehensive assessment of ED use by released prisoners with HIV but represents the lower limits of ED use. All participants were on ART and two-thirds were receiving an intensive adherence intervention with DAART. Generalizability is limited by the relatively small population size and by the nature of participants&#x02019; involvement in the RCT which provided increased attention and oversight. Although participants were concurrently enrolled in a RCT that included transitional case management, case management has not been shown to significantly affect rates of ED or urgent care clinic utilization in other studies of released prisoners with HIV. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Wohl2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> Participants may have used EDs outside of these two urban centers, and we may therefore have inadvertently missed visits by more geographically and socially transient patients; however, previous studies on ED use in Connecticut <xref rid="pone.0042416-Pollack1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> suggest that our data are likely to account for the overwhelming majority of ED visits. Subjects re-incarcerated during the study period may have experienced relatively restricted ED utilization, reflective of either decreased active drug use or provision of onsite primary care in a correctional setting. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Stephenson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Baillargeon3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042416-Springer5" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> Data from Texas, however, suggests that just 20% of released prisoners with HIV are re-incarcerated within three years. <xref rid="pone.0042416-Baillargeon3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> Baseline assessments of subjects reflect a single time point and may not reflect variations in status over the 12 months of observation. These assessments are what is known as a person transitions to the community and may provide guidance <italic>a priori</italic> for interventions that might reduce ED use after prison release. In addition, we did not have access to information about participants&#x02019; concurrent use of primary care, which may have confounded ED use. Last, this study lacks a control group; application of these findings to HIV-uninfected released prisoners or to other geographic regions where drug use patterns of or available support services for released prisoners differ must be interpreted with caution.</p><p>In spite of these limitations, this study has several important strengths in its design. Subjects&#x02019; healthcare use was followed for up to one year after prison release regardless of attrition in the parent study. This allowed us to track individuals in the community for whom the only point of contact with the healthcare system was the ED. Second, much of the health services literature relies on self-reported ED use, which may be skewed by social desirability or recall biases. In a population of released prisoners, there is often a prevailing mistrust of the healthcare system that makes self-report of healthcare utilization even less reliable. In contrast, our study objectively and comprehensively measured ED utilization based on medical chart review at all major EDs in the two urban centers of interest. Future research on this topic should include a control group of HIV-infected released prisoners receiving no intervention to better distinguish the impact of case management and adherence support on healthcare utilization patterns. From a health services perspective, future studies might explore ED use by including PLWHA who do not interface with the criminal justice system or people recently released from prison but not infected with HIV. We would exercise caution about interpreting such a study, however, because of the specific healthcare needs of PLWHA, the public health implications for retaining people in HIV care and on ART, and the unique destabilizing period that occurs during transition from prisons to communities.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study of healthcare utilization by PLWHA prescribed ART and recently released from prison, ED use was highly correlated with mental illness, active substance use and extremes of housing stability, but not with HIV-related medical illness. These co-morbid illness and social factors should be addressed by future interventions because, as illustrated by the ED visits described here, substantial need exists.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0042416-Josephs1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
