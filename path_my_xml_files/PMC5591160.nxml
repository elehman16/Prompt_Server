In fact, when ART is started in recent HIV infection, CD4 T cells are recovered to normal levels and HIV-associated inflammation is minimized.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>Shortly following infection with HIV, the virus rapidly replicates in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and within a few weeks, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in these tissues is depleted.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population of non-GALT lymphoid tissues remains largely intact.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> This cellular depletion in the gut during recent infection specifically occurs to CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, which selectively express CCR5<sup>+</sup> (usually activated memory and effector cells).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> These events may not be a coincidence given that most new infections are with HIV populations that use the CCR5 coreceptor. These observations have led to the theory that in regards to HIV pathogenesis, &#x0201c;the die is cast&#x0201d; in primary HIV infection,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> and perhaps the benefits observed in studies initiating ART during primary infection are the mitigation of these early events.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> The vast majority of patients with primary HIV-1 infection are infected with CCR5 tropic virus.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> We hypothesized that early CCR5 blockage with a CCR5-containing ART regimen may provide immunologic and clinical benefit. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of maraviroc (MVC), an antiretroviral medication that inhibits HIV cellular entry through the CCR5 coreceptor, intensification to a standard of care (SOC) antiretroviral regimen on proportions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets in persons starting ART in early (&#x0003c;3 months from estimated date of infection [EDI]) HIV infection.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Population and design</title><p>This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1:1 randomized clinical trial comparing SOC ART (atazanavir, ritonavir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine) with SOC ART plus MVC. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee. The protocol for this study (ViiV-a-la-GALT) was reviewed and approved by the University of California San Diego Human Research Protections Program. The full trial protocol can be accessed by contacting the corresponding author.</p><p>We recruited 20 acute or very early HIV infected persons aged &#x02265;18 years from August 2010 to March 2014 (when we reached our target enrollment number) in San Diego, CA, at the University of California San Diego's AntiViral Research Center. The primary eligibility criteria included persons in acute or early HIV infection using nucleic acid and detuned HIV-1 testing as previously described<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> who did not demonstrate genotypic resistance to the study drug regimens. Prior to study launch, the study statistician generated the randomization schedule and this was provided to the study pharmacist who provided all study drugs. Each participant received their individual medication based on their randomization scheduled. This procedure is the standard used in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group. This procedure allows blinding of study participants, coordinators, investigators, and those performing data entry. Following randomization, study participants initiated SOC ART&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;once-daily placebo or SOC ART&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;once-daily MVC within 16 days of screening and were followed longitudinally at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 and as needed. There were no changes to methods after trial commencement.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Study procedures</title><p>At study screening and before the initiation of ART, participants underwent a study entry evaluation (including past medical history), physical and laboratory assessments (including HIV viral loads [COBAS, Roche, Indianapolis, IN]), CD4<sup>+</sup> counts, HIV-1 drug resistance testing by <italic>pol</italic> genotype (Genosense, Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA), and coreceptor usage (Trofile, Monogram Biosciences). Whole blood was then drawn from study participants at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from plasma using gradient centrifugation. Isolated PBMCs were washed and aliquoted into tubes of 1 million PBMCs/200&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L staining buffer prior to incubation with conjugated antibodies (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ): CD3 (APC-Cy7), CD4 (PerCP), CD8 (Pac-Blue), CD45RO (PE), CD27 (APC), CCR5 (FITC), CCR7 (PE-Cy7), CD38 (PE-Cy7), and HLA-DR (FITC). Conjugated antibodies to intracellular Ki67 (FITC) were used with fixation and permeability buffers (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for intracellular staining assays per manufacturer instructions. Lymphocyte subsets were measured on a BD FACSCanto II instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and data analyzed with FlowJo software. One investigator implemented the gating strategy to ensure a consistent gating approach. For our primary outcome, CCR5 expression gating was set at the border of CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> cells that were not expected to express much (if any CCR5). An example of flow cytometry gating is provided in Supplemental Figure 1. Percentages were analyzed based on CD4 and CD8 T-cell lineages. Viral loads (Roche) were measured in collected blood plasma.</p><p>A proportion of study participants also underwent quantification of HIV DNA using digital droplet polymerase chain reaction as previously described.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of this study was the difference from baseline to week 48 in the proportion of CCR5<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells.

This power calculation is based on the estimate of the standard deviation of the proportion of CCR5<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> memory cells at 48 weeks after start of therapy of 0.08.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were by original assigned groups. All statistical analyses were 2-sided and performed with a significance level of 0.05. Baseline demographic and medical characteristics were compared between arms using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher exact test for numeric and categorical predictors, respectively. Changes in primary and log-odds transformed secondary outcomes were calculated as differences in outcome values from baseline to weeks 12, 24, and 48 separately, where negative difference indicates decrease in values. Changes in primary outcome (CCR5<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>) were compared with the 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test (assumptions for parametric analyses were checked). Because group differences were found in levels of baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the primary analyses were followed by analysis of covariance to compare the primary outcome between arms while controlling for this covariate. Wilcoxon rank-sum procedure was used in analysis of the secondary outcomes. Although differences in log-odds of the secondary outcomes were used for the analyses per study protocol and the reported <italic>P</italic> values are from those analyses, the section Results reports median differences in untransformed values rather than log-odds transformations for ease of interpretation. Multivariate analyses were not pursued given the lack of significant results in univariate analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Description of study participants</title><p>Of the 20 persons enrolled (10 enrolled to intervention and 10 to placebo), 1 was lost to follow-up (moved from San Diego) and was not included in analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

In this study, rectal tissues were also sampled and showed increases in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that the peripheral findings were not due to altered trafficking into effector sites. The authors hypothesized that observed increases in activated T cells may be due to increases in plasma CCR5 ligands that result from MVC blockage of the CCR5 receptor.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>In summary, our study evaluated MVC intensification in persons initiating ART within 3 months of EDI. While all participants experienced increases in circulating memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, there were no significant differences between those who received MVC and those who did not. At most, MVC intensification of SOC ART led to weak trends of higher increases in na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and slower declines in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and decreases in senescent memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This could have been related to differences in viral decay kinetics, but we did not observe differences in HIV viral load changes between arms. Limitations of our study include a limited number of study participants, lack of evaluations of gastrointestinal mucosa, the performance of multiple tests without a multiple comparison correction, and baseline group difference even with a randomized trial design. Additionally, performance of plasma CCR5 ligands in this population was beyond the scope of the study. Despite a few trends, there is no evidence to suggest that intensification of standard ART with MVC during acute HIV alters T-cell dynamics significantly in the peripheral blood. This suggests that diagnosis of early HIV and timing of ART may have greater clinical significance than the ART regimen used.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Many thanks to our study participants and additional study-associated staff including Tari Gilbert, Celsa Spina, Neal Sekiya, Dina Sirypango, and DeeDee Pacheco without whom none of this work could have been completed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-95-e5315-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e874" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AEH = acute and early HIV, ART = antiretroviral therapy, EDI = estimated date of infection, GALT = gut-associated lymphoid tissue, MVC = maraviroc, SOC = standard of care.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This publication was funded by the institution from ViiV Healthcare.
