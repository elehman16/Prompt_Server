Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), thereby augmenting antitumor immune responses. After decades in which a number of clinical trials were conducted, ipilimumab was the first therapy to improve overall survival in a randomized, controlled phase III trial of patients with advanced melanoma. These results led to the regulatory approval of ipilimumab at 3&#x000a0;mg/kg for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. More than 17,000 patients worldwide have received ipilimumab, either as a commercial drug at 3&#x000a0;mg/kg or in clinical trials and expanded access programs at different doses. Consistent with its proposed mechanism of action, the most common toxicities associated with ipilimumab therapy are inflammatory in nature. These immune-related adverse events were mostly reversible when effective treatment guidelines were followed. Importantly, long-term follow-up of patients who received ipilimumab in a phase III trial showed that 24% survived at least two years, and in phase II studies, a proportion of patients survived at least five years. Evaluation of ipilimumab is ongoing in the adjuvant setting for melanoma, and for advanced disease in nonsmall cell lung, small cell lung, prostate, ovarian, and gastric cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4</kwd><kwd>immuno-oncology</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>ipilimumab</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibody</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Melanoma is less common than other types of skin cancer, yet it is an aggressive disease that accounts for approximately 75% of deaths due to skin cancer.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The incidence of melanoma has increased substantially over the last three decades, with an estimated 8,700 melanoma-related deaths in the United States in 2010<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and estimates of 9,480 deaths in 2013.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IV) have a particularly poor long-term prognosis, with approximately 75% surviving less than one year and an overall 5-year mortality rate of 90%.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Until recently, median overall survival (OS) for patients with advanced melanoma was approximately eight months with traditional therapies<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and typically less for patients with brain metastases.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Traditional treatment options for patients with advanced melanoma include surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and/or systemic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy or interleukin-2 (IL-2)&#x02013;based immunotherapy).<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Since its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1975, the chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine (DTIC) has been the most widely used single agent for the treatment of advanced melanoma.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Response rates with DTIC (or its oral analogue, temozolomide) range from 5% to 12% in recent clinical trials, but responses are generally transient.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The chemotherapeutic agent fotemustine produces improved response, but not OS, rates over DTIC.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> IL-2, which is also approved in the United States for metastatic melanoma, can produce durable tumor responses in 5&#x02013;10% of patients who may be cured of their disease.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Biochemotherapy regimens with chemotherapy and traditional immunotherapies (IL-2 and interferon alpha (IFN-&#x003b1;)) have been extensively evaluated, but increased response rates using these regimens have not translated into improved OS.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In fact, prior to 2011, no agent approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma had been shown to improve the OS in a randomized, controlled phase III trial.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Progress in the treatment of advanced melanoma was based on fundamental discoveries in immunology, and specifically the identification of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) as a negative signaling molecule in activated T cells.

Following activation, T cells upregulate and translocate CTLA-4 receptor molecules to the surface, which bind B7 with a higher avidity than CD28.

Study CA184-022 was a dose-ranging trial in patients that had been previously treated or were intolerant to prior therapy. The OS was a secondary endpoint in each of these studies. Another trial (CA184-004) was an exploratory biomarker study with ipilimumab in treatment-naive and previously treated patients. In all studies, ipilimumab was given intravenously every 3 weeks for four doses (induction), and eligible patients could receive maintenance therapy every 12 weeks beginning at week 24.</p><p>Two key lessons were derived from the outcomes of these phase II studies. First, they identified immune-related AEs (irAEs) as the most common toxicities associated with ipilimumab treatment, which were confirmed by histopathology as inflammatory in nature. The irAEs were shown to be reversible in most cases following adherence to treatment guidelines developed during the phase II studies (see below). Second, these studies documented the unique kinetics of response to ipilimumab, where some patients showed responses after apparent disease progression, possibly reflecting the time required to establish antitumor immunity. Objective responses were sometimes observed 6&#x02013;12 months after the initiation of treatment. Prolonged stable disease (&#x02265;1 year) likely reflected an additional characteristic of ipilimumab efficacy. Furthermore, it was shown that these response kinetics may translate into a delayed separation of survival curves, a previously described feature of immunotherapy needing special consideration for phase III studies.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Thus, it was recognized that the OS was a superior endpoint to capture the clinical activity of ipilimumab, and the primary endpoint for both phase III trials was changed to OS (prior to unblinding). Finally, biomarker analyses confirmed that ipilimumab treatment increases activated and memory T cell populations,<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> consistent with its proposed mechanism of action.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Phase III trials of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma</title><p>The phase III trial, MDX010-20,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> began in 2003 with ipilimumab treatment at 3&#x000a0;mg/kg based on evidence of safety and activity in early clinical trials.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Previously treated patients who received ipilimumab, with or without gp100 as an active control, had significantly improved OS compared with those who received gp100 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A near doubling of 1- and 2-year survival rates with ipilimumab compared to gp100 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Importantly, clinical outcome was independent of the stage at presentation (M0, M1a, and M1b vs. M1c) and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, both of which are important prognostic factors for melanoma, as well as age (&#x0003c;65 vs. &#x02265;65 years). Prior treatment with IL-2 also did not preclude a response to ipilimumab. The frequency of irAEs was approximately 60% in patients who received ipilimumab, with 10&#x02013;15% having melanoma of grade 3 or 4.

The successful development of a novel immunotherapeutic agent such as ipilimumab required close collaboration between the sponsoring pharmaceutical companies and the clinical trial investigators to better understand its unique mechanism of action, identify patterns of response, and to develop guidelines to manage its unique toxicities. Important research continues with ipilimumab, including evaluation of ipilimumab in combination with other therapies (such as anti-PD-1) to potentially increase the numbers of patients that experience clinical benefit. Ongoing phase III trials will determine if the activity of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma extends to earlier stages of disease and to other tumor types. Ipilimumab has supported the development of the immuno-oncology discipline, and CTLA-4 will hopefully be the first of many targets to be successfully exploited to fight cancer in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all of the clinical trial investigators and their teams throughout the world for their contributions to the development of ipilimumab, and the thousands of patients that participated in the clinical trials.
