The number is expected to reach 552 million by 2030, representing 9.9% of the adult population. Diabetes is associated with various short and long-term complications, many of which, if left untreated, can be fatal. All these also have the potential to reduce the quality of life of people with diabetes and their families. The most common long-term complications affect the heart, eyes, kidneys, and feet.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Foot infections in persons with diabetes are a common and complex.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition to causing severe morbidities, they now account for the largest number of diabetes-related hospital bed-days[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and are the most common proximate, nontraumatic cause of amputations.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Diabetic foot infections require careful attention and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Ayurveda has its own principles, but it is incorporating new theories and drugs in it and is presenting them according to its principles.

After treating with <italic>Katupila</italic>, pain sensation regained by 7<sup>th</sup> day due to neo-vascularization and restored pain sensation in nerve fibers. The statistically insignificant result in pain relief was seen due to the restoration of pain sensation by correcting neuropathy.

The infection at the wound site was assessed on the basis of odor, exudate level, local temperature, and swelling in both the groups. In Group A, signs of infections relieved 61% by the 7<sup>th</sup> day and totally relieved at the end of 28<sup>th</sup> day. Local application of <italic>Katupila</italic> reduces the discharge, swelling, pain by controlling the bacterial load, so wound became <italic>Shuddha</italic> (clean or healthy).
