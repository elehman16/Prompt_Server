The main reason for this is suggested to be late diagnosis at advanced cancer stages. Cancer diagnostic work-up begins in general practice in 85% of all cancer cases. Thus, general practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the diagnostic process. The latest Danish Cancer Plan included continuing medical education (CME) on early cancer diagnosis in general practice to improve early diagnosis. This dual aims of this protocol are, first, to describe the conceptualisation, operationalisation and implementation of the CME and, second, to describe the study design and outcomes chosen to evaluate the effects of the CME.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The intervention is a CME in early cancer diagnosis targeting individual GPs. It was developed by a step-wise approach. Barriers for early cancer diagnosis at GP level were identified systematically and analysed using the behaviour system involving capability, opportunity and motivation described by Michie et al. The study will be designed as a geographical cluster randomised stepped wedge study. The study population counts 836 GPs from 417 general practices in the Central Denmark Region, geographically divided into eight clusters. GPs from each cluster will be invited to a CME meeting at a certain date three weeks apart. The primary outcomes will be primary care interval and GP referral rate on cancer suspicion. Data will be obtained from national registries, GP-completed forms on patients referred to cancer fast-track pathways and GP-completed online questionnaires before and after the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this will be the first study to measure the effect of a theory-based CME in early cancer diagnosis at three levels: GP knowledge and attitude, GP activity and patient outcomes. The achieved knowledge will contribute to the understanding of whether and how general practice&#x02019;s ability to perform cancer diagnosis may be improved.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Registered as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02069470">NCT02069470</ext-link> on ClinicalTrials.gov.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13012-014-0159-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Denmark</kwd><kwd>General Practice</kwd><kwd>Continuing Medical Education</kwd><kwd>Diagnosis</kwd><kwd>Early Detection of Cancer</kwd><kwd>Barriers</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Denmark lags behind many European countries in cancer survival. It has been suggested that late diagnosis and more advanced cancer stage at treatment lie at the root of this problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In order to minimise the time from referral to diagnosis, some countries have implemented fast-track pathways for cancer, e.g. the 2-week wait in the United Kingdom and the cancer pathways in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Such organisational initiatives are largely dependent on the prevailing referral patterns in general practice. Selecting patients for referral for suspected cancer is a complex procedure which is influenced by 1) the general practitioner&#x02019;s (GP&#x02019;s) personal characteristics such as knowledge, skills, clinical judgement, risk-taking disposition and attitude; 2) organisational factors such as access to tests and investigations; and 3) patient-related factors such as expectations, symptom presentation and communication-style preferences. It is by no means a straightforward task to set the bar for referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Over-investigation has clinical and financial consequences, whereas under-investigation may delay diagnosis and have medico-legal implications.</p><p>The key role of general practice in earlier cancer diagnosis is indisputable; 85% of Danish cancer patients presented symptoms to general practitioners on their route to diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Previous studies have found that cancer patients had an increased number of visits to general practitioners 6 months prior to diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and that 25% of all cancer patients had a primary care interval of more than 20 days until referral according to the GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, there seems to be a potential for earlier referral and possibly also for earlier diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, as the average Danish GP sees only eight to ten new cancer patients per year, cancer is a relatively rare disease in primary care. Half of the diagnosed cancer patients are known to present with what the GPs report as alarm symptoms, while the other half tend to present with non-specific or vague symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. When patients present cancer-related symptoms to general practitioners, their probability of having cancer is low because even alarm symptoms of cancer have low positive predictive values (PPVs; below 5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Yet, the proportion of cancer patients among patients referred to cancer fast-track pathways is high (PPVs of 10%&#x02013;30%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which implies that the GPs may somehow introduce a higher threshold for referral.</p><p>To improve cancer diagnostics in Denmark, the latest Danish Cancer Plan included continuing medical education (CME) targeting GPs as a key strategy to optimise cancer symptom recognition among GPs and to facilitate referral to fast-track pathways. The CME initiative provided an important opportunity to measure if and how targeted CME may influence the participating GPs&#x02019; knowledge, attitude and activity in the context of referral for cancer suspicion.</p><p>The primary aim of this article is to describe the conceptualisation, operationalisation and implementation of CME to enhance cancer diagnostics in primary care. A second aim is to describe the study design and outcomes chosen to evaluate the effects of the CME.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The CME intervention</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p>The study was performed in one of the five Danish Regions (Central Denmark Region) which has 1.27 million inhabitants and 417 GP clinics with 836 GPs. In Denmark, GPs own their private clinics and are on a contract with the Danish Regions on a central, negotiated scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Part of this scheme includes remuneration for participation in CME. As a first line in the Danish healthcare system, the GPs provide free access to medical advice and act as gatekeepers to hospital and private specialists. Each citizen (99%) is listed with a specific general practice clinic.</p><p>The regional CME on early cancer diagnosis was initiated by a team comprising researchers, a regional academic coordinator, hospital-GP liaison advisors, a CME supervisor and three leading hospital consultants. A working group was established to operationalise the CME. This group counted four academic GPs of whom two were hospital-GP liaison advisors, one CME supervisor and one researcher (BST). A research group (the authors) identified the barriers as described below. The Danish government funded the CME.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Identification of barriers at GP level for early cancer diagnosis</title><p>The key aim of the CME was to optimise cancer-related referral from general practice clinic to hospital in an attempt to identify underlying cancers at an earlier and more amenable stage. The target for the intervention was the individual GP, and the CME was developed in a stepwise manner as described by Grol et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Initially, the research group identified barriers at the GP level for early referral using a number of methods: input from research literature, brainstorm among the four GPs in the working group, individual GP interviews made by the first author (BST), a focus group interview with six GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], experiences from audit of lung cancer diagnosis in general practice in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and Danish GPs&#x02019; responses to the Module 3 International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The barriers identified through this process were shared with the members of the working group, and they were included in the CME if considered both important and possible to change (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>
<bold>The process of identifying the important barriers to be included in the CME program.</bold>
</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2014_159_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>One barrier was &#x0201c;Insufficient GP knowledge about the positive predictive values (PPV) of cancer symptoms&#x0201d;. This barrier signifies that GPs have not acquired full knowledge of the PPVs based on primary care populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It was hypothesised that this could prevent GPs from knowing what would be the PPV upon referral of patients to the fast-track cancer pathway (below 10%). Another barrier was &#x0201c;Lack of recognition of the &#x02018;low-risk-but-not-no-risk&#x02019; symptoms&#x0201d;. This barrier reveals the absence of awareness of non-specific, vague symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. &#x0201c;Lack of knowledge on benefits of early diagnosis&#x0201d; suggests an insufficient understanding of the fact that 2&#x02013;4 weeks&#x02019; delay in diagnosis may cause stage progression for some cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and that waiting time in general can have an impact on prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Another important issue, &#x0201c;false reassurance from a normal test and other pitfalls&#x0201d;, covers the fact that GPs felt reassurance when an ordered test turned out normal or was used on mistaken indications. This reassurance could arise because of the false negative nature of the results (e.g. chest x-ray missing 15-20% of lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]) or because a negative test result was used to exclude a cancer diagnosis (e.g. normal blood counts). Awareness of typical pitfalls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] in early cancer diagnosis was thus considered important to the GP&#x02019;s choice and interpretation of a test.</p><p>&#x0201c;High risk-taking&#x0201d; indicates the existence of a high GP referral threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The threshold is considered to be too high since the observed proportion of cancer patients in Danish fast-track pathways (typically 10-30%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] is higher than the PPVs of alarm symptoms. &#x0201c;Low use of fast-track pathway referral for cancer suspicion&#x0201d; indicates that in some situations GPs refer patient to an ordinary hospital investigation rather than to the more optimal cancer fast-track pathway. This could be explained by an incomplete implementation or a concern for overuse of the fast-track referral option. &#x0201c;Inadequate experience with online cancer guidelines&#x0201d; indicates a need for more experience in the use of the regional website for referral. It was hypothesised that such a website would heighten the GPs&#x02019; knowledge about referral criteria and receiving departments and that the presence of this website would allow the GPs an opportunity to better inform the patient about the investigation and overall reduce time spent. &#x0201c;Difficulties in communicating cancer risk&#x0201d; concealed an uncertainty in how to communicate risk to a patient. This item was evaluated as important since, opposite ordinary referral, referral to a fast-track pathway required that the GP informed the patient about their suspicion of cancer. Thus, some GPs did not refer patients to cancer fast-track investigation as they did not want to worry the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Addressing the identified barriers and developing the CME elements</title><p>According to the theoretical frame described by Michie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], any changes in the GP&#x02019;s clinical behaviour (B) will be governed by their psychological and physical capability (C), social opportunity (O) and motivation (M) to change. Using this COM-B-model, the identified barriers were analysed, and the elements of the CME were subsequently developed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The cognitive part of the CME would increase the GP&#x02019;s knowledge about the PPVs of cancer symptoms and increase his or her awareness of the identified pitfalls in cancer diagnosis. This was believed to lead the GP to perform a more correct cancer risk assessment and thereby optimise referral procedures. The CME would point out that referral-delay could worsen the prognosis to dispel the myth that cancer develops over several years and that another month therefore would not change the prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>The physical capability covers the skills necessary to perform concrete manoeuvres. The CME reintroduced how to access the regional website and shortly described the contents and search tool. Furthermore, the communication skills about cancer were addressed through case-based discussion on how and when to inform a patient about cancer risk.</p><p>The GPs&#x02019; physical opportunity to refer patients suspected of having cancer exists through the already established fast-track pathways and existing guidelines. The CME included no intervention in this area. The social opportunity was indirectly addressed by including a local opinion leader and a local hospital consultant in the team of lecturers to emphasise that a change of attitude towards lowering the referral threshold is widely recommended.</p><p>Motivation includes the reflective processes involving evaluation. Risk taking was addressed through case-based discussion and by raising questions about what it implies to be a competent GP. Motivation also comprised automatic processes involving emotions and impulses arising from associative learning. To address these processes, the CME included an educational film developed to illustrate a GP&#x02019;s handling of a patient with a complex medical history. By identifying with the GP actor and by subsequently discussing his struggle and lack of readiness to do the definitive investigation, it was intended that the GPs would store this experience in their mind for later pattern recognition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Form of CME</title><p>The CME took place as a 3-hour session. According to the available evidence, the teaching approach was multifaceted, partly didactic, but mostly interactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The key points were first explained and illustrated by an oral presentation, next they were discussed in a reflective debate based on two clinical patient scenarios and one educational film to create a scenario similar to that encountered in clinical practice and decision-making. Hands-on models of tumours were placed in the lecture room. PPV diagrams on lung, colorectal, ovarian and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] were printed in hard copy as a clinical tool. Furthermore, leaflets for specific fast-track pathway to support communication about risk of cancer were offered in a plastic retainer, also to bring home to the clinic.

The vignettes were validated and tested in the ICBP module-3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. They were developed to describe the likely GP actions which included GP readiness to refer when a patient presented with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer (two vignettes), colorectal cancer (two vignettes) or ovarian cancer (one vignette). GPs were asked to complete two randomly chosen vignettes.

The first version of the questionnaire was developed by the authors and academic GPs in an iterative process that focused on the specific elements for CME intervention.

Patients referred to fast track were also identified in a regional database (PAS) and in a radiological database (breast cancer). If the GP form was missing, the GP was sent a form for the particular patient and kindly requested to complete it.

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>The CPR number and the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS)</td><td>In Denmark (and other Nordic countries), researchers have exceptional opportunities to perform register-based research because every person with a permanent residence in Denmark has a unique personal identification number. At birth or immigration, all citizens in Denmark are allocated a personal ten-digit identification number, the CPR number. This number is registered in the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) and allows linkage between all national registries at the individual level. The CRS contains information about vital status (dead or alive) and residence.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>The Primary Care Referral Registry</td><td>An online shared database with all electronic referral letters sent from general practice clinics to hospitals. Contains information about sender, receiver and patient including anamnesis. We will develop an algorithm to identify patients referred for cancer investigation.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>The Danish National Patient Registry(NPR) comprises The Patient Administrative System (PAS)</td><td>The NPR is a national database unifying information from the five regional Patient Administrative System (PAS). The NPR is run by the National Board of Health who carries out ongoing validation of the data from PAS. Both the NPR and PAS are continuously updated. They comprise variables like the patient CPR number, dates of admission and discharge, diagnoses classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (Comorbidity), codes for undertaken procedures, the GP&#x02019;s provider number and different additional codes. Of particular relevance for this study, we identified patients referred to fast-track cancer pathways by the additional code DZO31 in PAS every second week.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>List of patients referred to fast-track pathway for breast cancer from four radiological departments</td><td>Since patients referred to the fast-track pathway for breast cancer are not registered with a DZO31 code, like other investigations in fast-track pathways, an additional data list was periodically received from the four radiological departments in Central Denmark Region.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>The Danish Cancer Registry (DCR)</td><td>The DCR has been recording primary cases of cancer on a nationwide basis since 1943 and has been shown to be accurate and to have a nearly complete registration of cancer cases. The files of the DCR provide information on cancer type, site morphology and history of cancer. Tumours in the registry are coded according to the ICD-10 (seventh revision before 2004), which includes a four-digit code for tumour morphology. If a person develops more than one primary tumour, each tumour is generally registered and counted as an individual record. We used the DCR to find prior and incident cancer diagnoses among referred patients and to obtain information on date of diagnosis and tumour stage.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Danish National Health Service Registry (NHSR)</td><td>The NHSR for primary care is a national register of all health professionals contracted with the tax-funded health-care system, e.g. GPs. The register is run by the National Board of Health, and its data are based on the health professionals&#x02019; invoices to the regional health administrations. Among others, the NHSR holds information on name and addresses of every provider number. A provider number may refer to several providers if, for example, several GPs form a medical practice partnership.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Patient list</td><td>List of patients connected to each provider number. The list contains information on patients&#x02019; CPR number, including age and sex.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>The provider number and the Provider Number Registry</td><td>Every health professional contracted with the tax-funded health-care system has a provider number. The provider number system is used to control the supply of GPs and, to a certain extent, to control expenditures. GPs are allowed to sell or share their provider number and office facilities. GPs can choose to work in solo practices or in group practices (in the latter case, the GPs can share a provider number or have one provider number per GP). Danish citizens are free to choose their own GP unless the GP list is closed (GPs are allowed to close their lists when the number of persons on the list reaches 1,600 persons). The list system enables the GP to develop a better knowledge of the individual patient which ensures continuity of care. The Provider Number Registry contains information on the name and addresses of every health professional with a provider number.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Statistics Denmark</td><td>As a central authority, Statistics Denmark is responsible for collecting, processing and publishing statistical information and for making statistical analyses and prognoses. Researchers can apply for data from Statistics Denmark for further analysis. We will use data from the Integrated Database for Labour Market Research which is owned by Statistics Denmark to calculate a deprivation score for each GP&#x02019;s practice population. This Danish deprivation index (DADI) has eight variables that are scored individually and sum up to a score between 10 and 100; the higher the number, the greater the extent of deprivation in the practice population. The variables used are (i) proportion of adults aged 20&#x02013;59 with no employment, (ii) proportion of adults aged 25&#x02013;59 with no professional education, (iii) proportion of adults aged 25&#x02013;59 with low income, (iv) proportion of adults aged 18&#x02013;59 receiving public welfare payments (transfer income or social benefits), (v) proportion of children from parents with no education and no professional skills, (vi) proportion of immigrants, (vii) proportion of adults aged 30+ living alone and (viii) proportion of adults aged 70+ with low income (= the lowest national quartile).</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For the descriptive part, differences will be tested using appropriate parametric and nonparametric statistics. The effect of the intervention will be analysed in a generalised, linear, random-effects model with random effect of GPs. The data will be used to assess whether further modelling of inter-correlation within practice and within clusters is required, and whether the intervention effects are equal for all GPs or in random interaction with them. Analyses will be performed both in the full GP population &#x0201c;intention to intervene&#x0201d; (cluster level) and in the three GP subgroups: 1) GPs who participated in the CME, 2) GPs who did not participate in the CME, but had at least one colleague who participated, and 3) GPs who did not participate in the CME and who had no colleagues who participated. A colleague is defined as a GP with the same clinic address as the respondent.

With an assumed PPV for diagnosing cancer in fast-track pathway on 20% and an assumed GP response rate on 70%, we expect to receive one-page forms with information on primary care intervals on 7,700 patients.

The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (j.no. 2009-41-3471). The Danish National Board of Health gave legal permission to obtain information from the GPs&#x02019; medical records without permission from the patients (j.no. 3-3013-149/1/HKR). The regional Data Protection Agency gave permission to use the regional database (PAS) and the radiological database to obtain information on patients investigated in a cancer fast-track pathway (j.no. 1-16-02-262-12).

We identified key elements and analysed them by using the COM-B system described by Michie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The effect evaluation will be conducted in a geographical cluster randomised stepped wedge study. The effect of the CME will be measured at three levels: GP knowledge and attitude, GP activity and patient outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>With a detailed description of the CME elements, training process and context, we have tried to optimise the possibilities for an adaptation/replication in other settings.</p><p>The time frame of the present study did not afford us with the possibility to conduct an explorative study on the target group before the trial; instead, a full-scale CME was conducted in an external regional cancer steering group, and the findings were subsequently evaluated, discussed and approved.</p><p>Randomising individual GPs to the CME intervention was considered unfeasible as much of the effect would include GPs working together and discussing cancer diagnosis within practices and in the CME groups. Preventing GPs from participation was considered unethical since the CME was a part of the Danish Cancer Plan, and it was considered important that all patients could benefit from an improved clinical practice. A cluster randomised stepped wedge study was thus preferred. Using this design, we will be able to control for time trends by allowing contemporaneous comparisons across clusters at different time periods.</p><p>Designing a study in real life, however, raised some challenges with regard to controlling the intervention. A specific CME date was offered to all GPs, but they were free to decide whether they wanted to participate or not. The collected data will allow us to compare the three GP subgroups of each cluster at a baseline level to explore potential selection bias.</p><p>GP knowledge, attitude and self-assessed readiness to refer will be measured by online questionnaires before and after the CME to allow paired analyses to be performed. The GPs were informed in the invitation letter that the questionnaire attempted to measure activity related to cancer diagnosis in general practice. This could have influenced the responses.</p><p>By placing a pad with forms in each GP office and by sending regular reminders (every second week), we expect to collect prospective data, i.e. to obtain data before the GPs know whether the referred patient had cancer or not. In cases where the GP forgot to complete a form and had to be requested to do so, information bias can occur. Furthermore, lead time bias will be considered when reporting the 1-year survival. This outcome will be evaluated in close relation to potential change in cancer stage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have developed a theory-based CME in early cancer diagnosis.
