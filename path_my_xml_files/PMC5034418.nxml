We investigated the impact of extremes of radiographic data (outliers) and baseline prognostic factors on detection of treatment effects, to provide guidance on future analysis of joint structural data in RA clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data were from two, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib in adult patients with moderate to severe RA: ORAL Scan (NCT00847613) and ORAL Start (NCT01039688). These studies detected significant reductions in radiographic progression with tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg twice daily (BID) plus background methotrexate (ORAL Scan), and with tofacitinib 5 or 10&#x000a0;mg BID as monotherapy (ORAL Start). We evaluated mean changes from baseline in van der Heijde modified total Sharp score (mTSS) at month 6 and month 12, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A trimmed analysis was used to deal with extremes of data. The impact of baseline prognostic factors on radiographic progression was evaluated using ANCOVA to analyze the mean change from baseline in mTSS for each factor in turn.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The analysis included data from 720 patients from ORAL Scan and 880 patients from ORAL Start. Trimmed analyses were unbiased for the true mean estimate and enabled us to remove the effect of influential extreme observations in the data set. Almost all patients had at least one poor prognostic factor at baseline (e.g., high level of disease activity, or positive for rheumatoid factor). The strongest predictor of treatment effect was the severity of radiographic damage at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A trimmed analysis can establish whether any significant inhibition of structural damage is being driven by extremes of data, and should be one of the sensitivity analyses of choice for structural data in RA clinical trials. Furthermore, analysis of radiographic data based on baseline prognostic factors may reveal increased treatment effects. Application of these methods to analysis of radiographic data from clinical trials in patients with RA, allows a more complete interpretation of data.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01039688">NCT00847613</ext-link> (registered 17 February 2009) and NCT01039688 (registered 23 December 2009)</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13075-016-1106-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Modified total Sharp score</kwd><kwd>Missing data</kwd><kwd>Outlier</kwd><kwd>Prognostic factors</kwd><kwd>Radiographic progression</kwd><kwd>Rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>Tofacitinib</kwd><kwd>Sensitivity analyses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004319</institution-id><institution>Pfizer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>During the past decade, radiographic progression rates observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) clinical trials have gradually decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The ethical necessity for the placebo treatment periods of RA trials to be of short duration (typically 12&#x02013;16 weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], has resulted in the use of early-escape trial designs to minimize exposure to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This presents methodological challenges to the demonstration of treatment effect and magnitude of effect, as low rates of radiographic progression in control groups may impact upon the statistical power of such trials to detect a true RA treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, since there is also a requirement for trials of RA therapies to provide long-term efficacy data (&#x02265;1&#x000a0;year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], researchers may have no alternative but to extrapolate efficacy data, including structural efficacy. Such extrapolations tend to result in wider confidence intervals (CIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and increase the likelihood that plots of data over time for the reference and comparator arms will cross, thus making the detection of true treatment differences more difficult.</p><p>From a methodological perspective, increasing the number of patients and/or the inclusion of patients with RA who are at high risk for radiographic progression in clinical trials, may increase the power of a trial to detect true treatment effects. However, as diagnoses of RA may now be made early in the disease course, and as initial treatments become more aggressive, rapid development of erosions is less likely to be seen. Based on the above considerations, it is important to confirm that a treatment effect on radiographic progression in controlled clinical trials &#x02013; such as between-group differences in the change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified total Sharp score (mTSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] &#x02013; represents a robust outcome. Sensitivity analyses can be used to confirm the credibility of clinical trial findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and further explore results of marginal statistical significance, and trends that are not statistically significant.</p><p>In this article, we explore two distinct post hoc methodologies that may enhance the ability to demonstrate a true treatment effect on structural progression in RA clinical trials, including sensitivity to the effects of extremes of data (outliers) using a trimmed analysis approach, and the impact of prognostic factors on the ability to detect a treatment effect.</p><p>We have used two recent phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of RA, as examples for radiographic progression: ORAL Scan (NCT00847613) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and ORAL Start (NCT01039688) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Published results of the ORAL Scan study (conducted in patients receiving background methotrexate [MTX]) showed that tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg twice daily (BID) was effective in reducing radiographic progression versus placebo at month 6 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) in the primary analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Tofacitinib 5&#x000a0;mg BID was associated with numerical improvements in mTSS, although statistical significance was not reached (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0792) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and results observed using rank analysis as a sensitivity measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] were inconsistent. In the ORAL Start study, in which tofacitinib was administered as monotherapy, both tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg BID were associated with statistically significant reductions in radiographic progression versus MTX at month 6 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for both comparisons) in the primary analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which was confirmed by rank analysis. Analyses of the percentage of patients with radiographic progression have previously been published for both studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Here we discuss methodologies applicable to analysis and interpretation of mean changes in mTSS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Designs of the phase 3 ORAL Scan and ORAL Start clinical trials</title><p>Full details of ORAL Scan and ORAL Start, including patient populations, have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Both studies were double-blind, parallel-group trials of 24&#x000a0;months&#x02019; duration, and were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in adult patients (aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) with active moderate to severe RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patients had either an inadequate response to MTX (ORAL Scan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or were MTX-na&#x000ef;ve (ORAL Start) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In ORAL Scan, patients were randomized (4:4:1:1) to tofacitinib 5&#x000a0;mg BID, tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg BID, placebo advanced to tofacitinib 5&#x000a0;mg BID, and placebo advanced to tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg BID. All patients received stable background MTX. Patients randomized to placebo were advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10&#x000a0;mg BID, according to the randomized treatment regimen, at either month 3 (non-responders; did not achieve &#x02265;20&#x000a0;% improvement in swollen and tender joint counts) or month 6 (all other patients). Due to the early-rescue study design, there were no patients receiving placebo beyond month 6.</p><p>In ORAL Start, patients were randomized (2:2:1) to receive tofacitinib as monotherapy (5 or 10&#x000a0;mg BID), or MTX (10&#x000a0;mg/week, titrated up to 20&#x000a0;mg/week by week 8). Patients received their randomized treatment as per protocol (tofacitinib or MTX) throughout their participation in the 24-month study; there was no rescue of inadequate responders in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Radiographic scoring</title><p>Radiographs of both hands and feet were taken at baseline, then at month 3 in non-responders (ORAL Scan only) and at months 6, 12, and month 24 (or end of study). The van der Heijde mTSS was used to assess radiographic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Radiographs were graded by two independent, blinded readers who viewed the entire set of radiographs for a patient in a single reading session (concealed time order). All error (e.g., measurement error) was divided randomly and symmetrically in both tails of the distribution so that the sum of all error could be expected to be zero. Adjudication was performed in the event of any large discrepancy in mTSS between the two independent readers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis of radiographic progression</title><p>The primary efficacy analyses of ORAL Scan and ORAL Start have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The primary efficacy analyses included progression in radiographic scores measured by mean change from baseline in mTSS at month 6, based on the month 12 interim analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The current analysis included radiographic progression data at month 6 and month 12 from the 12-month interim analysis (some values may differ from the final, locked study databases). Both the primary analyses and the current analysis included all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication and who had a baseline measurement and at least one subsequent measurement.</p><p>Radiographic progression, measured by mean change from baseline in mTSS at month 6 and month 12, was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with a least squares (LS) approach to solve values. The ANCOVA model included treatment, geographic location and baseline mTSS value, and duration of RA (for ORAL Start), as covariates. Linear extrapolation was used to impute missing values. Where month 6 data were not available, month 3 data were extrapolated to month 6; month 3 data are not reported here.</p><p>After the publication of ORAL Start [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], one of its study sites (eight patients randomized) was found to be non-compliant with study procedures and those patients have been removed from the efficacy analyses presented here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>To investigate the trimmed analysis approach to deal with extremes of mTSS values, we used data from the primary analyses of mean change from baseline in mTSS at months 6 and 12. Trimmed analysis involved assignment of a percentile rank to data for mean change from baseline in mTSS at months 6 and 12 for each treatment group. A fixed percentage of data points were then removed in equal amounts from the top and bottom ranks of each treatment group (&#x02018;trimming&#x02019;), thus 1&#x000a0;% trimming resulted in deleted observations from &#x0003c;1st percentile and &#x0003e;99th percentile, 2&#x000a0;% of data being deleted in total. ANCOVA was applied to the trimmed data set, with the process subsequently repeated in increments of 1&#x000a0;% up to 10&#x000a0;%, and the analysis for each of the trimmed data sets was compared.</p><p>To investigate whether the presence at baseline of poor prognostic factors for radiographic progression is associated with a higher treatment effect, we performed a post hoc analysis of mTSS data from ORAL Scan and ORAL Start. We selected a number of prognostic factors that are known to predict radiographic progression in RA, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positivity (CCP+), rheumatoid factor positivity (RF+), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, erosion score, and mTSS score at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. ANCOVA was used to analyze the mean change from baseline in mTSS at month 6 and month 12 for each of the subsets for every prognostic factor in turn. An additional analysis of baseline mTSS subsets by categorization according to tertiles (i.e., three subsets, with patients with the highest baseline mTSS values in the top third of the sample at greatest risk of progression) was performed to investigate any &#x02018;dose effect&#x02019; of baseline structural damage on the observable treatment difference.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 720 patients in ORAL Scan and 880 patients in ORAL Start had at least one post-baseline radiograph and were included in the analysis. In ORAL Scan, radiographs from 706 patients were available for analysis at month 6 (tofacitinib 5&#x000a0;mg BID, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;277; tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg BID, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;290; placebo, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;139) and 720 at month 12 (tofacitinib 5&#x000a0;mg BID, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;286; tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg BID, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;295; placebo, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;139). In ORAL Start, radiographs from 875 patients were available for analysis at month 6 (tofacitinib 5&#x000a0;mg BID, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;344; tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg BID, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;367; MTX, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;164) and 879 at month 12 (tofacitinib 5&#x000a0;mg BID, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;343; tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg BID, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;368; MTX, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;168).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Impact of outliers on the ability to detect a treatment effect</title><p>Change from baseline in van der Heijde mTSS is a common measure of progression of joint destruction in patients with RA. Typically, as shown by cumulative probability plots for the distribution for changes from baseline in mTSS at month 6 (primary analysis) in ORAL Scan and ORAL Start, a large proportion of patients have little or no change in mTSS, with fewer patients having larger changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Where changes, either positive or negative, are extreme, this may result from a combination of true effect and measurement errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While such extreme data points have minimal influence on treatment effects, they do contribute to variability (higher standard deviations) and may, therefore, jeopardize statistical comparisons. Indeed, statistical analyses of the mean change from baseline in mTSS using ANCOVA may be influenced by extreme values. Although rank analysis is a commonly used approach to remove the influence of extreme values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], it can reduce sensitivity for detecting differences in mTSS values, particularly when the mean rate of progression is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The effects of extreme values can be investigated by &#x02018;trimming&#x02019; to systematically remove increasing proportions of extreme values from both ends of the mTSS distribution curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Cumulative probability plots showing individual patient changes from baseline in mTSS at month 6. <italic>BID</italic> twice daily, <italic>mTSS</italic> van der Heijde modified total Sharp score, <italic>MTX</italic> methotrexate, <italic>PBO</italic> placebo</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13075_2016_1106_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sensitivity analysis using a trimmed analysis approach</title><p>The cumulative probability plots shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> demonstrate how 1&#x000a0;%, 5&#x000a0;%, and 10&#x000a0;% of trimming of data will lead to different distributions of change from baseline in mTSS.</p><p>In ORAL Scan, untrimmed data at month 6 (equivalent to the primary analysis) and month 12 showed that patients treated with tofacitinib 10&#x000a0;mg BID, but not tofacitinib 5&#x000a0;mg BID, had significantly less radiographic progression from baseline versus placebo (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Table S1 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

However, trimming has been applied in modelling the length of pediatric hospital stay, where explicit values were trimmed, rather that the approach taken here to trim specific percentages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our findings show that trimmed analysis represents a useful means of checking the contribution of extremes of structural data in patients with RA. This approach represents a conceptual bridge between a rank analysis and ANCOVA, and is unbiased for the true mean estimate, while removing the effect of influential observations in any one data set. Indeed, trimmed analysis gives improved insight into the influence of extreme values and should be considered as one of the sensitivity analyses of choice for structural data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Impact of prognostic factors on the ability to detect a treatment effect</title><p>In the absence of radiographic progression in the control group, it is not possible to demonstrate that an effective drug delays structural joint damage, and in such situations, a clinical trial with mean change from baseline in mTSS as the primary outcome will fail.

This finding was as expected, as the majority of patients included in phase 3 RA clinical trials were RF+ and/or CPP+, and had a high level of disease activity. Moreover, a high percentage of patients had two or more poor prognostic factors (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although we considered the possibility that such patients may be less responsive to treatment (i.e., that rapid progression would be a negative predictor of response) in general, the subsets of patients with poor prognostic factors showed more pronounced treatment effects, in terms of change from baseline in mTSS, with tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg BID (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, not all prognostic factors had equal impact. Although RF and CCP seropositivity and CRP level were significant predictors of efficacy and treatment effect, the strongest individual predictors of a treatment effect were baseline mTSS or baseline erosion score. Combining erosion score with CCP and/or RF seropositivity did not attenuate this effect, however combining erosion score with CRP level did appear to increase the predictive effect (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Differences from comparator in mTSS (month 6 and month 12) according to baseline prognostic factors. <sup>a</sup>Median baseline mTSS value was 13.1 for ORAL Scan and 4.0 for ORAL Start.

However, only a few analyses specifically address the effects of baseline prognostic markers on radiographic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We identified several recent studies that investigated the effect of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs on joint structural preservation in patients with RA, although few used baseline radiographic data as a prognostic marker. One such study was C-OPERA, which evaluated radiographic progression in MTX-na&#x000ef;ve patients with early RA who received certolizumab pegol with MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Treatment effect was analyzed according to CCP seropositivity (an inclusion criterion for the study), RF seropositivity, and presence of bone erosions at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Inhibition of radiographic progression was assessed at weeks 24 and 52 using the van der Heijde mTSS. In agreement with the findings of the present analysis, the authors concluded that treatment with certolizumab was more likely to prevent joint damage in patients with higher disease activity at baseline or with early evidence of bone erosions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The C-OPERA study described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] is an example of study population enrichment for individuals at high risk of radiographic progression. While it follows that it may be desirable to enrich study populations for other poor prognostic factors, as defined here and in European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the optimum number of baseline risk factors is open to debate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Demonstration of a reduction in joint structural damage via measurement of radiographic progression in RA is challenging due to the limited duration of placebo control, and a low level of progression observed in the placebo group &#x02013; which patients receive in addition to background therapy &#x02013; and limitations of current analytical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the present analysis, we explored several different methodologies to correct for these effects, taking into consideration the effects of extremes of data, and baseline prognostic factors for radiographic progression. These methodologies are well described in published literature, although infrequently used in previous evaluations of radiographic progression in RA.</p><p>The trimmed analysis approach described here allowed us to visualize the effect of potential outliers, with stable mean values providing assurance of a real treatment effect versus comparators. Furthermore, analysis of high-risk subsets of patients based on known prognostic factors increased the observable treatment difference. If we wish to detect and demonstrate true treatment differences in trials that have a focus on structural preservation in patients with RA, then these factors should be taken into account at the trial design stage.</p><p>In conclusion, using a trimmed analysis approach can establish whether or not significant inhibition of structural damage is driven by extremes of data (outliers), and that analysis of radiographic data based on prognostic factors at baseline may reveal increased treatment effects. Applying these analytic methodologies to the assessment of radiographic progression allows a more complete interpretation of data and verification of radiographic results reported in RA RCTs, which can be difficult to evaluate accurately in current clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13075_2016_1106_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Trimmed analysis of data for mTSS change from baseline at month 6 and month 12 in ORAL Scan and ORAL Start.
