The presence of these psychosocial problems leads to parenting stress. Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) is a parenting support program to support parents with children with BMID and psychosocial problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of SSTP compared to Care as Usual (CAU) in reducing psychosocial problems in children with BMID.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial in the Northern provinces of the Netherlands. Parents of children aged 5 to 12 with borderline (IQ 70 to 85) or mild (IQ 70 to 50) ID and psychosocial problems were invited. Psychosocial problems were identified using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) parent report (&#x02265;14). Measurements were assessed before the intervention (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1) and after a follow-up of six months (T2). SSTP takes 8 to 10 individual sessions of 40-90 minutes, provided over 10 to 12&#x000a0;weeks. CAU concerned any service, except SSTP. Primary outcomes were the child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems (SDQ parent and teacher forms and the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, ECBI).

In the intention to treat analyses, SSTP achieved no significantly better effect than CAU for the SDQ parent report, the ECBI and the APQ on the short- and long- term. In the short term, SSTP was significantly more effective than CAU for the SDQ teacher report (B&#x02009;=&#x02009;-2.25, 95% CI -3.79 to -0.71) and the PSI (B&#x02009;=&#x02009;-7.06, 95% CI -12.11 to -2.01).

Prevalence rates vary widely, from 30% to more than 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The combination of psychosocial problems and BMID is likely to restrict school and social participation and can also limit occupational opportunities in the post-school period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, raising a child with BMID and psychosocial problems is likely to lead to parenting stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems and parenting stress are likely to exacerbate each other over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Improving parenting skills using parenting interventions has been shown to lead to great reductions in both the child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems and the parents&#x02019; parenting stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A promising parenting programme is Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP). SSTP is part of the Australian Triple P, Positive Parenting Programme. This program is a family intervention that aims to prevent and reduce severe behavioral, emotional and developmental problems in children with all kinds of disabilities, including BMID, by enhancing the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although SSTP seems promising, evidence of its effectiveness is very scarce. Results of some studies in Australia showed significant improvements in child behavior and parenting styles in different target populations of pre-school children, children with autism or other developmental disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, a Dutch non-randomized, non-controlled study of SSTP has shown positive effects on psychosocial problems in children, on parenting skills, family functioning and parental wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, these findings have been challenged on the basis of a number of weaknesses. First, the Australian developers were involved in all the effectiveness studies. Second, these studies had small sample sizes or comprised children without BMID. Furthermore, many of these studies did not compare the effects with other interventions offered simultaneously or Care as Usual (CAU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Accordingly, convincing evidence of the effects of individual SSTP in children with BMID and their parents is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the SSTP parenting support program in reducing psychosocial problems in children with BMID compared to CAU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research design</title><p>The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial with three assessments: before the intervention (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1) and six months later (T2), and is reported following the CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Full details of the trial protocol can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen approved the study design. Parents participated voluntarily in this study, having signed to attest their informed consent and were free to leave the study at any time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>We obtained a sample of parents using a two-step process. First, through schools, parents of children 5- to 12-years old with borderline (IQ 70 to 85) or mild (IQ 70 to 50) intellectual disability (ID), living in the four northern provinces of the Netherlands (Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe and a part of Overijssel) were invited to complete a screening measurement (that is, T0) about their child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems and their parenting skills. In the Netherlands, children 5- to 12-years old with BMID mainly attend three types of schools for special educational needs, known in Dutch as SBO, REC3 and REC4. SBO (Speciaal Basis Onderwijs: special primary education) includes children with borderline intellectual disabilities (IQ 70 to 85), learning difficulties and/or behavior difficulties. REC 3 (Regional Expertise Center cluster 3) is a type of school for children with physical disabilities, mild to severe intellectual disabilities (IQ &#x0003c;55 or IQ 56 to 70 with other severe disabilities) and/or chronic diseases. REC 4 (REC cluster 4) serves children with psychiatric and/or behavioral disorders with borderline ID (IQ 70 to 85) or children with psychiatric and/or behavioral disorders without ID (IQ &#x0003e;85) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. All the participating parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) about their child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To increase response rates, schools sent a reminder to all parents who did not respond within four weeks and each school published a newsletter on the study, based on information provided by the researchers.</p><p>In the second step of sampling, eligible parents of children with a clinical Total Difficulties Score (TDS) on the SDQ parent form of 14 or higher were invited by the researcher to participate in the intervention study. If necessary, we offered assistance in completing the screening measurement (T0). Moreover, parents completed the second and third questionnaires during a visit by a research assistant, who was thereby able to provide assistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Exclusion</title><p>At the first step of the sampling process, the screening exclusion criteria were: (1) the child lived in residential care (except foster care); (2) the parents were unable to speak Dutch; (3) information about the child&#x02019;s IQ was not available; or (4) the parents lived outside the research area. At the second step, the intervention selection, the exclusion criteria were: (1) a brother or sister (with a higher SDQ-TDS) was already participating in the study: and (2) the parents were receiving treatment for parenting skills or other treatment that potentially conflicted with SSTP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>SSTP aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents to prevent behavioral, emotional and developmental problems in children with disabilities, including BMID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. SSTP is based on seven key steps to positive parenting: (1) ensure a safe, interesting environment; (2) create a positive learning environment; (3) use assertive discipline; (4) have realistic expectations; (5) take care of oneself as a parent; (6) family adaptation to having a child with a disability; and (7) be part of the community. The last two principles are specific extensions of Triple P for Stepping Stones, targeting the specific problems of raising children with a disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>SSTP requires eight to ten individual sessions of 40 to 90&#x000a0;minutes each, divided over four modules and provided over a period of ten to twelve weeks. The first module, &#x02018;Assessment&#x02019;, consists of two sessions of about 60 to 90&#x000a0;minutes each. In this module, the parents formulate hypotheses about the problems and make relevant causes and factors clear. The second module, &#x02018;Positive Parenting&#x02019;, also consists of two sessions of about 60 to 90&#x000a0;minutes. These sessions introduce parenting strategies to the parents. The third module, &#x02018;Practice&#x02019;, consists of three sessions of about 40 to 60&#x000a0;minutes each. In these sessions, parents practice their newly acquired parenting strategies and receive support. The final module, &#x02018;Planned Activities Training&#x02019;, consists of three sessions of about 60 to 90&#x000a0;minutes. In these sessions, parents are assisted in the practical implementation of the strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In this study, eight SSTP health care professionals delivered SSTP. These professionals were all SSTP accredited, that is, they completed training by an accredited SSTP trainer and an accredited SSTP trainer provided periodic supervision. The professionals worked for a Dutch healthcare organization that specialized in clients with disabilities (Dutch: MEE). These professionals did not provide CAU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Care as Usual</title><p>Parents assigned to the control condition, CAU, could use any service except SSTP. The main types of service used were Practical Pedagogical Family Support (PPG), Video-home training (VHT), Intensive Pedagogical Homecare (IPT) or Intensive Orthopedagogical Family Care (IOG), but individual psychiatric or psychological care for the child was also sought and in some cases no care at all.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes of the study were child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems, measured with the SDQ on the parent and teacher forms and with the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). The SDQ consists of questions on four subscales with five items each: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer relationship problems. Each item can be scored on a 3-point scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;not true, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;somewhat true and 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;certainly true), yielding a TDS ranging from 0 to 40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The ECBI consists of 36 items in which parents rate how often behavior occurs. Each item can be scored on a 7-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;never&#x02019; to 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;always&#x02019;). The sum of these scores yields a sum score on the ECBI ranging from 36 to 252 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary outcomes were parenting practices and stress. Parenting practices were measured using the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ), short version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This consists of 35 items on parenting practices, in four subscales: parental involvement, positive parenting, poor monitoring and inconsistent discipline. Each item can be scored on a 5-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;never&#x02019; to 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;always&#x02019;) which yields a sum score on the APQ ranging from 35 to 175 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Parenting stress was measured using the short Dutch version of the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This questionnaire consists of 25 statements about experiences related to child characteristics, parent characteristics and situations that are directly related to the role of being a parent. Each item can be scored on a 6-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;totally disagree to 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;totally agree) which yield together a sum score on the PSI ranging from 25 to 150 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Background characteristics</title><p>Background characteristics concerned the gender and age of the child, ethnicity (both Dutch or one or both non-Dutch), parental education, parental employment and family composition. Parental education was categorized as: 1) low education: elementary or lower levels of secondary education; 2) middle: higher levels of secondary education or intermediate vocational education; 3) high: higher vocational education and university education. Parental employment was categorized as 1) yes: if at least one parent worked more than 12&#x000a0;hours a week and 2) no: if both parents together worked fewer than 12&#x000a0;hours a week. Family composition was categorized as 1) two biological parents and 2) other: one parent, co-parents, adoption and foster parents.</p><p>The treatment integrity was measured by the number of sessions attended by the parents. SSTP was completed adequately if the family had attended at least five sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size</title><p>The parental SDQ-TDS served as the primary outcome measure for determining the sample size needed. For a three-point decrease in the SDQ-TDS, given a standard deviation (SD) for the SDQ of six points (that is, an effect size of 0.5), at alpha =0.05 (two-sided) and beta =0.20, 63 children needed to be included in each group (SSTP and CAU). With adjustment for an estimated &#x02018;loss to follow-up&#x02019; of 40%, 210 children needed to be included in the study, 105 children in each treatment condition.</p><p>The prevalence rate of SDQ-TDS &#x02265;14 in BMID children not under current treatment for their mental health problems was estimated at 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, (2 &#x000d7; 105)/55% =381 children with BMID, 5- to 12-years old, were required. Accounting for 30% refusal to participate at that step and 10% incomplete SDQs, 635 parents were need to complete the SDQ at the first step of the selection procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomization</title><p>Eligible individuals were randomized per center in each of the four participating centers (Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe and Overijssel) in mixed blocks of four and six to prevent unequal randomization within the centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], using a computer-generated randomization algorithm. If parents were randomized to SSTP, the intervention started within four weeks of administering the screening measurement (T0). In the first part of the study the randomization ratio was 1 to 1. After one year of inclusion, this was adapted to 2 SSTP to 1 CAU because of a relatively high drop-out rate in the SSTP group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Blinding</title><p>Parents were allocated blindly to either SSTP or CAU. Furthermore, the teachers did not know who was participating in which group. The SSTP trainers could not be blinded to the treatment status during the intervention. Last, the research assistant was also not blinded to treatment status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>First, we described the flow of participants &#x02013; parents &#x02013; in a diagram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Second, we described the baseline characteristics of the parents in each research group. The differences between the groups were tested using Pearson Chi-square tests for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables.</p><p>Third, we compared the effectiveness of SSTP with CAU on the primary and secondary outcomes by assessing the effects of SSTP compared to CAU using mixed model techniques. In this analysis, the individual measurements were the first level and the child was the second. The effects on the SSTP group compared to the CAU group were assessed as regression coefficients (B) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in the short term (that is, T0 to T1) and in the long term (that is, T0 to T2) adjusted for age and gender. First, we performed an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, in which all randomized parents were analyzed regardless of whether or not they completed the intervention and any post-treatment questionnaire, with the last observation carried forward. Because of the high dropout rate in the SSTP group, this group was also split into SSTP completed and SSTP not completed for additional analyses.</p><p>Finally, all the parents who completed the screening measurement and at least one post-measurement were included in the complete case analyses. All analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 20.0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ethical permission</title><p>Ethical permission for this study was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen (METc2010.203; ABR: NL29554.042.10).

The parents of children with clinical psychosocial problems (SDQ-TDS &#x02265;14) were included. In both the ITT and complete case analyses, we found significant differences between SSTP and CAU in the short term for the SDQ teacher form and PSI, but not in the long term. We found no significant differences in effects between SSTP and CAU on the other primary or secondary outcomes at either post-intervention measurement.</p><p>We found some advantages in the short term for SSTP over CAU, but no advantages in the longer term. These findings contrast with previous studies which found more positive effects for SSTP on a child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems, on parenting skills, family functioning and parental wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Several explanations for this difference in findings can be provided. First, we compared the SSTP with a control group CAU, whereas other studies only compared SSTP with a waiting list group or no control at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Second, our study included parents from schools for special education who were selected for intervention using a screening measurement for psychosocial problems. Previous studies included parents who were explicitly referred to healthcare because of problems experienced in daily life or which focussed on children with specific problems, such as autism or physical disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is reasonable to expect that the effects of the intervention would be different, because parents in previous studies had already perceived a need for treatment.</p><p>Third, other studies which reported the effectiveness of SSTP were either performed by its developers in Australia or had small sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, those studies should be interpreted carefully due to information and selection bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Finally, in contrast with other studies, we used an independent data collection process, which meant that parents were asked to complete questionnaires in the absence of the health care professional who was carrying out the intervention. These questionnaires were not specifically developed for or used in the SSTP intervention.</p><p>In summary, our study was carried out effectively and designed to a high standard, owing to a sufficient sample size, independent data collection and control group, which strengthens our findings.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The main strengths of our study have already been indicated. First, randomization prevented selection and allocation bias, meaning that its internal validity is high. Second, we recruited from schools for special education, so the majority of parents of children with BMID were reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This increases the external validity and generalizability of our results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Third, our study was well powered because the sample size was sufficient. Fourth, our study had a low loss to follow up because parents received assistance by an independent research assistant in completing the questionnaire if they participated in the intervention study. Furthermore, our data collection was fully independent of the intervention itself, to ensure that the overview obtained was more objective and to avoid social desirability bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Sixth, we had a follow-up measurement six months after the intervention to enable the study of the effects of the SSTP on psychosocial problems over time. A final strength was the use of two informants to measure the child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems (that is, teacher and parent). More informants lead to a better understanding of a child&#x02019;s functioning, because psychosocial problems can be highly situational and differ at school and at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Our study also had an important limitation: there was selective dropout in the intervention group. Of the 111 randomized parents in the SSTP group, only 57 completed the intervention. Parents in the group that completed SSTP reported more baseline problems on the ECBI (child&#x02019;s behavior problems) and the PSI (parenting stress) than parents in the group that did not complete SSTP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study found some effects in the short term but no effects in the long term for SSTP compared to CAU over time and across outcomes. In terms of the child&#x02019;s psychosocial problems at school and the parents&#x02019; parenting stress, we found significant differences between the SSTP and CAU groups immediately after the intervention. However, we found no differences six-months after treatment for those two outcomes, nor for the other outcomes.</p><p>This study had a high drop-out rate in the SSTP group. The reasons for this deserve additional study as SSTP may not fit this population despite being promising in theory. SSTP might be too intense for certain populations, or insufficiently intense because of the number of problems parents have to deal with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].
