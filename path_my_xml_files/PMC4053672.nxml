Grinding of the teeth, tooth malformations, unilateral chewing, root scraping and planning, and missing teeth are among the causes of dentin exposure and gingival recession.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Several theories exist to explain DH; however, the most accepted is the hydrodynamic theory. To date, analysis of most data supports a theory that these stimuli induce fluid flow within dental tubules, which triggers baroreceptors near the pulp, leading to pain.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This hydrodynamic theory of pain generation assumes an exposed dentin surface and patent tubules that allow fluid flow to reach the pulp where the baroreceptors reside.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Estimates of DH prevalence vary. According to Kielbassa, 9-30% of the adult population suffers from DH,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] while Dowell, <italic>et al</italic>. estimated that 50% of the general population is affected and 100% of the patients with periodontal conditions have experienced DH at some time.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Panoply of current diagnostic and treatment strategies for DH suggests considerable uncertainty among dental practitioners about how to manage this condition.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] DH is generally diagnosed through patient interview and clinical examination, detecting an exaggerated pain response to minimal stimuli, even while brushing teeth. DH is classified as mild, moderate, or severe, based on intensity of pain.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>A variety of treatments have been tried to stop or minimize pain caused by DH. The most widespread treatments involve application of desensitizing agents and other materials such as toothpaste containing strontium salts or potassium salts, high-concentration fluoride varnishes, cyanoacrylate adhesives, and restorative materials on the affected area.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Despite the large number of published studies, however, there is still no consensus on which product constitutes the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; for DH treatment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>A material GC Tooth Mousse based on the Recaldent<sup>&#x02122;</sup> is a unique complex containing amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and casein phosphopeptide (CPP), derived, from milk casein. The preparation is recommended in hard tissue re-mineralization as well as in DH reduction due to its ability to block opened dentinal tubules.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>At present, the commonly used desensitizing agents generally are favorable in short-time, while blow the mark in a long-term and hence the development of new desensitizing agents is needed.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The search for a natural desensitizing agent with long lasting effects has led to the observation that propolis can have promising effects on DH.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Propolis is a naturally-occurring bee product and it was first used as a medicine by the Egyptians and use of it was continued by the Greeks and Romans. It is widely used in homeopathic and herbal practice as an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antimycotic, and bacteriostatic agent. The primary constituents of propolis are flavones, flavanones, and flavanols. It is also composed of resin (55%), essential oils and wax (30%) mixed with bee glue &#x0201c;the salivary secretions of bees&#x0201d; and pollen (5%) and other constituents (10%), which are amino acids, and minerals.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>There are many clinical applications of propolis in dentistry. To exemplify, a few are-relief from denture ulcerations and stomatitis, halitosis, mouth freshener, periodontal pocket/abscess, mouthwash, cervical, dentinal, and root caries sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Some <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have successfully shown that, propolis has clinically significant effect on reduction of dentin permeability,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but to date, there have been very few studies done on desensitizing effect of propolis <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Hence the aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 30% ethenolic extract of Indian propolis compared with Recaldent<sup>&#x02122;</sup> in reduction of DH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and settings</title><p>A randomized, double blind, split mouth, clinical trial was conducted among patients of Central Jail, Bhopal, who fulfilled with following selection criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Selection criteria</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Patient inclusion criteria for those fulfilling the preliminary screening</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patients aged 18-40 years, residing in Central Jail Bhopal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients having at least 3 caries-free cervical lesions with DH.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The loss of dentin should be less than 2 mm deep as per Tooth Wear Index (TWI) code &#x02018;2&#x02019; and &#x02018;3&#x02019; (defect up to 2 mm thick/loss of enamel and substantial loss of dentin, but not exposing pulp or secondary dentin).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with adequate oral hygiene and only those who are willing to participate in the study.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Patient exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patient with history of any systemic illness and/or psychological diseases, and previous hospitalization.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Teeth having dental caries, cracks or fractures in the cervical areas of the teeth.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Teeth with TWI code 0 (no change of contour), 1 (minimal loss of contour) and 4 (defect more than 2 mm deep/pulp exposure, or exposure of secondary dentin).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Teeth with any extensive or unsatisfactory restorations, prosthesis or orthodontic appliances involving the cervical areas.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with history of drug addictions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients using analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory drugs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who failed to give consent.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Withdrawal criteria</title><p>Failure to complete follow-up after undergoing initial treatment and giving consent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Method of collection of data</title><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee in People's Dental Academy, Bhopal.

One of the most common one-dimensional method is the verbal rating scale and it is widely used in clinical research to assess intensity of acute pain.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In this study, agents, i.e. 30% ethenolic extract of Indian propolis, Recaldent<sup>&#x02122;</sup> effectively reduced the DH. Pain decreased from severe to slight or moderate during various applications of 30% ethnolic extract of Indian propolis and Recaldent<sup>&#x02122;</sup>.</p><p>Scientific researchers starting in 1960,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] confirm that folk tradition has known about beneficial aspects of propolis 1000 years ago. It is dispensed in various forms, mouthwash, lozenges, wine, cake, powder, jelly, tablets, capsules, tinctures or creams, soap and now it is available as toothpaste in Brazil, Russia, China and other European countries.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>In 1999, Mahmoud <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a pioneer study on the effect of propolis on DH <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, propolis was applied twice daily on teeth with hypersensitivity. It was concluded that propolis had a positive effect in the control of DH.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In our study, it is seen that there is a significant reduction in the severity of DH among the teeth assigned in 30% Indian propolis group. Its action was slightly slower as compared to Recaldent<sup>&#x02122;</sup> but still the number of teeth with mild pain increased markedly. This could be attributed to high content of flavanoids in propolis which produces the occluding effect.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Flavanoids may be able to suppress the information of free radicals by binding heavy metals in ions, which are known to catalyze many processes leading to the appearance of full radicals.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Recaldent<sup>&#x02122;</sup> (GC tooth mousse) was developed by Prof. Reynolds at the University of Melbourne in 1998.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] It contains CPP and ACP. CPP stabilizes ACP and forms nano complexes with ACP at the tooth surface thereby providing a reservoir of calcium and phosphate ions, which favors mineralization.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] CPP also buffers the Ph of plaque, depresses demineralization and enhances re-mineralization, which also results in anti-cariogenic property.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In our study, G.C. tooth mousse was the most effective among the test groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The initial observation of the medicine reveals that its action is most effective in the 1<sup>st</sup> days of application. In the first 2 weeks, 81.2% teeth showed rapid reduction while the overall reduction in DH after 4<sup>th</sup> application was 91.6%. Perhaps, in order to increase its desensitizing effect, it has been recommended that, the application should be repeated in intervals shorter than 7 days.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>The sterile water, which was used as a negative control in our study showed the least (35.4%) reduction in DH. This slight reduction in DH may be attributed to placebo effect and participation bias.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The placebo effect is commonly considered as a response to medical intervention that results from the intervention itself and not from any particular mechanism of action.</p><p>Several treatment modalities and agents have been used in the management and resolution of dentin hypersensitivity, but their efficacy has varied from one study to another and it is not yet established in the literature.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Further, research is needed to clarify the mechanisms and etiology of this uncomfortable clinical condition.</p><p>Dentin hypersensitivity studies are subject based. Successful management of DH requires more research into factors such as bad hygiene, diet, lifestyle, salivary flow/content, and other customs.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Correcting the factors, which have led to sensitivity in the first place alone can prevent recurrence. It is desirable to develop novel agents that are capable of more effective and lasting tubule occlusion such as methods that mimic or harness the natural defense reactions of the dentin-pulp complex. Furthermore, expanding the use of propolis for DH treatment in dental clinics will help corroborate its effectiveness and safety may result in this product becoming the treatment of choice for moderate and mild DH.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>No females participated in the
