One of the latest trends is aqua-cycling, where participants sit on a water-resistant stationary bike and, while immersed chest deep in the water, combine continuous cycling with upper body exercises that utilise water resistance. Since stationary cycling and aquatic exercises are frequently recommended to patients with knee osteoarthritis, combining both would seem an obvious step, and an aqua-cycling exercise programme for patients with knee osteoarthritis has indeed been developed. This study protocol gives a detailed description of the exercise programme and the methodology of a study to compare this programme with treatment involving usual care only.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study is a single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial of Maastricht University Medical Centre+, the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria: knee pain of four to seven on a 10-point pain rating scale; a Kellgren/Lawrence score between one to three; ability to cycle; good mental health; sufficient language skills; indication for physical therapy in conjunction with impairments due to OA. Exclusion criteria: any contra-indication for aquatic exercise; planned total knee replacement; corticosteroid injection &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;months and/or hyaluronic acid injection &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;months; severe joint complaints (other than knee joint); symptomatic and radiological apparent hip OA; inflammatory joint diseases; inability to safely enter and exit the pool; fear of water. Participants will receive two 45-min moderate intense aqua-cycling sessions weekly over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks in addition to usual care or usual care only. Usual care consists of an individual intervention plan comprising lifestyle recommendations, medication routine and referral to a physical therapist. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks after baseline. The primary outcome is self-reported knee pain and physical functioning. Secondary outcomes are lower limb muscle strength, functional capacity, self-reported disease severity, physical activity level, quality of life, self-efficacy and fear of movement. Daily diaries will collect information on knee pain, physical functioning, level of physical activity, pain medication routine and physical therapy (control group only) or exercise participation over two 30-day periods (during the intervention period).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge the present study is the first randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of aqua-cycling in the pre-surgical stage of knee osteoarthritis. This trial will demonstrate if the newly designed aqua-cycling intervention, in supplement to usual care, can help to improve impairments due to knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Netherlands Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3766">NTR3766</ext-link> (21-12-2012).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12891-016-0939-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Aquatic exercise</kwd><kwd>Aqua-cycling</kwd><kwd>Immersed cycling</kwd><kwd>Underwater cycle ergometer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>022.003.036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Bie</surname><given-names>Rob A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Aqua-cycling, which is cycling on a water-resistant stationary bike, might be a supplement to the available exercise possibilities for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Knee OA, a common chronic health condition, affects the daily lives of millions of people worldwide by causing knee pain and difficulty performing day-to-day activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. All dimensions of physical function, as described by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (IFC) framework, are affected by knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For example, as a reaction to load-dependent joint pain that commonly occurs during daily functional activities like walking or stair-climbing, people tend to underuse the knee and become physically inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Avoidance of these activities gives rise to problems with body functions and structures such as cardiovascular deconditioning, muscle weakness and reduced knee range of motion, but also to more general health problems such as a higher risk of comorbidity and premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Exercise therapy is crucial for maintaining good general health and alleviating the symptom progression of knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition to exercise, patient education about treatment options, weight management and strategies to prevent capacity overload of the damaged knee, as well as pharmacological treatment with analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are recommended for optimal conservative management of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, only a small part of the population treats their complaints by participating in physical therapy or exercise therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The patients&#x02019; reasons for exercising (or not) depend on their (perception of their) physical ability for exercise; beliefs about exercise; motivational factors such as enjoyment, social support, taking control of the disability; pain and limitations of the lower limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Aquatic exercise enjoys a good reputation among patients because exercising in water feels easier and less painful than on land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The buoyancy of the water results in decompression of joints and causes the individual to feel weightless and to move more smoothly than on land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, a warm water temperature promotes muscle relaxation, possibly resulting in pain reduction and the perception of less joint stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recent systematic reviews of aquatic exercise studies of individuals with OA and other chronic musculoskeletal disorders showed a small to moderate effect on joint pain, self-reported functioning, and performance tests of physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These achievements are comparable to the results of land-based training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Growing recognition of the benefits of aquatic exercise and increasing public interest have resulted in many forms of aquatic exercise. Older patients with OA value individualized, expert-supervised shallow-water exercises, aqua jogging and hydrotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The exercise possibilities in water range from simple vertical water exercise and water running to more holistic programmes such as Watsu&#x000ae; and the adaptation of land-based fitness trends like Zumba&#x000ae; to the aquatic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. With the continual development and refinement of water-proof equipment, even spinning is now possible in a swimming pool. Aqua-cycling, where participants are immersed chest deep in water and pedal against water resistance, has recently become a popular water-based fitness activity. It combines the advantages of the aquatic environment with those of stationary land-based cycling, a combination that seems ideal for patients with knee OA. Stationary cycling is often used in the treatment of lower-limb injuries and chronic conditions like OA because of the reduced joint load, the repetitive circular pedalling movement that can be used to improve range of motion&#x000a0;(ROM) in a functional manner, and the involvement of the largest muscle groups of the lower limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Evidence shows that stationary cycling can reduce knee pain and improve aerobic capacity, self-reported physical functioning and gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. So far, only a small number of studies have documented the therapeutic effects of aqua-cycling. Ulatkowski and von Kathen evaluated the additional effect of aqua-cycling during recovery from total knee surgery and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In both cases, patients who did aqua-cycling showed greater improvements in knee-ROM and a reduction in knee joint swelling compared with patients receiving usual care only. Furthermore, a small one-group pre-test and post-test study on the effects of a 10-week aqua-cycling programme involving patients with rheumatic diseases showed a positive influence on strength, well-being and joint mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Another small study on the feasibility of aqua-cycling, as a part of an aquatic circuit training for patients with knee OA, evaluated aqua-cycling as a safe and controlled exercise regimen and reported that participants were very satisfied with the training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>A 12-week group-based aqua-cycling training for mild to moderate knee OA patients was developed, because currently only a few therapeutic aqua-cycling interventions are available. The results of this study might provide guidance on the clinical use of aqua-cycling and greater insight into the effectiveness of aqua-cycling may help to broaden aquatic treatment possibilities. Furthermore, the study may support instructors of community aqua-cycling classes in dealing with participants with knee OA. For these reasons, it is important to examine whether a 12-week aqua-cycling programme, in supplement to usual care, will result in better outcomes of self-reported knee pain and physical functioning when compared with the relatively less intricate regimen usual care only.</p><p>This article provides a full description of the study&#x02019;s rationale, design and method in accordance with the SPIRIT guidelines for reporting protocols of intervention trials and the CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The current study is a single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Maastricht University Medical Centre+ (MUMC<sup>+</sup>). Due to the structure of the trial, participant blinding is not possible. To design the trial as cost-effectively as possible, the programme coordinator is involved in many project activities such as recruitment, data collection planning and execution of the intervention, precluding blinding. Data collection and entry is performed by blinded and independent physical therapists and research assistants. The data will be analysed by blinded analysts.</p><p>The randomisation procedure is performed by an independent research assistant of the Department of Epidemiology of Maastricht University using free, internet-based software to generate the random allocation schedule (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">http://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>). A block randomisation with a constant block size of eight patients and an allocation ratio of 1:1 is used to keep sample sizes equal across the intervention and control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>Participants were recruited in a hospital (MUMC<sup>+</sup>) in the Dutch province of Limburg. Patients were recruited form March 2013 until October 2015. The source population were patients diagnosed with mild to moderate knee OA. They were diagnosed by an orthopaedic surgeon or nurse practitioner, and the diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms and X-rays. Patients with an indication for conservative management of knee OA were offered the opportunity to participate in the present study. The orthopaedic specialist briefly explained the project and asked the patient for their agreement to share contact information (name and telephone number) with the programme coordinator. Research on participation in self-management programmes shows that the recommendation of a health professional influences the decision on whether to take part in a programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Non-participation had no consequences for further treatment.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Eligible patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] rated knee pain between four and seven on a 10-point numeric pain rating scale, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] had a Kellgren/Lawrence score between one and three, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] were able to cycle on a stationary exercise bike, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] were in good mental health (score &#x0003c;8 for anxiety and depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] had sufficient language skills and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] had an indication for physical therapy in conjunction with impairments due to OA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Potential participants with any contra-indication for aquatic exercise therapy such as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] severe, unstable cardiorespiratory co-morbidities and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] open wounds, or patients on a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] waiting list for total knee surgery were excluded from participation in this study. Furthermore, all potential participants who met one of the following criteria were excluded given that these conditions could limit safe and full participation in the study or impede the perception of symptoms of knee OA: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] corticosteroid injection &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;months and/or hyaluronic acid injection &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;months, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] severe joint complaints (other than knee joint) that interfere the ability to participate in an exercise programme, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] symptomatic and radiological apparent hip OA, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] inflammatory joint diseases, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] inability to safely enter and exit the pool and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] fear of water.</p><p>Eligible patients first received verbal information by telephone. Interested patients were contacted by the programme coordinator after their consultation visit at the MUMC<sup>+</sup>. If their interest in participation continued after the telephone call, the programme coordinator sent additional information by mail. Each potential participant could consider participation for 1&#x000a0;week and was instructed to hold off any physical therapy until the randomisation results were known. If a candidate decided to participate, they had to sign an informed consent form in which they declared their voluntary participation. The programme coordinator checked incoming applications, including two short questionnaires, to screen for any contra-indications for physical activity using the physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) and to screen for anxiety and depression using the HADS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In case of any doubts about a patient&#x02019;s mental and/or physical health, the patient concerned was advised to contact a medical specialist for examination or advice.</p><p>After providing their informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to either the usual care control group or a 12-week aqua-cycling programme at MUMC<sup>+</sup>. Having completed the baseline assessment, participants in the intervention group started the aqua-cycling programme (24 sessions) and the control group could start with physical therapy and continue other usual care routines. The post-programme and follow-up measurements were scheduled after 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks. After the last assessment, the control group is offered 12 sessions of aqua-cycling in a public swimming pool. The intervention group can also join this group after the 12-week intervention phase, but will have to pay the regular rate for aquatic fitness charged by the community pool. An overview of the participant timeline is given below in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant timeline</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2016_939_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Both groups</title><p>Participants were referred by their general practitioner for a consultation visit to the orthopaedic specialist at MUMC<sup>+</sup>. Essentially, there were three different types of consultation visits. Participants from the area of Maastricht who have not yet been diagnosed with OA were referred to MUMC<sup>+</sup> for further diagnostics of their knee complaints. Based on predictive values for severity of complaints, the MUMC<sup>+</sup> scheduled patients for consultation at the Early OA Outpatient Clinic or the department of orthopaedic surgery. The Early OA Outpatient Clinic is responsible for the diagnosis and secondary prevention in patients with pre-surgical knee OA. The diagnosis is based on recent X-rays and clinical symptoms. Subsequently, the nurse practitioner provided patients with personalised information on OA, an information booklet on OA and an individual intervention plan consisting of lifestyle recommendations, medication routine and referral to a physical therapist. After 6&#x000a0;weeks, patients had their second consultation visit to evaluate the treatment. Patients already diagnosed with knee OA and who came back for a follow-up visit at the department of orthopaedic surgery could also participate in the study in case of an indication for physical therapy. These were usually patients who had limited success with pharmacological treatments such as injections and oral pain medication. In the case of injections, patients could still participate in the present trial after a wash-out period of three (in the case of a corticosteroid injection) to 6&#x000a0;months (in the case of a hyaluronic acid injection). If participants received an injection during the trial, the programme coordinator recorded the date and type. Occasionally, patients were referred to the orthopaedic surgeon for diagnosis and in that event the orthopaedic surgeon provided a diagnosis, lifestyle recommendations and a treatment plan.</p><p>All participants were instructed to maintain their usual care routine. The programme coordinator kept track of changes in participants&#x02019; treatment plans by monitoring patients with diaries that recorded OA-related functional problems, knee pain, physical activity, physical therapy and medication use in the first and third month after baseline assessment. Furthermore, a short interview by phone (control group) or in person (intervention group) was scheduled after 6&#x000a0;weeks. Prior to the last assessment, the programme coordinator called participants and inquired about any changes in treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control group</title><p>The control group was instructed to continue usual care, including working on prescribed lifestyle recommendations, medication routine and consultations with their orthopaedic surgeon during the 24-week trial. Furthermore, participants could start with physical therapy, but this was not necessary to participate in the present study. Use of and compliance with non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical therapy and exercise, is low in patients with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Motivation to start with and maintain such interventions is influenced by previous treatment experience and perceived effectiveness, attitudes towards exercise, perceived severity of knee symptoms and comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, due to differences in health care coverage, some participants were unable to afford physical therapy. Funding constraints made it impossible to cover the costs for these participants. To minimise dropout, participants were offered 12 weekly sessions of aqua-cycling after the end of a patient&#x02019;s participation in this study. These sessions were held in a community pool because of size restrictions of the hospital pool.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention group</title><p>Participants in the intervention group also continued with usual care, though they were instructed not to start additional physical therapy during the 12-week intervention period. Supervised by a physical therapist, participants performed aqua-cycling exercises for 45&#x000a0;min twice a week over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks. The training took place in a heated therapy pool (32&#x000b0; Celsius) at the MUMC<sup>+</sup> department of physical therapy. Depending on the body length of the participants, the water depth varied between 1.20 and 1.30 metres and participants were immersed between the navel and a maximum height of the xiphoid process (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The aqua bike used was the AquaCruiser II&#x000ae; from AquaKinetiqs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). This bike differs from other aqua bikes used for recreational sporting activities by healthy people (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hydrorider.com/">www.hydrorider.com</ext-link>). Differences consists of cycling barefooted instead of using water shoes, the AquaCruiser II&#x000ae; saddle is more comfortable, and the resistance can be adjusted during pedalling via a knob located below the handlebar instead of being set on land prior to the session. The resistance can be adjusted by six reproducible and equal increments by means of a magnetic braking system.</p><p>Participants cycled on the aqua bike throughout the whole session. Every session consisted of a warm-up, a conditioning phase and a cool-down.

Furthermore, the upper body was also activated to acclimatise the whole body to the aquatic environment.</p><p>In the conditioning phase, participants cycled for 25 to 30&#x000a0;min at a moderate intensity level and combined continuous cycling with exercises for the upper body. In addition, patients cycled in out-of-the-saddle positions, did one-leg pedalling or emphasised one part of the pedal movement (e.g. by actively pulling the pedals upwards). Therefore, the conditioning phase essentially consisted of three segments: continuous cycling at a minimum cadence of 60 revolutions per minute (rpm), upper body exercises and lower body exercises. The continuous cycling segment consisted of at least 5&#x000a0;min of cycling at a minimum pedalling cadence of 60&#x000a0;rpm. Exercise duration was increased by 15 to 20&#x000a0;s each week. Based on a conditioning phase of 25&#x000a0;min, this is an increase of 1&#x000a0;% per week, which is lower than the recommended weekly increase of 2.5&#x000a0;% as advocated by the American Geriatric Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This is deliberate, however, as the assumption is that aqua-cycling is more demanding than stationary cycling on land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Increased pedalling resistance was offered with caution and only if a participant was able to cycle continuously at 60&#x000a0;rpm without adverse reactions such as increased knee pain after the session, because increased workload results in increased knee load. This is in turn reported to be associated with worsening of knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The upper body exercises were used as an active break for the lower limbs as the pedalling tempo decreases with the focus shifted from the legs to the upper body. In addition, the upper body exercises enabled a varied exercise programme and prevented monotony which might have occurred with 45&#x000a0;min of purely cycling. The exercises were typical exercises used in aquatic fitness to strengthen arms (biceps, triceps), shoulders (rotators, flexors, extensors) and upper back (e.g. rhomboids, latissimus). A single repetition maximum as guidance for exercise intensity cannot be transposed to the aquatic environment. Characteristically, aquatic strength exercises are repeated 20 times and more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Previous research has shown that this is an effective training method to increase muscular strength in chronic pain and OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Additionally, the high number of repetitions allows time to rehearse the exercise to promote execution using strong, powerful movements with good technique and full ROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Floating devices and drag equipment were used to increase resistance and to provide a varied exercise programme. The equipment used has not been sponsored by the manufacturers. The more exhausting upper-body exercise routine was followed by exercises focusing on the lower limbs. Patients cycled in a half-seated or standing position, emphasised the upwards and downwards pedalling movement and/or cycled with one leg. There is currently no evidence regarding the influence of different body positions in aqua-cycling on knee joint load. Consequently, the results of biomechanical studies of stationary cycling on land have guided the development of this exercise segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Research on the difference between seated and standing uphill cycling shows an increased activation of monoarticular hip and knee extensors. However, to keep knee load as low as possible, standing positions should be limited during each session. During a land-based spinning class, out-of-saddle positions account for approximately 16&#x000a0;% (~8&#x000a0;min) of the session&#x02019;s total time (50&#x000a0;min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In comparison, the time spent cycling in standing positions in the aqua-cycling programme was 5 to 8&#x000a0;% (2 to 4&#x000a0;min) of the total cycling time (~45&#x000a0;min).</p><p>The cool-down consisted of slowly cycling forward and backward, knee-ROM exercises and static stretching of the lower limbs to decrease the heart rate, prepare participants for the change of body position (e.g. from sitting on the exercise bike to standing position) and environment (the pool floor slowly comes up during the stretching exercises), and to reduces experienced muscle soreness.</p><p>The exercise intensity was moderate and was regulated by the patients themselves based on their perceived exertion using the BORG scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition, heart rate is monitored by a Polar Ft 7, Wearlink&#x000ae;&#x02009;+&#x02009;Hybrid chest strap during each training session, and peak and average heart rates are protocolled. An average heart rate of 70-75&#x000a0;% of the maximum heart rate is desirable and recommended by exercise guidelines for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Furthermore, the supervising physical therapist assessed the quality of the performance by judging compensational movements, postural control, safe execution, and level of exertion (assessed by the talk test). In the event of any doubt about a participant&#x02019;s health status, the physical therapist discontinued the training and referred the participant to their general practitioner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The current study investigates the effect of aqua-cycling on impairments due to knee OA, such as knee pain, reduced physical functioning over the previous week and on the assessment day, and knee stiffness.

In addition to the WOMAC subscales for pain, stiffness and physical function (in its complete and original format), the KOOS also takes into account difficulties with sport activities and knee-related quality of life. The five subscales are scored on a five-point Likert scale and final scores are modified to a 0&#x02013;100 scale. A lower score is associated with higher impairments.

There are no previous data on which to base the sample size calculation. The estimation of the sample size is based on two factors: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of WOMAC, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] studies with a similar design (aquatic therapy versus usual care) or intervention (one group pre-test/post-test feasibility study of aqua-cycling for rheumatic patients). Although the present study uses the KOOS questionnaire, the WOMAC questionnaire has been used to estimate the sample size. The WOMAC is well recognized in OA research and the questionnaire and minimum clinically important differences (MCID) of the WOMAC subscales are known. The MCID changes from baseline to post-interventions on the WOMAC pain and function scale range from 15&#x000a0;% to 18&#x000a0;% for pain and 12&#x000a0;% to 17&#x000a0;% for physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. The results of previous studies are in line with or exceed the MCIDs referred to. Hinman et al. showed a 21&#x000a0;% and 29&#x000a0;% improvement in WOMAC pain and function scores for the hydrotherapy group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The usual care group did not improve. A feasibility study of an aqua-cycling programme for rheumatic patients showed an improvement of 14&#x000a0;% in the post-intervention score of self-reported physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Based on the above&#x000a0;mentioned data, the aqua-cycling training in the present study is expected to achieve at least similar results as the interventions of Moser and Hinman, or even exceed those results because of a higher exercise frequency and intensity and longer duration of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, a difference of 25&#x000a0;% between the aqua-cycling group and usual care group in terms of reduction of knee pain and improvement in physical functioning is hypothesised as clinically meaningful. The statistical level of significance was set to an alpha (&#x003b1;) of 0.05 and statistical power to 0.80. The standard deviation is 20&#x000a0;% of the maximum score of the WOMAC subscale for pain and physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. With an expected dropout rate of 20&#x000a0;%, the final number of participants needed is 168.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23. The effect of group membership (aqua-cycling versus usual care) on primary and secondary outcomes will be estimated and tested for significance with a significance level set at 0.05. Furthermore, any significant changes that occur over time will be examined. Demographic variables and clinical background variables (i.e. BMI, co-morbidities) will be used as grouping variables for subgroup analysis or as covariates.</p><p>Multilevel analysis will be applied with repeated measures (level 1) that are clustered within persons (level 2), and with patients (level 1) clustered within groups (level 2).

In addition, the relationship between the aqua-cycling training and the factors just referred to will be evaluated. Multilevel analysis will be used to estimate and test between-person differences and the within-person processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>The content of the aqua-cycling intervention is comparable to existing physical activity programmes on land. Research has shown that these programmes involve no additional harm or risk to the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Aqua-cycling in rheumatic patients was evaluated in a study as safe and feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, there is adequate evidence that aquatic training and stationary cycling are beneficial and safe activities for patients with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Because the risk of any adverse events from participation in the intervention group is small and comparable to the very low risk of adverse events from participation in land-based OA exercise programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], no data monitoring committee (DMC) is needed.

As far as we know, the present study is the first randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of aqua-cycling in the pre-surgical stage of OA. If this training proves to be effective, the results can provide guidance on the use of aqua-cycling in clinical and community exercise settings. Aqua-cycling could be used to increase the range of motion of the knee, lower limb muscle strength and aerobic capacity in all populations, whereas land-based training is too painful. It might also an option for patients who feel uncomfortable with traditional aquatic exercise because of poor swimming skills or hydrophobia. Previous studies have shown that aqua-cycling is well accepted by patients who have hydrophobia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As aqua-cycling has become a recent fitness trend in Europe and the US, many public swimming pools offer aqua-spinning to a healthy population. Exercise instructors in community exercise settings who are qualified to supervise classes with musculoskeletal disorders could use the training programme described (if proven effective) to adapt aqua-spinning classes to the needs of people with knee OA. The opportunity to participate in a modern and popular exercise class might especially be appealing to knee OA patients who want to be active and/or are young [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The strength of this study is the close monitoring conducted during the intervention phase with diaries, since self-reported measures might be sensitive to day-to-day variations not capturing the development of OA impairments throughout the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Another strong aspect of the study is the follow-up assessment 3&#x000a0;months after the end of the programme, something that is rarely done in aquatic exercise research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Especially interesting in the follow-up assessment is the evaluation of whether participants in the intervention group continued to aqua-cycle in the community swimming pool or stayed active in another way. This will indicate if people are willing to continue aqua-cycling at their own cost or if it has helped them to become more active. The control group will be invited to attend 12 free aqua-cycling sessions in the community pool. Due to limited access to the hospital pool and the limited number of aqua bikes (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), it is not possible to train both groups in the hospital. Funding restraints make it impossible to bear the costs of 24 sessions twice a week for the control group in the community pool. As the programme coordinator will give the training, there will be no difference in terms of the training content and structure. However, this waiting-list control design can influence the results of the study in two ways. On the one hand, participants in the control group might be more motivated to follow usual care instructions with regard to physical activity because they do not want to be less active than the intervention group. In addition, this group will be monitored by means of diaries too, which might also motivate them to be more active. On the other hand, it is possible that the control group participants will follow usual care recommendations less strictly as they will be waiting for their turn to try out aqua-cycling. Furthermore, the fact the control group participants did not receive any immediate and free intervention might influence motivation for further participation. Therefore, we will inform participants about group allocation before the baseline assessment. The assessments of the present study are not part of the clinical routine and participants have to come back for the assessments after giving consent and being randomised. By informing participants about group allocation prior to the baseline, we wish to prevent frustration about group allocation and possible dropout. Nevertheless, this strategy increases the risk of dropout before baseline assessment.</p><p>In conclusion, this trial will increase the knowledge of aqua-cycling and might be a useful addition to aquatic exercise training. As with aquatic treadmill training, it is possible to adequately monitor and modify exercise intensity since pedalling rate and resistance can be adjusted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. In addition, the exercise programme is based on exercise guidelines and the exercise intensity will be measured by pedalling frequency and resistance, average heart rate, peak heart rate and perceived exertion during the different parts of the conditioning phase. Recent reviews strongly recommend using and reporting exercise intensity, as will be done in this study, in order to obtain a better understanding of the dose-response relationship in aquatic exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>The data collection is still ongoing and will be completed in March 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p>The scientific integrity of this research project requires that all results of this study be disclosed unreservedly.
