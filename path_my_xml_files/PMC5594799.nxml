Although LC results in less pain than open cholecystectomy, but still it is not a pain free procedure.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Postoperative pain remains a major concern in patients undergoing LC. Pain following LC is multifactorial. Pain is differentiated into three components - visceral, abdominal wall, and referred pain to shoulder.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Preemptive analgesia is the one of the most important methods to reduce the pain after LC. Due to the &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; effect on the nociceptive system, preemptive analgesia has the potential to be more effective than a similar analgesic treatment initiated after surgery as it reduces immediate postoperative pain and also prevents the development of chronic pain by decreasing the altered central sensory processing.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Intraperitoneal local anesthetics are now widely used, as they provide the benefit of analgesia without systemic side effects that may result from use of enterally and parenterally administered drugs.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Timing of intraperitoneal instillation of local anesthetic is very important. Barczynski <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the optimal timing of bupivacaine peritoneal instillation and concluded that peritoneal instillation was much more effective for pain relief if used before creation of pneumoperitoneum.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Maestroni <italic>et al</italic>. also studied preemptive analgesia in LC where both local anesthetic and normal saline (NS) were administered before creation of pneumoperitoneum and suggested only application before creation of pneumoperitoneum may preempt every neuronal central sensitization.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, Zmora <italic>et al</italic>. and Elfberg and Sj&#x000f6;vall-Mj&#x000f6;berg evaluated the effect of intraperitoneal bupivacaine on pain following LC and concluded that intraperitoneal bupivacaine does not attenuate pain following LC.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The results of various studies have been conflicting with majority demonstrating benefit of pain reduction after intraperitoneal instillation of local anesthetics in the initial postoperative period, whereas there are some suggesting that it does not attenuate pain following LC.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate preemptive effect of ropivacaine in LC by comparing postoperative abdominal pain, shoulder pain and requirement of rescue analgesic after intraperitoneal instillation of 3 mg/kg ropivacaine in 100 ml NS before creation of pneumoperitoneum versus intraperitoneal instillation of 3 mg/kg ropivacaine in 100 ml NS after completion of surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This prospective randomized, double-blind study was conducted after approval from hospital ethical committee in 100 patients of age group 20 to 60 years of American Society of Anesthesiologist physical Status I and II, scheduled for LC under general anesthesia. Patients who refused to participate in study, in whom surgery converted to open cholecystectomy, history of hypersensitivity to ropivacaine, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, pregnancy, history of peritonitis were excluded from the study. After written informed consent, patients were randomly divided using concealed opaque envelopes to one of the two groups of fifty each. In Group A, patients received intraperitoneal instillation of 3 mg/kg ropivacaine in 100 ml NS before creation of pneumoperitoneum and Group B patients received intraperitoneal instillation of 3 mg/kg ropivacaine in 100 ml NS after completion of surgery.</p><p>Detailed preanaesthetic evaluation was performed 1 day before surgery and visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0&#x02013;10 was explained to all the patients.</p><p>After shifting, the patient to operation theatre, baseline heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded and intravenous (IV) access was secured. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen via an anatomical face mask for 3 min, all patients were induced with 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate, lignocaine 1.0 mg/kg, fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and propofol 2&#x02013;2.5 mg/kg. Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg was given to facilitate oral endotracheal intubation with appropriate size endotracheal tube. After checking and securing the endotracheal tube, anesthesia was maintained with intermittent positive pressure ventilation using closed circuit and 0.5%&#x02013;2% isoflurane. Muscle relaxation was achieved with intermittent vecuronium bromide.</p><p>Drug solution was administered using veress needle before creation of pneumoperitoneum in Group A and before removal of trocars after completion of surgery in Group B by the surgeon who did not participate in the study. During surgery, all patients received an IV infusion of lactated ringers solution at a rate of 5&#x02013;7 ml/kg/h patients were placed in 15&#x000b0;&#x02013;20&#x000b0; reverse trendelenbergh's position with left side downward tilt. During laparoscopy, intra-abdominal pressure was limited to 10&#x02013;12 mmHg. The CO<sub>2</sub> was carefully evacuated at the end of surgery. Anesthesiologist in postanesthesia care unit was unaware of treatment to which each patient was randomized.

Recently, the use of intraperitoneal instillation of local anesthetic is emerging as a promising modality for postoperative pain management in these patients.</p><p>Various local anesthetics such as lignocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine have been evaluated in many trials.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Several factors are important for intraperitoneal instillation of drug to decrease postoperative pain, which include choice of drug, concentration of drug, volume of drug, and timing of drug administration.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>We used ropivacaine for intraperitoneal instillation because of its low toxicity and longer duration of action. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide type local anesthetic used as regional anesthetic. It is a pure S(&#x02212;) enantiomer, developed for the purpose of reducing potential cardiac toxicity and improving relative sensory and motor block profiles. When ropivacaine is given intraperitoneally it starts acting within 10&#x02013;20 min, and duration of action lasts for 4&#x02013;6 h.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Kucuk <italic>et al</italic>. have found that intraperitoneal instillation of 150 mg of ropivacaine was significantly more effective than either 100 mg bupivacaine or 100 mg ropivacaine for preventing postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Another important aspect is the appropriate volume of the medium used for instillation. It should be large enough to reach the entire subdiaphragmatic region. Some studies have shown that better abdominal and shoulder tip pain control was observed when larger volume of local anesthetic solution was used for instillation rather than smaller volume.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Timing of intraperitoneal instillation of local anesthetic is also very important. In our study, mean postoperative VAS scores for pain abdomen at rest were significantly lower in Group A than Group B in the first 12 h thereby indicating that the patients receiving intraperitoneal ropivacaine before creation of pnemoperitoneum had lesser pain in the first 12 h during the postoperative period. The VAS scores were less up to 24 h but difference was nonsignificant after 12 h postoperative period. The results are comparable with studies conducted by Barczynski <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Maestroni <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>However, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. found that preemptive intraperitoneal bupivacaine had no significant effect on pain abdomen and shoulder pain.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This lack of efficacy might be due to small dosage of intraperitoneal bupivacaine used (0.25% 40 ml) for coverage of the intraabdominal organ surface.</p><p>The shoulder tip pain was also significantly less in Group A as compared to Group B up to 12 h. The exact mechanism of shoulder tip pain is yet to be clarified. The proposed mechanisms include phrenic nerve neuropraxia of short duration due to stretching of the subdiaphragmatic fibers by an increased concavity of the diaphragm induced by pneumoperitoneum with CO<sub>2</sub> insufflated into the abdominal cavity. The preemptive analgesia with intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine before pneumoperitoneum could cause the inhibitory effect on development of posttraumatic hyperalgesia resulting in reduced shoulder pain. The results are similar to Barczynski <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] who observed that none of the patients reported shoulder tip pain who received intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine preemptively.</p><p>Pain after LC is dynamic and exacerbated by coughing or movement (supine to sitting), or deep breathing and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Pain at rest and at movement was correlated in our study and the mean postoperative VAS scores for pain abdomen and shoulder pain at deep breathing were significantly lower in Group A than Group B in the first 12 h.</p><p>The latency time from end of the operation to the first rescue analgesic requirement was significantly longer in Group A (472 &#x000b1; 26.32 min) than in Group B (189 &#x000b1; 11.87 min) patients. This shows that the application of peritoneal instillation with ropivacaine before the creation of pneumoperitoneum is superior to its use after the completion of surgery. The results were comparable to Barczynski <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in which latency time in patients who received intraperitoneal bupivacaine before creation of pneumoperitoneum was (426 &#x000b1; 57 min), whereas it was (307 &#x000b1; 39 min) in patients who received intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine after the completion of surgery. Longer latency time for first rescue analgesic in our study might be explained by higher dose of ropivacaine (3 mg/kg), whereas Barczynski <italic>et al</italic>. used 2 mg/kg intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine. Our result is also supported by Pasqualucci <italic>et al</italic>. who observed that the latency time for first analgesic was significantly more (324 &#x000b1; 43.4 min) in patients who received intraperitoneal bupivacaine before creation of pneumoperitoneum in comparison to patients who received intraperitoneal bupivacaine after completion of surgery (218.4 &#x000b1; 14.6 min) in postoperative period.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The total analgesic requirement was also significantly less in patients who received intraperitoneal instillation of drug before creation of pneumoperitoneum (1.34 &#x000b1; 0.52 g paracetamol) than patients who received after completion of surgery (2.4 &#x000b1; 0.97 g paracetamol). Maestroni <italic>et al</italic>. also observed a significantly lower total pain intensity and total analgesic requirement during initial 8 h postoperatively in patients who received ropivacaine preemptively.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Kim <italic>et al</italic>. also concluded intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine at the beginning of LC combined with NS infusion is an effective method for reducing pain after LC.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>However, Sozbilen <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that administration of ropivacaine preoperatively and postoperatively for LC has similar effects on postoperative pain and the stress response of patients.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Our findings are contradicted to Lee <italic>et al</italic>. who found that preemptive intraperitoneal bupivacaine had no significant effect on duration of first analgesic requirement and total analgesic requirements.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] That lack of efficacy might be because of the low dosage of intraperitoneal bupivacaine used (0.25% 40 ml) for coverage of the intraabdominal organ surface. In a systematic analysis to evaluate the effect of intraperitoneal local anesthetic on pain characteristics after LC. Choi <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that intraperitoneal local anesthetics exhibited beneficial effects on postoperative abdominal, visceral and shoulder pain in a resting state.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>There are certain limitations of our study. Pain perception is subjective and also related to anxiety which can affect the result. The individual requirement of analgesia also varies significantly so exact interpretation is difficult. We did not measure plasma level of ropivacaine, cortisol or catecholamine levels. All the patients were admitted for at least 24 h while in some centers laparoscopy is a day care procedure.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that analgesia administered before a nociceptive stimulus reduces the degree of sensitization produced in the nervous system and intraperioneal instillation of ropivacaine before creation of pneumoperitoneum produces a significant decline in pain scores in comparison to intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine after completion of surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Preemptive analgesia with
