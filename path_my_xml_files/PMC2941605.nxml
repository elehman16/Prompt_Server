In India, the most commonly occurring head and neck cancers are those of the oral cavity and the pharynx. The majority of these cancers present with stage III/IV disease. Surgery and radiation therapy are the main treatment modalities. Concomitant chemoradiation is being investigated with the goal of improved local control that translates into improved survival. In this background, we have started this prospective randomized trial to ascertain the dose, schedule and sequence of therapy and to note whether Vinorelbine as radiosensitizer is equally effective as Cisplatin, comparing compliance, local control and toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>Forty patients of advanced head and neck cancer were randomized into two arms. Arm A received weekly injection Cisplatin 40mg/m<sup>2</sup> along with radiation. Arm B received weekly injection of Vinorelbine 6mg/m<sup>2</sup> along with radiation. Radiotherapy was delivered at a dose of 6,600-7,000 Gy in conventional fractionation in a telecobalt machine.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The complete response (CR) rate was higher in arm B (90%) than in arm A (70%).

The overall male to female ratio is nearly 4:1. It usually occurs in the 5<sup>th</sup> decade and above. The prognosis of head and neck cancer depends on the primary site, grade and anatomical extent of the disease. Early-stage head and neck cancers can be cured with surgery and/or radiotherapy but, for advanced stages, the local failure rate sometimes approached as high as 50%. To improve the results, combined modality treatment with chemotherapy has been investigated. The three approaches to the use of primary chemotherapy are neoadjuvant chemotherapy,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] adjuvant chemotherapy and concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Concomitant chemoradiation is being investigated with the goals of improved local control translating into improved survival, reduction of distant metastasis and preservation of organ function. The purpose of administering chemotherapy and radiotherapy is to take advantage of the radiosensitizing capability of many of the active drugs for this disease and effect a substantial-enough increase in locoregional control, which would translate to increased survival.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Patients who received concomitant chemoradiotherapy had marginally improved rates of locoregional control and disease-free survival. This was observed primarily in patients with oropharyngeal cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] as compared to other cancers. The drugs most commonly employed as part of a radiation combined approach are Cisplatin, 5FU and hydoxyurea. Cisplatin has widespread use in combined modality treatment in lung cancers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] and head and neck cancers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] Recently, Vinorelbine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] was used as a radiosensitizer. A majority of the studies was performed using Cisplatin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] as a radiosensitizer, although some studies also support use of Vinorelbine as a radiosensitizer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was carried out in the radiotherapy department of I.P.G.M.E.R, Kolkata, from September 2004 to July 2005. Forty patients of head and neck cancer were randomized into two arms, with 20 patients in each arm.</p><p>Patients of head and neck carcinoma having stage II-IV disease with squamous cell histology were included in this trial. These patients had no prior surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The performance status was &#x0003e;70% (according to Karnofsky&#x02019;s scale). Hematological parameters were within the normal range, like hemoglobin &#x0003e;11 mg%, absolute neutrophil count &#x0003e;1,900, platelet count &#x0003e;1 lakh/mm<sup>3</sup>, serum bilirubin &#x0003c;1 mg%, liver enzymes within 1.5-times of the normal limit and serum creatinine &#x0003c;1.5 mg%. Patients were excluded from the study if they had already received some form of anticancer therapy, if there was presence of metastatic disease, if they had participated in a clinical trial in the last 30 days, if there was simultaneous participation in a clinical trial or if they had any uncontrollable systemic illness like diabetes, tuberculosis and hypertension.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Patients who fulfilled the above eligibility criteria were required to sign the informed consent form and were then randomized to assign either of the treatment arms.</p><p>Arm A: External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) along with weekly injection Cisplatin 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV.</p><p>Arm B: EBRT along with weekly Vinorelbine 6 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV.</p><p>The dose of EBRT was 66-70 Gy, with conventional fractionation, using a telecobalt machine with cord sparing after 4,400 cGy.</p><p>Response was assessed by local examination and indirect laryngoscopy 1 month after completion of radiotherapy. Regular follow-up was carried out at monthly intervals. Local control was recorded using the terminology complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and progressive disease (PD) (as per WHO definition).</p><p>Toxicity assessment was carried out weekly during treatment and thereafter monthly up to 3 months for acute toxicities using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Subsequently, patients were being followed-up monthly up to 6 months and then at 3-monthly intervals for any sign of recurrence and treatment-related morbidity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>From September 2004 to July 2005, 41 patients were enrolled.

The majority of the patients are in the range of 50&#x02013;70 years. Patients were predominantly male (95%). They had a good performance status.

If external beam radiation therapy is selected, it may be given with either conventional once-daily fractionation to 66-70 Gy in 2 Gy/fraction, 5 days a week in a continuous course or with an altered fractionation schedule. EBRT may also be delivered with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] to reduce the dose to the normal tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] The disadvantages of IMRT are that it is much more time consuming to plan and treat the patient, the dose distribution is often less homogeneous so that &#x0201c;hot spots&#x0201d; may increase the risk of late complication and the risk of marginal miss may be increased. Whether an altered fractionation schedule is better than a conventional one depends on the altered fractionation technique that is selected. Altered fractionation schedules shown to result in improved locoregional control rates are the University of Florida hyperfractionation technique and HD Anderson concomitant boost technique. The Randomized Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 90-03 found that acute toxicity is increased with altered fractionation whereas late toxicity is comparable with that of conventional fractionation.</p><p>Management of the neck is closely tied to management of the primary site.

Although toxicities like mucosal, hematologic and dermatologic were higher in they concomitant arm, they were manageable. All toxicities were significantly higher when Cisplatin was used as a radiosensitizer.
