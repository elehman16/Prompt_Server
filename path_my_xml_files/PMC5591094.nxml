It is the most common nail disorder in adults, accounting for up to 50% of all nail diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The most common therapeutic options are oral and topical antifungal agents. However, oral medications have more adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and potential drug interactions, and its clinical application is often limited, especially in patients with comorbidities.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Topical antifungal agents are often ineffective because of their limited ability to penetrate through the nail plate.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Therefore, many therapeutic trials have been conducted to find an alternative therapy that can increase the efficacy of onychomycosis treatment while avoiding its adverse effects.</p><p>In recent years, laser treatment of onychomycosis has garnered increasing attention. Currently used lasers for the treatment of onychomycosis are Nd:YAG laser, ultrapulse fractional carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser, 870/930&#x0200a;nm dual wavelength diode laser, and photodynamic therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Yang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> reported fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser with a total of 8 sessions within 3 months showed a clinical efficacy of 52.11% in the treatment of onychomycosis. Furthermore, there were 2 studies reported that fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser combined with a topical antifungal agent showed a clinical efficacy of 71% and 73.32% in the treatment of onychomycosis, suggesting the combination therapy had a higher efficacy for treating onychomycosis than fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser alone.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> It is generally believed that the mechanism by which fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treats onychomycosis may mainly through vaporization and decomposition of target's local tissue and its bactericidal effect. Fungi are extremely sensitive to temperature above 55&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C; the photothermal effect of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser can increase the temperature of local tissue, thus it plays a direct role in killing the fungi in the laser-treated affected nail.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Additionally, fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser makes the local tissue of affected nail vaporize and exfoliate, causing diffuse remodeling and at the same time destroys the fungal growth environment, thus contributing in fungal growth inhibition.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser can enhance the absorption of topical antifungal agents, thereby improving its efficacy.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> However, the main drawback is the lack of control group in their clinical trials, therefore further study is needed.</p><p>Luliconazole is a newly developed imidazole antifungal drugs, it exerts a broad spectrum of antifungal effect by blocking ergosterol biosynthesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> In this study, we used fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser combined with luliconazole 1% cream to treat onychomycosis. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser combined with luliconazole 1% cream for treating onychomycosis and to compare it with that of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser alone. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficacy and safety of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser therapy combined with luliconazole 1% cream.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a randomized, parallel group, 2-arm, positive-controlled, single-center, superiority trial with a 1:2 allocation ratio.

The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (trial registration, 2015-SRFA-032). All patients provided written informed consent. This study was conducted in accordance with CONSORT statement.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>The key inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of onychomycosis affecting fingernails and/or toenails by clinical nail morphology confirmed by positive fungal microscopy. Exclusion criteria were: patients with a history of keloid, localized bacterial infections, concomitant nail disease such as psoriasis, lichen planus or atopic dermatitis, or other skin diseases that may interfere with diagnosis and treatment; with allergy to drug used in the study; with heart, liver, kidney diseases, diabetes, or mental illness; had taken oral antifungal medication within the last 3 months or used topical antifungal medication within the last 2 weeks; had taken oral glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants within the last 3 months; with nail polish; and pregnant patients. Patients with negative fungal culture were not excluded if fungal microscopy was positive.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization, interventions, and sample size</title><p>Patients were randomized following simple randomization procedures (computerized random number generator) into 2 groups: control group or L group (31 patients, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;108 nails) only received laser treatment at 2-week intervals for 6 months; treatment group or L&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;D group (29 patients, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;115 nails) received laser treatment at 2-week intervals combined with luliconazole 1% cream once daily for 6 months.

To our knowledge, there were only 2 uncontrolled trials using fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser combined with a topical antifungal agent to treat onychomycosis. Lim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> were known to be the first to report the efficacy of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser combined with a topical antifungal agent to treat onychomycosis. They treated 24 patients (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;119 affected toenails) with a total of 3 sessions of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment at 4-week interval combined with amorolfine cream once daily within 3 months. At 3 months after the last treatment, they reported 71% of patients (17 patients) had fully or &#x0003e;60% normal-appearing nails. They only did fungal microscopy on patients with fully normal-appearing nails and all of them had a negative fungal microscopic result (50%, 12 patients).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Another trial was done by Bhatta et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> using a total of 3 sessions of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser at 4-week interval combined with once-daily application of terbinafine cream within 3 months to treat 75 patients (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;356 affected nails). The percentage of patients with fully or &#x0003e;60% normal-appearing nails at 3 months after the last treatment in their study was 73.32% (55 patients) and there were 94.66% of patients (71 patients) with a negative fungal microscopic result.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Similar to their studies, we found fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser combined with luliconazole 1% cream to be effective for treating onychomycosis with 69.6% of nails (80 nails) with fully or &#x0003e;60% normal appearance and 57.4% of nails (66 nails) with a negative fungal microscopic result. The treatment outcome (CER) was maintained at least 6 months posttreatment, and there was no obvious recurrence.</p><p>Although we used the same method as that used by Lim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> and Bhatta et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> to evaluate the clinical outcome, the clinical efficacy in our study was assessed from the percentage of nails with fully or &#x0003e;60% normal-appearance. Mycological cure in our study was also assessed from the percentage of nails with a negative fungal microscopic result, while Lim et al and Bhatta et al evaluated their results from the percentage of patients whose nails obtained a negative fungal microscopic result. Therefore, it makes comparison with the previous studies of Lim et al and Bhatta et al difficult. Nevertheless, the percentage of nails, instead of the percentage of patients, can better indicate the clinical efficacy and MCRs since the number of affected nails in each patient can vary.</p><p>In our study, the combined therapy was given within a period of 6 months, which was twice longer than those in the study of Lim et al and Bhatta et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Our team, Xu et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> treated 16 patients (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;29 affected nails) with onychomycosis using a long-pulsed 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser weekly and oral terbinafine daily for up to 6 months. Mycological and clinical examinations of each patient were performed at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks of treatment. The results showed the MCR (100%; 29 nails) and CER (96.55%; 28 nails) at 24 weeks of treatment were higher than the MCR (93.10%; 27 nails) and CER (86.21%; 25 nails) at 12 weeks of treatment, indicating that extended duration of treatment increased the efficacy of the treatment of onychomycosis. Therefore, we also extended the treatment duration in our study to achieve better efficacy.</p><p>To understand the patient's benefits of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser therapy combined with luliconazole 1% cream in the treatment of onychomycosis, we investigated the factors that influenced the therapeutic clinical efficacy. Our analysis showed that an initial nail's thickness of less than 2&#x0200a;mm and OSI score of less than 16 were the best predictors for therapeutic efficacy. Compared to fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser alone, fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment combined with luliconazole 1% cream showed higher efficacy in patients of all ages, male patients, nails with OSI score of more than 16, fully damaged nails, in finger/toenails other than thumb/big toenails, in toenails, and nails with a duration of disease &#x0003c;10 years.</p><p>Dermatophytes such as <italic>T rubrum</italic> and <italic>T mentagrophytes</italic> account for 80% to 90% of all cases, and <italic>C albicans</italic> accounts for approximately 70% of onychomycosis caused by yeasts.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Our study showed fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser combined with luliconazole 1% cream was effective to treat nails infected with <italic>T rubrum</italic> (62.1%; 36 nails), <italic>T mentagrophytes</italic> (66.7%; 8 nails), and <italic>C albicans</italic> (70%; 7 nails). However, there were no significant differences in the clinical efficacy rates in the groups treated with fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser and luliconazole 1% cream compared with the fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser group.</p><p>Studies evaluating monotherapy with topical antifungal agents for treating onychomycosis have not been satisfying, except in a very mild case.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Lim et al also reported that their patients were treated by topical monotherapy before laser treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> All patients had failed to improve with topical therapy for their onychomycosis, before undergoing combined therapy with fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser and topical amorolfine. Luliconazole is a newly developed imidazole antifungal drugs, they inhibit the activity of the enzyme lanosterol 14&#x003b1;-demethylase, thereby blocking the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, a necessary constituent of the fungal cell wall.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Studies have shown that luliconazole has a good antifungal activity, such as against dermatophytes, <italic>Malassezia</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic>.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> However, we had treated another group of patients with only luliconazole 1% cream, but the results were of little value. On the other hand, Yang et al conducted a trial using only fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser to treat onychomycosis and the result showed a CER of 52.11%. Therefore, we designated fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment as the control and did not include topical antifungal monotherapy in our study.</p><p>Although the efficacy of monotherapy with topical antifungal agent has not been satisfying, there were significantly higher clinical efficacy (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004) and MCRs (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006) in the group treated with both fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser and luliconazole 1% cream compared with those of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser alone. Studies suggest that fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser therapy creates columns of destruction that enhance the penetration of topical antifungal agents into the nail bed or matrix, thereby improving the efficacy of onychomycosis treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Our study confirmed that topical antifungal agent when combined with fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser had a significant efficacy.</p><p>Evaluation of patient satisfaction at the end of our study showed there were 41.4% of patients (21 patients) who were very satisfied with the results of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment combined with luliconazole 1% cream. There were a lower percentage of very satisfied patients in our study compared to that of Lim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> (59%; 14 patients) and Bhatta et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> (66.67%; 50 patients), although the CER of our study was quite satisfying. This might be because of the long treatment duration and the inconvenience of repeated hospital visits. Moreover, we assessed the clinical and mycological cure based on the percentage of nails, instead of the percentage of patients, which was used in the previous studies; therefore, this may also explain the lack of consistency between the CER and the level of patient satisfaction in our study.</p><p>Some patients experienced mild pain during laser treatment, but there was no bleeding or oozing during or after treatment. There were no adverse reactions reported during the observation period. Fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser has the advantage of smaller diseased skin tissue damage, faster recovery, less pain treatment, can be used in patients with comorbid conditions, and no risk of developing resistance.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>There are a number of limitations to our study. First, there was no blinding. Thus, knowledge of group assignment may affect the patients&#x02019; behavior in the trial and their responses to subjective outcome measures. Second, our study had a limited number of cases. Third, we only evaluated the mycological cure from a fungal microscopy without a fungal culture examination. Further randomized controlled blinded trial with a larger sample size, more follow-ups during treatment, and a longer follow-up time is needed. Further study is also required to determine the optimal settings and duration of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we found that the fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser combined with luliconazole 1% cream is a safe and effective treatment for the treatment of onychomycosis, and its efficacy is better than fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment alone.
