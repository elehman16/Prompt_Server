autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in the dysferlin (<italic>DYSF</italic>) gene encoding the dysferlin protein. DYSF mutations lead to a wide range of muscular phenotypes, with the most prominent being Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We assessed the one-year-natural course of dysferlinopathy, and the safety and efficacy of deflazacort treatment in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. After one year of natural course without intervention, 25 patients with genetically defined dysferlinopathy were randomized to receive deflazacort and placebo for six months each (1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day in month one, 1&#x000a0;mg/kg every 2nd day during months two to six) in one of two treatment sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During one year of natural course, muscle strength declined about 2% as measured by CIDD (Clinical Investigation of Duchenne Dystrophy) score, and 76 Newton as measured by hand-held dynamometry. Deflazacort did not improve muscle strength. In contrast, there is a trend of worsening muscle strength under deflazacort treatment, which recovers after discontinuation of the study drug. During deflazacort treatment, patients showed a broad spectrum of steroid side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Deflazacort is not an effective therapy for dysferlinopathies, and off-label use is not warranted. This is an important finding, since steroid treatment should not be administered in patients with dysferlinopathy, who may be often misdiagnosed as polymyositis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This clinical trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClincalTrials.gov">http://www.ClincalTrials.gov</ext-link>, identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00527228?term=NCT00527228&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00527228</ext-link>, and was always freely accessible to the public.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)</kwd><kwd>Dysferlinopathy</kwd><kwd>Therapy</kwd><kwd>Deflazacort</kwd><kwd>Muscle strength</kwd><kwd>Steroids</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysferlinopathies are autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin (<italic>DYSF</italic>; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] gene number 603009, Chr 2p13, GenBank NM_003494.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Dysferlinopathies are rare muscular dystrophies, as the number of adult patients is estimated between 1/100,000 to 1/200,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Miyoshi myopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (MM) and distal anterior compartment myopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] (DMAT), both allelic distal muscle disorders that preferentially affect the gastrocnemius or tibial muscle, and limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2B with characteristic proximal weakness at onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] represent different phenotypic presentations of dysferlinopathy. Dysferlinopathy arises from mutations in the dysferlin gene, which contains 55 exons and spans a region of 150&#x000a0;kb. The clinical picture is usually less severe than most other autosomal recessive LGMD forms, although there is a wide intra- and interfamilial variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Confinement to wheelchair may occur, on average 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;years after onset of the disease. Cardiac and respiratory muscles are not involved in the majority of patients, and patients have normal intelligence. Serum creatine kinase (CK) is always considerably elevated even in the pre-clinical stages. Muscle biopsies typically show dystrophic patterns, additionally, inflammatory changes are frequently seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Protein analyses in LGMD2B usually show a total deficiency of dysferlin, both through immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, but partial deficiency is observed in some patients. A large mutational spectrum with more than 400 different sequence variants in the <italic>DYSF</italic> gene has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, identical mutations in patients even within the same family expressing LGMD2B or MM phenotypes may suggest a role for modifier genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>So far, the natural course of the disease and the mean decline in muscle strength and daily-life activities have only been described in a larger cohort of clinically, but not genetically identified dysferlinopathy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Steroids have proven efficacy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], possibly due, at least in part, to the anti-inflammatory effect of the drug. However, immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and cyclosporine did not result in a similar increase of muscle strength as observed with steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It was hypothesized that steroids may have other or additional modes of action in DMD such as a membrane-stabilizing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Dysferlinopathies show marked inflammation in muscle biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Anecdotal reports have suggested that steroids do not improve muscle strength in dysferlinopathy patients, but this was not fully explored in a randomized, controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>This clinical trial was conducted for assessment of the natural course of the disease during a one-year pre-treatment phase and for evaluation of efficacy and side effects of deflazacort in patients with dysferlinopathy. We wanted to assess if deflazacort treatment results in improvement of muscle strength and function compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population and inclusion criteria</title><p>25 patients (12 male, 13 female) from 18 different families between 20 and 60&#x000a0;years (mean age 32.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.2) with clinical, immunohistochemical, immunoblot and genetic criteria of dysferlinopathy were included in the clinical trial. Three patients presented with MM, two with DMAT phenotype, while the remaining 20 patients mainly showed LGMD involvement. Eight patients had homozygous, 15 patients compound heterozygous mutations in the dysferlin gene; in two patients (patient 1 and 2, siblings), only one heterozygous mutation was detected, since the second described genetic modification may only represent a polymorphism. Within the patients with compound heterozygous mutations, deletion of exon 31 was detected in one patient. In two patients, three compound heterozygous pathogenic dysferlin mutations were detected (see patient details in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). HyperCKemia was noted in nine of our patients between 4 and 19&#x000a0;years prior to disease onset. Patients &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years of age, confined to bed or wheelchair, with other neurologic or internal diseases or with former or current steroid treatment were not included.

The cross-over design was chosen for several reasons: a) patients with dysferlinopathy are extremely rare, therefore, a sufficient power can be reached with a small sample size by the chosen design, b) in a cross-over design, each patient can serve as his/her own control, c) the willingness to take part in a clinical study is much higher in a cross-over design, since each patient will receive the study drug. In a 12-months pre-treatment phase, the natural history of the disease was assessed. The 12-month visit served as a baseline control prior to treatment; during the two cross-over treatment periods response to treatment was evaluated by comparing evaluations at start and end of each period. All examinations took place at the principal investigator&#x02019;s center, the other six participating centers helped with patient recruitment and transfer to the clinical trial center.</p><p>All patients had a one-year follow-up of natural history with examinations in six-months intervals prior to the treatment phase. After one year, patients were randomized to six months deflazacort or placebo; after a three-months wash-out, there was cross-over to the alternate treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the clinical trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1750-1172-8-26-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Study drug</title><p>Since weight gain could be less pronounced in deflazacort treatment compared to other steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we decided for deflazacort as study drug, and for an alternate day regimen (month 2 to month 6: 1&#x000a0;mg/kg every 2nd day) after the loading phase (month 1: 1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day), since significant improvement of strength along with only mild side effects have been reported with this treatment schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast to the results of alternate-day therapy with prednisone (1.25 and 2.5&#x000a0;mg/kg every other day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], Angelini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] used a dosage of deflazacort of 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg every other day and showed sustained improvement over 2&#x000a0;years, including improvement in average muscle strength and in timed function testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Testing was performed by two experienced neurologists after sufficient training with clinical trial procedures.

It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. Accordingly, the SF-36 has proven useful in surveys of general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of diseases, and in differentiating the health benefits produced by a wide range of different treatments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sf-36.org">http://www.sf-36.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory testing</title><p>On each study visit, safety laboratory testing for selected electrolytes, liver, kidney and inflammation analytics and hematology variables (sodium, potassium, creatinine, urea, ASAT, ALAT, GGT, CK, ESR, CRP, blood cell count) were performed, and adverse events were recorded. Genetic testing for dysferlin was carried out for all patients by the Department of Human Genetics at the University of W&#x000fc;rzburg. All 55 coding exons and flanking splice regions of the dysferlin gene were amplified with exon-specific primers, followed by direct sequencing on both strands. If only one mutation was found by sequencing, gene dosis was measured for most of the exons using the MLPA kit P268-A1 from MRC Holland.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Randomization to the two sequences of treatment was done by the MD-NET Clinical Trials Coordination Centre (CTCC) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.md-net.org">http://www.md-net.org</ext-link>) using the SAS 8 statistical package procedure &#x0201c;PROG PLAN&#x0201d;. After screening for eligibility, patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive either deflazacort or placebo for the first treatment phase. Patients baseline characteristics with regard to sex, age, body weight and muscle strength assessed by CIDD and HHD did not show relevant differences between treatment groups. The study drug and the placebo preparation were disposed by the hospital pharmacy, a number was communicated to identify the study drug for each patient, and the drug was identically prepacked to maintain the masking for the patient and investigator. To maintain the masking for the trial statistician, reading permission was withdrawn from the computer directory containing randomization information.</p><p>The data of all visits were summarized descriptively, using arithmetic mean and standard deviation for numeric data (including changes within each trial period (natural history, crossover periods 1 and 2)) and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical data. For crossover analyses, a mixed model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] was applied with the sequence of the two treatments within the crossover design, the two treatment periods and treatment (deflazacort or placebo) as fixed factors and patients nested within sequence as random factor. This procedure was also chosen to substitute missing values in four patients of this study. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was used for the efficacy analyses of the two primary endpoints. In addition, a non-parametric procedure25 was applied which allows to assess the treatment effect, the carry-over effect from period 1 to period 2 (utilizing Wilcoxon U-tests) and the period effect (via signed rank tests) within the crossover design. The selection of this analysis procedure was mainly based upon the small sample size of this trial with non-normal distribution of the outcome measures. The per-protocol population (PP) was used for all efficacy analyses of secondary endpoints as specified in the study protocol. This includes all patients who have completed the second crossover period.</p><sec><title>Sample size considerations</title><p>The clinical trial intended to show superior efficacy of deflazacort over placebo in the 2 primary endpoints. The available literature on clinical trials in the investigated indication did not provide sufficiently valid data whereon a statistical sample size calculation could be based. Therefore, sample size calculation was based on effect size consideration. An effect size of d&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x003b4;/&#x003c3;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5 represents a moderate superiority of deflazacort compared to placebo according to Cohen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Effect sizes below d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5 are usually considered as clinically not meaningful, effect sizes of d&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.8, on the other side, would be associated with clinically relevant benefit of the deflazacort treatment. To demonstrate a difference between deflazacort and placebo with an effect size of at least 0.5 in a crossover design, a number of N&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 patients were planned to complete the trial with the 2nd crossover period. The following assumptions are made for this sample size determination: &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.0125 (1-sided, adjusted according to Bonferroni-Holm for 2 primary outcome measures), 1-&#x000df;&#x02009;=&#x02009;80%, d&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x003b4;/&#x003c3;&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;0.5 and a correlation between the outcome measures in the 2 crossover periods of &#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;0.6). Allowing a drop-out rate of about 20%, we have aimed for a total sample size of 35 patients. Previous studies in DMD patients using higher daily dose steroid regimen reported drop-out rates of less than 6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The recruitment of 35 patients was more difficult than expected; only 25 patients were included between September 2003 and February 2008. However, no patient showed improvement of muscle strength &#x02013; although blinding was sustained, it became clear, that the study drug did not have a positive effect, and may even have a negative effect on muscle strength. Therefore, a conditional power calculation based on the first 18 patients was performed in February 2008 for answering the following question: is it feasible according to the interim results, that an efficacy of deflazacort versus placebo can be proven, if the clinical trial will be conducted as scheduled (recruitment of 10 more patients)? The result of the power analysis showed that the probability for proving efficacy of deflazacort versus placebo was highly unlikely, even if the clinical trial was continued according to plan. Therefore, we decided to terminate the study and perform a final analysis with all available data (stop for futility). Before the final decision was reached to close the clinical trial, another seven patients were included to the natural course part or proceeded to the medication phase. However, the data of these patients was not included in the interim analysis, since only participants who completed the full trial period were analyzed. In total, 37 patients were screened for this study. Twelve patients could not be included due to loss of ambulation (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), earlier use of steroids (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), lack of compliance (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4). Of 25 patients who entered the natural history phase, none discontinued this part of the trial prematurely; two patients had only just finished the natural history phase, when the trial was discontinued; 23 patients were randomized into the crossover treatment. The final analysis population consists of 23 patients, of whom four (patients 12, 13, 21, 23) had not fully completed both treatment phases at the date of the interim analysis, two under deflazacort, and two under placebo.</p><sec><title>Primary efficacy variables</title><sec><title>Muscle strength assessed by CIDD</title><p>Initial testing of manual muscle strength assessed by CIDD in both groups (sequence deflazacort-placebo, and placebo-deflazacort) showed not much difference between the two groups regarding basic muscle strength (between 77% and 80% CIDD). All patients declined during the natural history, at 6&#x000a0;months and even more pronounced at 12&#x000a0;months. In the deflazacort-placebo sequence, patient&#x02019;s strength declined during deflazacort treatment, partly recovered during the steroid wash-out, but further declined during placebo administration. Patients in the placebo-deflazacort sequence constantly lost strength over the entire trial duration. None of these differences were significant; there was a numerical trend to a slightly larger loss (by 1.2 units in the CIDD) during deflazacort treatment compared to placebo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>a; change between start and end of pooled crossover periods: deflazacort: d&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;2.24; standard deviation (SD)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.0; placebo: d&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1.00, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.2; mixed model result (ITT): p(treatment)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1558; 95% confidence interval [&#x02212;3.01; 0.52] in disfavor of deflazacort; non-parametric analysis (PP): p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4375).

muscle strength declined about 2% as measured by CIDD, and 76&#x000a0;N as measured by HHD. These findings were supported by comparable worsening of the secondary outcome measurements Handgrip, NSS, Vignos Scale and HMAS. Arguably, scores derived from manual muscle testing do not represent interval data; thus one cannot accurately measure percentage change. However, using more quantitative measures of strength demonstrated a similar lack of benefit as did the other secondary outcome measures. Additionally, Vignos and HMAS are fairly rough scales, not suitable for identifying more subtle changes over a one year period in a slowly progressive muscle disease. Vignos Scale and HMAS both showed worsening, slightly in favor of placebo. The Hammersmith Motor Ability Score thereby showed overall worsening, not restricted to walking ability. Interestingly, timed tests did not detect relevant changes illustrating that tests measuring changes in complex activities in milliseconds may not perfectly mirror and have an impact on changes in daily life. Additionally, QSMT by torque measurement die not prove useful to detect reliable changes. Patient-reported quality of life assessments remained fairly unchanged during this first year or improved slightly, mainly in the dimensions, which were impaired in this study population (physical functioning, mental health, standardized physical component scale).</p><p>Interestingly, CK levels remained stable during placebo administration, and decreased during deflazacort treatment, but non-corresponding with clinical improvement. This finding confirms that steroids are not just ineffective in dysferlinopathy, but show different activities, thereby enhancing the internal validity of this clinical trial.</p><p>Non-recoverable loss of strength in patients with dysferlin-deficiency, who were initially misdiagnosed as inflammatory myopathy and treated with corticosteroids, had been suggested by Hoffmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in an uncontrolled series of 20 patients prior to this study.</p><p>Interestingly, we detected reduced dysferlin levels in patients with inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis, inclusion body myositis) treated with steroids (unpublished data). If a reduction in dysferlin-expression would occur in dysferlinopathy patients, then it would affect patients with residual or partially functional dysferlin protein more than patients without any protein. However, we did not obtain muscle biopsies of the patients in our study during or after treatment.</p><p>In our trial, patients did not improve during the deflazacort period of treatment. In contrast, under deflazacort treatment, there was a trend to muscle strength worsening, which recovered after discontinuation of the study drug during the wash-out period. In patients with residual dysferlin protein levels, the negative effect of deflazacort was more pronounced than in patients with absent dysferlin protein. However, due to the small sample size of the subgroups, this finding is mainly hypothetic and has not been described before, but we may speculate that steroids have a negative effect on dysferlin expression or function.</p><p>In contrast, Belanto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] hypothesized that a key therapeutic benefit of glucocorticoids may be the up-regulation of dysferlin as an important component of glucocorticoid-enhanced myogenic differentiation. However, this was based on experimentation in cultured C2C12 cells that may not be an adequate model for adult, dystrophic muscle. Further work is required to understand the exact molecular action of steroids on dysferlin expression or function in mammalian muscle, whether it is a direct or an indirect effect.</p><p>The SF-36 scores in subscales physical role function and general health perception as well in the standardized physical component scale at baseline showed similar values in dysferlinopathies as in other chronic diseases, and improved slightly during the 1-year natural history phase, possibly due to better patient support and care during the ongoing clinical trial. No impaired quality of life compared to the German general population were observed in the emotional subscales of the SF-36. During deflazacort treatment - in line with the results of the other outcome measures, e.g. strength testing - SF-36 ratings worsened in all subscales, but remained stable or improved slightly during placebo administration, most pronounced for mental health, emotional role and vitality subscales and the standardized mental component scale. The CGI global severity score did not change comparing starting- and endpoint of the trial, suggesting that relevant differences of disease severity were not fully recognizable by the investigator within 27&#x000a0;months of the trial duration.</p><p>During deflazacort treatment, we observed a broad spectrum of known side effects. Our study shows that deflazacort is not an effective therapy for dysferlinopathies, and may even harm patients. Therefore, off-label use is not warranted. Even if this result is not what we would have hoped for, it is nevertheless an important finding, since there is good reason now to definitely withhold steroid treatment from patients with dysferlinopathy.</p><p>In this study, we were able to establish data regarding the natural course of dysferlinopathies that improve our understanding of the clinical problems these patients are confronted with and may serve as reference for future studies. As measures of muscular function in our sample of juvenile and adult ambulatory patients, CIDD, HHD and NSS have proven useful in showing a change in muscle strength and daily activities within one to two years, while timed tests seemed not suitable. Additionally it became clear that a quality of life measure, specifically adapted on patients with muscle diseases would be warranted, since SF-36 and CGI do not adequately mirror the specific problems of muscular dystrophy patients.</p><p>Although no major therapeutic breakthrough has been achieved and curative treatment modalities are not yet applicable, life expectancy and quality of life of dysferlinopathy patients could be remarkably improved by establishing a drug therapy, capable of delaying the dystrophic process and improving muscle strength and function. Unfortunately, no such therapy is available yet, and treatment of dysferlinopathies is mainly based on symptomatic treatment. Therefore, the results of this clinical trial &#x02013; even being negative - are warranted and may influence further guidelines for steroid treatment in dysferlinopathies. Furthermore, our assessment of the natural history of the disease will provide new insights in the clinical understanding of dysferlinopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This clinical trial was done as a research project of the German network on muscular dystrophies (MD-NET, #01GM0601, research project R19 and S1) funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Bonn, Germany).

Since 1997, she is member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Germany (DGM), and ad hoc reviewer for Telethon and several peer-reviewed journals.</p><p><italic>Hanns Lochm&#x000fc;ller</italic> is Professor Hanns Lochm&#x000fc;ller trained as a neurologist in Munich (Germany) and Montreal (Canada). He was appointed chair of experimental myology in the neuromuscular research group at the Institute of Genetic Medicine of Newcastle University in 2007. Hanns has a longstanding interest in the molecular genetics of the inherited myopathies and neuromuscular junction disorders, and is interested in the further study of animal models of these disorders as a means to understand their pathophysiology as well as to develop means to monitor disease progression and therapeutic interventions. Ongoing work in these areas in cell and animal models of muscular dystrophy is concentrating on gene transfer, pharmacological interventions and cell therapy. Hanns is co-founder and former coordinator of the German muscular dystrophy network (MD-NET), and scientific coordinator of EuroBioBank, a European network of biobanks for rare disorders. He led the activity on &#x0201c;patient registries and biobanks&#x0201d; for TREAT-NMD answas elected Chair of the TREAT-NMD Alliance Executive Committee in April 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Gabriele Ihorst, IMBI Institute for Medical Biometry and Informatics, Freiburg, Germany and Ralf Kohnen, RPS Research Germany GmbH, N&#x000fc;rnberg, Germany.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Elmar Dunkl, RPS Research Germany GmbH, N&#x000fc;rnberg, Germany and Gabriele Ihorst, IMBI Institute for Medical Biometry and Informatics, Freiburg, Germany for statistical data analysis.
