Different types of bursitis, including ischiogluteal, greater trochanter, pes anserine, prepatellar, popliteal, and retrocalcaneal bursitis are the causes of pain in lower extremities of patients referring to treatment centers. Most of these patients recover spontaneously, by conservative treatments and activity modification.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Inflammation of a bursa located below pes anserine tendon (at the junction of semitendinosus, Sartorius, and gracilis muscle tendons with the anteromedial proximal tibia) is called pes anserine bursitis (PAB). In most cases, the occurrence of PAB in patients, cannot be proved;[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] so the diagnosis of PAB syndrome is frequently base on clinical features.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Ultrasonography can facilitate the diagnosis of PAB.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, in most suspected cases ultrasound findings are lacking.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In a study, only 2.5% of these patients showed radiologic signs of PAB in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] therefore the diagnosis of PAB cannot be based solely on MRI findings, but it is helpful for ruling out other structural causes of proximal tibial pain such as stress fracture and bone cysts.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Common biomechanical deficiencies that may occur along with this disease include weakness of core muscles, weakness of medial hamstring muscles, and weakness of hip adductors. Initial treatment includes ice, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to reduce inflammation and pain.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Furthermore, using short-term knee orthosis is very important to reduce the pain.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Rehabilitation of such patients includes increasing the flexibility, stretching, and endurance of pes anserine muscles; however, the kinetic chain must be considered.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Use of phonophoresis and iontophoresis may be suitable for treatment.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In cases where conservative treatments fail or when severe pain causes functional limitations, local corticosteroid injection is used.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] There has been recently a strong tendency toward using extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in tendon pathologies. The success rate of ESWT in treating epicondylitis, plantar fasciitis, rotator cuff tendinitis, Achilles tendinitis, and jumper's knee is reported to be 60&#x02013;80%.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Because the studies on treating PAB with ESWT are very limited, we decided to investigate the effect of this method on reducing the pain in chronic PAB so that if this method is proved to be effective, we can recommend it as a treatment for PAB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This single-blind randomized, clinical controlled trial was conducted in 2013&#x02013;2014 on patients with chronic PAB referred to Out Patients Department Clinics of Physical Medicine Department of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic PAB (pain for at least 3 months and point tenderness at the insertion of pes anserine tendon on anteromedial, proximal aspect of tibia), who were refractory to conservative treatments such as ice, acetaminophen, NSAID or physiotherapy were included. The patients were randomly divided into two 20-member experimental groups (ESWT and sham ESWT) after diagnosis by a physical medicine specialist and differentiating from other causes of pain on medial side of knee such as medial collateral ligament injury according to history and clinical examination. Patients with degenerative or non degenerative neurological diseases (change of patient's perception), history of coagulopathy, cancer, cardiac pacemaker, pregnancy, fractures below the knee during the past year, history of corticosteroid injection during the past month, knee effusion, and taking anticoagulants were not included. Considering type I error (alpha) =0.05 and study power = 80%, the sample size was calculated for at least 20 patients in each group. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. First, the mean pain score in each group was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) and McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ) before the intervention. Then the intervention consisting of one session of ESWT per week (using focus probe, 4 Hz frequency, 1500 pulses and 0.15 mj/mm<sup>2</sup> energy per se ssion) that was performed during three consecutive weeks. For the placebo group sham treatment was done where standard contact of focus probe with the skin was provided. The machine makes a noise with every shock wave delivered and, in order to enhance the sham design, minimal energy pulses (0.04 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) were generated. In both groups, the patients could use hot water bags or 400 mg gelofen BID to reduce their pain. They also were trained in hamstring stretching exercises (3 times a day, 3 times each, and each time for 30 s). The patients started exercising since the beginning of the study and continued it up to the end of the study. Pain scores of all patients were again measured using VAS and MPQ (total pain index, present pain index [PPI]) immediately after the intervention (at the end of 3<sup>rd</sup> week) and after 8 weeks. Using SPSS (version 19.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA), the independent <italic>t</italic>-test, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests, and Friedman test, the pain scores of patients were statistically analyzed and compared to the two groups and to each other (in terms of time and intra-group comparison). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as the significance level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Forty patients (aged 35&#x02013;65 years) were enrolled in this study and were randomly divided into two groups.

The sham ESWT group consisted of 5 (25%) males and 15 (75%) females with a mean age of 50.2 &#x000b1; 8.1 years. There was no significant difference between the mean ages of patients in both groups.

There are various options for the treatment of PAB (rest, ice, NSIAD, physical therapy, injection), but a lot of them are not satisfactory effective, and some of them are associated with risks. For example, glucocorticoid injections can provide temporary pain relief, but care should be taken to avoid injecting any of the three tendons converging at the pes anserinus; injection within the tendons themselves can weaken these structures and intensify the patient's pain.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] One of the new methods to reduce the tendon injuries is using shock waves. There is a growing tendency to use the ESWT and to determine its mechanism in tendon pathology; which done with electromagnetic stimulation and producing low level energy wave which may be effective on increasing blood flow in the treated area. Nowadays, various procedures are used for treatment that we can point to improving muscles movement by means of decreasing passive muscle tone and increase muscle movement range. Experimental results show that ESWT increases neovascularization along with increased angiogenic growth index in the tendon, bone, and tendon-bone junction. Neovascularization may play an important role in blood circulation improvement and tendon repair. There is a close clinical relationship between decreased substance <italic>P</italic> concentration and pain treatment in ESWT on the tendon. Moreover, it seems that nitric oxide plays a fundamental role in the molecular mechanism of ESWT. Changes in the concentration of internal mediators support the anti-inflammatory effects of this treatment.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] According to our results, although the pain intensity in both groups was significantly reduced over the experimental period, the average score of pain in the ESWT group immediately after intervention (3<sup>rd</sup> week) and 8 weeks after treatment was significantly lower than the Sham group based on VAS and MPQ indices. Other treatment methods such as ice, acetaminophen or massage may have little effect on reducing the pain, and some of them are associated with risks. For example injection within the tendons themselves can weaken these structures and intensify the patient's pain. Moreover; we cannot use NSAIDs in chronic renal failure or glucocorticoid injections in patients with diabetes. Hence, according to other available researches about the efficacy of ESWT on bursitis and tendinitis and also based on our results, we can recommend ESWT as an effective and safe method. The results of a study by Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. on the treatment of knee osteoarthritis showed that ESWT reduces pain and improves knee function during the 12 weeks of treatment as compared with placebo.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In a systematic review, the effects of focus-ESWT and radial pulse therapy on musculoskeletal diseases of the soft tissue have been compared. The results showed that focus-ESWT is an effective in the treatment of plantar fasciitis and calcific tendinitis while radial pulse therapy is an effective in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. It appears that the focus-ESWT is dose-dependent. There is some low-value evidence indicating that low dose focus-ESWT, and radial pulse therapy are ineffective in the treatment of rotator cuff diseases. There are mixed results on the lateral epicondylitis.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furia <italic>et al</italic>. found that low-energy radial ESWT is effective in the treatment of chronic patellar tendinopathy.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In another study, the impact of ESWT with platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection on the chronic patellar tendinopathy in athletes was investigated. During the 12 months follow-up, both groups showed significant improvement. Although the group that received PRP showed higher improvement at 6 and 12 months, both groups were similar in early follow-up.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In a study by Henk <italic>et al</italic>., the therapeutic effects of focus and radial ESWT in the treatment of patellar tendinopathy were compared. The patients in each group were treated during three sessions (1 session/week). In each group, a specific exercise program (eccentric decline squat training) began 2 weeks after the last treatment session and continued until the end of the study period (12 weeks). No significant differences were observed between the effects of both methods.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] A placebo-controlled trial of ESWT by Vahdatpour <italic>et al</italic>., in subjects with chronic plantar fasciitis indicated a superior improvement in the active treatment than the placebo group.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In another placebo-controlled trial by Vahdatpour <italic>et al</italic>., it seems that ESWT have positive effects on treatment, quicker return to daily activities, and quality-of-life improvement on frozen shoulder.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Furthermore, a placebo-controlled trial confirmed that ESWT is a safe and effective method in patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome in short-term.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Regarding PAB, there are very limited studies, and we found only one study published in the literature[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in which the therapeutic effect of ESWT on PAB in 28 patients was investigated. In that study, shock wave therapy was performed on patients after a local anesthetic with focus probe. The results, 180 days after treatment, were as follows: Excellent (44%), good (38.2%), fair (2.9%), and poor (14.7%). They concluded that, ESWT was found to be a noninvasive and safe treatment for PAB in patients not responding to other conservative treatments. Hence, their findings are as compatible with our results in this research.</p><p>Among the limitations of this study, we can point to failure to complete the process of the patients and using several unreported self-treatments by the patients simultaneously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>According to the results of the present study, ESWT could be an effective and safe method of treatment and reducing the pain in chronic anserine bursitis.
