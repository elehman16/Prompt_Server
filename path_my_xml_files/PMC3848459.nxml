A review of the literature reported that almost one third of aged care residents have depressive symptoms, while an estimated 10% of aged care residents meet criteria for a current diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite the awareness of the high prevalence of depression in the aged care population, the high occurrence and under-treatment of depression within aged care settings is concerning, with studies indicating that depressive illness is associated with increased mortality risk of chronic disease, and the requirement for higher levels of supported care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In addition, more than half of the aged care population is estimated to demonstrate Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), such as agitation, verbal and physical aggression, sleep disturbance, and wandering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Research has demonstrated that these disturbances are not well managed by staff in the aged care sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This is of particular concern as the failure to adequately care for older people with BSPD is associated with serious adverse outcomes, including increased falls and injury, the use of restraints, social isolation, admission to a psychiatric inpatient ward, and stress and burnout among care staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Aged care staff have the potential to play a key role in the detection, assessment, management, and ongoing monitoring of mental health disorders among their care recipients. However, research suggests that these staff receive little training in mental health and commonly hold misconceptions about disorders such as depression and BPSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and as a result, have demonstrated poor skills in managing residents with these disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the project described in this paper, senior clinical and organisational leaders as well as senior Registered Nurses (RNs) and Personal Care Assistants (PCAs) will participate in a transformational training program to better detect and manage depression and BPSD. The program also focuses on how to improve workplace climate and effective leadership in mental health practices. Transformational training is an approach that is specifically designed to address factors related to organisational leadership and workplace climate, and so ensure that organisational barriers to the effective implementation of training into practice are resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Research has confirmed that transformational training leads to increased trust, commitment, staff engagement, perceived management support, and cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which are fundamental to effective and sustained change in organisational practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This, in turn, will allow these staff to encourage, inspire and motivate other staff to internalise and routinely use strategies to manage depression and BPSD and referral practices.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to outline the hypotheses of the current study, to describe the method utilized in the study design, and the development and proposed evaluation of the <italic>Staff as Change Agents Program</italic> - an educational and transformational training program for professional care staff in residential aged care.</p><sec><title>Hypotheses and expected outcomes</title><p>It is hypothesised that the transformational training program will be superior to care as usual in terms of:</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;Organisational strategies to manage depression and BPSD, and</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;Staff knowledge and skills in the provision of mental health care;</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;Workplace climate factors such as staff trust, teamwork/cohesion, communication and supportive workplace relations;</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;Staff factors such as stress, job satisfaction, and turnover; and</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;Severity of resident depression and BPSD.</p><p>It is also hypothesised that supplementing the transformational training program with clinical support from a mental health nurse specialist will lead to greater benefits than the same program without clinical support.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A cluster randomised controlled design will be employed in this study, with participating facilities allocated to one of three conditions. The first condition will implement the training program in six facilities. The second condition will involve the implementation of the training program in another six facilities with the additional provision of clinical support to assist staff in these facilities with the roll out of the strategies and training offered in the program. Clinical support will be provided by an experienced and appropriately trained mental health specialist who will be situated within each facility for approximately one day per week for a six month period. The third condition will include six facilities that will participate in our project as a &#x02018;care as usual&#x02019; control group. All participating facilities will be randomly allocated to one of these three conditions, and the control condition will have access to the training program at the end of their participation in the no-intervention condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Target population</title><p>A total of 108 staff will participate in the study, including 54 senior staff (i.e., 3 facility managers and/or RNs from each of the 18 facilities) and 54 senior PCAs (i.e., 3 PCAs from each of the 18 facilities).</p><p>A total of 360 residents will be recruited to participate in the study. Across each of the 18 facilities, 10 residents with dementia who present with BPSD will be selected through consultation with facility staff. Similarly, 10 residents with undetected and untreated depression will be recruited across all 18 facilities. Initially depressed residents will be identified through examination of resident files and existing documentation collected for every Australian resident (known as the Aged Care Funding Instrument [ACFI]), which includes a depression screening instrument &#x02013; the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However final recruitment will be based on a Research Fellow conducting the Cornell Scale and selecting residents with a Cornell score of 8 and above (must include low mood in symptom count).</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention program</title><p>The four-session <italic>Staff as Change Agents &#x02013; Enhancing and Sustaining Mental Health in Aged Care</italic> program was developed based on evidence from the researchers&#x02019; previously established training programs, previous findings in relation to organizational barriers in aged care, and current programs using transformational training in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. An additional booster session focussed on organizational barriers to mental health care is also included four weeks after the completion of the program. The transformational training program is a multi-faceted approach that trains staff in the detection and management of depression and BPSD, and then develops leaders&#x02019; abilities to support staff through organisational change. Specifically, it trains staff in how to encourage, inspire and motivate other staff to internalise and routinely use strategies to manage depression and BPSD and referral practices. It enables staff to see these strategies as important and meaningful to residents and the teams themselves. The training also highlights the relational aspects of teams, providing leaders with training in developing trust, cohesion and communication amongst team members (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This training approach is vastly different from the way that aged care teams typically function at present, with for example, managers often engaging in transactional behavior that try to gain staff compliance via offering rewards, or punishing deviations from procedures &#x02013; a managerial style that results in emotional exhaustion, staff burnout, and poor adherence to workplace initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Delivery format and content of the </bold><bold><italic>Staff as Change Agents &#x02013; Enhancing and Sustaining Mental Health in Aged Care </italic></bold><bold>training program</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Session 1</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Session 2</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Session 3</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Session 4</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Booster session</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Depression and Workplace Environment<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Behavior of Concerns Associated with Dementia<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Staff as Change Agents<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Sustaining Mental Health in Aged Care<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Approximately 4&#x000a0;weeks after session 4<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; detect symptoms of depression and how to recognise masked symptoms of depression<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; describe and discuss challenging behavior of residents with dementia<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; explore workplace environment factors for improving mental health protocols<hr/></td><td rowspan="5" align="left" valign="top">&#x02022; identify key issues that lead to resistance to change in the detection and management of depression and BPSD<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; review skills and instruments introduced in sessions one and two<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; adopt effective communication and psychosocial strategies when dealing with residents with depression<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; explore workplace challenges<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; examine workplace outcomes, strengths and gaps<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; revisit staff competencies in using these instruments<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; use checklist and refer resident on to a senior staff member<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; review &#x0201c;Assessment &#x00026; Management Tool for Staff&#x0201d;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; define effective leadership behavior<hr/></td><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">&#x02022; additional training using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia and the assessment tool for staff to better manage<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; administer Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; discuss benefits and challenges using this assessment<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; discuss key attributes and behavior for facilitating change<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">define workplace environment and the factors that influence staff attitudes and behavior<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">explore how staff can implement this assessment tool using the enabling factors of effective communication, trust, teamwork and cohesion<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">challenging behavior<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02022; identify facility&#x02019;s work environment</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">&#x02022; review mental health protocols and the sustained implementation of the instruments</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of the training program</title><sec><title>Evaluation measures for aged care staff</title><p>All of the following measures will be completed by aged care staff at the 18 residential facilities at pre-intervention, post-intervention, 6-month and 12&#x000a0;month follow-up (or equivalent time for the control group).</p><p>1. <italic>Knowledge of Late Life Depression Scale &#x02013; Revised</italic>.

The documentation reviewed will include the resident care plan, progress notes, medical notes and medication charts. The review will focus on records of assessment, monitoring of symptoms, medical referrals, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment and nurse-led strategies to manage symptoms. The review will be conducted on a bi-monthly basis for 12&#x000a0;months after the implementation of the MHCTC program.</p><p>3.

Further, the clinician will work with staff to implement the strategies in the program to address the organizational barriers that act against the mental health needs of residents being addressed.

Longitudinal Configural Frequency Analysis (CFA) will be used to analyse change in categorical variables such as number of depression and BPSD referrals prior, immediate post training, at 6-month and at 12-month training follow-up. CFA is a technique analogous to repeated measures MANCOVA that allows for the estimation of trends and group differences over time but for categorical variables. Allowing for a 20% attrition rate &#x02013; a rate of attrition common in our past studies &#x02013; we have calculated that we will maintain at least 28 staff and 96 residents per condition at 12-month follow-up. Based on our estimated sample size in each of the conditions at 12-month follow-up, and with the expectation of a small-to-moderate effect size d = .20, the power of the analyses for aged care resident data is calculated at 0.99, and for the staff data at .91 at the two-sided significance level of &#x003b1; = .05 for both our mean difference testing and categorical analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Consent and ethics</title><p>All participating aged care staff and aged care residents will be provided with a plain language statement and will be asked to give written informed consent to participate.

Informed consent to examine resident documentation at the facility and collect outcome data will be obtained from the residents themselves, or if they are unable to provide consent, from their family or guardian. Staff will be paid for both the time spent in the training program as well as for the completion of the questionnaires.

The project described in this article will implement and evaluate two interventions that are designed to address the organisational barriers to mental health care (transformational staff training program and clinical support). It is expected that the project will demonstrate that with the transformational training program, a more accurate identification of depression and the causes of BPSD will ensue, resulting in appropriate treatment being delivered. This will result in less distress and improved quality of life for both residents and staff, and improve the job satisfaction of aged care staff, thereby reducing staff turnover. It will also determine the extent to which external specialist clinical support is required to produce optimal outcomes, an issue that to date has not been clearly determined, and which is essential for appropriate service planning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The model for best practice that is identified through this study will provide a framework for the development of training programs for staff to address mental health issues among residents in organisations in a sustainable way. The significance of this project goes beyond the level of individuals and facilities to the broader community. The outcomes from this study will be able to be used strategically to inform policy and practice for improved quality of care of older people with depression and BPSD more generally.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors have contributed to the implementation and design of this study.
