To reduce the occurrence of injection pain and local injection site reactions (LISRs), a reduced volume formulation of GA was developed. This study compared pain and LISRs after injecting the marketed and the novel formulations. RRMS patients currently injecting GA participated in this multicenter, randomized, crossover comparative study. All patients administered once-daily subcutaneous injections of GA 20&#x000a0;mg/1.0&#x000a0;mL (marketed formulation) or GA 20&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mL (reduced volume formulation) for 14&#x000a0;days. Patients were crossed-over to the alternate treatment for an additional 14&#x000a0;days. Using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), patients recorded in daily diaries the severity of injection pain immediately and 5&#x000a0;min post-injection, and the presence and severity of LISRs (swelling, redness, itching, lump) within 5&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h post-injection. VAS pain scores were ranked significantly lower immediately and 5&#x000a0;min after GA 20&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mL injections (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Although LISRs were rare for both preparations, the severity of reactions ranked significantly lower and fewer symptoms occurred within 5&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h of using the reduced volume formulation (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001).

As with all therapeutics, patient adherence to the treatment regimen is very important. Patients with chronic diseases have lower drug adherence and persistence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with studies of MS patients reporting that almost 40% of patients with MS miss injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many factors can lead to poor adherence with any medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; patients have reported that local injection site reactions (LISRs) and injection site pain are a couple of the reasons why they miss injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>LISRs, including pain, are the most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving GA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Although the etiology of injection site pain is multi-factorial, an increase in the volume of an injectable agent has been associated with increased injection site pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A study assessing four volumes of a subcutaneous injection found that increasing the volume from 0.5 to 1.0&#x000a0;mL increased injection pain significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In an attempt to potentially reduce the occurrence of injection pain and other injection site reactions, a reduced volume of the GA formulation was developed. The new formulation contains 20&#x000a0;mg GA and 20&#x000a0;mg mannitol in 0.5&#x000a0;mL whereas the marketed formulation contains 20&#x000a0;mg GA and 40&#x000a0;mg mannitol in 1.0&#x000a0;mL solution. The objective of this study was to assess injection pain and other LISRs associated with the reduced volume formulation by comparing it to the marketed formulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a multicenter, randomized, two-arm, single crossover study designed to compare the tolerability and safety of GA 20&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mL versus GA 20&#x000a0;mg/1.0&#x000a0;mL when administered subcutaneously by patients with RRMS. During the 7-day run-in period preceding the two treatment periods, all patients administered a daily subcutaneous dose of GA 20&#x000a0;mg/1.0&#x000a0;mL. During this period they were instructed on a 7-site injection rotation, manual injection techniques, and how to complete the patient diary. They were also randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to one of two crossover sequences of either GA 20&#x000a0;mg/1.0&#x000a0;mL or GA 20&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mL (Sequences 1 and 2) for the two treatment periods. During the treatment periods, patients administered one of the formulations of GA for 14&#x000a0;days and then the patients were crossed-over to the alternate formulation for an additional 14-day treatment period. Total GA treatment duration in the study was 5&#x000a0;weeks, including the 1-week run-in period. Block randomization stratified by study site was done according to a computer-generated schedule to ensure that patients of each site were distributed equally between the formulation sequences. Blinding in this study was not possible due to the patients&#x02019; ability to detect difference in the volumes of each formulation. The study was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH guidelines on good clinical practices, and all applicable laws and regulations. All patients gave written informed consent after the procedures had been fully explained, and prior to performing any study related procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>Men or women, aged&#x000a0;&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years, with a diagnosis of RRMS and taking GA 20&#x000a0;mg/1.0&#x000a0;mL per day subcutaneously with the Auto<italic>ject</italic><sup>&#x000ae;</sup>2 for glass syringe or by a manual injection technique for a minimum of 90&#x000a0;days were eligible for inclusion.

Both the 20&#x000a0;mg/1.0&#x000a0;mL and 20&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mL formulations of GA have a pH range of approximately 5.5&#x02013;7.0 and are stable for up to 1&#x000a0;month at room temperature with no adverse impact on product potency, appearance, pH, clarity or other physicochemical characteristics. All treatments were administered via a manual injection technique. Compliance with the dosing regimen for each period was determined by counting returned unused study drug syringes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Using daily diaries, patients recorded the severity of pain occurring immediately and 5&#x000a0;min after injection, and the presence and severity of LISRs that occurred within 5&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h post-injection.

Daily injection pain was rated by the patients with a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS, where 0&#x000a0;mm represented &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 100&#x000a0;mm represented &#x0201c;worst possible pain.&#x0201d; Injection pain occurring 5&#x000a0;min after the injection was also recorded daily on a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS (secondary outcome variable). Patients reported the presence or absence of LISRs and the degree of LISR severity that occurred within the 5&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h periods following the injection. LISR total presence scores could range from 0 to 4 for an individual patient depending on how many of the following symptoms were experienced: redness, itching, swelling, and lump. LISR total severity scores could range from 0 to 12 for an individual patient depending on the severity (rated 0&#x02013;3, with 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;none to 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe) of each of the following symptoms experienced: redness, itching, swelling, and lump.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety measures</title><p>Safety was monitored at each study site by assessing adverse events (AEs), evaluating laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), conducting general physical examinations, and conducting nervous system examinations (including mental status, pupil and fundi, cranial nerves, motor examination, gait, coordination, reflexes, and sensory function).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size (60 patients per group) was estimated to provide 80% power of detecting an effect of size 18% with a two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test for correlated sample means with an alpha value of 0.05.

The mean pain scores were low for both formulations; however, the mean immediate VAS total pain score was significantly lower after administration of 20&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mL GA injection compared with the 20&#x000a0;mg/1.0&#x000a0;mL GA injection. The lower immediate VAS pain score associated with the novel formulation was consistent over all 14&#x000a0;days of the study, indicating that the improvement in injection pain did not diminish over time. The reduced VAS pain score associated with the novel formulation was also evident 5&#x000a0;min post-injection.</p><p>The initial onset of LISRs experienced by patients can lead them to discontinue treatment or miss injections. With the realization that LISRs may lead to non-adherence, researchers have been investigating ways to limit LISRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Use of warm compresses and rotating the injection site seem to have a moderate effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As evidenced by the present study, reducing the volume may also provide a moderate benefit. The incidence and severity of LISRs within 5&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h post-injection were significantly less for the novel formulation than the marketed formulation. Moreover, even though most patients reported some LISRs following injection of either formulation, a greater percentage of patients treated with the reduced volume solution reported no symptoms within 5&#x000a0;min and 24&#x000a0;h after injection. A longer study duration would be needed to determine whether the improvement in injection pain and LISRs associated with the novel formulation improves quality of life, incidence of lipoatrophy, and long-term drug adherence.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that it was not blinded. Although blinding of the administered volume of the dose represents a superior experimental design, it was not possible to implement in the present trial for several reasons. First, the patients would have been required to be seen at the clinic every day, for a total of 35&#x000a0;days, to receive their injection. It would have been logistically very difficult for the large number of patients required for this trial, and place too great a burden on these patients to undertake daily visits. Second, to blind the volume of the formulation in the syringe, it would not have been sufficient to cover the syringe with opaque tape, or use a syringe with opaque glass, as the differences in the length of the syringe plunger, related to differences in the volume, would have been noticed by the patients. A new syringe with a redesigned plunger was not available for this study. However, it is important to note that, although the patients were able to detect a difference in the volume of the formulation, the trial investigators took care not to present one formulation as &#x0201c;better&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;superior&#x0201d; than the other formulation. In addition, patient diaries were collected after each period of the trial so that patients did not have the results of the previous entries for comparison purposes.</p><p>Both formulations had a good tolerability and safety profile. The percentage of subjects reporting AEs was low (&#x0003c;20%) for both treatments. All AEs were reported previously and there were no unexpected laboratory values. The novel formulation has the potential to improve patient adherence by producing less pain, and fewer and less severe LISRs. The 20&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mL formulation is a more tolerable option for patients using subcutaneous injections of GA. Since injection site reactions, including pain, are the most frequently reported AEs in subjects receiving daily injections of GA for RRMS, the 20&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mL formulation may offer clinical benefits for patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="d28e879" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
