Spinal anesthesia is simple to perform, economical, produces rapid onset of anesthesia and complete muscle relaxation. Although prolongation of the effects of local anesthetics has been reported for oral and intravenous clonidine, the intrathecal route is more effective; clonidine prolongs the duration of action of intrathecally administered local anesthetics and has potent antinociceptive properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] A recent report established 1 &#x003bc;g/kg intrathecal clonidine as an adequate dose for prolonging bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in pregnant females.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] It was observed that intrathecal clonidine upto 150 &#x003bc;g prolongs spinal anesthesia and analgesia but hemodynamic instability was seen with higher doses,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] so intrathecal doses of clonidine were titrated to 50 &#x003bc;g for pregnant females in our study in order to achieve adequate analgesia along with hemodynamic stability.</p><p>The primary outcomes studied were time to regression of spinal blockade below level L1 and duration of pain relief, defined as the time from intrathecal clonidine administration to first request for supplemental analgesia by patients. Postoperative cumulative analgesic consumption, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, motor blockade, hemodynamic variables, use of intravenous ephedrine, additional fluid requirements, and sedation were also recorded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>A randomized single blind trial was performed on 210 parturients undergoing emergency cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.

Patients included in the study were not aware of the drug combination which they received for spinal anesthesia in order to rule out the bias regarding use of rescue analgesia in the postoperative period. Patients included for this study belonged to American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade I or II, having full-term normal pregnancy. None of the patients had any contraindication for spinal anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were complicated pregnancies such as multiple pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension, placenta previa and antenatal patients with acute fetal distress, patients with previous abdominal surgeries and patients having body weight&#x0003e;80 kg.</p><p>All the parturients were preloaded with 0.5 to 1.0 L of ringer lactate via 18 gauge venous catheter. Base line parameters for pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded in all three groups and were found to be statistically insignificant. In group I (n=70), we tried to find out optimal dose of intrathecal bupivacaine (12.5 mg) which was not associated with visceral pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] Visceral pain was assessed on the basis of previously explained visual analog score, judged by the patient at the time of uterine incision and peritoneal cleaning. In group II (n=70), intrathecal clonidine (50&#x003bc;gm) was added and dose of bupivacaine was reduced to 8 mg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] The second group was made with an idea to find out the low dose bupivacaine-clonidine combination that was not associated with visceral pain. In the third group (n=70), parturients were given bupivacaine 10 mg intrathecally along with 50 &#x003bc;g clonidine. Spinal anesthesia was given in lateral position between L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub> vertebrae using 25 gauge Whitacre needle taking complete aseptic precautions. Immediately after the block, each parturient was placed with a wedge under righthip.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] Pulse and non-invasive blood pressure were measured every 5 min for first 30 min and thereafter every 10 min. Hypotension was defined as 20% decrease from baseline MAP. It was treated with i.v. fluid bolus and with 3 mg incremental boluses of i.v. ephedrine. Total ephedrine requirements, number and duration of hypotension episodes were recorded. Patients breathed spontaneously and supplementary oxygen was given through a facemask during the operation. Urine output was also monitored. Sensory block was tested by cold, touch, and pinprick along the midclavicular line till the block reached T6 level and then the surgical incision was allowed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] The quality of anesthesia (judged by anesthetists), the quality of muscle relaxation (judged by surgeon) and degree of intraoperative comfort (judged by patient) were recorded as excellent, good, fair, or poor. Intraoperative pain and the feeling of discomfort were evaluated by the patient and recorded by an observer unaware of patient data using visual analog scale. Development of motor block was assessed with the Bromage Scale (0=no motor block to 3=complete motor block of both lower limbs). Incidence of nausea, vomiting, itching, shivering, pruritus, and sedation during operation; the time required for sensory recovery below L1 dermatome, motor recovery (ability to move lower limbs), and onset of postoperative pain were recorded. Apgar score of all the babies at 1, 5, and10 min and maternal respiratory depression were recorded.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Three groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni multiple comparison <italic>post hoc</italic> test.

General anesthesia in the cesarean section is associated with higher mortality rate in comparison to regional anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is also having its own demerits. Deaths in regional anesthesia are primarily related to excessively high regional blocks and toxicity of local anesthetics. Reduction in doses and improvement in the technique to avoid higher block levels and heightened awareness of toxicity of local anesthetics have contributed to reduction of complications related to regionalanesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] On comparing progression of sensory block to T6 dermatome<sub>;</sub> in our study we found the mean time duration of 6.8 min in group II and minimum time of 5.50 min in group I [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>].</p><fig id="F0003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Time for onset of sensory block</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-5-31-g003"/></fig><p>In this study muscle relaxation was found to be excellent in all three groups (judged by surgeon). This is supported by Ogun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] who also reported excellent muscle relaxation with or without addition of 75 &#x003bc;g clonidine to 8 and10 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine in the cesarean section. Visceral pain is a common problem in the cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. It is a poorly localized type of pain that appears to come from deep inside the body. It is often associated with autonomic activity causing nausea, vomiting, sweating, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Visceral pain in the cesarean section is experienced when the uterus is exteriorized and peritoneum is closed (judged by patient). In our study we found no visceral pain in group I. However visceral pain incidence could be reduced with lower bupivacaine doses of 8 mg by adding 50 &#x003bc;g of clonidine. In our study we found the depth of anesthesia in group II to be equivalent to group III, though the dose of bupivacaine was less. This is observed that by addition of clonidine, adequate depth of spinal anesthesia can be achieved at much lower doses of bupivacaine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>]</p><p>Bradycardia in spinal anesthesia is believed to result from at least two causes: blockade of sympathetic cardio accelerator fibers and decreased venous return to the heart. Sympathetic cardio accelerator fibers arise from T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>4</sub>, so that a sympathetic block height to T<sub>1</sub> should completely eliminate sympathetic flow to the heart. However, this level of sympathetic block is associated with peripheral vasodilatation and a reduction in preload. The decrease is preload is believed to be the most important cause of decrease in heart rate. Bradycardia in our study was found in 31 out of 210 parturients [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>]. Higher incidence was observed with higher bupivacaine doses. There was no difference in incidence of bradycardia by addition of clonidine in groups II and III.</p><fig id="F0004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Adverse events (number of episodes)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-5-31-g004"/></fig><p>By addition of 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g intrathecal clonidine we found that 35-45% of the patients were drowsy (assessed by Ramsay sedation scale) as compared to those without clonidine addition [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0003">Table 3</xref>].

In our study we found increased incidence of nausea and vomiting with higher bupivacaine dose [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0003">Table 3</xref>] but no significant increase in side effects by adding clonidine.
