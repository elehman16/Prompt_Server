femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) continues to rise. Although there
is evidence that surgery can improve symptoms in the short-term,
there is no evidence that it slows the development of osteoarthritis
(OA). We performed a feasibility study to determine whether patient
and surgeon opinion was permissive for a Randomised Controlled Trial
(RCT) comparing operative with non-operative treatment for FAI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Surgeon opinion was obtained using validated questionnaires at
a Specialist Hip Meeting (n&#x000a0;= 61, 30 of whom stated that they routinely
performed FAI surgery) and patient opinion was obtained from clinical
patients with a new diagnosis of FAI (n = 31).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Clinical equipoise was demonstrated when surgeons were given
clinical scenarios and asked whether they would manage a patient
operatively or non-operatively. A total of 23 surgeons (77%) who
routinely perform FAI surgery were willing to recruit patients into
a RCT, and 28&#x000a0;patients (90%) were willing to participate. 75% of
responding surgeons believed it was appropriate to randomise patients
to non-operative treatment for &#x02265; 12 months. Conversely, only eight
patients (26%) felt this was acceptable, although 29 (94%) were
willing to continue non-operative treatment for six months. More
patients were concerned about their risk of developing OA than their
current symptoms, although most patients felt that the two were
of equal importance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that a RCT comparing operative and non-operative
management of FAI is feasible and should be considered a research
priority. An important finding for orthopaedic surgical trials is
that patients without life-threatening pathology appear willing
to trial a treatment for six months without improvement in their
symptoms.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Femoroacetabular impingement</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Hip</kwd><kwd>Feasibility</kwd><kwd>Equipoise</kwd><kwd>Trial design</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>None declared</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>odf2nlm-version</meta-name><meta-value>1.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>price</meta-name><meta-value>$2.00</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>principal-institution</meta-name><meta-value>Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>coi-statement</meta-name><meta-value>None declared</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The number of surgical procedures performed each year to treat

optimal study design for comparing the efficacy and effectiveness
of treatments. However, they are particularly difficult to perform
in the field of surgery due to difficulties in blinding, standardising
procedures, and a lack of acceptance by patients and surgeons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref></sup> Only 7% of research articles in surgical
journals are RCTs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref></sup> and
treatments in surgery are half as likely to be based on evidence from
RCTs than in medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, as
a result of the above difficulties, RCTs pertaining to surgical
intervention may be poorly constructed and may not always represent
the ideal study type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref></sup></p><p>A RCT is not always possible because once a procedure has been
accepted as best practice, it may be considered unethical to allocate
patients to an alternative treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref></sup> RCTs require a setting of equipoise,
a situation where both patients and clinicians feel a genuine conscious
uncertainty as to the optimal management strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref></sup> Equipoise can relate
to either an individual or a community. Individual equipoise refers
to a setting where an individual is undecided as to the optimal
treatment. Community equipoise refers to a setting where individuals
may not display equipoise, but broadly equal numbers of individuals within
a community are proponents of each different treatment. Individual
equipoise is considered necessary for trial recruitment, whereas
community equipoise is considered necessary for a trial to be ethically
acceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup></p><p>Patient preference for a particular treatment is a frequent cause
of trial abandonment, primarily because patients often have a preferred
treatment in mind.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> Equipoise is therefore
essential within the patient population, but is highly dependent
on the information made available. Measurement of surgeon and patient
preference is a crucial aspect of feasibility assessment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref></sup> and is increasingly
requested by funding bodies. Feasibility studies seek to determine
whether a study is possible, and to estimate important parameters
for the design of the main study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> In this instance, the proposed study
is a RCT to determine whether surgery in patients with femoroacetabular
impingement (FAI) can delay the onset of osteoarthritis (OA) compared
with non-operative treatment.</p><p>FAI describes abnormalities in the orientation of the acetabulum
(pincer impingement) or abnormalities in the shape of the femoral
head and neck (cam impingement). This results in abutment of the
femoral head&#x02013;neck junction against the acetabular rim and labrum,
progressing to cartilage delamination and OA at this site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> This pathogenesis is supported by
several observations. A 20-year longitudinal study of an asymptomatic
population-based cohort has shown that the presence of a cam lesion increases
the risk of future THR by sixfold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> Cam lesions have been observed in
&#x0003e; 50% of patients undergoing hip replacement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup> and significant
cartilage damage has also been seen intra-operatively at the specific
sites where impingement occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup> Lastly,
early signs of cartilage damage have been detected using delayed
Gadolinium Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Cartilage (dGEMRIC)
in asymptomatic patients with cam lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup></p><p>The United Kingdom maintains a database (Hospital Episode Statistics)
of all medical procedures performed on the National Health Service.
Analysis of this database reveals that the number of surgical procedures
performed each year to treat FAI is rising exponentially, with a
442% increase over the past 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup> This trend has been mirrored in
the United States, and in 2012 the American Academy of Orthopaedic
Surgeons hosted a FAI Research Symposium to address the increasing
recognition and intervention for this condition.</p><p>The options for treatment include physiotherapy and activity
modification, or surgery to treat the cartilage damage with or without
reshaping the impinging bony deformities. While cohort studies show
that each of these treatment options can improve symptoms in the
short-term,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup> the greatest potential
benefit lies in being able to arrest or delay the onset of OA, for
which there is currently no evidence. There are now calls for a
RCT to make a robust comparison between the above treatment modalities.
We constructed this study with the goal of determining the feasibility
of a RCT studying FAI surgery. Our specific aims were to ascertain
whether specialist hip surgeons believe that a RCT for FAI management
is required, to establish whether there is evidence of surgeon and
patient equipoise, and to determine whether patients are willing
to participate in such a trial.</p><p>Information gained may also help to decide the optimum trial
design. We identified three areas of design as being crucial to
trial feasibility: Which patients should be included in a RCT? How
long are patients and surgeons prepared to continue a treatment
if symptoms do not improve? What should be used as the primary outcome measure?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We designed two different questionnaires to ascertain surgeon
and patient preferences.</p><sec><title content-type="h3">Surgeon preference</title><p>A written questionnaire was developed to establish surgeon preferences
using a combination of questions requiring discrete &#x02018;yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;no&#x02019; responses,
and validated bidirectional linear analogue scales requiring surgeons
to mark their responses on an 11-point scale from -5 to +5 (Fig.
1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref></sup> Data were
collected at the 2012 meeting of the British Hip Society during
a session focusing on pathology of the hip in the young adult. This
forum has a high attendance by consultant surgeons specialising
in the management of FAI. Responses were analysed in numerical format
and using a surgical equipoise ratio (SER).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref></sup> This scale comprises three digits,
representing the number of
surgeons with negative value responses, those at zero, and those
with positive value responses.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Example questions using a bidirectional
linear scale to determine surgeon or patient opinion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2000137-galleyfig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Patient preference</title><p>A Patient Information Leaflet was developed with the aid of a
Patient Advocate (PL), attached to which was a written questionnaire.
This included a description of FAI and how it results in damage to
the labrum and articular cartilage. It also contained an overview
of conservative and surgical treatment options, along with a discussion
of the potential risks and benefits of each. Conservative management
was said to comprise weekly physiotherapy and activity modification,
and surgical treatment was said to comprise hip arthroscopy with
labral debridement or repair, and osteochondroplasty. During a three
week period, all patients aged between 18 and 65 years with newly
diagnosed FAI seen in clinic at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre,
Oxford, and the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, were invited
to read through the Patient Information Leaflet and answer the questionnaire
to identify patient preferences for the management of their hip
pathology. The 11-point bidirectional scale was used to ask patients
whether their principal concern was the risk of developing arthritis
or their current pain, and a linear scale from 0 to 24 months (with
three-month divisions) was used to ask patients how long they would
be happy to trial non-operative management if their symptoms did
not improve. Patients were seen again immediately after they completed
the questionnaire to address any further questions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title content-type="h3">Surgeon preference</title><p>Questionnaires were completed by 61 surgeons, 30 of whom indicated
that they routinely performed surgery for FAI. Of these 30 surgeons
who routinely performed FAI surgery, six (20%) performed &#x0003c;&#x000a0;ten&#x000a0;procedures
annually, four (13%) performed between ten and 20, six (20%) performed
between 20&#x000a0;and 30, four (13%) performed between 30 and 50, three
(10%) performed between 50 and 100, and seven (23%) performed &#x0003e;
100 procedures per year. The preferred surgical approach of these
surgeons was arthroscopic (53%, n = 16), followed by arthroscopic
and mini-open (30%, n = 9), followed by open only (17%, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5).
The questionnaire also asked surgeons to state their preferred Patient
Reported Outcome Measure (PROM). Some authors did not respond and
others gave multiple measures: the Non-Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> was the most common
(49%), followed by the Oxford hip score (OHS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup> (20%), the Hip
Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup> (18%), the Harris
hip score (HHS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup> (9%)
and the Hip Outcome Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref></sup> (9%).</p><p>Of all surgeons surveyed, 75% stated that they would modify their
practice in response to level 1 evidence demonstrating FAI surgery
was superior to conservative management in delaying the onset of
OA. This question was answered by 28 surgeons who routinely perform
FAI surgery, of whom 21 (75%) said they would modify their practice,
and by 20 surgeons who do not routinely perform FAI surgery, of
whom 15 (75%) said they would modify their practice. Of the surgeons
who routinely perform surgery for FAI, 23 of 28 responses (82%)
indicated that they were willing to participate in a multi-centre
RCT. However, if the two non-responders are assumed to be unwilling,
77% of surgeons would be willing to participate in such a trial. </p><p>Approximately 75% of surgeons found it appropriate to randomise
patients to non-surgical management for &#x02265;&#x000a0;12&#x000a0;months, and of those
surgeons who did not believe this is appropriate, the shortest specified
length of time was six months. This question was answered by 28
surgeons who routinely perform FAI surgery, of whom 20&#x000a0;(71%) believed
&#x0003e; 12 months was appropriate, and 20&#x000a0;surgeons who do not routinely
perform FAI surgery, of whom 16 (80%) believed &#x0003e; 12 months was appropriate.</p><p>The responses to questions using the bidirectional linear scale are
both tabulated (Table I) and displayed as histograms (Figs 2 to
8). Not every surgeon responded to every question, and the total
responses for each question are given in Table I. The majority of
surgeons believed FAI is a cause of osteoarthritis with a surgical
equipoise ratio (SER) of 7:6:39 for &#x02018;no&#x02019;, &#x02018;undecided&#x02019; and &#x02018;yes&#x02019;,
respectively (Fig. 2), although the belief that optimal debridement
of FAI lesions prevented the development of osteoarthritis was more
controversial, with an SER of 13:19:20 for &#x02018;no&#x02019;, &#x02018;undecided&#x02019; and
&#x02018;yes&#x02019;, respectively (Fig. 3). When asked whether they would manage
a patient non-operatively or operatively on first presentation,
the SER was 29:6:15 and 10:6:34 for mild and severe symptoms, respectively,
representing &#x02018;non-operatively&#x02019;, &#x02018;undecided&#x02019; and &#x02018;operatively&#x02019; (Figs
4 and 5). Considering the subgroup of 23 surgeons who routinely
perform FAI surgery and who were willing to recruit patients into
a RCT, the SER was 12:2:9 for mild symptoms and 3:1:19 for severe
symptoms, representing &#x02018;non-operatively&#x02019;, &#x02018;undecided&#x02019; and &#x02018;operatively&#x02019;,
respectively (Figs 6 and 7). Evidence of early osteoarthritis was likely
to make a surgeon less likely to perform FAI surgery, giving a SER
of 35:4:8, representing &#x02018;yes&#x02019; (less likely), &#x02018;undecided&#x02019; and &#x02018;no&#x02019;,

whether there is a requirement for a study, it establishes whether
surgeon and patient opinion is permissive of the proposed
trial, and it also provides guidance for trial design.</p><p>Our study demonstrates a requirement for a RCT to compare the
operative and non-operative management of FAI. Although surgeons
in our feasibility study displayed uncertainty as to whether osteochondroplasty
for FAI could prevent OA, the number of surgical procedures performed
each year to treat FAI continues to rise exponentially. This may
reflect increasing evidence
that surgery can improve symptoms in the short-term,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup> however, our study shows that the
primary concern of patients was more frequently the prevention of
OA rather than their current pain. This supports the need for a
well-designed RCT. Indeed, 75% of surgeons said they would modify
their clinical practice in response to level 1 evidence showing
FAI surgery slowed the development of OA over conservative management
strategies.</p><p>We have also shown that surgeon and patient opinion was permissive
for a RCT, and that there was evidence of equipoise. The ideal position
of equipoise for a trial is when both patient and clinician have
no particular preference for alternative treatment strategies. In
reality, this theoretical model is rarely seen. Community equipoise describes
disagreement within an expert clinical body as to the preferred
treatment strategy. If the majority of clinicians strongly believe
one treatment is superior to another, it would not be ethical to
randomise patients to the treatment that is perceived to be inferior.
When members of the public were asked to specify the degree of community
equipoise they would require to cast an approving vote on an ethical
committee, half believed a RCT was unethical when community equipoise
is disturbed beyond 70% cent of clinicians favouring one of the
treatment options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup> By
this threshold our study demonstrates adequate community equipoise,
as when we asked surgeons their preferred treatment for a patient with
mild and severe symptoms, no more than 70% of surgeons favoured
either treatment option. When presented with patients experiencing
mild symptoms, 58% of surgeons favoured non-operative management, whereas
with patients experiencing severe
symptoms, 68% of surgeons favoured operative management (Figs 4 and
5). These findings suggest it is ethical to perform a RCT for all
symptom severities.</p><p>An individual is in equipoise when they themselves do not display
a preference for one treatment option over another. This is considered
essential if clinicians are to willingly recruit patients into a
trial, and also minimises researcher bias for either treatment arm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup> In our study, individual
equipoise is illustrated when a surgeon marks &#x02018;undecided&#x02019; as their
preferred treatment option for a given clinical scenario. As the
number of surgeons without a treatment preference increases, the
number of surgeons willing to recruit patients would be expected
to rise. Although a study may require relatively few surgeons for
adequate recruitment, if no surgeon displays individual equipoise,
trial recruitment is unlikely to be possible. We found that 12%
of surgeons were undecided as to whether to adopt operative or non-operative management
in patients with both mild and severe symptoms. Whereas for mild
symptoms this represented an equal number of surgeons who did and
did not perform FAI surgery, for severe symptoms, the vast majority were
surgeons who did not routinely perform FAI surgery (Figs 4 and 5).
This finding suggests that few surgeons would be willing to recruit
patients into a RCT; however, this was not the case. We found 77%
of surgeons who routinely perform FAI surgery to be willing to recruit
patients into a RCT. This supports the theory that individual equipoise
in clinicians is not essential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref></sup> Surgeons
who had a strong preference for one treatment arm were still willing
to recruit patients into a trial (Figs 6 and 7). </p><p>A RCT for FAI management with operative and non-operative treatment
arms should achieve a high rate of patient recruitment, as 90% of
patients indicated that they were willing to participate. But recruitment
and drop-out rates are conditional on trial design. A crucial factor is the length of time
patients are randomised to non-surgical treatment. While 75% of
surgeons indicated that it is appropriate to adopt a non-operative
treatment strategy for one year or more, only 26% of patients found this
acceptable if their symptoms did not improve. This is likely to
result in low recruitment rates and high drop-out rates. Given that
the majority of patients surveyed (94%) found six months to be acceptable,
cross-over to a surgical treatment arm must be allowed at this time
point in order to ensure success of the trial. This finding dictates the
primary outcome measure and sample size of such a trial, and feasibility
therefore depends on the ability to detect a clinically relevant
difference within six months. This is only possible using advanced
imaging techniques to detect surrogate markers of OA, such as T<sub>2</sub> mapping
or dGEMRIC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref></sup> The
finding that patients are happy to pursue a treatment strategy for
six months without improvement in their symptoms may have important
implications for clinical trials addressing other orthopaedic pathology.</p><p>When considering the inclusion criteria for a RCT, we demonstrated
strong community opinion that surgeons are less likely to perform
FAI surgery in the presence of early OA (Fig.&#x000a0;8). In order to avoid
confusion we intentionally excluded a specific definition of early OA, as there are many classifications,
and few are commonly used in a clinical setting. Nevertheless, responses
suggest surgeons would find it unacceptable to perform FAI surgery
on patients with established OA. We therefore believe trial inclusion
would need to be limited to patients with a T&#x000f6;nnis grade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref></sup> or Kellgren-Lawrence
score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref></sup> &#x0003c;
2. We also recommend that a RCT addresses arthroscopic surgery,
and uses the Non-Arthritic Hip Score as the PROM, as these are preferred
by the majority of surgeons and ensure applicability of study findings.</p><p>There are limitations to this feasibility study. The patients
and surgeons completing our questionnaires do not necessarily represent
national or international opinion, despite this being one of the
largest surgical feasibility studies published, and not every surgeon
answered every question. The same two surgeons who routinely perform
FAI surgery did not mark their responses on the bidirectional scales,
and a higher number of surgeons who do not routinely perform FAI
surgery did not complete all of the questions. This may be because
they did not feel sufficiently well informed to provide a response, but
it could also be a reflection on the survey design.</p><p>Although we are cautious that a patient may be more likely to
consent to a trial in theory than in practice when approached by
the trial team, similar studies to ours have reliably predicted
recruitment rates in the subsequent trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref></sup> It
is also extremely difficult not to display bias towards the operative
treatment arm. If symptoms do not improve with non-operative therapy,
it is possible to consider surgery. However, the reverse is not
possible when surgery reflects a definitive and irreversible procedure.
As a result, patients may interpret this to mean surgery is the
optimum treatment. This is a significant hurdle to performing a
surgical RCT, and one that is extremely difficult to overcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>All proposed studies should demonstrate, rather than assume,
feasibility. Our study demonstrates that a RCT is required to investigate
whether surgical debridement of FAI slows the development of osteoarthritis
compared with a non-operative control. We also showed that this
study is feasible in terms of both surgeon and patient opinion.
Consensus opinion is a dynamic concept, and while surgeon and patient
opinions currently appear permissive, this may not be the case in
the future. We recommend that a RCT for FAI treatment be conducted,
and that it is considered a research priority. Important findings
of this study relevant to the design of other clinical trials are
that individual surgeon equipoise is not essential, and that surgeons
expressing a strong preference for a particular treatment strategy
may still be happy to recruit patients into a RCT. Also, patients
are happy to pursue a treatment strategy for six months, even if their
symptoms do not improve.</p><p>The authors would like to thank P. Lovell for his role as Patient
