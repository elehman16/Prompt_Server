From this limited armamentarium, clinicians attempt medical management of a chronic disease that has substantial economic, physical, and emotional consequences. Although many studies have shown that weight loss can be achieved through highly supervised dietary interventions, weight regain following these interventions is almost universal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A recent meta-analysis showed that 25&#x02013;88% (mean 54%) of weight loss achieved immediately after the intervention was maintained after 1 year of unsupervised follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). After 2 years, the percentage of maintained weight loss diminishes even more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In contrast, bariatric surgery is the most successful intervention for achieving long-term weight loss in morbid obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, widespread use of a surgical intervention for obesity is problematic because many people who would benefit do not choose this approach, nor is it routinely available to individuals with BMI &#x0003c;39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and no other metabolic complications. Given the lack of long-term success with dieting, the invasive nature of bariatric surgery, and the limited pharmacologic options for the medical management of obesity, studies designed to investigate weight loss with agents approved for other primary indications have potentially high clinical value.</p><p>Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 is an incretin hormone secreted by the enteroendocrine L cells of the small intestine in response to food intake. The major physiologic effects of GLP-1 include increased postprandial insulin secretion, decreased postprandial glucagon secretion, and delayed gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Early studies of human GLP-1 showed that continuous peripheral infusion was associated with decreased appetite and increased satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Continuous infusion of GLP-1 also was shown to improve insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and &#x003b2;-cell function in individuals with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Incretin mimetics evolved as therapeutic options for the treatment of type 2 diabetes primarily because of their effects on insulin and glucagon secretion, with weight loss as an additional benefit.</p><p>Weight loss ranging from 2 to 6 kg has been a consistent finding in studies designed to investigate the glycemic benefits of incretin mimetics in individuals with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). There are very limited data on weight loss in nondiabetic individuals treated with these agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). To evaluate the effects of exenatide treatment in obese, nondiabetic women, we designed a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. To minimize the placebo effect and study the effect of exenatide in a real-world setting, we did not include any lifestyle modifications, and we discouraged any change in diet or physical activity. To avoid confounding factors of body fat distribution, we enrolled only women.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>We conducted a 35-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, with two 16-week treatment periods separated by a 3-week washout period (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0931/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). All study visits were conducted in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center General Clinical Research Center in Boston, Massachusetts. All participants gave written informed consent before participation. The study was approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Review Board and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Between 2007 and 2010, we enrolled 41 women aged between 18 and 70 years with BMI between 28 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Major exclusion criteria included having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, having uncontrolled hypertension or dyslipidemia, being treated with antiobesity medication within 1 year, having a history of bariatric surgery, and having previous treatment with exenatide. Subjects reported a stable weight within 6 months of the screening visit. A total of 24% of the study population had prediabetes at enrollment. Subjects injected 5 &#x003bc;g of either exenatide or identically dispensed placebo before breakfast and supper. After 2 weeks, subjects increased their doses to 10 &#x003bc;g exenatide or placebo twice daily. Study visits occurred every 2 weeks.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcomes of body weight (kg) and BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were measured at all study visits, with subjects wearing light clothing and no shoes.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Waist circumference (cm) was measured using a nonelastic measuring tape. Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA; RJL System Quantum II Bioelectrical Body Composition Analyzer) after an overnight fast. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured using a Dynamap automated monitoring device. Lipid panels, leptin, and adiponectin were measured after an overnight fast at weeks 0, 10, and 16 during both treatment periods. Glycemic status was measured at the beginning and end of each treatment period with a standard 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin was measured using the access chemiluminescent assay (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Adiponectin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, NH), and leptin was measured using a radioimmunoassay technique (Linco Research, St. Charles, MN). Resting energy expenditure (REE; kcal) was measured after an overnight fast using the Viasys Indirect Calorimeter. Subjects wore a watch-sized sleep monitor and an accelerometer (Actigraph and Actical; Mini Mitter) on the nondominant wrist for 2 weeks during each treatment period. Subjects rated hunger, satiety, and nausea on a 10-cm visual analog scale every 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our study was powered to assess the primary outcome of change in body weight during exenatide treatment. We calculated that we needed 42 subjects to detect a (mean &#x000b1; SD) 2.6 &#x000b1; 1.3 kg difference in body weight between exenatide and placebo treatment at 16 weeks with 80% power and an &#x003b1; value of 0.05. Using a 20&#x02013;25% drop-out rate, we enrolled an additional 10 subjects. Differences in baseline characteristics between the two randomized groups of the study were assessed with <italic>t</italic> tests.

Two-hour glucose values trended lower during exenatide treatment compared with placebo, although there was wide variability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). We did not see any significant change in leptin levels when we compared exenatide with placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>); however, we noted that leptin levels decreased significantly among high responders (39 &#x000b1; 4.8 ng/mL to 28.8 &#x000b1; 3.7 ng/mL) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref><bold>)</bold>, an effect not seen in nonresponders.

All subjects who had a modified titration schedule during exenatide treatment reported nausea.

Exenatide is associated with a reduction in hemoglobin A1C of 0.5&#x02013;0.8% and liraglutide with a reduction of 1.1&#x02013;1.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Of interest, a consistent finding in large clinical studies is that hemoglobin A1C levels declined but then plateaued while weight loss continued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Data on weight loss with exenatide in individuals without diabetes are limited. One group reported ~3.3 kg placebo-corrected weight loss over 24 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Astrup et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) showed that 1.2&#x02013;3.0 mg liraglutide daily plus aggressive lifestyle intervention for 20 weeks was associated with dose-dependent, placebo-corrected weight loss, ranging from 2.0 to 4.4 kg among nondiabetic obese individuals. Neither study commented on individual responses to treatment.</p><p>Our cohort of women lost, on average, 2.5 kg after 16 weeks of exenatide treatment, and we observed significant weight loss after only 2 weeks. Importantly, we observed that 30% of our study population lost 8% of their body weight during exenatide treatment, whereas another 31% did not lose any weight or gained weight. The variable response to exenatide was apparent as early as 4 weeks. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report stratified weight loss in response to exenatide treatment in obese, nondiabetic individuals. Although we did not identify baseline characteristics that predicted the degree of response to exenatide treatment, our observation that significant weight loss was seen as early as 2 weeks and that high responders could be identified by 4 weeks has important clinical ramifications and demonstrates the value of a short clinical trial to assess the effectiveness in a given individual. A larger prospective study designed to investigate predictors of weight loss with exenatide is an important area for future investigation.</p><p>The mechanisms of weight loss with exenatide are not fully understood but may include changes in energy expenditure, changes in leptin sensitivity, or nausea resulting in decreased food intake. Significant weight loss is usually associated with a decrease in REE that favors weight regain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Leibel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) observed that a hypocaloric diet producing 10% weight loss resulted in a decrease in REE of ~130 kcal/day, and Pereira et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) found that a low-fat diet producing 10% weight loss was associated with a decrease in REE of 176 kcal/day, compared with 96 kcal/day with a low&#x02013;glycemic index diet producing the same degree of weight loss. Dietary or pharmacologic interventions that blunt the decrease in REE with weight loss are in great clinical demand. We identified a potential effect of exenatide on REE because those who had the most robust weight loss with exenatide did not have the expected decrease in this parameter. Rodent and human studies support a relationship between GLP-1 and energy expenditure, possibly by activating the sympathetic nervous system. In rats, both peripheral and central administration of GLP-1 receptor agonists increased blood pressure and heart rate by activating autonomic regulatory sites in the rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In lean, healthy males, peripheral GLP-1 administration during a hyperglycemic clamp was associated with increased REE, and the GLP-1 analog liraglutide has been associated with increased heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>Another mechanism through which exenatide may produce weight loss is by increasing leptin sensitivity. Obesity is considered to be a state of leptin resistance, and weight loss is thought to improve leptin sensitivity. There currently is no technique for measuring leptin sensitivity in humans, and the decrease in leptin levels seen with weight loss generally is used as indirect evidence of increased leptin sensitivity. Although there was no significant change in leptin levels during exenatide treatment when we analyzed our data in aggregate, we noted that leptin levels decreased significantly among exenatide high responders compared with nonresponders. However, this effect may be attributed to weight loss, per se, rather than exenatide treatment. A comparator group with calorie-restricted weight loss would help answer this question in future studies. Nausea, the most common adverse effect of exenatide, also may contribute to weight loss. Although exenatide was associated with more nausea than placebo, the severity of nausea decreased over time and nausea scores were not higher among exenatide high responders.</p><p>Our study included a small cohort of generally healthy obese women, which limits the generalizability of our findings. The overall drop-out rate was 35%, with 17% dropping out prior to being randomly assigned and 18% dropping out after being randomly assigned. There was no significant difference in baseline weight or BMI among dropouts versus completers. A crossover study design introduces the possibility of both an order effect and a carryover effect. Our statistical analysis was adjusted for possible treatment order effects. Given the short half-life of exenatide and normal renal function among study participants, a 3-week washout period should have been sufficient to exclude a carryover effect. Our study was powered for the primary outcome of weight loss during exenatide versus placebo treatment. Retrospective analysis revealed that weight loss among our cohort could be grouped as &#x02265;5% body weight, &#x0003c;5% body weight, or weight gain. A larger, prospective study will be required to examine the metabolic parameters that may predict the degree of response to exenatide treatment.</p><p>The trend in obesity literature typically has been to report the average response of an entire study population to a particular dietary or pharmacologic intervention. However, the analysis and reporting of weight loss data in aggregate can obscure individual responses to treatment. Our study is the first study to describe weight loss variability with a GLP-1 receptor agonist and demonstrates that a subset of women have a robust response to exenatide treatment that can be identified very early in the course of therapy. Future studies examining the duration and magnitude of weight loss among individuals who have a robust response to exenatide treatment, as well as characteristics that predict response, may guide us toward a more personalized approach to pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
