An influential study conducted in Kenya in 1998&#x02013;99 reported that a school-based drug-and-educational intervention had benefits for worm infections and school attendance.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this statistical replication, we re-analysed data from this cluster quasi-randomized stepped-wedge trial, specifying two co-primary outcomes: school attendance and examination performance. We estimated intention-to-treat effects using year-stratified cluster-summary analysis and observation-level random-effects regression, and combined both years with a random-effects model accounting for year. The participants were not blinded to allocation status, and other interventions were concurrently conducted in a sub-set of schools. A protocol guiding outcome data collection was not available.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Quasi-randomization resulted in three similar groups of 25 schools. There was a substantial amount of missing data. In year-stratified cluster-summary analysis, there was no clear evidence for improvement in either school attendance or examination performance. In year-stratified regression models, there was some evidence of improvement in school attendance [adjusted odds ratios (aOR): year 1: 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88&#x02013;2.52, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.147; year 2: 1.23, 95% CI 1.01&#x02013;1.51, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.044], but not examination performance (adjusted differences: year 1: &#x02212;0.135, 95% CI &#x02212;0.323&#x02013;0.054, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.161; year 2: &#x02212;0.017, 95% CI &#x02212;0.201&#x02013;0.166, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.854). When both years were combined, there was strong evidence of an effect on attendance (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.74&#x02013;1.91, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), but not examination performance (adjusted difference &#x02212;0.121, 95% CI &#x02212;0.293&#x02013;0.052, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.169).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The evidence supporting an improvement in school attendance differed by analysis method. This, and various other important limitations of the data, caution against over-interpretation of the results. We find that the study provides some evidence, but with high risk of bias, that a school-based drug-treatment and health-education intervention improved school attendance and no evidence of effect on examination performance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Helminth</kwd><kwd>worms parasitic</kwd><kwd>randomized control trial</kwd><kwd>primary schools</kwd><kwd>Kenya</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p><boxed-text id="dyv128-INLINEBOX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Key Messages</p></caption><p>

In January 1998, there were 92 primary schools in these districts, of which 75 were included in the study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyv128-F1">Figure 1</xref>). Schools were systematically allocated, or &#x02018;quasi-randomized&#x02019; (for details see companion paper<xref rid="dyv128-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>), into three groups with 25 schools per group by Edward Miguel, Michael Kremer and Sylvie Moulin on an Excel spreadsheet (unpublished observation Edward Miguel). The intervention was introduced over 2 years: Group 1 schools received the intervention in both years; Group 2 schools received the intervention in year 2 only and were in the control arm in year 1; and Group 3 schools did not receive the intervention in either year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyv128-F2">Figure 2</xref>). The participants were not blinded to their allocation nor administered placebo. Concurrently, Internationaal Christelijk Steunfonds (ICS) were also evaluating five other interventions under their &#x02018;School Assistance Programme&#x02019; in 27/75 study schools (SAP schools).

The health education consisted of regular public lectures and wall charts, and one teacher per school was trained by staff at the Kenya Ministry of Health Division of Vector Borne Diseases (DVBD) to deliver health messages. Trial staff gave 10&#x02013;15-minute presentations on worm infection prevention several times a year. Drug treatment entailed biannual albendazole treatment in schools with geohelminth infection over 50%, and annual mass treatment with praziquantel in schools with schistosomiasis prevalence over 30%. Drug treatment was delivered to all boys and girls aged&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;12 years in eligible schools. The DVBD conducted parasitological surveys in advance of delivering the drug treatments that were used to measure the secondary outcomes of the trial. Schools in the control arm received neither component of the intervention. Mass treatment and whole-school health education necessitated school-level randomization. We inferred, in the absence of a protocol, that the complex intervention was intended to be delivered from the start of each calendar/academic year.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>We specified two co-primary outcomes: school attendance and educational attainment in end-of-year examinations. Outcomes were assessed among a closed cohort consisting of all pupils who were registered in grades 1&#x02013;8 at the start of year 1 and were eligible for drug treatment (boys and girls aged&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;12 years). Outcome data were censored after pupils moved schools. School intervention status was not concealed from fieldworkers collecting the outcome data.</p><p>School attendance was measured by ICS fieldworkers during unannounced school visits. Each year was divided into eight potential visit-periods. The 27 SAP schools were scheduled for visits during six periods in years 1 and 2; the 48 non-SAP schools were scheduled for four visits in year 1 and five in year 2. The school visit schedule was concealed and different in each period, although it is unclear how specific dates for visits were chosen. Attendance was binary: pupils were &#x02018;in attendance&#x02019; if observed to be present, and were &#x02018;not in attendance&#x02019; if they were not present. If the observation data were missing but records indicated the student had &#x02018;dropped out&#x02019;, then a pupil was coded as &#x02018;not in attendance&#x02019;. Handling of missingness in the attendance measure is described in Appendix 1 (available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ije/dyv128/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> at <italic>IJE</italic> online). In our individual-level analysis, each attendance observation was treated as a binary outcome and we did not aggregate observations for each pupil. Examinations in Mathematics, English, and Sciences were administered by ICS for pupils in grades 3&#x02013;8 at the end of each year. The raw marks were transformed into a measure of deviation from the examination-specific mean (z-score), and averaged for each pupil.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Worm infection and weight-for-age (WAZ) and height-for-age (HAZ) data were collected and specified in this analysis as secondary outcomes. These data were available for comparison between arms in year 1 only.</p><p>At baseline and the start of year 2, the DVBD assessed worm infection prevalence among sub-samples of pupils from schools about to initiate treatment. No testing was performed for Group 2 at baseline or Group 3 at any point. It is unclear how these sub-samples of pupils were selected. In Group 1, a &#x02018;representative subset&#x02019; of the pupils tested at baseline was sought for re-testing in year 2.<xref rid="dyv128-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The Kato-Katz technique was used for sample preparation, and egg counts from two readers were averaged and converted into eggs per gram of stool values. Arithmetic mean egg counts with standard World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds for moderate infection were calculated.<xref rid="dyv128-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>ICS collected anthropometric measures from all pupils in grades 3&#x02013;8 at baseline and the start of year 2. A questionnaire was administered on a pre-announced day and only to pupils who were present. A single enumerator read the scales and took height measurements for all of the pupils at a visit. Pupils were asked their age and ICS staff were encouraged to cross-check against school records. WAZ and HAZ were converted to z-scores by the original authors. WAZ and HAZ data were only considered to be missing if they were not recorded for grade 3&#x02013;8 pupils.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and consent</title><p>In both years, community and parent meetings were held in intervention schools immediately before delivery of the intervention. In year 1, parents who did not wish their children to receive the drug treatment were asked to inform their school headmaster. In year 2, under recommendation from the Kenyan Ministry of Health, ICS was required to collect written consent from parents for children to receive drug treatment. Pupils in all arms were asked for their consent to take part in the questionnaire survey. It is unclear what informed consent procedures were carried out for attendance observations in schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses included those eligible for treatment with deworming drugs: all boys and girls aged&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;12 years. All analyses were performed according to the original assigned group (intention-to-treat). In accordance with our interpretation of the intention-to-treat of this complex intervention, school attendance observations of pupils in 1998 were assigned to the treatment condition in Group1 and the control condition in Groups 2 and 3, and in 1999 observations were assigned to the treatment condition in Groups 1 and 2 and control condition in Group 3.</p><p>First, we described the characteristics of the study population and investigated patterns of missing data. We calculated mean cluster-summaries of baseline characteristics with confidence intervals for each group. We calculated mean age for each grade and applied this to pupils with missing age data as a simple form of imputation. We calculated the between-cluster coefficient of variation (k) for school attendance in the 50 control schools in year 1 and in the 50 intervention schools in year 2, and similarly the intra-cluster coefficient of variation (ICC) for examination performances. Initial analyses identified an unexpected cluster-level association between the level of school attendance and the total number of pupil-observations performed, which was influenced by whether or not schools were involved in the SAP programme. To describe and investigate this association further, we plotted the proportion of pupils observed as present in each school against the number of observations made in a school, stratified by year and by allocation group, and fitted ordinary-least-squares regression lines.</p><p>The primary-outcome analyses were conducted in three steps that increased progressively in complexity to reflect the cluster-allocated stepped-wedge design of the trial. First, in each year the means of the school-level summary outcomes for each group were calculated, and also for each intervention arm. The latter were compared within years using the unpaired t-test. Second, year-stratified random-effects logistic regression models were used to examine the association between the intervention and attendance, and mixed-effects linear regression for examination performance (see Appendix 2 for model specification, available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ije/dyv128/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> at <italic>IJE</italic> online). Random effects were fitted for school. Third, regression models with a fixed effect for year were used to combine the 2 years, which implicitly included comparison between Group 2 in year 1 (control) in year 2 (intervention). <italic>P-</italic>values for logistic regression were calculated using likelihood ratio tests. Sensitivity of the results to the exclusion of one school with no pupils recorded present in year 2 was examined.</p><p>All regression models included terms for the population size of the school and the zone of the school, since these were used to stratify the quasi-randomization, and further adjustment was made for variables that showed imbalance between groups at baseline. Using the combined-year logistic regression model, we investigated potential interaction by age and by school SAP status; the latter was not pre-specified in the pre-analysis plan. For the secondary analysis, we compared mean cluster summaries for each arm using unpaired t-tests.</p><p>In analyses that were not pre-planned, we investigated the sensitivity of our school attendance results to the assumption of the intention-to-treat applying from the start of each year. This was based on information in the study timeline (Appendix 4, available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ije/dyv128/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> at <italic>IJE</italic> online) that indicated that the drug component of the intervention was not delivered at the start of each year. We investigated two scenarios. In scenario one, we excluded observations of attendance in the first visit-period in 1998, and added observations in the first two visit-periods in 1999 to the analysis for the first year, assigning observations in Group 2 during both these visit-periods to the control condition. Therefore, &#x02018;year 1&#x02019; comprised observations in the second to the eighth visit-periods in 1998 plus observations in the first and second visit-periods in 1999. &#x02018;Year 2&#x02019; comprised observations in the third to the eighth visit-periods in 1999. This approximates to what was done in the original analysis.</p><p>In scenario two, we excluded observations of attendance in the first visit-period, and also excluded the observations in the first two visit-periods in 1999. This data handling avoids comparing observations of pupils in different years in the year-specific analyses, and is our preferred method to accommodate the described timing of the drug treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The trial took place between January 1998 and December 1999 (map Appendix 3; timeline Appendix 4; available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ije/dyv128/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> at <italic>IJE</italic> online). All 75 schools agreed to take part and none dropped out. Approximately 10500 pupils were enrolled in each group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="dyv128-T1">Table 1</xref>). A substantial proportion of age data were missing at baseline (6646 pupils, 21.1%); after imputation (using the mean age in each grade), there were 702 pupils with missing age data (2.2%)&#x02014;these pupils were also missing grade data. Pupils in Group 1 were 0.4 years older than those in Group 2 and a higher number of Group 2 schools were enrolled in the SAP (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) than in Group 1 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) or Group 3 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8). The sex ratio, proportion eligible for drug treatment, mean WAZ and distance to Lake Victoria were balanced across the groups. There were substantial missing sex data (3399 missing sex observations/31&#x02009;445 pupils; 10.8%) and the amount of missing data varied between groups. The mean school size was similar in the three groups but the range was much larger for Group 2 (minimum 37; maximum 1392).

During the first year, 168 pupils (1.6%) in Group 1 moved to a different school, 176 pupils (1.6%) in Group 2 and 200 (2.0%) in Group 3. By the end of year 2, 824 pupils (7.8%) in Group 1 moved, 810 (7.5%) in Group 2 and 742 (7.4%) in Group 3.</p><p>In year 1, two Group 2 schools were temporarily closed and pupils from these schools were absorbed by other local schools. Both were reported to have re-opened, but for one school none of the 7 pupil-observations in year 2 were recorded as present. This school was included in later analyses, but a sensitivity analysis showed no major impact of excluding it. In addition, one school in Group 3 had no attendance observations recorded in year 1 and one school in Group 2 had no examination results in year 2.</p><p>All intervention schools were eligible for mass albendazole treatment. In year 1, 6616 pupils in Group 1 received drug treatment (72.1% of those eligible), with none receiving treatment in Group 2 or 3. In year 2, 4516 Group 1 pupils (52.1%) and 4159 Group 2 (47.5%) pupils received drug treatment, as well as 91 pupils in Group 3. A minority of schools were eligible for mass schistosomiasis treatment (6/25 in year 1, 16/50 in year 2). Field documents from year 1 indicate that the educational components of the intervention were delivered to Group 1 schools. Documentation from the second year of the study was not received.</p><p>The numbers of school visits conducted are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyv128-F1">Figure 1</xref>. In year 1, 19 planned school visits were not conducted (5.4% of intended total), with the majority (11) in Group 2. In year 2, 83 planned visits were not conducted (20.6% of intended total), again the highest number being in Group 2 (21 in Group 1, 38 in Group 2 and 24 in Group 3). Data were available for 74% of pupils during conducted visits in year 1 and 86% in year 2, and within years the proportions were broadly similar between groups. In all three groups, school attendance was higher in year 1 than in year 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyv128-F3">Figure 3</xref>). In year 1, but not year 2, there were several schools that had more than 95% attendance. All of the schools with attendance above 95% were non-SAP schools. There was an unexpected association between the number of school-attendance observations in a school and the school&#x02019;s mean attendance, which depended on the intervention arm. As indicated by the slope of the lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyv128-F3">Figure 3</xref>, in 2/3 intervention group-years school attendance was higher in schools where more observations were undertaken. Conversely, the opposite relationship was seen in all three of the control group-years.

In adjusted regression models, the OR for &#x02018;year 1&#x02019; was slightly closer to the null, whereas the result for &#x02018;year 2&#x02019; was virtually unchanged. The adjusted combined-year logistic regression OR was larger, with similarly strong evidence. In scenario two, 11588 observations at the start of 1998 were excluded, as well as the 31404 observations during the first two visits in 1999. In comparison with our pre-specified primary analysis, the year-specific results were largely unchanged, with the cluster summary mean difference in year 2 being slightly larger. For the combined-year logistic regression analysis, the adjusted OR was larger than in the pre-specified analysis.

This effect differed by age and by whether or not schools were involved in another intervention programme (the School Assistance Programme). The strength of evidence supporting the improvement in school attendance was dependent on the analysis approach used, in particular when the two years were combined. Our first year-stratified analysis using unweighted cluster summaries found higher attendance in intervention schools in both years, but the evidence was weak. This analysis should be robust but may not be statistically optimal. To improve precision, we used random-effects regression on school attendance observations, an approach which gives greater weight to clusters with higher numbers of observations. This analysis found limited evidence of a moderate effect in year 1, and evidence of a small effect in year 2; these effects were of equivalent magnitude to the cluster-summary results. Finally, we pooled data from the 2 years using logistic regression and found strong evidence of an effect that was substantially larger in magnitude than either of the two year-specific effects. There was no evidence of effect of the intervention on examination performance.</p><p>The trial had several strengths; in particular, this was a large study and the attendance data were collected using direct observation. A limitation of the trial was that it lacked a clearly pre-documented plan for sampling, data collection, data management and analysis. These documents would help to understand why some schools were not visited, the day of the week on which schools were visited and any ways in which the data collected differed from what was intended. Without access to these documents, we cannot explain why the observed relationship between the number of school-attendance observations in a school and the school&#x02019;s mean attendance depended on the intervention arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyv128-F3">Figure 3</xref>). We did not anticipate this correlation when pre-specifying our analysis plan. This underlying correlation in the data could potentially bias effect estimates using random-effects regression methods, since these gave more weight to schools with more observations.</p><p>The stepped-wedge design appeared to exacerbate the influence of the unexpected patterns in the data. The combined-years model estimated an effect that was higher than either of the two year-specific effects. We suggest this may partly be due to the fact that the intervention effect from the combined-year analysis includes a non-randomized comparison of Group 2 between years, before and after introduction of the intervention. This comparison can usefully increase the precision of the effect estimate if secular trends are adequately controlled.<xref rid="dyv128-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> We suggest that a simple diagnostic that should lead to caution in the analysis of stepped-wedge trials because of inadequate control for secular trends might apply when&#x02014;as we have found in this study&#x02014;the combined-step effect estimate is substantially outside the bounds of the randomized step-specific estimates; in this study, years represent the steps in the wedge. We are particularly concerned about the reliability of this before-after comparison because, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyv128-F3">Figure 3</xref> shows, in Group 2 the association between the number of pupil observations and mean school attendance changed between years. This would potentially lead to overestimation of the effect on attendance in a weighted analysis. Furthermore, as this is a closed cohort, the study population in year 2 was on average 1 year older than in year 1, some pupils had dropped out and some had aged out (i.e. left school after completing grade 8). Due to limitations in the data collection, we did not attempt to censor pupils who left school. Thus, a pupil observed to be &#x02018;absent&#x02019; on a particular visit was progressively more likely to have permanently left school.</p><p>Further concerns arise from the patterns in the data. The schools with very high (&#x0003e; 95%) attendance in year 1 were all non-SAP schools, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyv128-F3">Figure 3</xref>, and fieldworker visit schedules were different for SAP and non-SAP schools (different frequency and timing; Appendix 2, available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ije/dyv128/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> at <italic>IJE</italic> online). In year 2, the attendance patterns of SAP and non-SAP schools were similar, and the visit schedules were more alike. It is possible that these systematic differences in data collection affected the measured level of attendance because of seasonal variation in school attendance. With regard to planned school visits that were not performed by fieldworkers, it is possible that the obstacles to visiting would also have affected pupils and may have varied over time. These effects could lead to bias, especially when combining results across the two study years.</p><p>In light of these issues, we are particularly uncertain about the validity of estimates arising from combined-year analyses of these data, and advise that such results should be interpreted with caution. We have greater confidence that the year-stratified analyses reflect attendance differences between treatment and control, but with modest statistical evidence. A limitation of this research is that, to our knowledge, there is no accepted method for combining the randomized comparisons in each year to estimate an overall effect and confidence interval with binary data from a stepped-wedge trial without evoking a non-randomized before-after comparison in clusters that change treatment arm.<xref rid="dyv128-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>In an exploratory analysis, we investigated the sensitivity of the results to the specification of &#x02018;year 1&#x02019; and &#x02018;year 2&#x02019;. In neither of the two scenarios were the results substantially different from the pattern of the results of our pre-specified analyses. Since the sensitivity analysis did not incorporate any indication about when the educational component of the intervention was delivered, it may be incorrect to characterize the observations during the first visits in 1998 or the observations in the first two visits in Group 2 as control, as is done in scenario one. In the absence of a protocol it is not possible to conduct a true intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>We note that an effect, if present, on school attendance may not have arisen because of drug treatment. In a companion paper,<xref rid="dyv128-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> an effect reported in the original paper on the reduction in prevalence of anaemia was not present in re-analysis. In line with other research,<xref rid="dyv128-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> we found no short-term effect of the intervention on WAZ or HAZ in this statistical replication. These biological effects are key steps on causal pathways typically used to link deworming drug treatment with other benefits. Allocation to the intervention arm could therefore plausibly have affected school attendance through behavioural pathways affected by the educational component of the intervention, the placebo effect of the drug treatment or the Hawthorne effect.</p><p>Regarding generalizability of the intervention effect, worm burden needs to be high for schools to be eligible for the treatment. Burden may also affect the magnitude of effects: low burden may explain why a large trial in India evaluating the effect of deworming and vitamin A supplementation on pre-school mortality found no effect.<xref rid="dyv128-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Without clear articulation of a causal pathway, it is unclear what other factors would need to be similar in other settings to generalize the results of this study.</p><p>This trial is, to our knowledge, the only published trial to investigate the effect of school-level deworming on educational outcomes. In our re-analysis, the strength of evidence that the deworming intervention improved school attendance was dependent on analytical choices, some of which are at risk of bias. The dataset had substantial amounts of missing data, hard-to-explain school attendance patterns and limited evidence for intermediate steps on the intervention&#x02019;s hypothesized causal pathway. We therefore conclude that this study provides some evidence for an effect of this complex intervention on school attendance, but with high risk of bias. For examination performance, there was no evidence of effect. We caution against generalizing these findings to other settings and recommend that further research is conducted.</p><p>The pre-analysis plan for this re-analysis can be found at [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer/2013/05/14/">http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer/2013/05/14/</ext-link> aiken_replication_plan_final.pdf].</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ije/dyv128/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>IJE</italic> online.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source>International Initiative for Impact Evaluation</funding-source> as part of the first round of their Replication Programme [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/funding/replication-window/">http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/funding/replication-window/</ext-link>].
