The aim of this trial was to test the impact of a new chart incorporating a modified EWS (MEWS) system and a linked training program on nurses&#x02019; responses to clinical deterioration (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were: numbers of patients with vital signs recordings in the first eight postoperative hours; number of times each vital sign was recorded; and nurses&#x02019; knowledge.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial of intervention versus standard care was conducted in three intervention and three control adult surgical wards in an 867-bed public hospital in Cape Town, between March and July 2010; thereafter the MEWS chart was withdrawn. A total of 50 out of 122 nurses in full-time employment participated. From 1,427 case notes, 114 were selected by randomization for assessment.</p><p>The MEWS chart was implemented in intervention wards. Control wards delivered standard care, without training. Case notes were reviewed two weeks after the trial&#x02019;s completion. Knowledge was assessed in both trial arms by blinded independent marking of written tests before and after training of nurses in intervention wards. Analyses were undertaken with IBM SPSS software on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients in trial arms were similar. Introduction of the MEWS was not associated with statistically significant changes in responses to clinical deterioration (50 of 57 received no assistance versus 55 of 57, odds ratio (OR): 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05 to 1.31), despite improvement in nurses&#x02019; knowledge in intervention wards. More patients in intervention than control wards had recordings of respiratory rate (27 of 57 versus 2 of 57, OR: 24.75, 95% CI: 5.5 to 111.3) and recordings of all seven parameters (5 of 57 versus 0 of 57 patients, risk estimate: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A MEWS chart and training program enhanced recording of respiratory rate and of all parameters, and nurses&#x02019; knowledge, but not nurses&#x02019; responses to patients who triggered the MEWS reporting algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pactr.org/ATMWeb/appmanager/atm/atmregistry?_nfpb=true&#x00026;_windowLabel=trialViewer_1_2&#x00026;trialViewer_1_2_actionOverride=%2Fpageflows%2Ftrial%2FtrialViewer%2FviewTrail&#x00026;trialViewer_1_2id=626">PACTR201309000626545</ext-link>) on 9 September 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0624-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cluster randomized trial</kwd><kwd>Developing country</kwd><kwd>In-service training</kwd><kwd>Monitoring (physiological)</kwd><kwd>Pragmatic randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Vital signs</kwd><kwd>Scoring systems (MeSH checked 3 April 2013)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Critically ill patients are increasingly being nursed on general wards, where it is reported that monitoring of vital signs is infrequent and inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Interpretation of signs of clinical deterioration is poor, and responses to clinical deterioration are inappropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinical and physiological deterioration, including changes in respiratory rates, occurs six to eight hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] before cardiopulmonary arrest. Arrest often occurs after a period of unrecognized, slow, and progressive physiological deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Multi-professional in-hospital courses for life support after a catastrophic event are well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, there are few examples of training programs for early recognition and management of adult patients with impending critical illness. One such program, the &#x02018;Acute Life-threatening Events - Recognition and Treatment&#x02019; (ALERT) course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], is based on the assumption of pre-existing knowledge of the biosciences, but previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] suggests that this underpinning knowledge may be suboptimal. Traditional assumptions that mortality and determinants of survival fall within the domain of medical care may be inhibiting nurse-led research in this area, but there is increasing evidence that these outcomes are &#x02018;nursing sensitive&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] .</p><p>Introducing an early warning scoring (EWS) or modified early warning scoring (MEWS) system is complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and before and after evaluation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] indicate that EWS systems improve detection of clinical deterioration. This paper describes a pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster randomized, controlled trial evaluating the impact of a MEWS training program and published consensus-derived MEWS observations chart (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] on the proportion of patients with physiological variables recorded and nurses&#x02019; responses.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are no published randomized controlled trials or other experimental studies on the implementation and evaluation of MEWS training programs and recording systems. The purpose of this trial of intervention versus standard care was to test the impact of a MEWS system and a linked training program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>We designed a prospective, pragmatic, cluster randomized trial with two arms (intervention versus no intervention), using hospital surgical wards as the unit of randomization, testing the hypothesis that nurse training plus introduction of a locally developed MEWS chart would improve knowledge, recording of vital signs, and nurses&#x02019; responses to predetermined physiological thresholds. Randomization was at two levels: wards and patient records. Our study satisfied the six criteria for pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There were no deviations from the protocol.</p><p>A pragmatic, cluster randomized trial design was chosen to minimize contamination, as nurses might use information for all patients, consciously or subconsciously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A permanent nurse was unlikely to be assigned to both an intervention and control ward, therefore allocation of all nurses in respective clusters to the intervention or control arm, rather than individual nurses, limited the threat of contamination. Secondly, monitoring, recording, and interpreting patients&#x02019; vital signs and responding to abnormal physiology is the responsibility of the ward nursing team, and evaluation of the quality of such care is best assessed at ward or cluster level. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] were used to report the study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study sites</title><p>The study was conducted between 1 March and 31 July 2010 in six purposively sampled adult wards for general, vascular, and orthopedic surgery in an 867-bed academic public (government) hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. The traditional &#x02018;cardiac arrest team&#x02019;&#x02009;, comprising ICU nurses and doctors, had been replaced by ward response teams more than two decades previously. There was no hospital-wide emergency response system for predefined thresholds for deterioration in physiological variables and no EWS system in place on any general wards. Approval for implementation of the MEWS chart was limited to the study period; usual care was resumed at the conclusion of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sampling</title><p>Patient case notes from intervention and control wards provided clinical and demographic data.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion criteria for records from intervention and control wards</title><p>All patients identified from case notes who were aged 14&#x000a0;years or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], had had a general anaesthetic, and were admitted to one of the six research wards between 1 May and 31 July 2010, were eligible for inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exclusion criteria for patient records</title><p>Those with absent, incomplete or unavailable records (for example due to medico-legal review) were excluded from the study. Incomplete records were defined as not including observations charts and patient progress notes. If either was absent, case notes were discarded, and replaced by an alternative random number. Patients designated &#x02018;not for resuscitation&#x02019; in their case notes were excluded from the study as this might have affected nurses&#x02019; responses to changes in vital signs. Any case notes of patients transferred to high dependency care from the operating room, or from the ward, within eight hours of their operation (including patients who had died there) were excluded from the study because the study focus was ward-based vital sign monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size determination for record review</title><p>We are unaware of any randomized controlled trials examining quality of recording of postoperative vital signs on general wards, or nurses&#x02019; responses to abnormal physiology, as defined by MEWS scores; this might be attributed to the relative novelty of this method of monitoring vital signs. However, the United Kingdom Health Foundation&#x02019;s Safer Patients Initiative (SPI) controlled before and after study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] indicates that a multi-component organizational intervention increases respiratory rate monitoring frequency from 40 (93 out of 233) to 69% (165 out of 239) in control hospitals, and from 37 (141 out of 381) to 78% (296 out of 379) in intervention hospitals. Preparatory work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] indicated that patients&#x02019; respiratory rate was the parameter monitored least frequently (1.8%, one out of 55) in these wards. We felt an increase in respiratory rate monitoring frequency from 1.8 (one out of 55) to at least 20.0% (11 out of 55)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], would be clinically important and, based on the results of the study above, achievable.</p><p>A sample of 114 records (57 from each trial arm) was calculated to be sufficient to detect a difference of 18.2% (from 1.8 to 20.0%) between arms in the frequency of monitoring respiratory rates, with 80% power and 5% significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. No information was available on the impact of clustering on MEWS system use, and no intra-cluster correlation coefficient could be calculated.</p><p>All nurses who were permanently employed full time (professional, staff, and auxiliary) on the six study wards, and covering day and night shifts, were invited to participate in the training evaluation (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;62 on intervention wards, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;60 on control wards). Part-time staff were temporary and recruited from agencies. These individuals fluctuated daily, so they could not be included. Student nurses were excluded as they were allocated on a temporary, <italic>ad hoc</italic> basis. Unlike agency staff, permanent nurses were assigned to single wards, reducing the threat of contamination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization and sequence generation of wards</title><p>Six wards were randomized to either the intervention or control trial arms by the drawing of sealed lots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization and sequence generation of patient records</title><p>Following conclusion of the intervention, patients&#x02019; records were obtained for review. To select a total of 114 records, 19 records were randomly selected from all six wards. For patients who met the inclusion criteria, random numbers were generated using SPSS (IBM Corp., IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 19.0, Armonk, NY): each record was screened and, if incomplete, unavailable, or meeting other exclusion criteria, an alternative random number was generated and a new record was selected by further randomization. Records of all patients who met inclusion criteria, including those who died on the ward, were examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recruitment of nurses</title><p>Post-randomization, all nurses in the intervention arm were approached to seek voluntary participation in the training program (two declined). Nurses in the control arm were recruited for voluntary participation in the pre- and post-intervention knowledge testing only (none declined) (Additional file: <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> Pre- and post- intervention test).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Allocation concealment and blinding</title><p>Allocation concealment was managed by an independent person (administrator, NL) drawing sealed lots, being blinded to the ward names on the lots and to outcome (intervention and control trial arms).</p><p>Patients were unaware of their allocation. Nurses who participated voluntarily in the training program and knowledge testing were not blinded to allocation, as the purpose of the training was to implement the MEWS chart.</p><p>Data collectors (JO and TW) were blinded to the allocation and implementation of the intervention. Data analysts for the knowledge tests (JO) and case notes (JJ and SJ) were blinded to the codes identifying trial arms. The first author (UK) was the Principal Investigator (PI) and was not blinded for two reasons: 1) the PI conducted nurses&#x02019; knowledge tests and trained nurses in the intervention wards in the use of the MEWS chart; and 2) the hospital database and operating room register identified patients by name and folder number, and both were searched manually for inclusion criteria for participants. Once identified, the PI requested case notes by name and folder number from the Records Department and signed a confidentiality clause. The CONSORT extended pragmatic checklist allows for an explanation of the absence of blinding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>The Cape Town modified early warning score training program</title><p>The Cape Town MEWS training program and manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] included basic physiology and literature on the advantages of using patients&#x02019; early warning scores as part of the handover process, thereby focusing shift handover meetings on patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Three experts validated the content and face validity of the knowledge test, training manual, and power point presentation, using a checklist and scale of one to four to establish the Index of Content Validity (CVI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], giving a rating of three to four (high content-validity) for each. Recommended changes were made before administration.</p><p>Attendance at the two-hour interactive training sessions was dependent on staffing and workload as there were no resources to replace nurses on training. Wards released one to three nurses at a time, so five repeat training sessions were needed for day staff. Nurses on night duty were trained individually or in pairs when they were next on day duty. Nurses&#x02019; knowledge pre-and post-intervention was tested in all six wards (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Of the 11 official languages, English is used for recordings in patient notes, and was the medium of instruction and testing, although it is a second or third language for most nurses.</p><p>Staggered pre-intervention knowledge testing was conducted between 12 March and 23 March for nurses in both trial arms. The MEWS training program was conducted between 12 March and 22 April. The MEWS chart was introduced on 1 May and removed at midnight on 31 July. Post-intervention knowledge testing was conducted between 3 August and 13 August.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Implementing the Cape Town modified early warning score observation chart</title><p>While standard care (existing observations chart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]) continued in three control wards, the Cape Town MEWS observations chart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) was implemented in the three intervention wards. This MEWS chart indicates which scores should be reported, the degree of urgency needed, and where a total score should be entered.</p><p>During training, nurses were instructed to assign the correct score for each vital sign recorded, total the scores, and respond as follows: for a single parameter MEWS of one, to recheck the measurement after half an hour and report if there was no improvement; for a single parameter MEWS of two, to recheck the measurement after five minutes and report immediately if there was no improvement; for a critical single parameter MEWS of three, to report urgently; and for a total MEWS of three or higher, to report urgently. Senior ward nurses who had received training were recruited as MEWS Project Leaders, identifiable by a lanyard bearing a card with this title. Their task was to keep the project on track, order sufficient copies of the chart from the first author, and to ensure that new staff received training. Training manuals were available on all intervention wards. Patients&#x02019; records (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;114) were reviewed two weeks after the completion of the study, on 31 July 2010. Data were captured electronically on an Excel criterion-based record review form. Researchers recoded vital signs from existing observations charts onto MEWS charts for all patients in the control arm and patients in the intervention arm where the MEWS charts were blank (36.8%, 21 out of 57).

The South African National Health Research Ethics Committee (NHREC) was notified of the study in 2009 (application 2009/3483). The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from nurse participants on intervention wards for the training program and knowledge testing, and on control wards for knowledge testing only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Cluster randomized controlled trials raise important ethical issues in relation to the nature and practice of informed consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. When the MEWS observations chart was implemented on the three intervention wards, consent was not obtained from individual nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] or patients, as the institutional consent (guardianship) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] was considered to be the &#x02018;community consent&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] on behalf of individuals in the intervention clusters. The University of Cape Town, Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee waived the need for written informed consent from individual patients whose records were reviewed. In terms of South African legislation at that time (National Health Act No. 61 of 2003, Section 16 (2)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] a health care provider may examine a user&#x02019;s health records for the purposes of research without authorization if the research will not obtain information relating to the identity of the user.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Record review</title><p>Of 1,427 patients undergoing surgery between 1 May and 31 July 2010 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), 493 were aged 14&#x000a0;years or more and had received a general anaesthetic.

A pragmatic, cluster randomized, parallel group, controlled clinical trial of a training program and a MEWS chart for the detection of early signs of clinical deterioration made significant differences to knowledge, recording of respiratory rate, and recording of all seven physiological parameters during the first eight postoperative hours. However, there was little evidence that the intervention improved nurses&#x02019; responses to patients who triggered a critical MEWS reporting algorithm.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Limitations</title><p>Difficulties with the conduct, analysis, and reporting of cluster trials have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in both developed countries and sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Approval for implementation and testing of the MEWS in this study was limited to the period of study and the researchers had no authority to plan for its further use in practice thereafter. Although a cluster trial is intended to minimize contamination, professionals in the control arm may be sensitized to the problems under investigation by their involvement with researchers or communication with colleagues in the intervention arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Any nurses from control wards, untrained in the MEWS, voluntarily working overtime shifts in intervention wards might have diluted the impact of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; this may account for some, but not all, of the non-use of 37% of MEWS charts and the improvement in nurses&#x02019; knowledge in control wards. Unusually for a randomized controlled trial, this work was conducted in a real-world setting in a resource-poor environment in a developing country. As in most cluster trials, we were unable to link individual nurses and patients, and most patients would have received care from several nurses. MEWS charts are not problem-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and the complexity of introducing a EWS system and educational program suggest that pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trials or stepped wedge trials might be preferable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] to patient randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Suboptimal compliance with the MEWS affected the trial; no scores were totaled. Complex systems such as EWS are prone to human calculation errors, when &#x02018;pen and paper&#x02019; is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], rather than electronic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Not all patients in both trial arms had recordings of all seven vital signs. In our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in the same six wards, results showed a similar pattern of recording of vital signs, and no patients&#x02019; records contained recordings for all seven parameters displayed on the MEWS. The absence of a total MEWS or a MEWS for one or more (of six) vital signs in 47% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;509) of patients in general surgical and medical wards in an observational data analysis pre- and post-intervention study in Belgium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] resonates with our findings. There were differences in recordings between trial arms but similar rates of &#x02018;abnormal&#x02019; vital signs (by MEWS criteria). The absence of catastrophic clinical consequences in both trial arms is noteworthy, but not unusual in our clinical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and we have no evidence that the MEWS improved clinical outcomes.</p><p>Our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in the same wards indicated a similar uniform absence of responses to abnormal vital signs. Per protocol analyses indicated that, where used, the MEWS increased recordings of oxygen saturation and level of consciousness, in addition to respiratory rate. In both intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, more patients in the intervention arm had abnormalities reported. However, differences did not reach statistical significance. Those that comply with trial protocols are not a random sample and may be different in some ways. Selectively excluding those who violate protocols may introduce bias, necessitating cautious interpretation of per protocol analyses. We acknowledge a paucity of conservatism in our sample size calculation, most particularly that we were unable to take account of clustering; however, data collection was limited by available resources. A larger sample is needed to test these findings. Our findings are presented without correction for multiple testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] in order to delineate leads for larger trials, and interpretation rests with readers.</p><p>Traditionally, nursing work that is not recorded is regarded as incomplete or even &#x02018;not done&#x02019;. However, the absence of recorded interventions for patients meeting pre-determined criteria for intervention, although of deep concern, does not mean necessarily that there were no interventions. Nevertheless, without a documented record, nurses&#x02019; reporting is incomplete, and counted as such in this study. From single site research we cannot assume that respondents and response patterns are representative of other populations. The trial location may have influenced recruitment, retention, and clinical outcomes. A new vital signs chart may improve recording due to increased interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>No nurse observation protocol existed at our research site. Intervals between manual monitoring of vital signs on general wards vary substantially, for example between eight and 12&#x000a0;hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Our study might have been strengthened by implementing and evaluating compliance with a standard protocol for frequency of physiological observations of at least every 12&#x000a0;hours for every patient, as recommended in the United Kingdom&#x02019;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical Practice Guideline 50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. There were few deaths and too many confounding factors in a clinical setting to attribute these outcomes to inadequate recording and reporting. A much larger sample would be needed to examine the effect of the MEWS on SAEs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>The realities of practice</title><p>Incomplete recording of all seven vital signs in the postoperative period was high in the intervention arm and worse in the control arm. In the control arm, poor recording might be attributed to the absence of guidelines for appropriate frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and number of vital signs to be recorded. Not all MEWS charts include monitoring of urine output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Poor recording of oxygen saturation following the administration of a general anaesthetic and opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] is of concern.</p><p>The improvement in scores between pre- and post-intervention knowledge tests of nurses in the intervention arm from 41.9 to 61.4% did not translate into improved documented reporting of patients who met the pre-determined criteria for intervention. The MEWS does not replace clinical judgment in detecting deteriorating patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Even so, nurses failed to report deranged physiological parameters for 87.7% (intervention) and 96.5% (control) patients. This is deeply concerning and raises questions about the specificity of the MEWS to identify &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; patients. However, in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in the same wards, there were no reported interventions for 10 out of 11 (90.9%) patients who died and had abnormal physiology, and for 38 (86.4%) control patients with abnormal physiology. The specificity of the Cape Town MEWS had been determined at between 77.3 and 81.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other studies also report nurses&#x02019; failure to communicate concerns and inappropriate responses when patients showed signs of physiological deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. There are too many confounding factors in a clinical setting to attribute these outcomes to inadequate recording and reporting. Strategies for implementing and monitoring patient safety initiatives in large tertiary hospitals need to accommodate the complexity of such organizations. Patients admitted to this level of care have complex conditions requiring treatment not available at secondary level hospitals, increasing their risk of adverse events. Other factors have to be considered.</p><p>Problems arise when nurses are competent in using technology for the monitoring of vital sign but lack clinical knowledge in interpreting data and intervening appropriately to ensure optimum and safe patient care. Misinterpretation of clinical data is associated with poor clinical reasoning skills and, in studies using computer-based clinical scenarios, nurses have been found to overestimate risks and the need to intervene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. An Australian survey found that nurses may not always follow predetermined medical emergency team (MET) calling criteria and may not recognize when assistance is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>Poor recording of vital signs and little evidence of appropriate responses to signs of physiological deterioration may be linked to &#x02018;task allocation&#x02019;, the method of patient care employed in the research wards, in preference to &#x02018;patient allocation&#x02019;. It is standard practice in South African wards to delegate monitoring, recording, and interpretation of patient observations to nursing auxiliaries and enrolled nurses, and the quality of recording should be viewed within this context. The core function of the nurse in avoiding SAEs should go beyond the recording of patients&#x02019; physiological vital signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. It is the nurse&#x02019;s professional responsibility to understand the significance of patient observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Benefits of the intervention</title><p>Disappointingly, the improved knowledge scores only reached 61.4%, and may have been impacted by language difficulties and the inclusion of non-professional nurses who have a non-academic qualification. The MEWS chart resulted in significantly more patients in the intervention wards than control wards having recordings of respiratory rate, the best discriminator for clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Not all existing observation charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] included respiratory rate monitoring. This trial showed that, if included, respiratory rate is more likely to be monitored. As respiratory rate monitoring is the best discriminator of SAEs, it has replaced recording of oxygen saturation on some charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, the improved scores suggest that a hospital-wide training program for early recognition and management of patients with impending critical illness is needed, in order to complement in-service education programs for late rescue techniques, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Low pre-intervention bioscience knowledge scores in both trial arms confirm previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] that suggests that this underpinning knowledge may be suboptimal.</p><p>Improved recording did not translate into an improvement in responses to deranged physiology. The Cape Town ward MEWS has a wider range of cut points (thresholds) for respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, systolic BP, and temperature than other published MEWS. This might have made interpretation of parameter readings more difficult, and may have accounted for the low response rate to the large number of triggers, despite training. This raises questions regarding the clinical effectiveness of the MEWS chart deployed to identify patients at risk and the user friendliness of the chart. To address the latter possibility, a revised version of the Cape Town ward MEWS observations chart (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2: Revised Cape Town MEWS chart) is presented. The United Kingdom National Early Warning Score (NEWS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] was not available when the study was undertaken. Since completion of this trial, we have substituted the values from the NEWS into the Cape Town ward MEWS, with permission from the United Kingdom Royal College of Physicians, as the NEWS values retain the range of trigger cut points (thresholds) (heart rate: 111 to 129; systolic BP: 81 to 100) we found to be associated with mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. User friendliness of the chart might be improved by reducing the number of cut points (thresholds) for physiological parameters that were not associated with mortality. To assist those responding to patients&#x02019; physiological deterioration, the United Kingdom NEWS algorithm for a total MEWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] has been included on the revised chart, in addition to guidelines for reporting a single parameter trigger.</p><p>The association between recordings of vital sign parameters (including respiratory rates) and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] challenges traditional assumptions that mortality outcomes and determinants of survival fall solely within the domain of medical care, and provides further evidence that these outcomes are &#x02018;nursing sensitive&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nurses are concerned that patients on general wards are having increasingly more complex surgery, increasing their dependence and morbidity which, in the face of understaffing, results in increased workload and suboptimal quality of care, leaving less time to apply learning in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Specialist nurses, increased registered nurse (RN)-to-patient ratios and a richer RN skill mix (more RNs than other categories of nurses), is inversely related to hospital mortality rates (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,184 nurses in 168 hospitals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and to most adverse events (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;124,204 patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. These results should be generalized cautiously as hospital characteristics vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. A total of 19 of 27 studies that were systematically reviewed found an association between one or more unfavorable nursing environmental attributes and higher mortality. Despite extensive variability in attribute and outcome measures, settings, and research quality across studies, there is evidence that social and environmental characteristics of hospital nursing practice affect the outcomes of care, but more research is needed to link the nursing environment, including patient monitoring, to patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The monitoring of vital signs should be central to patient safety initiatives and hospital-wide morbidity and mortality reviews.
