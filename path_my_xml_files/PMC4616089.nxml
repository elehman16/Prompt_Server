therapy as a part of an integrated treatment for sequelae in the musculoskeletal system of
torture survivors. [Subjects] This study reviewed 30 male torture survivors presenting
with chronic low back pain. They were randomly selected and divided into two groups: an
experimental group and a control group. [Methods] For the experimental group, complex
manual therapy was performed twice a week for 8 weeks to improve the physical sequelae of
patients. Improvement was measured using the PDS-K for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD), the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain examination, the Korean Oswestry Disability
Index (KODI) for back function assessment, and the Balance System SD as a dynamic balance
test. The total period of the intervention for both groups was 8 weeks. [Results] For the
experimental group, PDS-K, VAS, KODI, and the dynamic balance test all showed significant
improvements after the intervention, which they did not for the control group. In the
comparison of the groups, PDS-K, VAS, KODI, and the dynamic balance test all showed
significant differences. [Conclusion] Complex manual therapy for torture survivors with
chronic low back pain contributes to functional recovery by reducing back pain. The
treatment can be considered to have positive effects on sequelae in the musculoskeletal
system of torture survivors as they age.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>Complex manual therapy</kwd><kwd>Torture survivor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Examinations of torture victims, even years after torture, have found a high incidence of
mental and physical symptoms. The physical symptoms are mainly associated with the
musculoskeletal system, but symptoms in vital organs are also common<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
occurrence of positive physical findings suggesting an organic cause for these symptoms are
reported to be low, and therefore torture victims&#x02019; symptoms are often classified as
psychosomatic<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Throughout the years, several chronic muscular pain syndromes have
been described. Regional or diffuse pain in the musculoskeletal system is often associated
with poor sleep, tiredness, paraesthesiae, headache, and irritable symptoms of the gut and
bladder<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The etiology and
pathogenesis of the chronic muscular pain syndromes are not fully known, but today there is
general agreement that changes in spinal and supra-spinal pain modulating mechanisms are of
central importance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Musculoskeletal sequelae of torture often show the same clinical
picture as that seen in chronic muscular pain syndromes. Several studies of torture victims
agree that physical complaints are common even many years after torture. Complaints of pain
with relation to the musculoskeletal system dominate, but neurological symptoms and
complaints from various organ systems are also common.</p><p>In 1993, the Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims (RCT) in Copenhagen,
Denmark, reviewed 51 torture victims who were examined on average 8.5&#x02005;years after being
tortured. The results were as follows: 92% complained of pain related to the
musculo-skeletal system (65% in the head and neck, 30% in the back, 8% in the upper
extremities, 41% in the lower extremities, 12% in more than one region), 37% had
neurological complaints, 18% complaints of the heart and lung, 30% complaints of the stomach
and intestines, and 18% complaints of the urinary tract and genitals (unpublished data).
These findings are in agreement with a Swedish study of 200 torture victims, of whom 62% had
muscle pain, 28% joint pain, 19% neurological complaints (disturbances of sensation,
radiating pain), 32% complaints of the stomach and gut, 27% symptoms of the urinary tract
and genitals, and 30% vegetative symptoms (shortness of breath, palpitations, profuse
sweating)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus, the clinical picture is one of localized or diffuse pain in the muscles, joint pain,
and neurological complaints, mainly in the form of disturbances of sensation and radiating
pain, as well as irritable symptoms of the organs, the same picture seen in chronic muscle
pain syndromes. In the literature, the commonest objective findings are also related to the
musculoskeletal system, typically as muscular tenderness as well as tenderness and
restricted movements of the joints and spine. Under neurological examination disturbances of
sensation dominate, whereas motor impairment such as decreased power and lack of re&#x0fb02;exes is
rarer<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Apart from these findings, physical examination supplemented by
other examinations, such as X-ray, ultrasound scanning, endoscopy, ECG, or EEG, rarely
reveal abnormalities (unpublished data, RCT). This discrepancy between the many physical
complaints and the few objective findings has led to classification of torture victims&#x02019;
symptoms as psychosomatic.</p><p>One group of torture survivors in Korea, injured during the May 18 democratic movement,
reportedly showed 42% to have physical diseases, 30% physical and mental diseases, 18%
mental diseases and 10% unknown diseases<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given that most May 18 participants suffer from PTSD even 25&#x02005;years
after the incident, their sequelae have developed along with PTSD<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies of such survivors suggest that physical
symptoms are predominantly pain occurring in the musculoskeletal system, which appears
several years after torture<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various
studies have been carried out of physiotherapy for torture survivors by rehabilitation
centers all over the world; however, little has been done in Korea. Thus the purpose of this
study was examine the effect on PTSD, pain and lumbar function when manual therapy is
performed for torture survivors with chronic lower back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was performed using a pre/post-test control group design. At the T center located
in G city, 30 subjects who met the selection criteria and exclusion criteria for low back
pain among male torture survivor subjects (n=30) were selected. By means of a coin toss,
they were divided randomly into a complex manual therapy group (experimental group=15) and a
self-exercise group (control group=15). This study was approved by the psychological T
center, and all the participants provided their written informed consent.</p><p>In the experimental group, the average age was 59.2&#x000b1;6.6&#x02005;years, the average height was
169.6&#x000b1;6.5 cm, and the average weight was 64.8&#x000b1;8.8&#x02005;kg. In the control group, the average age
was 62.6&#x000b1;6.6&#x02005;years, the average height was 167.7&#x000b1;5.8 cm, and the average weight was
67.3&#x000b1;8.9&#x02005;kg.</p><p>For the experimental group, complex manual therapy was performed twice a week for 8 weeks
to improve sequelae in the musculoskeletal system caused by torture. In one session,
Myo-Facial Release (MFR) was carried out for half an hour, to release muscle tension by
gently pulling up and down on the erector spinae muscles with the hands, with the client in
a prone position. For another half an hour the Muscle Energy Technique (MET) was performed,
to release tension in the hamstring and gluteus maximus with the client&#x02019;s feet on the
therapist&#x02019;s shoulders, and the subjects exercised by pushing down on the shoulders with the
feet. Subsequently, the following exercises were carried out for an hour to mitigate
hypertension and pain in the digitorum longus of the lower back: pelvic posterior tilt
exercise; upper abdominal exercises; lumbar stabilization exercise extension exercise for
muscle strength by bridge exercise a with sling, and self-exercise<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The control group was educated in self-exercise for the back using manual therapy. During
the education, verbal explanations, demonstrations by the therapist, and handouts were
provided. Both groups were checked for their adherence to the exercise schedule every week.
Both groups carried out their exercises for 90 minutes a session 3 times per week. The total
period of the intervention was 8 weeks.</p><p>In this study, subjects&#x02019; lower back pain was evaluated using the scales used were PDS-K,
Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Korean Oswestry Disability Index (KODI), and dynamic balance
test. PDS-K is a brief but reliable self-report measure of PTSD which assesses PTSD and
symptom severity in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV
(DSM-IV). Since it contains six diagnostic criteria, it can be used as a diagnosis method
and applied to those who experience various traumatic events<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To identify the extent of pain over the body, VAS was used. The client marked their pain
score directly on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. Score 0 implies &#x02018;no pain&#x02019; and score 10
implies &#x02018;unbearable pain<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. KODI was used
to assess functional disability caused by lower back pain. The index has nine items which
are scored from 0 to 5 (pain level, personal hygiene, lifting objects, gait, sitting,
standing, sleeping, social activity, and traveling and moving). A higher score indicates
higher functional disability<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dynamic
balance was measured using a Balance System SD (Biodex Inc, USA). The measurement device is
composed of a round mat with a motion-detecting sensor, a monitor on which targets are
displayed, and a computer and printer.</p><p>For Window<sup>TM</sup> SPSS 18.0 was used for the statistical analysis, The paired t-test
was used for before and after comparison, and independent t-test was used for between group
comparison with a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes were compared over time in back pain, function and balance between the two groups.
In the PDS-K examination, the control group did not show difference between before and after

of mental and physical symptoms. Physical symptoms are mainly associated with the
musculoskeletal system, but symptoms of the vital organs are also common<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The sequelae in the musculoskeletal system caused by torture depend on the torture method,
and some torture survivors have shown peripheral polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain
symptoms<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although these symptoms are
not necessarily considered a mental problem, they are sometimes not pain signals from
peripheral tissues and organs, but rather nerve system pain. Except for nociceptive pain,
neuropathic pain elements which are related to acute or chronic inflammation caused by
musculoskeletal lesions are taken into account when examining torture survivors<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physiotherapists have carried out continuous dialogue about torture experiences and pain
with clients who have experienced torture. The information that clients share is of use to
observe their pain patterns, and can be utilized in the treatment process<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the sequelae after torture, pain extending to the musculoskeletal system is related
to lack of sleep, fatigue, paresthesia, headache, and sensitive responses in the internal
organs and the urinary bladder. Chronic muscle pain can also be seen. The sequelae in the
musculoskeletal system caused by torture show similar clinical patterns to the symptoms of
common chronic muscle pain syndrome<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, complex manual therapy carried out for torture survivors, decreased PTSD
symptoms after the intervention according to the PDS-K score, and the KODI score for
disabilities also decreased. This indicates there was mitigation of lower back pain, leading
to complementary and positive effects on both constructive and functional elements of the
lower back. In the present study, complex manual therapy led to significantly lower PDS-K
scores in the experimental group than in the control group. This indicates that a variety of
manual therapies are effective, even in cases of post-traumatic stress disorder and
psychological factors. Although these results are those of a single case study, they suggest
areas for future study<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>VAS results after complex manual therapy were significantly lower in the experimental group
than in the control group. This indicates that complex manual therapy is effective at
reducing the low back pain of survivors of torture and is consistent with the previously
cited study<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Torture survivors believe
that manual therapy is more effective, together with physical therapy, to manage their back
pain. The KODI scores after complex manual therapy were significantly lower in the
experimental group than in the control group. The stabilization exercise for the body, using
a sling, after the MFR and MET techniques in complex manual therapy, improved the function
of the right lumbar region, and was found useful by participants. Finally, dynamic balance
ability improved after the intervention, indicating that the performance of complex manual
therapy for torture survivors as they age is an effective approach for preventing falls by
senior survivors of torture.</p><p>Traditional physical therapy performed in hospitals to treat the lower back pain of torture
survivors has spatial limitations. The complex schedule of back pain treatment performed for
torture survivors in this study appears to be useful for reducing chronic lower back pain
and improving function in long-term sequelae of torture. Currently, the average age of
torture survivors in Korea is gradually increasing. A fall prevention program administering
complex manual therapy offers a new physical therapy intervention for torture survivors.</p><p>This study was limited in that it is difficult to generalize partial research findings.
Therefore, it will be necessary to conduct research with greater numbers of participants
with various symptoms. This study did not distinguish between the individual effects of the
treatment techniques involved in the complex manual therapy. Also, the pain assessment had
limitations, because it which did not vary according to the characteristics of the sequelae
of torture survivors. The concept that torture survivors are chronic pain patients, combined
with existing knowledge of the treatment of chronic pain patients in general, further
underlines the need for the availability of such treatment. In the light of the global
extent of such problems there is also a need for the development of differentiated forms of
treatment, adaptable to differences in treatment traditions and the capacity of resources in
different countries.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rasmussen</surname><given-names>OV</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The involvement of medical doctors in torture: the state
