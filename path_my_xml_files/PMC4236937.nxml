While SA is being utilized for short laparoscopic procedures, the sympathectomy counteracts the increased SVR.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, with prolonged pneumoperitoneum time, patient's discomfort becomes the limiting factor.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Concomitant use of two anesthesia techniques for better hemodynamic variables is a widely accepted method.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] We decided to use this ubiquitous technique of combining SA with GA for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries.</p><p>Despite there being a plethora of articles on the combination of epidural and general anesthesia, only a few studies focus on combining SA with GA. Among these, few authors have studied combination of SA and GA for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Laparoscopic hysterectomy, unlike other laparoscopies, involves open/vaginal dissection as a part of completion of surgery. When SA is utilized, this vaginal dissection can be carried out with minimum anesthetic agents sufficient to prevent awareness. Motivated by this fact, the present study was designed to compare the combination of SA and GA with plain GA in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy, with the hypothesis that sympathectomy of SA overcomes the hemodynamic response of pneumoperitoneum.</p><p>The primary outcome of our study was to find the impact of SA on hemodynamic repercussions of pneumoperitoneum. The secondary outcomes to be studied were requirement of isoflurane, &#x003b2; blocker (metoprolol), and residual effects of SA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining approval from the institutional ethical committee, 60 subjects of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I/II, posted for laparoscopic hysterectomy were recruited for our study with a written and informed consent. The group size of 30 was determined by power analysis based on standard deviation data from a previous study report. Exclusion criteria were patients belonging to ASA physical status III/IV, those with contraindications to SA, and patient's refusal.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive SA with GA (group SGA) or plain GA (group GA) with the sealed envelope technique by a person other than the anesthesiologist involved in the study.</p><p>Inside the operation theater, baseline electrocardiogram, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and saturation were recorded. After securing an intravenous access, all patients were preloaded with lactated Ringer's solution 15 ml/kg. SA was given in sitting position with 26 G Quincke needle in L3-L4 interspace using 10 mg of heavy bupivacaine solution. Patients were immediately made supine and the table height was adjusted to reach a spinal level of T6. Onset of sensory anesthesia was checked with pin prick, and motor block assessment was carried out with modified Bromage scale. A waiting period of 20 min or time for maximal spinal action, whichever occurred earlier, was allowed to pass before GA induction. Any cases of failed SA were managed by giving GA and excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, midazolam 0.03 mg/kg, and fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg intravenously. All patients received ondansetron to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Anesthesia was induced with 2.5% thiopentone in a dose sufficient to abolish eyelash reflex. Vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was given to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture (50:50), isoflurane, and vecuronium. Isoflurane was used in lowest possible concentration necessary to keep MAP and HR within 20% of baseline and at the same time maintaining bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60. Isoflurane requirement was quantified in each patient by measuring inspiratory concentration. The average total inspiratory concentration of isoflurane was calculated by the sum of products of inspiratory concentration and times divided by total anesthesia time. Isoflurane was adjusted in steps of 0.2% when needed to keep the hemodynamic parameters to acceptable values. When inspiratory concentration exceeded 1%, Inj. Metoprolol 0.1 mg/kg was given in titrated doses to maintain MAP. Total dose of metoprolol was also recorded. Alpha-2 agonists were avoided due to their additional sedative properties. Monitoring was carried out by the attending anesthesiologist blinded to the technique.</p><p>Carbon dioxide gas was used for pneumoperitoneum and the pressure was kept between 12 and 15 mm of Hg for all patients. Time of creation of pneumoperitoneum was documented.</p><p>At the end of the procedure, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 80 mcg/kg intravenously. Patients were extubated when they regained spontaneous respiration and obeyed simple verbal commands. Inj. diclofenac 75 mg was added to last IV fluid for postoperative analgesia (postoperative requirement of analgesics was not taken into consideration in our study). Patients were observed for regression of SA in the postoperative room for the next 2 h, whichever occurred earlier.</p><p>The following parameters were studied in addition to basic monitoring:</p><p>

The combination of these two techniques provided better cardiocirculatory stability than GA alone in laparoscopic hysterectomy.</p><p>Pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery leads to significant hemodynamic repercussions such as an increase in SVR and MAP,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] often necessitating therapeutic intervention.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Various pharmacological agents like &#x003b2; blockers, nitroglycerine, and &#x003b1;2 agonists are used to provide hemodynamic stability, but they have their own disadvantages.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Techniques like gasless laparoscopy[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and reduction in intra-abdominal pressure during pneumoperitoneum have been tried to counteract the detrimental effects of pneumoperitoneum.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Combining two anesthesia techniques to add their advantages and limit the side effects of each is not new. Luchetti <italic>et al</italic>. studied the combination of epidural and general anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and inferred the combination to be safe and effective.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Metabolic response is shown to be reduced by regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In relation to combining SA and GA, comparison has been made, with positive results obtained in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Encouraged by this, we conducted a prospective, randomized study to examine whether combining SA and GA improved hemodynamic stability in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy.</p><p>SA alone is being successfully utilized for short or day care laparoscopic procedures.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] For major laparoscopic surgeries, however, conventional GA is still the technique of choice.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] But under GA, the hemodynamic derangements during pneumoperitoneum have to be managed by either increasing the anesthetic concentration or by administering vasodilators.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The former leads to unnecessary deepening of anesthesia and the latter may cause awareness.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] When SA is used in conjunction with GA, the sympathectomy resulting from SA may limit the rise in SVR, thus overcoming the increased MAP. This finding was confirmed in our study where the MAP in group SGA was well maintained during pneumoperitoneum, as against in group GA. Our results are consistent with those of previous study conducted in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>It can be elucidated from our study that the requirement of isoflurane was markedly reduced in group SGA as compared to group GA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). This finding is in concordance with a study conducted by Simon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In our study, we found that only minimum concentration of isoflurane was required for maintenance of anesthesia. An appraisal has to be made of the finding that the isoflurane requirement decreased tremendously during vaginal dissection in group SGA, emphasizing the impact of sensory anesthesia. It was only with the aid of BIS monitoring that it was possible to closely titrate isoflurane while maintaining adequate depth of anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This finding may also imply a reduction in the cost of anesthesia, but assessing that was not the objective of present study.</p><p>The lower use of isoflurane resulted in early awakening and extubation in group SGA as compared to group GA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). This finding is supported by a study conducted by Lerou and Booij.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The unopposed parasympathetic outflow following SA causes increased bowel contractility, ultimately resulting in better operative field.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] It also decreases the requirement of steep head low, often demanded for laparoscopic hysterectomy. This inference is based on NRS obtained from surgeons.</p><p>An interesting finding of our study is the incidence of PONV which is also a major drawback in laparoscopic surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Five patients in group GA had PONV. On the other hand, none of the patients in group SGA suffered from PONV. This probably has to be attributed to the anesthetic concentrations, since by using less halogenated agents, consciousness level is recovered more quickly and secondary effects such as PONV diminish.</p><p>All patients were observed for 2 h in postoperative recovery for monitoring regression of SA. It is noteworthy that all patients had regression of SA in less than 1 h in recovery, implicating no residual effects of SA.</p><p>The contributions of our study are comparison of two anesthesia techniques, which, to the horizons of our knowledge, has not been studied or reported for laparoscopic hysterectomy, the appropriate utilization of anesthetic agents, evaluation of hemodynamic parameters, and studying recovery and complications. The only limitation of our study was the small number of patients studied undergoing only one kind of laparoscopic procedure. Moreover, only ASA physical status I/II patients were included in the present study, but the utility cannot be denied in high-risk, hypertensive, or obese patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To conclude, the hemodynamic repercussions during pneumoperitoneum can be effectively attenuated by combining SA with GA without any adverse effects. We recommend this conjunction of two anesthesia techniques in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fisburne</surname><given-names>JI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anesthesia for laparoscopy: Considerations, complications and techniques</article-title><source>J Reprod Med</source><year>1978</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>37</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">151142</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chui</surname><given-names>PT</given-names></name><name><surname>Gin</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>TE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anesthesia for laparoscopic general surgery</article-title><source>Anaesth Intensive Care</source><year>1993</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>163</fpage><lpage>71</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8517506</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jean</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery</article-title><source>Anesthesia</source><year>2010</year><edition>7th ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Churchill Livingstone</publisher-name><fpage>2185</fpage><lpage>202</lpage><comment>Sinha R, Gurwara AK, Gupta SC.
