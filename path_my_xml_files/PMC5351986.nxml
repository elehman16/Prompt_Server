Ultrasound, X-ray fluoroscopy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) are used to perform image guidance during interventions. Owing to fast volume acquisition, high resolution, good availability and low cost, CT guidance is a versatile approach for image-guided procedures.</p><p>The accuracy of needle placement is a critical step for the success of CT image-guided percutaneous interventions. Inaccurate needle placement can lead to loss of time, unwarranted X-ray exposure, adverse events, or failures such as non-diagnostic biopsy samples or incomplete treatment. Although CT guidance is very efficient for needle placement, some cases prove to be difficult; in particular, when an out-of-plane trajectory is required to achieve the anatomically safest route. The conventional workflow for freehand needle placement with CT guidance is detailed in [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; this article also highlights how the result of the intervention can be highly dependent on its complexity and on individual physician skill.</p><p>In order to improve accuracy and limit X-ray exposure in CT-guided interventions, a range of CT navigation systems have been developed [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some systems have been clinically tested by comparative [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] or randomized studies [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These navigation systems include a locator (optical or electromagnetic) which tracks in real-time the position of the needle.</p><p>In this paper, we present the results of a randomized clinical trial evaluating the IMACTIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CT electromagnetic navigation system prototype (Imactis SAS, La Tronche, France). This system allows the interventional radiologist to explore the patient&#x02019;s anatomy in any plane, and visualize the planned needle trajectory before it&#x02019;s insertion in real-time [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The results of a phantom study on out-of-plane punctures with this navigation system have shown a gain in time and accuracy compared to a standard CT-guided intervention [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this clinical trial was to assess the accuracy and usability of this electromagnetic CT navigation system in a standard clinical setting, by comparing conventional and navigated procedures in a full range of routine CT interventions on the chest, abdomen, pelvis and bones, including biopsy, drainage, tumor ablation, sympathicolysis and joint infiltration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Trial design and participants</title><p>This open comparative randomized controlled prospective trial was approved by the ethics committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes, Sud-Est V, France) and was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00828893&#x02014;CTNAV).</p><p>The inclusion criteria were an indication for a percutaneous CT intervention without contraindications in adult patients with the ability to understand and sign the informed consent. Patients were included for whom the planned intervention was intended to be carried out using CT guidance exclusively, according to standard local practice and operator preference. Patients for whom the interventional radiologist had intended to use an additional imaging modality, such as ultrasound guidance, were not included in this study. Other exclusion criteria were patients with any implanted stimulation device, pregnant or breast-feeding women, unavailability of the navigation system or unavailability of a senior investigator.</p><p>From June 2010 to January 2012, 120 patients were included in the radiology and medical imaging department of Grenoble university hospital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173751.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0173751.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0173751.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Patient flow.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0173751.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Interventions</title><p>Operators were either senior interventional radiologists from our hospital with more than 5 years of practice, or resident under the direct supervision of a senior investigator. Operators were first trained to use the navigation system by carrying out two interventions on a phantom model.</p><p>All procedures were performed using a Brilliance 64 (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands) or Sensation 16 (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) CT scanner. For the conventional CT intervention, the needle entry point was located using the CT gantry laser and a grid or a metallic wire placed on the patient&#x02019;s skin.</p><p>For navigated interventions, we used the IMACTIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CT navigation system prototype. The IMACTIS system was composed of a station with a touch screen and a proprietary electromagnetic locator. This locator is composed of a magnetic receiver, located inside a needle holder, and a magnetic transmitter, designed to be fixed to the patient&#x02019;s skin and detected in CT images, allowing an automatic registration between magnetic and CT coordinates. Once a CT-scan series (slice spacing of 2 mm maximum) had been transferred to the Navigation system, registration was performed without the need for any human interaction. Total DICOM series transfer and registration time was less than 20 seconds.</p><p>The position and orientation of the needle holder and the needle path were then displayed in real-time on two 2D reconstructed CT images extracted from the 3D CT volume. The two 2D images were computed such that the needle path was always displayed in the images; the system automatically chose the 2 perpendicular para-axial, sagittal or coronal oblique planes that optimize the visualization of the needle path. The needle holder was not tool specific and was suitable for any commercially available tool ranging from 25 to 11 gauge (needles, coaxial biopsy needles and guns, ablation devices, drainage kits).

This maximum distance error is computed along the entire real needle path, as if no iterative needle trajectory adjustments were made after the initial needle placement and as if the needle was pushed straight ahead up to the target depth.

Assuming the number of inclusions lost to be 5%, the number of patients to be included was determined to be 59 per group, approximately 120 in total.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Randomization and procedure</title><p>A senior investigator assessed patient eligibility, informed the patient about the study and obtained his written consent for inclusion. A senior investigator and the operator (if not the same person) discussed and rated by consensus agreement the expected technical difficulty of the intervention as &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;difficult&#x0201d; based on the referral letter and review of previous imaging records available, in order to establish the proximity of sensitive anatomical structures such as vessels, at-risk non-target organs, etc.</p><p>Randomization was performed using a website, developed by a specialist society (FDA 21 CFR part 11). This platform was available 24h/24 for investigators. We considered the expected technical difficulty of the intervention to be a prognostic factor of the success of the gesture. The randomization was therefore stratified according to the two levels of predicted difficulty, to ensure comparability for the subgroup statistical analysis. Computer-generated stratified randomization lists were generated using a block factor of two (6%) and four (94%). These random block sizes were chosen to be small, in order to prevent group imbalance in the case of an early interruption of the study. The investigators were evidently blinded to the block size selected for the randomization process.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Continuous variables were expressed as medians [P25%, P75%] and compared using a Mann &#x00026; Whitney non-parametric test. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test or the Fisher exact test when necessary. Data were analyzed according to both the worst case scenario intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) principles. The robustness of significant factors from univariate analysis was confirmed by ANOVA analysis taking into account predefined confounding factors: stratification (easy/difficult intervention), operator experience (resident/senior), number of interventions made by the operator (frequent/occasional, if more/less than 15 interventions were carried out by the radiologist during the study), type of intervention (biopsy, drainage, etc.), patient&#x02019;s position on the CT table, and presence of patient movement reported during the procedure. A Bartlett&#x02019;s test, Levene&#x02019;s test or data log transformation was carried out to confirm the data homoscedasticity for multivariate analysis. All p values were two sided. For the main outcome, multiple comparisons were made (distance/angle, ITT/per protocol, uni/multivariate). Following the Bonferroni correction method to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons, the statistical significance level was set at 0.00625 (0.05/8). For the secondary endpoints, it was set at 0.05.</p><p>Three subgroup analyses were performed according to the type of intervention (easy/difficult), the experience of the operator (senior/resident) and the number of interventions made by the operator (frequent /occasional). Analyses was performed using GNU R software (2.15.0).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Patient flow</title><p>We enrolled 120 patients between December 2009 and January 2012 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173751.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

The gain was consistent irrespective of whether the operator was a resident or a senior, whether the operator performed few (&#x02264;15) or many (&#x0003e;15) interventions, and whether the procedure was anticipated as being easy or difficult. In the CT group, the accuracy was significantly lower, and worsened when interventions were difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173751.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

Operators in the NAV group felt they had greater accuracy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0173751.t005">Table 5</xref>) and thus progressed more quickly and more safely to the target, reducing the number of intermediary control acquisitions. Moreover, since navigated interventions were indeed more accurate, fewer corrections of erroneous trajectories were required, compared to conventional CT. When interventions were difficult, there was a significantly higher risk in the CT group that a large number of control acquisitions would be required. The variance inhomogeneity analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0173751.t004">Table 4</xref> supports this point.</p><p>In accordance with fewer control acquisitions in the NAV group, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0173751.t004">Table 4</xref> shows that the X-ray dose delivered by the controls acquired during the progression to target was smaller using NAV (225 [133; 377] mGy.cm) than using CT (297 [173; 449] mGy.cm). However, this difference did not reach the level of statistical significance (p = 0.076). In our center, globally, few CT controls were made by the operators (mean value of 3 controls in the non-navigated group; vs. 10.3 controls for example in reference [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><underline>])</underline>, this could have rendered more subtle the irradiation difference between the CT and NAV groups. A multicentric study would therefore be interesting to further explore the positive impact of navigation on irradiation.

Navigated procedure results were not statistically different to standard CT procedure results for fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, number of needle repositions, incidence of pneumothorax, need for chest tube, or diagnostic yield. Among the 26 patients randomized for navigation, 8 navigated procedures (31%) failed because of technical failure or incoherent localization data, suggesting that the particular electromagnetic navigation system tested in this study might not have been ready for routine clinical use.</p><p>Finally, navigation systems offering the possibility to fuse several imaging modalities have been developed [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173751.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These systems can fuse pre-operative images (for instance, CT imaging) with real-time intra-operative images (such as ultrasound). The registration between pre-operative images and the navigation system is often based on interactively designated anatomical landmarks, or fiducials placed on the patient that are localized with a mouse click on pre-operative images and palpated magnetically; this step can be tedious and may lack ergonomics and reproducibility.</p><p>In [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a navigation system capable of fusing US and CT images has been evaluated in the particular context of liver biopsies under exclusive CT guidance. This randomized 50 patient trial showed an improvement when using the navigation system concerning the radiation dose and operation time; no information was given concerning accuracy. This study involved a single experienced investigator who had practiced on 20 phantoms and had used the system for 6 months before including patients in the study.</p><p>As detailed above and in [<xref rid="pone.0173751.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], there now exists a wide variety of developed systems; yet few have reached commercial availability, and none so far have been integrated into routine clinical practice. This may be explained by the associated cost, the complexity of using the system, the lack of reliability or insufficient added medical value.</p><p>The navigation system tested in this study presents some favorable factors for its integration into routine clinical practice:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Needle holder tracking is less expensive than needle tip tracking.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This navigation system has been developed specifically to assist CT-guided interventions, allowing a dedicated automatized workflow that limits the system usage complexity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of this navigation system in clinical conditions, even for occasional and non-expert operators.</p></list-item></list><p>However, only a larger multicentric study and future clinical routine observations will be able to predict the real potential of this navigation system. One such study has already been designed and started [NCT01896219].</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>This prospective randomized clinical trial demonstrated an improvement in accuracy when using the tested navigation system. This system proved to be reliable when evaluated in a routine clinical setting, by operators having diverse experience and no extensive training on the system, and for a large variety of types of interventions. Nevertheless, there are limitations to this study:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It was not a multicenter trial. However, the large number of operators allowed a broad evaluation of the system. As the navigation system was not evaluated by a small number of highly trained expert radiologists, we can expect that the results of this study are more easily transposable to a general population of non-specialized radiologists.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Operator experience could have been used as a stratification variable in order to have a better guaranty regarding the comparability for this criterion. Nevertheless, owing to randomization, the distribution of senior operators proved to be comparable in both groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Inclusions were neither systematic nor consecutive. Our cohort does not represent a random sample of our overall patient referral population. Inclusions mainly relied on the availability of a senior investigator.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In order to avoid bias during this clinical study, the randomization was implemented after the inclusion of each patient, and clinicians were blinded to the details of the randomization process. However, it was not possible to conduct a double-blind study, as is often the case with clinical trials of medical devices. However, in both the CT and NAV groups, the main outcome was calculated automatically and identically, once the entry and end points of the planned and achieved needle trajectories had been registered in the study database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173751.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Furthermore, the validity of the registered coordinates of the needle tip and entry point, from which the main outcome is computed, has been checked by an independent observer, blinded to the CT or NAV group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The estimated duration of interventions may not necessarily represent those of routine interventions, because of use of the system by novice users, and because of data collection and the constraints imposed by the strict adherence to the trial protocol. Therefore, future trials might provide better estimations for procedure duration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The navigation system evaluated in this study was designed for the assistance of specific interventions performed exclusively with CT guidance, and it has no multimodality capability. Thus, this study cannot evaluate the interest of a fusion between CT and other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The navigation system evaluated in this study was designed to track a needle holder, and not to track the needle tip. Consequently, this system has no capability to compensate for needle bending during the intervention. This study demonstrates however that needle holder tracking provides a reliable localization and improves accuracy. Further studies comparing with needle tip tracking technology would be interesting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No respiratory motion tracking was provided for this navigation system; a breath-hold approach was therefore required for certain procedures. New technical developments would be useful to take into account possible respiratory motion, and possibly further increase the accuracy of the navigation system.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, though numerous navigation systems have been developed, few clinical studies have been conducted according to a robust methodology that are able to demonstrate an advantage in the use of these systems. Findings from this prospective randomized controlled trial suggest that the tested navigation system improves the accuracy of CT-guided interventions, particularly when they are difficult to perform. A specific interest of this trial is that the tested system has been evaluated in a routine clinical setting by operators having diverse experience and no extensive training on the system, and for a large variety of types of interventions. This is particularly valuable in the context of the increasing number of indications for CT-guided interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0173751.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Clinical protocol in English.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0173751.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0173751.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Clinical protocol in French.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0173751.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0173751.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Consort 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0173751.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Cecilia Hughes for her careful proofreading of the manuscript and the external reviewers whose contributions enabled the manuscript to be improved.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0173751.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Arnolli</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hanumara</surname><given-names>NC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Broeders</surname><given-names>IAMJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>An overview of systems for CT- and MRI-guided percutaneous needle placement in the thorax and abdomen</article-title>. <source>Int J Med Robotics Comput Assist Surg</source>. <year>2015</year>
