It has been reported that the prevalence of propofol injection pain among patients is between 28% and 90% in adults and between 28% and 85% in children.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] One study found that there was no gender difference in the prevalence of vascular pain associated with propofol administration.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The factors that influence propofol pain include vascular size, infusion rate, propofol concentration, chemical structure, and the temperature of propofol preparation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The postinjection pain can be immediate or delayed. Immediate pain occurs due to the direct irritant effect. Klement and Arndt postulated that vascular pain is evoked via a direct effect by osmolality and pH, however, propofol is isotonic and has a pH between 6 and 8.5.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It has been shown that pain after intravenous injection of propofol was related to its free aqueous concentration.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Also, delayed injection pain (10&#x02013;20 s later) is due to the plasma kallikrein-kinin system and vascular effect of bradykinin by contact with propofol.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>There are different methods to decrease propofol injection pain, such as mixing it with lidocaine,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] pretreatment with lidocaine,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] although the most effective way is large and antecubital veins.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the triglyceride-associated lipid type, and that of lidocaine on the incidence and intensity of immediate and delayed pain experienced following propofol infusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomized and double-blinded clinical trial, which enrolled 150 American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II patients, was conducted after receiving approval from the Mashhad University of Vice Chancellor for Research and local Ethics Committee No. 900184 on 2012/2/2. Patients who provided informed consent for their participation and who did not have any contraindication for propofol infusion were equally and randomly divided into three groups with random number generator and numbered envelops. Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, patients with epilepsy and conduction disorders, patients on anti-arrhythmic drugs, those with lipid metabolism disorders, patients with a history of allergy to eggs, propofol, or lidocaine, as well as those who had taken sedative drugs during the 24 h preceding the study, were excluded. Prior to the study, the quality of pain evaluation and verbal analog scoring was explained to the patients. Before inducing anesthesia, the patients did not receive any topical anesthetics or tranquilizers. A 20 gauge catheter was placed in the largest vein on the back of the hand and 150 mL of saline was infused. Following this, the patients were monitored for vital signs. For each patient, two syringes were prepared, 5 ml syringe was filled with distilled water or lidocaine and 20 ml syringe was filled with long-chain triglycerides (LCT) or medium chain triglycerides-LCT (MCT-LCT) propofol (LCT-propofol was from Claris Company and MCT-LCT propofol was from Fresenius Kabi Company). The patients and anesthesia nurse who evaluated the vascular pain were blind to the study groups. In the first group, distilled water and propofol mixed with MCT/LCT was administered. In the second group, distilled water and propofol mixed with LCT was administered. The third group received 1 mL (20 mg) of lidocaine, followed by a preparation of propofol containing LCT (lidocaine + propofol-LCT) (prepared by Claris). The rate of propofol infusion was 10 mg/s in all patients. The propofol solution was equilibrated to room temperature before administration.</p><p>The incidence and the intensity of pain were assessed by means of verbal analog scoring (1&#x02013;10) based on the answers to questions asked to the patients at two stages, the start of the injection, and 20 s after the propofol injection. After the pain evaluation and the induction of anesthesia, fentanyl and atracurium were administered, and the patients were intubated after 2&#x02013;3 min.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical studies and analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated based on our previous study[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in three groups with SigmaPlot software version 12.5, 2015 (Systat Software Inc. San Jose, USA). Considering incidence of 55% for propofol-LCT vascular pain, meaningful reduction of pain for 20%, first type error of 0.05 (&#x003b1; = 0.05), confidence coefficient of 80% (&#x003b2; = 0.2), and sample size of 144 people, were found and 150 people were selected for facilitating the study.</p><p>The data were analyzed with SPSS software (version 16, Chicago, SPSS Inc). The analysis of variance, post-hoc Tukey, Chi-square, and the Fischer's exact test were used for the comparison of the parametric data such as age, weight, and vascular pain intensity. For the analysis of nonparametric data, the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was adopted such as sex and injection pain incidence. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic parameters, including the age, gender, and weight, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

The incidence of pain was lowest in the lidocaine group (18%) and highest in LCT group (44%). The immediate pain intensity in propofol-LCT and propofol-MCT/LCT groups was higher than that in lidocaine + propofol-LCT group. In contrast, the delayed pain intensity in propofol-MCT/LCT group was lesser than that in lidocaine + propofol-LCT and propofol-LCT groups. To date, various methods have been used for controlling the pain experienced during propofol infusion. However, it appears that the most effective method is the administration of lidocaine prior to propofol with or without tourniquet.</p><p>Change in lipid composition of propofol decreases the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In some previous studies, the pretreatment lidocaine reduced propofol-MCT/LCT injection pain,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but in other studies, differences were not significant.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In our study, the propofol-MCT/LCT decreased delayed injection pain, but not on immediate vascular pain versus propofol-LCT.</p><p>In a study, lidocaine reduced the intensity of propofol injection pain with three different doses.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Parmar and Koay compared the incidence of pain following the administration of cold propofol, two different doses of lidocaine (0.1 and 0.2 mg), and normal saline, and showed that the administration of cold propofol was associated with high prevalence of pain, which could be reduced by the administration of lidocaine before propofol.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The studies have revealed a potential of inhibition generation of bradykinin by pretreatment lidocaine.</p><p>Propofol induces immediate pain through topical stimulation and induces delayed pain by activation of the kallikrein cascade.
