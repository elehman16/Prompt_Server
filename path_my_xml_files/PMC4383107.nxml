But it has the drawback of short duration of action and lack of postoperative analgesia. Larger dose of analgesic is required to provide pain relief with high incidence of side effects when local anesthetic is used alone for SA.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Neuraxial opioids though effective have worrisome respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, and pruritus that limit their use in the ward.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Recent research has focused on nonopioid spinal receptors that inhibit transmission of pain signals. Increased understanding of spinal processing of pain has led to the development of specific drugs that inhibit pain transmission. Intrathecal neostigmine and magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) both produce substantial antinociception without neurotoxicity, potentiate analgesia of bupivacaine and opioids as evident from animal and human studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Since their primary site of action is the spinal cord, direct intrathecal injection is preferable to obtain meaningful and clinically effective analgesia. The safety profile of this route has been evaluated in several experimental settings.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Thus, intrathecal neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> in smaller doses might become useful adjunct analgesics to spinal bupivacaine anesthesia. Furthermore, the ability of intrathecal neostigmine to protect against SA-induced hypotension and to increase gastrointestinal motility in the absence of respiratory depression are positive features that stimulated us to undertake this study.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no trials in the available literature comparing intrathecal neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> on characteristics of SA, hemodynamic stability, and postoperative analgesia. With this background in mind, we designed this randomized, double-blind, prospective clinical study to test the hypothesis &#x0201c;intrathecal neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> when added to hyperbaric bupivacaine for SA, will improve hemodynamic stability and reduce postoperative pain and consumption of analgesic after lower abdominal surgery when compared to saline control.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of smaller doses of neostigmine (25 &#x003bc;g) and MgSO<sub>4</sub> (50 mg) on characteristics of SA, hemodynamic stability, and postoperative analgesia when added to hyperbaric bupivacaine for SA. It is a randomized, double-blind, prospective, parallel group clinical trial conducted at Department of Anaesthesiology, Shri Bhausaheb Hire Government Medical College, Dhule during October 2011 to March 2013. The study was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee and registered in the public database (CTRI/2011/08/001948).

The patient's clinical history, vital data, and investigations were recorded in the case sheet. Use of the pain scale was explained. They were randomly assigned to one of the three groups of 25 each using computer generated randomization list using GraphPad QuickCalcs (GraphPad Software, Inc., 7825 Fay Avenue, Suite 230 La Jolla, CA 92037 USA). The assignment was sealed in opaque envelops along with code of the group and opened just before entry into the study.</p><p>All patients received tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg orally night before surgery. They were kept fasting for 8 h for solid food. On arrival in the operating room, standard monitoring was established. Intravenous (IV) line was started with 18-gauge canulla followed by preloading with 10 ml/kg lactated ringers solution and maintenance infusion 6&#x02013;10 ml/kg/h. IV ondansetron 4 mg and ranitidine 50 mg was given as antiemetic prophylaxis. SA was carried out in the lateral position at lumbar 3&#x02013;4 interspace using 23-gauge disposable spinal needle. After clear and free flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), one of the study solutions was administered intrathecally depending upon the group. The control group (Group C) received mixture of hyperbaric bupivacaine 17.5 mg and 0.5 ml normal saline. Neostigmine group (Group N) received hyperbaric bupivacaine 17.5 mg and 25 &#x003bc;g neostigmine methyl sulfate (Myostigmin 0.5 mg/ml-Neon Laboratories Ltd.) made 0.5 ml with normal saline. Magnesium group (Group M) received hyperbaric bupivacaine 17.5 mg and 50 mg MgSO<sub>4</sub> (Magneon 50% w/v, Neon Laboratories Ltd.) made 0.5 ml with normal saline. All the study drugs were preservative free and total volume of drug injected was 4 ml. The study drug was prepared by anesthesiologist not involved in outcome measurement. The patient, anesthesiologist who performed the spinal block, and the observer collecting data about study parameters were blinded to group allocation. Time of intrathecal injection was noted and patient repositioned supine. The head end of the operating table was elevated by 10&#x02013;20&#x000b0; while injecting drug. Supplementary oxygen via facemask was given at 3 L/min throughout the surgical procedure. Vital parameters heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded using automated blood pressure (BP) cuff (EMCO 4920MPM, serial N0.0612218, EMCO Meditek Pvt. Ltd.) every 5 min for 30 min, then every 10 min till end of surgery. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored. No additional analgesic was given unless requested by the patient. Intraoperative sedation was provided with IV midazolam 1mg when required. Vomiting in absence of hypotension was treated with IV metoclopramide 10 mg or propofol 20 mg bolus. Patients in whom sensory block was inadequate and those requiring general anesthesia (GA) supplement were excluded from the study.</p><p>A dermatomal sensory level up to eighth thoracic segment (T8) was considered satisfactory.

In this prospective randomized controlled trial, evidence was provided that patients who received intrathecal neostigmine 25 &#x003bc;g or MgSO<sub>4</sub> 50 mg with spinal bupivacaine had reduced postoperative pain score and analgesic requirement after major gynecological surgery. Though our main aim was to compare neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> we thought it worthwhile to add placebo group for some additional inference so that we could compare each drug with placebo as well. The parameters of SA itself may be affected by adjuvant used with local anesthetics. In our study, sensory block was slightly prolonged with neostigmine and motor block with MgSO<sub>4</sub> but it was not statistically significant.

The time to first analgesic demand was longest with neostigmine (5.1 h) followed by MgSO<sub>4</sub> (4.2 h) and saline control (3.8 h). Diclofenac sodium was first analgesic given on demand. Further doses were given at fixed interval after first dose. Diclofenac requirement was slightly less with neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub>, but it was not statistically significant. Only 40% subjects in the neostigmine group required additional analgesia with tramadol after first dose of analgesic compared to 64% in MgSO<sub>4</sub> group and 92% in the saline group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Furthermore, the total dose of tramadol was significantly less with intrathecal neostigmine. The cumulative analgesic requirement was indicated by the total number of analgesic doses required during first 24 h after surgery. It was lowest in the neostigmine group than MgSO<sub>4</sub> and control groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.00232). The analgesic consumption was not significantly reduced with MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Though lower abdominal surgery is a highly painful procedure, we did not use strong opioid as the first analgesic because neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> both are reported to produce central sedation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Furthermore, mild sedation was observed in our pilot study. To prevent excessive sedation, a milder form of analgesic was chosen.

It can be compared with visual rating scales.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The pain score in the recovery room was reduced to a significant degree by neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> both.

Pain itself activates a pain inhibitory system at the level of spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] This effect is due to spinal-supraspinal-spinal loop and descending inhibitory system.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>. recently hypothesized that spinally released norepinephrine from this pathway activates intrinsic spinal cholinergic neurons to cause acetylcholine release which produces analgesia.

Painful stimulus releases glutamate and aspartate neurotransmitters which bind to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Activation of these receptors leads to calcium entry into the cell that initiates a series of central sensitization such as wind-up and long-term potentiation in the spinal cord. This NMDA signaling is important in determining the duration and intensity of postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Magnesium blocks the calcium influx into the cell, that is, natural physiological calcium antagonism and noncompetitively antagonizes the NMDA receptors.

Fewer episodes of hypotension and vasopressor requirement with neostigmine represent its protective effect against SA-induced hypotension. Previous studies have reported that neostigmine &#x0003c;100 &#x003bc;g does not counteract hypotension of SA in gynecological surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The incidence of bradycardia and atropine requirement was reduced significantly by MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Such protective effect from bradycardia was not observed with neostigmine which exhibited a similar degree of bradycardia like that of the control group. Thus, intrathecal neostigmine in given dose provides some protection against SA-induced hypotension whereas MgSO<sub>4</sub> protects against bradycardia of SA. The exact mechanism responsible for this effect of MgSO<sub>4</sub> is not clear.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting due to neostigmine is dose-dependent, the smaller dose can produce analgesia without nausea.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Klamt <italic>et al</italic>. ascribed the vomiting to the effect of neostigmine on brain.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The rostral spread to brainstem may contribute to the severity of adverse effects (bradycardia, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, motor weakness, etc.). The side effects occur 30&#x02013;60 min after injection. To minimize the cephalad spread, injection of neostigmine in hyperbaric solution and maintaining head up position is recommended.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The hyperbaric solution produced analgesia limited to lower limbs without producing nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Similarly, in our study, the risk of nausea and vomiting could be minimized using neostigmine with hyperbaric bupivacaine and maintaining head up position. The increased vomiting and antiemetic use in the control group could be because of more tramadol consumption. Solution of MgSO<sub>4</sub> itself is hyperbaric compared to CSF limiting its cephalad spread. Isotonic saline was used for dilution of study drugs as it does not alter the pH and osmolality of drug and CSF, the volume administered intrathecally was held constant in all the groups.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Propofol is effective in controlling neostigmine-induced emesis.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Mild to moderate sedation was reported in previous human studies with 50 mg intrathecal MgSO<sub>4</sub> but there was no significant difference in sedation score or somnolence score in those studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Central cholinergic stimulation can result in sedation in the neostigmine group.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In the present study mild sedation was observed in 56% subjects with MgSO<sub>4</sub>, the patients were sleeping comfortably. The incidence was similar to that reported previously.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Only 20% patients in neostigmine reveal sedation. No patient was sedated in the recovery room. We did not observe any other central cholinergic effects of neostigmine like hallucination, agitation, mydriasis, nystagmus, pruritus, increased sweating or salivation. There was no evidence of bradycardia from systemic absorption of neostigmine. Urinary retention could not be evaluated as all the patients were catheterized. The incidence of other adverse effects did not differ among the three groups. Significant adverse effects were not observed during the intraoperative period like desaturation, respiratory depression, shivering, etc., No significant neurological complains, or adverse physical finding was noted at 7 days follow-up visit. Though our study is not adequately powered to comment upon neurotoxicity clinical trials performed to date have not reported any evidence of neurological complications following intrathecal neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>To summarize, analgesia of neostigmine is found to be dose independent, hence low dose is sufficient for effective postoperative analgesia. The intrathecal neostigmine requirement is much smaller in postoperative patients than that required in volunteers. This smaller dose of neostigmine is also effective in reducing hypotension of SA. The addition of MgSO<sub>4</sub> to SA reduces postoperative pain score but did not reduce analgesic consumption in first 24 h compared to neostigmine. Combination of low-dose intrathecal alpha-2 adrenergic agonist or systemic opioids may result in better analgesia with fewer side effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] We did not asses the incidence and severity of chronic pain after gynecological surgery which might have further revealed the action MgSO<sub>4</sub> in pain modulation and inhibition of central sensitization. Our findings reinforce the role of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an effective spinal adjuvant. One of the limitations of our study is we did not evaluate the dose-response. More controlled studies are required to define benefits and outcomes with different dose of neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> and comparison with established analgesic drugs will clearly establish their role in postoperative pain management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Intrathecal administration of neostigmine 25 &#x003bc;g and MgSO<sub>4</sub> 50 mg as adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine for SA does not affect characteristics of block. The postoperative analgesia of 25 &#x003bc;g neostigmine during early recovery was better than 50 mg MgSO<sub>4</sub> and saline control with less consumption of rescue analgesic in first 24 h. MgSO<sub>4</sub> reduces postoperative pain score to a significant degree up to 12 h after surgery. Neostigmine provides some protection against SA-induced hypotension whereas MgSO<sub>4</sub> protects against bradycardia of SA. Intrathecal neostigmine and MgSO<sub>4</sub> can provide a low cost simple change in anesthesia practice leading to significant decrease in postoperative pain and analgesic need.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the Medical Research Council of Maharashtra for funding this project.
