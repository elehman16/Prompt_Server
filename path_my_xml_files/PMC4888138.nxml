<bold>Objective: </bold>Standards of care and treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) vary. Non-drug &#x0200e;psychosocial intervention therapy is recommended for women with any kind of &#x0200e;discomfort or distress caused by PMS. The current study examined the effectiveness of &#x0200e;group cognitive-behavioral therapy on the symptoms of PMS at a girls&#x02019; dormitory of &#x0200e;North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>
<bold>Method:</bold> In this quasi-experimental study, 32 female students with PMS who were majoring in &#x0200e;nursing and midwifery and residing in the dormitory were selected using the &#x0200e;convenience sampling method and were assigned to experimental and control groups. &#x0200e;The Standardized Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool was used as the research &#x0200e;tool. Eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral group therapy were held for the students</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> There was a significant difference in psychological symptoms before and after &#x0200e;cognitive-behavioral therapy (p=0.012). Furthermore, cognitive-behavioral therapy was &#x0200e;effective on social interferences caused by PMS symptoms (p=0.012).&#x0200e;</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion</bold>: Group cognitive-behavioral therapy effectively alleviates PMS symptoms in female &#x0200e;college students.&#x0200e;</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</kwd><kwd>Group Therapy</kwd><kwd>Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) &#x0200e;</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a universal phrase present in all cultures and has &#x0200e;been the subject of attention for many biomedical researchers (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). PMS is a disorder that &#x0200e;affects the lives of millions of women from menarche to menopause (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This syndrome &#x0200e;consists of a wide range of physical, psychological, and behavioral symptoms that do &#x0200e;not result in any organic disease, occur regularly during the luteal phase of each &#x0200e;menstrual cycle, and resolve as menstruation ends. The severity and chronic nature of &#x0200e;PMS has led to the prevalence of this disorder in women and disrupts their work, &#x0200e;family relationships, and daily activities (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Over 90% of women experience PMS in &#x0200e;their reproductive years. In addition, 10% experience premenstrual dysphoric disorder &#x0200e;&#x0200e; (PMDD), a severe form of PMS. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) In the United States, 28 million women suffer &#x0200e;from PMS, and 6 million are affected by PMDD (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Ramezani Tehrani (2013) studied &#x0200e;&#x0200e;18- to 45-year-old women in Iran between the years 2009 and 2011 and reported the &#x0200e;prevalence of PMS as 52.9%, of which 34.5% suffered from its severe form (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Women &#x0200e;experience more than five hundred menstrual cycles during their reproductive years.&#x0200e;&#x0200f; &#x0200f;These cycles have various symptoms, including depression; changes in mood, behavior, &#x0200e;and feeling of well-being (including mental image); food cravings; abdominal pain; &#x0200e;breast tenderness; headache; and fatigue. These symptoms intensify 4 to 7 days before &#x0200e;menstruation, and women are likely to suffer from these symptoms on particular day's &#x0200e;for 4 to 10 years. Like other major mood disorders, PMS and PMDD make a person &#x0200e;incapable of leading an organized life. Since PMS is associated with mental disorders, &#x0200e;there is a need for effective therapeutic interventions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The Royal College of &#x0200e;Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Association for Premenstrual &#x0200e;Syndrome (NAPS) published clinical practical guidelines for the management of PMS &#x0200e;&#x0200e; (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In these guidelines, patients record their PMS symptoms for at least two or three &#x0200e;cycles in a questionnaire diary. Appropriate treatments are then selected based on the &#x0200e;recorded symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended in patients with &#x0200e;moderate to severe PMS and mood, emotional, and physical symptoms (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) &#x0200e;&#x0200f;.&#x0200f;</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy includes limited weekly sessions conducted by a &#x0200e;psychotherapist focusing on modifying negative and abnormal thoughts and training &#x0200e;individuals in effective adaptive mechanisms. The benefit of psychotherapy is that its &#x0200e;effects are achieved through time; even when psychotherapy sessions come to an end, &#x0200e;their effects remain. Conversely, pharmacotherapy has a very rapid effect, but it ends &#x0200e;with the discontinuance of the drug (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Cognitive therapy focuses on cognitive &#x0200e;concepts, cognition related to the inner perception process, memory, and judgment with &#x0200e;which a person perceives herself and the world around her, and cognitive interventions &#x0200e;that help change or rectify individuals&#x02019; thinking patterns which have been shaped over &#x0200e;time. Such thinking patterns often interfere with individuals&#x02019; abilities and optimal &#x0200e;performance. The skills and techniques used in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are &#x0200e;models which investigate and determine the relationship between thoughts, feelings, &#x0200e;and behavior. In CBT, it is assumed that individuals are not disturbed by an event &#x0200e;itself; rather, it is the individual&#x02019;s perception of that incident which is harmful. As long &#x0200e;as an individual believes something, she will nurture and develop that belief. Work and &#x0200e;practice can modify beliefs that create difficulties in life (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In 2011, Nazari et al (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) &#x0200e;indicated that anxiety is the most common symptom of PMS. According to this study, &#x0200e;group CBT is able to free target individuals from distress and confusion through &#x0200e;planning and organizing, thus reducing anxiety. The individual avoids disturbing &#x0200e;thoughts that cause anxiety and comes to believe herself as a person who has certain &#x0200e;abilities and shortcomings. Moreover, avoiding hidden defects reduces the expectations &#x0200e;an individual has of herself and others. Results of this study showed that irritability is &#x0200e;reduced through CBT. Recent studies (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) have shown that a combination of &#x0200e;different treatments is much more effective than single treatment methods. Non-&#x0200e;pharmacological treatment of chronic disorders is of particular importance, especially in &#x0200e;adolescents. One can greatly benefit from counseling techniques through which the &#x0200e;client is helped to identify his problem and, after becoming familiar with the unknown, &#x0200e;he proceeds to analyze his problem and choose a solution. Adolescence and youth are &#x0200e;the most common periods for the start of PMS symptoms. Given the negative effects &#x0200e;PMS has on psychological, physical, and mood dimensions of this critical period in the &#x0200e;life of girls, the first step for its prevention and for the promotion of physical and &#x0200e;mental health in these individuals is to increase their awareness by developing and &#x0200e;spreading extensive, organized programs. Based on the mentioned studies and &#x0200e;witnessing PMS symptoms among dormitory girls and their indiscriminate use of &#x0200e;medication, the current study was carried out with the purpose of reducing PMS &#x0200e;symptoms in female students in the dormitory of North Khorasan University of Medical &#x0200e;Sciences through group CBT.&#x0200e;</p><sec><title>Materials and Method</title><p>In this quasi-experimental study was conducted at North Khorasan University of Medical &#x0200e;Sciences in the second semester of the 2011-2012 academic year. The study population was &#x0200e;female students living in the dormitory and majoring in nursing, midwifery, etc. Thirty-two &#x0200e;students with PMS were selected through non-probability convenience sampling upon acquiring &#x0200e;the Ethics Committee&#x02019;s authorization (coded 90/p/380 on 10/2/2011) after the tenth meeting and &#x0200e;after obtaining informed consent from the participants. The sample was then divided into control &#x0200e;and experimental groups. Error type I was considered equal to 0.05 and error type II to 0.20 &#x0200e;&#x0200e; (P1:0.8, P2: 0.4). Thus, 16 individuals were selected for each group. The Premenstrual Symptoms &#x0200e;Screening Tool (PSST), originally developed in 2003 by researchers at McMaster University to &#x0200e;screen individuals with severe PMS or PMDD or those who may benefit from treatment, was &#x0200e;used in this study. This quick and reliable tool screening operationalizes classified DSM - IV &#x0200e;criteria (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It&#x0200f; &#x0200f;has two parts. The first part consists of 14 items which measure emotional, &#x0200e;physical, and behavioral symptoms. The second part measures the impact of these symptoms on &#x0200e;the lives of individuals through 5 items, each of which has four options rated on a Likert scale - &#x0200e;not at all, mild, moderate, or severe symptoms - scored from 0 to 3. The following three &#x0200e;conditions should be met for the diagnoses of moderate to severe PMS: &#x0200e;</p><p>At least one of the first 4 items rated severe; &#x0200e;</p><p>In addition to the previous item, at least four items from questions 1 to 14 rated moderate &#x0200e;to severe; &#x0200e;</p><p>At least one of the five &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; items (last 5 items) rated moderate or severe. Hariri et al. &#x0200e;evaluated the validity and reliability of this test in Iran with Tehran University of Medical &#x0200e;Sciences students who reside in dormitories. The reliability of the questionnaire obtained a &#x0200e;Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient of 0.9. Content validity and content validity index values were 0.7 &#x0200e;and 0.8, respectively (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). First, the PSST was distributed among students. After individuals with &#x0200e;moderate to severe symptoms were identified, those with a score of 16 or higher were selected. &#x0200e;After obtaining informed consent, individuals were placed in experimental and control groups. &#x0200e;The experimental group was given explanations regarding their duties, rights, privileges, and &#x0200e;limitations. The experimental group received 8 to 12 ninety-minute group therapy sessions &#x0200e;which were held once a week from 8:00 to 9:30 pm in one of the classrooms at the School of &#x0200e;Nursing and Midwifery. The group therapy sessions took approximately 3 months to finish. &#x0200e;Members were approximately the same age and majoring in nursing or midwifery. Rights of the &#x0200e;members included:&#x0200e;</p><p>Personal information should remain confidential and safe; &#x0200e;</p><p>Group members should have access to the group leader and assistant leader;&#x0200e;</p><p>Members should be able to talk in private;&#x0200e;</p><p>Members should not face any obligation for entering the group; &#x0200e;</p><p>Members have the right to actively participate in group activities.&#x0200e;</p><p>In the recruitment stage, the leader and assistant therapist were careful to choose members who, &#x0200e;in addition to having the conditions of PMS, were interested in change and understood the &#x0200e;group&#x02019;s objectives. The reason for their selection for group therapy was explained to individuals. &#x0200e;Members paid no tuition or any other costs for group therapy sessions. In each session, the &#x0200e;practice sheets and assignments were given to members free of charge. After finishing one &#x0200e;session and starting the next (with a week between the two), individuals had to note down their &#x0200e;actions and activities and bring it along with themselves to the next session. In group therapy &#x0200e;sessions, the group leader was not the only person to talk; rather, all members had to cooperate &#x0200e;and participate actively in the sessions. Each person talked about her experience with PMS, her &#x0200e;thoughts and feelings at the time, and the useful experience she had in encountering and &#x0200e;reducing the intensity of these symptoms intensity. Participants received training in at least 12 &#x0200e;cognitive-behavioral techniques throughout the course. During the last 30 minutes of each &#x0200e;session, the group leader gave a general summary of the issues discussed and gave the necessary &#x0200e;instructions for the assignments. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the treatment protocol. Data was analyzed using &#x0200e;statistical indicators along with Friedman statistical tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were &#x0200e;used in SPSS version 19. &#x0200e;</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This research was carried out on 27 female students who were eligible for the study. &#x0200e;This number included 14 individuals in the intervention group and 13 individuals in the &#x0200e;control group. Participants had a mean age of 21 years with a standard deviation of &#x0200e;&#x0200e;0.79 and a median age of 21 years.&#x0200e;&#x0200f; &#x0200f;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the significant improvement in &#x0200e;psychiatric symptoms experienced by the intervention group after intervention &#x0200e;compared with before intervention.

Treatment was based &#x0200e;on presenting information on such topics as relaxation, massage, nutrition, lifestyle &#x0200e;change, regular physical exercise, and stress management. The study&#x02019;s findings show &#x0200e;that training with the group cognitive-behavioral therapy approach was effective on the &#x0200e;psychological symptoms of PMS in the experimental group. A significant difference &#x0200e;was seen between the trained experimental group and the control group. In addition, &#x0200e;the present study indicated that group cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective on the &#x0200e;social interferences caused by PMS; however, no significant effect was found on the &#x0200e;physical symptoms of PMS. These results were in line with similar studies carried out by &#x0200e;Christensen et al. in 1994 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), Blake et al. in 1998 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), Busse et al. in 2009 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), Hofmann &#x0200e;et al. in 2012 [23], Taghizadeh et al. in 2010 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), Hossein Nazari et al. in 2011 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and &#x0200e;Mirzai et al. in 2012 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These studies also revealed an improvement in some &#x0200e;psychological symptoms of PMS such as anxiety, depression, negative thoughts, and &#x0200e;physical changes. Furthermore, a 2011 study by Navabinejad et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) examined the &#x0200e;effects of group cognitive-behavioral therapy on the physical symptoms of PMS in &#x0200e;married women. Its results suggested that CBT should be used to increase family &#x0200e;efficiency and reduce marital conflicts related to the menstrual period. The 2012 &#x0200e;findings of Mirzaie et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) indicated that cognitive-behavioral stress management is &#x0200e;effective in reducing symptoms such as anxiety in women with PMS, but not on &#x0200e;physical symptoms. This study concluded that interventions in the form of drug therapy &#x0200e;and physical activity are able to reduce the physical symptoms of PMS. Since PMS &#x0200e;symptoms are caused by hormones and neurotransmitters, psychological treatments such &#x0200e;as stress management cannot prove effective in alleviating physical symptoms. In the &#x0200e;present study, the measurement of changes in physical symptoms was expressed &#x0200e;through a single question which students evaluated on a Likert scale. Thus, the &#x0200e;researchers believe that not being able to differentiate physical symptoms prevented &#x0200e;students from correctly evaluating and stating them. In investigating the frequency of &#x0200e;symptoms, a reduction before and after interventions was found. It cannot be definitely &#x0200e;asserted that cognitive-behavioral therapy has no effect on physical symptoms of PMS. &#x0200e;In addition, there is no single, accepted treatment across the globe for PMS. Previous &#x0200e;studies have not shown consistent results. Many clinical trials were not well-controlled &#x0200e;and have listed various methods for controlling the symptoms of PMS. It may be &#x0200e;helpful if the symptoms of stress are taken into consideration in psychological &#x0200e;counseling, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or group therapy (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In the current &#x0200e;study, the positive effects of cognitive-behavioral treatment on emotional and &#x0200e;psychological symptoms of PMS are justifiable. Based on the cognitive-behavioral &#x0200e;theory, disturbing thoughts and cognitive impairment lead to depression and stress. &#x0200e;PMS symptoms may be intensified and prolonged by the vicious cycle of negative &#x0200e;thoughts (low mood, low self-esteem, and lack of self-control) that women experience &#x0200e;in the premenstrual stage. One of the main strategies for making cognitive-behavioral &#x0200e;therapy more effective is to offer treatment in the form of group therapy (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In &#x0200e;the present study, the researchers tried to provide individuals with techniques for &#x0200e;identifying, challenging, and changing negative cognitions and inhibiting automatic &#x0200e;thoughts through 8 sessions of training. Carrying out the assignments was one of the &#x0200e;important aspects of this program. When a skill was presented with the assistant &#x0200e;therapist, individuals were expected to spend time at home working on other aspects of &#x0200e;their thinking and to use the proper technique in response to mood symptoms that &#x0200e;occur. The group leader set up each session in a way that members could express their &#x0200e;feelings and that enabled her to present participants with the necessary training. The &#x0200e;group leader had to establish a sense of security and confidence in individuals so that &#x0200e;they could self-disclose and express their feelings without anxiety. Cognitive behavioral &#x0200e;therapy was conducted with the assumption that students in dormitories are more &#x0200e;susceptible to environmental and emotional stressors such as economic difficulties, &#x0200e;special dorm circumstances, inconsistencies, and personal conflicts. These issues &#x0200e;intensify students&#x02019; mood symptoms. Since the participating students were majoring in &#x0200e;medical science fields, there was a higher possibility for self-medication (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Although &#x0200e;the present study analyzed the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral therapy on &#x0200e;PMS symptoms, there was no follow-up on the group CBT&#x02019;s lasting effects after the &#x0200e;completion of sessions, and the treatment method was not compared with other forms. &#x0200e;Hunter et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) in 2002 studied the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (ten &#x0200e;sessions) and Fluoxetine (20 mg) and combination therapy (Fluoxetine and cognitive &#x0200e;therapy) in women with premenstrual disorders. His results showed that a distinct &#x0200e;improvement with all three kinds of therapy had occurred after 6 months. In addition, &#x0200e;patients who received Fluoxetine experienced a quicker recovery. Follow-up on the &#x0200e;three groups showed no differences in terms of the betterment of premenstrual &#x0200e;disorders. However, it did reveal that cognitive-behavioral therapy had more lasting &#x0200e;effects than Fluoxetine therapy. To clarify, Fluoxetine and cognitive-behavioral therapy &#x0200e;both have equal treatment effects, but differ in terms of long-term effects. This can be &#x0200e;effective in deciding which type of treatment to choose. No added advantage was &#x0200e;observed in combination therapy. Ghaedi et al.&#x02019;s (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) research in 2011 reported no &#x0200e;reduction in mean physical symptoms of the experimental and control groups after an 8-&#x0200e;week follow-up, but mean psychological symptoms were significantly lower in the &#x0200e;experimental group than the control group. Thus, many studies (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>and <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) suggest &#x0200e;that further experimental research must be carefully conducted with smaller groups &#x0200e;under controlled conditions in order to devise a tool that can assess the experiences of &#x0200e;women with PMS-related disorders. &#x0200e;</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy approach in managing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Other studies also &#x0200e;show that this kind of treatment is effective on the physical symptoms of PMS. CBT &#x0200e;gives female students new insight into themselves, their symptoms, and the individuals &#x0200e;around them, reinforcing their ability to identify solvable problems and helping them &#x0200e;become successful in better controlling their lives. This type of treatment is rarely &#x0200e;available, but it is the right choice for students suffering from PMS symptoms who &#x0200e;cannot tolerate drug therapy or for students who use non-prescribed medication.&#x0200e;</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This article is the result of a research plan approved by the Student Research Committee &#x0200e;of North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.
