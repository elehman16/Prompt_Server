Regarding the mechanistic differences between isolated systolic high blood pressure and isolated diastolic high blood pressure and their different impact on end organ diseases, it is necessary to examine the prevalence of different high blood pressure subtypes in Chinese children and explore their associations with adiposity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Data were derived from the baseline data of a multi-centered cluster randomized controlled trial involving participants from China. High blood pressure was defined according to age-, gender- and height-specific 95th percentile developed by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group. Body mass index was used to classify underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The prevalence of HBP was 10.2% and 8.9% for boys and girls, respectively. Isolated systolic high blood pressure is the dominant high blood pressure subtype among Chinese boys aged 6&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years and girls aged 12&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years, while isolated diastolic high blood pressure was the most common high blood pressure subtype in girls aged 6&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years. In boys, the status of overweight doubled the risk of isolated systolic high blood pressure (95% CI, 1.73, 2.31; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) compared with the normal weight group, and the risk for obese children was 4.32 (95% CI, 3.81, 4.90; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).

Mechanistically, it is reported that pediatric ISHBP represented an early stage of hypertension that might be modulated by the association between obesity and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, while no such phenomenon was found for IDHBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In adults, isolated hypertension(ISH) increases steadily with age, which is different from IDHBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether this age-related change in HBP exists in children as well.</p><p id="Par18">To date, the prevalence of different HBP subtype is unknown in Chinese children. Although the close relationship between body mass index (BMI) and HBP has been well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the associations between different HBP subtypes and BMI are rarely reported. In the present study, we investigated the gender and age disparity of HBP subtype among Chinese children based on a large national survey, and examined the strength of the association between BMI and HBP subtypes. Regarding the mechanistic differences between ISHBP and IDHBP, we hypothesized that the magnitude of association between ISHBP with BMI differs from that of IDHBP. These results have a potential to improve our understanding of pediatric HBP, and aid strategies for controlling and preventing HBP in children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par19">Data were derived from the baseline data of a multi-centered cluster randomized controlled trial involving Chinese children and adolescents from 7 provinces (Liaoning, Tianjin, Ningxia, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hunan and Guangdong) in September of 2013.

Similar pattern was also observed in girls, although the associations between HBP subtypes and BMI groups were of weaker amplitude compared with those in boys.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par32">The current study demonstrated that there is a gender difference of HBP subtypes distribution, and boys had a higher risk of ISHBP than girls. In boys aged 6 to 17&#x000a0;years old and girls aged 12 to 17&#x000a0;years old, ISHBP is the most common subtype of HBP in Chinese children. In girls aged 6 to 11&#x000a0;years old, IDHBP is the most frequent subtype. In addition, in both sexes, 9 to 11&#x000a0;years old were the age related to the highest prevalence of all types of HBP. These patterns were slightly changed when BMI was adjusted for. Furthermore, compared with IDHBP, a stronger association was observed between ISHBP and BMI.</p><p id="Par33">To our knowledge, the present study is the first study concerning different HBP subtypes (ISHBP, IDHBP and SDHBP) prevalence and these subtypes&#x02019; associations with BMI among Chinese young population. Our team previously reported the increasing trend in HBP from 2005 to 2010 using the Chinese National Surveys on Students&#x02019; Constitution and Health (CNSSCH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. That study showed that the prevalence of systolic and diastolic HBP in 2010 were 4.9% and 3.9% in boys and 3.5% and 4.0% in girls, respectively. In the present study, the prevalence of SHBP and DHBP among 6- to 17-year-old children in 2013 is higher than those in 2010, with SHBP 7.05% and 5.58% for boys and girls respectively, and DHBP is 5.79% and 6.02% for boys and girls. Additionally, there is an inverted U-shaped pattern in the prevalence of HBP with age among various HBP subtypes and sex groups, with children aged 9&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years old had the highest prevalence. These findings were lower than those observed in Swiss adolescents, who had the prevalence of HBP and ISHBP of 11.4% and 9.60%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Xu et al. used the same standard of HBP explored the prevalence of HBP by age and gender in Chinese children. In line with our results, boys had higher prevalence of HBP than girls, and HBP generally increased by age, but the trend with age were slightly different. In Xu et al.&#x02019;s study boys had a peak prevalence of HBP at age of 16&#x000a0;years, while girls had a peak prevalence of HBP at age of 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our study, the prevalence of HBP is around 10&#x000a0;years old in both genders (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3). The different age with peak HBP prevalence may due to the different ethnicities. In addition, we also specified the ages with peak prevalence among each HBP subtypes, which were generally consistent with those of HBP.</p><p id="Par34">In addition to previous studies that showed boys had significantly higher prevalence of HBP than girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], our results presented boys related with an enhanced risk of ISHBP across age groups. Nevertheless, the situation of IDHBP was different, which revealed girls of 6 to 14&#x000a0;years old had a higher risk of IDHBP than their male counterparts.</p><p id="Par35">Current study depicted the distribution of HBP subtype across age groups, which were different from those in adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Increasing evidence has showed that the impact of ISHBP on the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and related mortality and morbidity is stronger than IDHBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, high SBP could be tougher to control compared with high DBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Regarding the phenomenon that pediatric HBP could track into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the age and gender characteristics of prevalence of different HBP subtypes could be of vital importance when strategies for prevention and control HBP are developed in young population, which may further benefit their subsequent adulthood cardiovascular profile.</p><p id="Par36">Additionally, the current study demonstrated the associations between different HBP/HBP subtypes and BMI. Regarding the association between BMI and BP, similar results were found in other studies in Chinese children. Generally, children with overweight had a doubled higher risk of HBP, while quadrupled the risk was showed in children with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Though elevated BMI is associated with a significantly increased risk of ISHBP and SDHBP, the correlation between ISHBP and BMI is much stronger than that for IDHBP. These findings were consistent with a previous study conducted in a US population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The possible mechanism for these differences in the magnitude of the association might be related with central pulsatile hemodynamics. Pierce et al. found that the adolescents with high BMI had increased left ventricular mass, high aortic wave amplitude, and systolic BP, but not diastolic BP, compared with their peers with normal weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Additionally, higher fat accumulation has been reported as an important independent predictor of aortic stiffness (aortic pulse-wave velocity), which is strongly associated with SBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, our finding suggested that intervention for reducing BMI may lead to a bigger benefit in controlling of ISHBP than IDHBP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par37">The strengths of our study include that we used a relative large and representative sample. Additionally, our sample included participants with wide age range (from 6 to 17&#x000a0;years), which allowed us to explore the trend of pediatric HBP subtypes with age. However, there are also limitations. Firstly, the BP measurement was collected on one occasion, and the estimated prevalence of HBP may be overestimated. In the future study, BP measurements with multiple visits or using ambulatory blood pressure monitor would be better to identify HBP. Secondly, we did not collect the information about medication and salt consumption in this survey, which were warranted in our further study. Thirdly, this is a cross-sectional study which is not able to provide causal inference for the association between BMI and BP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">Our study revealed that ISHBP is the predominant subtype of pediatric HBP among Chinese 6 to 17-year-old boys and 12- to 17-year-old girls, and IDHBP was the most common subtype of HBP in girls aged 6&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years. An inverted U-shaped trend in prevalence of HBP subtypes across age was also observed. Regarding of the strength of association between ISHBP and BMI was stronger than those for IDHBP, children with ISHBP may obtain more benefices from obesity intervention. These findings may aid the strategies for preventing and controlling of hypertension in early life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
