The study population comprised 60 patients with ASA physical status I and II, aged 18&#x02013;65 years, scheduled for elective surgery of duration 3 hours or more. Written informed consent was taken from each patient. Pregnant and nursing women, patients with morbid obesity, heart block, and hypertensive patients on &#x003b2; blockers were excluded from the study. Patients with diabetes and renal disease were not included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups, each containing 30 patients, using a &#x0201c;slips of paper in a box&#x0201d; technique. None of the patients were on any significant drug therapy preoperatively.</p><p>The grouping is as follows:</p><p>Group C: Control group: Isoflurane&#x02013;opioid-saline anaesthesia</p><p>Group D: Dexmedetomidine group: Isoflurane&#x02013;opioid-dexmedetomidine anaesthesia</p><p>All the patients were premedicated with inj. glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly, 30 min prior to induction of anaesthesia. On arrival in the operating room, the patients&#x02019; baseline heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and respiratory rate were recorded after 5 min settling in the operative room. A large bore intravenous canula was inserted for drug and continuous fluid administration. All the patients in group D received inj. dexmedetomidine in a dose of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg over a period of 10 min prior to induction of anaesthesia through an infusion pump. During the infusion, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and sedation score were recorded at 5 min intervals and at 10 min (end of infusion). All the patients in group C received saline through an infusion pump.</p><p>All the patients received inj. ondansetron 4 mg, inj. fentanyl 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg and inj. midazolam 1 mg intravenously (IV), before the induction of anaesthesia. Then, a dose of inj. thiopentone sufficient to abolish eyelash reflex was injected followed by inj. vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg to facilitate laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. The lungs were ventilated by mask for at least 3 min using 100% oxygen. Laryngoscopy was performed with a Macintosh laryngoscope and trachea was intubated with appropriate size endotracheal tube. Anaesthesia was maintained with N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub> (60:40), isoflurane, inj. fentanyl and inj. vecuronium. The isoflurane was used in lowest possible concentration necessary to keep the blood pressure and heart rate within 20% limits of patient's preoperative baseline values. The inspiratory concentration of isoflurane was adjusted in steps of 0.2% when needed to keep the haemodynamic parameters to acceptable values. Inj. fentanyl in increments of 0.4 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg was given when inspiratory isoflurane concentration exceeded by 1%. In both the groups, additional adjuvants were provided in the form of inj. diclofenac sodium or inj. propofol intravenously after inj. fentanyl exceeded 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg. The dexmedetomidine infusion was continued after intubation in a dosage of 0.2&#x02013;0.7 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/hour in group D, till the start of skin closure. All the patients in group D received isoflurane in minimum concentration of 0.4%, which was further increased when requirement of inj. Dexmedetomidine exceeded 0.7 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/Hr to keep the haemodynamic parameters within acceptable range. Similarly, isoflurane was terminated at the start of skin closure and N<sub>2</sub>O was discontinued after skin closure.</p><p>At the end of anaesthesia, the neuromuscular blockade was antagonised with inj. neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg and inj. glycopyrrolate 0.02 mg/kg intravenously. Patients were extubated when respiration was deemed sufficient and patients were able to obey simple commands.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Parameters studied</title><p>All the parameters and the results from the two groups (group C and group D) were entered in the predesigned study proforma sheet.</p><p>

It would also reduce perioperative volatile anaesthetic and analgesic requirement.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist that has been shown to have sedative, analgesic and anaesthetic sparing effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] It causes a dose-dependent decrease in arterial blood pressure and heart rate, associated with decrease in serum norepinephrine concentration.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine was well tolerated, and no serious side effects or adverse reactions occurred in the present study.</p><p>The dose of thiopentone needed for induction was reduced significantly (30%) in the patients receiving dexmedetomidine, as also found by Aantaa and coworkers, demonstrating the anaesthesia potentiating effects of the drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>It has also been shown that dexmedetomidine potentiates analgesia caused by fentanyl and reduces its dose requirements in humans during surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The fentanyl dose in the control group was almost twice that given in the dexmedetomidine group. The requirement of fentanyl was reduced by 33% in the dexmedetomidine group in our study. Analgesic property has been demonstrated earlier in a study with dexmedetomidine in experimental ischaemic pain in healthy volunteers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and as the sole analgesic after surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine has been widely studied as an anaesthetic adjuvant and its anaesthetic sparing effects are well known. In studies by Aho and colleagues and Aantaa and coworkers, it has been shown to reduce the isoflurane requirement dose dependently up to 90%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In our study, isoflurane was used as the main anaesthetic agent, the requirement of which was decreased by 32% in group D, in accordance with earlier studies.</p><p>Tracheal intubation is associated with increases in arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamine concentrations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Increases in arterial pressure and heart rate observed in the control group in the present study were similar to those reported in earlier studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In the present study, pretreatment with dexmedetomidine 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg attenuated, but not totally obtunded, the cardiovascular response to tracheal intubation after induction of anaesthesia. In patients undergoing general or gynaecological surgery, numerous studies have shown that dexmedetomidine blunts cardiovascular response to intubation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] and our findings are in accordance with them. In addition to this beneficial property of &#x003b1;-2 agonists, they have also been reported to increase the risk of hypotension and bradycardia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] These effects have most often been seen in young healthy volunteers on rapid bolus administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In our study, bradycardia was observed in two patients receiving dexmedetomidine, with no fall in blood pressure, which responded promptly to IV atropine.</p><p>In our study, three patients were of craniotomies for supratentorial tumours. The perioperative haemodynamic stability is of utmost importance in such surgeries. Increase or decrease in blood pressure may cause bleeding or edema or predispose the patient to cerebral ischaemia. The haemodynamic responses to emergence from anaesthesia and extubation are blunted with dexmedetomidine and the centrally mediated sympatholytic effect is continued well in postoperative period, which was advantageous in these patients. Tanskanen and coworkers, in their study using dexmedetomidine as an anaesthetic adjuvant for intracranial tumour, concluded that there was an increased perioperative haemodynamic stability in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery without postoperative respiratory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Also, dexmedetomidine has been studied as a supplement to isoflurane for vitreoretinal surgeries, without causing undue haemodynamic fluctuation, and has been shown to decrease the excitatory response during extubation with acceptable reduction in intraocular pressure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>A possible limitation of our study may have been the use of subjective criteria to determine dose of thiopentone, isoflurane and fentanyl for each patient. Estimating anaesthesia depth by changes mediated by autonomic nervous system is difficult during dexmedetomidine infusion as it increases the haemodynamic stability. Intraoperative Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring would have been definitely more objective in deciding the depth of anaesthesia and the requirement of anaesthetic agent. Also, measurement of QT interval and plasma catecholamine levels, more objective means of haemodynamic response,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] was not done because of practical difficulty. Measurement of the end-tidal isoflurane concentration would have been ideal to indicate the depth and for quantifying decrease in utilisation between groups than the inspired dial concentration. Postoperative requirement of analgesics was not taken into consideration as it was not part of our study. Measurement of time to recovery following extubation would have given an idea of recovery in both the groups.</p><p>The present study findings corroborate with those of previous studies. No adverse cardiovascular effects from the drug were seen in the present study. Bradycardia, a possible consequence of administration of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, was counteracted by the use of atropine. There was no case of awareness suggesting adequate depth of anaesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dexmedetomidine, as a pre-anaesthetic medication and intraoperative infusion, decreases intraoperative anaesthetic requirement. It has significant opioid and anaesthetic sparing property. It significantly attenuates sympathoadrenal response to tracheal intubation. In addition, continuous intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine does not affect intraoperative cardiovascular stability.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
