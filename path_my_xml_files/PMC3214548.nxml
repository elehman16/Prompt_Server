A sitting position is commonly used in pregnant patients due to easier performance of the block.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In previous trials, EVE failed to augment the sensory block[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] when performed following an intrathecal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine in sitting position. The failure of EVE was hypothesized to be due to the preferential caudad migration of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine that occurs in sitting position,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] making EVE-induced rise in epidural pressure insufficient to push the local anaesthetic cephalad.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] However, whether a change in patient positioning during subarachnoid injection with hyperbaric drug affects the results of EVE has not been evaluated till date.</p><p>The present report consists of two studies aiming to evaluate the effect of change in patient position on sensory block level following CSE with and without EVE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In the first study, after approval of the institutional review board and informed written consent from subjects, 28 ASA physical status I or II nonlaboring parturients with uncomplicated pregnancy of gestational period &#x02265;37 weeks scheduled for elective cesarean section under CSE anesthesia were included. Parturients with any contraindication to central neuraxial block were excluded from the study. Subjects with extremes of height or weight (BMI &#x0003c;20 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, height &#x0003c;145 cm or &#x0003e;180 cm) were also not included in the trial. The patients were randomized using sealed opaque envelopes to one of two groups, depending on whether EVE was applied following the block in sitting position (group SE) or in lateral position (group LE) (<italic>n</italic>=14 each).</p><p>All patients were administered 10 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate solution intravenously, just prior to block performance. Monitoring in the operating room included lead II electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and noninvasive oscillometric blood pressure measurement (Datex-Ohmeda<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, USA). All blocks were performed by investigators who were proficient in central neuraxial blockade and had greater than 3 years experience in anesthesia.</p><p>In all patients, the CSE was performed at L4-5 level using needle-through-needle set. Epidural space was identified in the midline using 18G Tuohy needle by loss of resistance to air technique, limiting the volume of air to less than 2 ml. Intrathecal injection of 9 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine (0.5%) along with 10 &#x003bc;g fentanyl, in a total volume of 2 ml, was injected over approximately 4 s via 25G pencil point spinal needle with the opening facing cephalad. Following this, the epidural catheter was inserted 4 cm inside epidural space and fixed after confirming absence of CSF or blood flow through it. The patient was then positioned supine with a 15&#x000b0; left tilt and EVE performed using 5 ml of normal saline injected over 10-15 seconds through the epidural catheter. The 15&#x000b0; left tilt of patient was maintained till delivery of the baby and no change in horizontal tilt of the table was allowed throughout surgery irrespective of the sensory block level.</p><p>The hemodynamic parameters and block characteristics were assessed by an independent anesthesiologist who was unaware of the anesthetic technique. Hemodynamic parameters were monitored every 5 min till end of surgery. Sensory block was assessed by loss of all sensation to pinprick. The motor blockade was assessed according to the modified Bromage score,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] wherein score 1 = complete block, unable to move feet or knees; 2 = almost complete block, able to move feet only; 3 = partial block, just able to move knees; 4 = detectable weakness of hip flexion while supine, full flexion of knees; 5 = no detectable weakness of hip flexion while supine; and 6 = able to perform partial knee bend. The block characteristics were noted every 5 min for 30 min after placing the patient supine, followed by 15 min interval till end of surgery, and then every 30 min in recovery room till complete motor recovery.</p><p>The time of completion of intrathecal injection was marked as time<sub>0</sub> and the following block characteristics were calculated beginning from time<sub>0</sub>.</p><p>

</p><p>Surgery was allowed to proceed as soon as sensory block ascended to T6 level. The time required to position patients supine after intrathecal injection (time<sub>s</sub>) and time for first request for postoperative analgesia were also noted. Postoperative analgesia was provided with epidural top-ups of 0.25% bupivacaine. Hypotension was defined as &#x0003e;20% fall from basal systolic blood pressure and treated with ephedrine 6 mg intravenous bolus. Other intraoperative adverse effects noted included bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and shivering.</p><p>In the second study, all procedural specifications were identical. Another 28 patients were recruited and randomized to receive the CSE without EVE in sitting (group S) or lateral (group L) position (<italic>n</italic> = 14 each). The primary outcome measure in both studies was the maximum sensory block level achieved.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results were analyzed using SPSS software version 11. All comparisons were made between groups SE vs. LE and groups S vs. L. Comparisons of demographic data, time variables, maximum block levels, as well as sensory blockade and motor blockade at corresponding time points were done between groups SE and LE and groups S and L using unpaired t-test. Incidences of adverse effects between the respective groups were compared using Chi-square test. Apgar scores were compared between the groups using Mann-Whitney U test. For comparison of sensory level achieved, T 1 to T 12 dermatomes were designated as numbers 1 to 12. <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>Sample size was calculated after a pilot study of 20 patients, who were not included in the final analysis. To detect a 2-segment difference in the maximum sensory block level with EVE, at alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 95%, 14 patients were required in each group.</p><p>Since the study was conducted in two parts, we also calculated after completion, the power of both parts to detect a difference of 2-segment in maximum sensory block level between groups SE and LE and groups S and L.

The mean S<sub>max</sub> was T3.5 &#x000b1; 1.4 vs. T5.3 &#x000b1; 0.9 in group LE vs. SE, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The mechanism of higher sensory level of block with EVE is postulated to be an increase in epidural pressure by the injection of epidural saline, leading to a thecal compression which pushes the intrathecal drug cephalad.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In our study, the epidural pressure in group SE would also have increased following the epidural injection for EVE, but the rise was probably insufficient to push cephalad the caudally pooled intrathecal bupivacaine, leading to a failure of EVE in group SE. Such a failure of EVE in augmenting sensory block after intrathecal deposition of hyperbaric bupivacaine in sitting position has been noted previously in nonobstetric patients,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] but never compared to results of EVE in lateral patient position. These earlier trials also attributed the failure of EVE applied to block performed in sitting position, to a restricted spread of local anesthetic to lumbar and sacral roots.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The dynamics of central neuraxial blockade in obstetric patients are known to be different from nonobstetric patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Earlier data in obstetric patients by Blumgart <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] show a contradictory result as compared to our study. The authors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] had noted successful block augmentation following EVE applied to CSE in sitting position, despite using hyperbaric bupivacaine. Herein, they used 10 ml normal saline for EVE, a volume double of the injectate used in the present study. The effect of injecting normal saline in epidural space is known to be additive, with an increasing percentage of thecal compression following increasing injectate volume from 5 to 20 ml.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The larger volume of saline used by Blumgart <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] may have increased the epidural pressure to a greater extent, such as to overcome the resistance offered by caudad migration of drug and result in block augmentation. This &#x0201c;volume effect&#x0201d; being cited by us as a probable cause of failure of EVE in sitting position does not amount to stating that 5 ml normal saline is an inadequate volume for EVE. It has been documented that 5 ml saline causes thecal compression and effective EVE.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Despite a significantly higher S<sub>max</sub>, the incidence of hypotension and amount of ephedrine used was statistically similar, though clinically greater, in group LE as compared to group SE [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. The lack of statistical significance may be because our study was not powered to detect differences in incidence of hypotension. Since hypotension was not the primary outcome measure, we recorded blood pressure at interval of 5 min only, as commonly done in our clinical practice. It is thus possible that transient variations in blood pressure were missed. Accordingly, it appears inappropriate to comment conclusively on the incidence of hypotension in the two groups. However, there was no difference in the neonatal Apgar score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>].</p><p>This study has demonstrated the difference in sensory block following EVE application in sitting and lateral position that has been hitherto unexplored. It may be argued that the higher sensory block in lateral position is a result of the CSE itself, without any contribution of the EVE. However, it has been amply documented in various trials that injection of 5 ml normal saline leads to thecal compression and effective EVE. Also, the second study was undertaken under identical circumstances to evaluate whether similar difference in sensory block level was seen after CSE in sitting and lateral position. The absence of any statistical difference in the S<sub>max</sub> observed in the second study lends support to variations in sensory block with EVE conducted in different position.</p><p>Previous studies regarding effect of sitting or lateral position on sensory block level following CSE in obstetric patients have produced conflicting results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] There is evidence to show both, a lack of any difference[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] as well as lower sensory block level[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] in sitting position as compared to lateral position. Although, there are other trials also comparing the block characteristics in sitting and lateral position in obstetric patients, but they have not analyzed the effect on the maximum sensory level.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Based on the findings of this study we recommend that when EVE is planned during cesarean section to raise the sensory level of block following intrathecal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine, the CSE should be performed in lateral and not sitting position. Also, under the conditions of this study, performing a CSE with patient in sitting or lateral position has no effect on the maximum sensory block level achieved.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
