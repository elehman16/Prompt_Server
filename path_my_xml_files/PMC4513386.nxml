The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of a single intralesional injection of ACS in naturally occurring tendinopathies of the equine superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) on clinical, ultrasonographic, and histological parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifteen horses with 17 naturally occurring tendinopathies of forelimb SDFTs were examined clinically and ultrasonographically (day 0). Injured tendons were randomly assigned to the ACS-treated group (<italic>n</italic> = 10) receiving a single intralesional ACS injection or included as controls (<italic>n</italic> = 7) which were either untreated or injected with saline on day 1. All horses participated in a gradually increasing exercise programme and were re-examined nine times at regular intervals until day 190. Needle biopsies were taken from the SDFTs on days 0, 36 and 190 and examined histologically and for the expression of collagen types I and III by immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In ACS-treated limbs lameness decreased significantly until day 10 after treatment. Swelling (scores) of the SDFT region decreased within the ACS group between 50 and 78 days after treatment. Ultrasonographically, the percentage of the lesion in the tendon was significantly lower and the echogenicity of the lesion (total echo score) was significantly higher 78 and 106 days after intralesional ACS injection compared to controls. Histology revealed that, compared to controls, tenocyte nuclei were more spindle-shaped 36 days after ACS injection. Immunohistochemistry showed that collagen type I expression significantly increased between days 36 and 190 after ACS injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Single intralesional ACS injection of equine SDFTs with clinical signs of acute tendinopathy contributes to an early significant reduction of lameness and leads to temporary improvement of ultrasonographic parameters of repair tissue. Intralesional ACS treatment might decrease proliferation of tenocytes 5 weeks after treatment and increase their differentiation as demonstrated by elevated collagen type I expression in the remodelling phase. Potential enhancement of these effects by repeated injections should be tested in future controlled clinical investigations.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Horse</kwd><kwd>Tendon</kwd><kwd>Ultrasonography</kwd><kwd>Biopsy</kwd><kwd>Histology</kwd><kwd>Collagen</kwd><kwd>Autologous conditioned serum</kwd><kwd>ACS</kwd><kwd>Irap</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tendinopathy of the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is a common injury in Thoroughbred racehorses and other horse breeds and is regarded as a career-limiting disease with a high recurrence rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Numerous treatment modalities have shown limited success in improving tendon repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Regenerative therapy aims to restore structure and function after application of biocompatible materials, cells, and bioactive molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is growing knowledge about the clinical effects of potentially regenerative substrates, e.g. mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and autologous blood products such as platelet rich plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] on equine tendinopathies. To date, however, ideal treatment strategies for naturally occurring tendinopathies have not been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Autologous conditioned serum (ACS; synonyms irap&#x000ae;, Orthokine&#x000ae;, Orthogen, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany) is used for intralesional treatment of tendinopathy in horses but, to the best of our knowledge, its clinical effect is only documented anecdotally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. ACS is prepared by exposing whole blood samples to glass beads, which has been shown to stimulate the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent investigation has shown that ACS from equine blood also contains high levels of IL-1Ra and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Equine studies have focused on the IL-1Ra-mediated anti-inflammatory effects of ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; however, in tendon healing, the high concentrations of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) may be equally or more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Blood samples from different horses and the use of different kits for the preparation of ACS may lead to differences in the cytokine and growth factor concentration in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the relevance of these differences for the clinical effect is unknown.</p><p>ACS was originally described to improve muscle regeneration in a murine muscle contusion model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in an experimental model of carpal osteoarthritis in horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in humans with knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The rationale for the use of ACS to treat equine tendinopathies is based on several findings: 1) It was shown in an experimental study that the expression of IL-1&#x003b2; (and matrix metalloproteinase-13) is upregulated following overstrain injury of rat tendons, demonstrating that these molecules are important mediators in the pathogenesis of tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. 2) IL-1Ra protein and heterologous conditioned serum prepared with the irap&#x000ae; kit reduced the production of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> by stimulated cells derived from macroscopically normal SDFTs in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. 3) Growth factors concentrated in ACS, e.g. IGF-1 and TGF-&#x003b2;, have the potential to attract resident precursor cells, e.g. MSCs and tenoblasts, and to increase cell proliferation during tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Rat Achilles tendons exposed to ACS in an experimental study showed an enhanced expression of the Col1A1 gene, which led to an increased secretion of type I collagen and accelerated recovery of tendon stiffness and improved histologic maturity of the repair tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It was shown in another rodent Achilles tendon transection model that ACS generally increases the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), bone morphogenetic protein-12 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], representing growth factors important for the process of tendon regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The process of tendon healing is mainly divided into three phases which merge into each other. The acute inflammatory phase (&#x0003c;10&#x02013;14 days) is characterized by phagocytosis and demarcation of injured tendon tissue. A fibroproliferative callus is formed during the proliferative phase (4&#x02013;45 days), while collagen fibrils are organised into tendon bundles during the remodelling or maturation phase (45&#x02013;120 days; &#x0003c;3 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to support the hypothesis that a single intralesional ACS injection into SDFT lesions 1) has a clinically detectable anti-inflammatory effect, 2) leads to improved B-mode ultrasonographic parameters and 3) improves the organization of repair tissue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Inclusion criteria for client-owned adult horses was a history of acute uni- or bilateral SDFT tendinopathy (tendon disorder) without cutaneous injury but with clinical signs of inflammation being reported to be present for up to 14 days prior to the presentation at the Equine Clinic of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Foundation, or to collaborating veterinarians. Horses were only included if the clients agreed to the study design and tendons had not received intralesional injections before. Injured limbs were randomly assigned to the group treated with ACS (<italic>n</italic> = 10) or to controls (<italic>n</italic> = 7). The study was carried out between 2009 and 2012 and approved by the animal welfare officer of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation, Germany, and the ethics committee of the responsible German federal state authority in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Law (Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety, Az. 33.9-42502-05-09A652).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical examination</title><p>All horses were examined clinically on the day of first presentation (day 0). This examination included visual assessment of lameness (5 grade score) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and signs of inflammation which were scored semiquantitatively by palpation (skin surface temperature in the palmar metacarpal region and sensitivity of the SDFT to palpation: 0 = no abnormality, 1 = mild abnormality, 2 = moderate abnormality, and 3 = severe abnormality; swelling of the SDFT was determined by palpation as an increase in diameter relative to normal tendon: 0 = no increase, 1 = increase by factor 1.5; 2 = increase by factor 1.5 to 2; increase by more than factor 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>B-mode ultrasonography</title><p>All injured tendons were examined with B-mode ultrasound on the day of first presentation (day 0) in a transverse and longitudinal fashion with a linear 5&#x02013;7.5 MHz linear scanner (Logiq e, GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA), according to the seven zone designations as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Images were stored digitally and analysed according to the following parameters to determine the degree- and time-related changes of the lesions: maximal injury zone (MIZ), type of lesion determined on transverse images in the MIZ (core lesion = centrally located, focal hypo-/anechoic region; marginal lesion = peripherally located, focal hypo-/anechoic region; diffuse lesion = homogenous or heterogenous changes in echogenicity of the whole/most parts of the cross sectional area), summarized cross-sectional areas of the tendon (total cross-sectional area, T-CSA), summarized cross-sectional areas of the lesion (total lesion cross-sectional area, TL-CSA), and percentage of the lesion in the tendon [percent total lesion, %T-lesion = (TL-CSA / T-CSA) &#x000d7; 100]. Echogenicity and fibre alignment were graded semiquantitatively at each zone and the scores for all levels were summarized (total echo score, TES; total fibre alignment score, T-FAS). Echogenicity was assigned to 0 (normoechoic), 1 (hypoechoic), 2 (mixed echogenicity), and 3 (anechoic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and fibre alignment was graded according to the estimated percentage of parallel fibres in the lesion: 0 (&#x0003e;75 %), 1 (50&#x02013;74 %), 2 (25&#x02013;49 %), and 3 (&#x0003c;25 %) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Analyses of ultrasonograms were performed by one examiner (ML) blinded to the individual treatment modality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intralesional treatment, follow-up examinations and controlled exercise</title><p>Ten millilitres of autologous blood were collected by a single venipuncture of one jugular vein into an irap&#x000ae;-10 syringe system (Orthogen, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany). Blood samples were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C (range 6&#x02013;9 hours). After centrifugation at 4,000 rotations per minute for 10 minutes (centrifuge: Universal 320, rotor: no. 1624, Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany), serum was aseptically aspirated from the syringe and passed through a 0.22 &#x003bc;m syringe-driven filter unit (Millex-MP, Millipore Corporation, Carrigtwohill, Co. Cork, Ireland). Depending on the size of the lesion as determined ultrasonographically (TL-CSA), tendons allocated to the ACS group received a single intralesional injection of 1&#x02013;3 ml through a 22G needle (diameter 0.7 mm, length 30 mm) into the SDFT defect (day 1). Control tendons either received a single injection of a placebo, i.e. 1&#x02013;3 ml saline through a 22G needle (diameter 0.7 mm, length 30 mm) or were untreated in case the owner declined an intralesional application of saline. Horses were sedated for the intralesional injections with detomidine (0.01&#x02013;0.03 mg/kg intravenously) and butorphanol (0.04&#x02013;0.05 mg/kg intravenously), and the medial and lateral palmar nerves were anaesthetized 2 cm distal to the carpometacarpal joints with 2 ml of a 2 % mepivacaine solution. After aseptic preparation of the skin, superficial digital tendon lesions were injected under sonographic guidance at a single site from the lateral aspect of the tendon perpendicularly to its long axis directly into the most hypoechoic areas, i.e. the MIZ while the limb was weight-bearing. All horses participated in a gradually increasing exercise programme as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The programme started the first day after the reported onset of SDFT tendinopathy. From week 25 to 27 horses were exercised for 25 minutes at a walk and for 15 minutes at a trot.</p><p>Horses were re-examined clinically and ultrasonographically at regular intervals for 27 weeks on days 11, 22, 36, 50, 78, 106, 134, 162, and 190. Thereafter horse owners were advised to gradually increase exercise on an individual basis until the previous level of performance was reached. Data concerning signs of acute tendon injury, the level of performance horses reached and the discipline they were used for were obtained by telephone inquiry with horse owners or trainers until the preparation of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Needle biopsies and histologic examinations</title><p>On days 0, 36 and 190, one needle biopsy was taken aseptically from each SDFT at its MIZ with a 20G automated biopsy needle (Biopsiepistole PlusSpeed&#x02122;, Peter Pflugbeil GmbH, Zorneding, Germany), with the needle entering the MIZ of the SDFT from distal at a 45&#x000b0; angle while the carpus was flexed approximately 90&#x000b0; and the metacarpophalangeal joint was moderately extended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Pain reaction and intensity of bleeding from the biopsy site were evaluated using an established score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The MIZ was recorded as distance from the accessory carpal bone (cm) so that repeat biopsies were taken from the same anatomic area as the day 0 biopsy while avoiding previous biopsy sites. Limbs were protected with a distal limb bandage for 2 days after taking needle biopsies and after intralesional injections. All needle biopsies were fixed in 10 % formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at a thickness of 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;m, mounted on microscope slides, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. A single histological slide of each biopsy was examined histologically according to a score described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; findings were graded using a semiquantitative four-point scale (0 = normal appearance, 1 = slightly abnormal, 2 = moderately abnormal, and 3 = markedly abnormal) considering the following parameters: fibre structure (0 = linear, no interruption; 3 = short with early truncuation), fibre alignment (0 = regularly ordered; 3 = no pattern identified), morphology of tenocyte nuclei (0 = flat; 3 = round), variations in cell density (0 = uniform; 3 = high regional variation), and vascularisation (0 = absent; 3 = high). Histological sections were independently scored by two observers blinded to horse and treatment modality (FG and ML). In total, five high power fields (40&#x000d7; magnification) per section were examined and scored. Mean averages of score values determined by each observer were calculated for each parameter (see above) before score values of both examiners were averaged.</p><p>Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue sections was used to determine the formation of collagen type I and collagen type III. A commercially available mouse-anti-bovine antibody (NB600-450 anti-COL 1A1, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) and a rabbit-anti-bovine antibody (CL197P anti collagen type III alpha 1 chain, Acris Antibodies GmbH, Herford, Germany) were applied as primary antibodies against collagen type I and collagen type III, respectively. Secondary biotinylated antibodies were obtained from relevant species allowing binding to the primary antibody. Colour production from the chromogen diaminobenzidine tetrachloride was catalysed by streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (avidin-biotin-complex-method) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Finally, the sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. Immunohistochemical cross-reactivity of antibodies with uninjured equine tendon tissue was tested prior to analysis of the needle biopsies. Positive control tissues included bovine aorta and bovine tendon for collagen type I antigen-specific antibodies and bovine skin for collagen type III antigen-specific antibodies. In negative control sections, primary antibodies were replaced by appropriately diluted Balb/c mouse ascites and rabbit serum, respectively.</p><p>Photomicrographs were taken from all immunostained slides (Color View II, 3.3 Megapixel CCD, Soft Imaging System GmbH, M&#x000fc;nster, Germany). Quantitative morphometric analysis of the immunoreaction was achieved by determination of the immunostained area using image analysis software (analySIS&#x000ae; 3.1, Soft Imaging System GmbH, M&#x000fc;nster, Germany). A threshold for a positive signal was defined and the percentage of positively immunostained area in the tissue section as a whole was calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis of data was performed using SAS&#x02122; Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

The assumption of normality was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and visual assessment of qq-plots of model residuals. In the case of rejection of normal distribution, distribution-free nonparametric methods were applied. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was applied to test the differences between groups on each examination day with regard to the parameters of degree of lameness, swelling and skin surface temperature. To compare not-normally distributed parameters within a group between examination days, the permutation test for nonparametric analysis of repeated measurements with the &#x00160;id&#x000e1;k post hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons was used. The influence of groups and time points on ultrasonongraphic parameters (T-CSA, TL-CSA, %T-lesion, TES and T-FAS), histology scores and percentages of positively immunostained areas were tested using a two-way analysis of variance for independent samples (groups) and repeated measurements (dependent time points, biopsies), followed by the Tukey post hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated by analysis of variance components to test inter-observer repeatability of histological scores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Description and history of horses, intralesional injections</title><p>Seventeen limbs of 15 horses between 2 and 19 years old (mean 8.46 years old) met the inclusion criteria.

Transient flattened morphology of tenocyte nuclei and an increased collagen type I expression in ACS-treated tendons over time are indicative of reduced proliferation and increased differentiation of this cell type, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The therapeutic effect of ACS treatment is also demonstrated by an earlier decrease in lameness as compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The history of the horses was suggestive of strain-induced tendinopathy in the majority of tendons treated with either modality. However, it remains unclear whether the effects shown in the current study equally apply to tendinopathies related to other etiologies. Although the reported duration of tendinopathy of up to 2 weeks before first examination (day 0) referred to clinical signs in the present study, subclinical degeneration is known to precede obvious clinical symptoms of strain-induced tendinopathies, especially in equine athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It cannot be excluded that at least some of the tendons on day 0 were not in the inflammatory, but in the early proliferative phase of tendon healing, although neither B-mode ultrasonography nor histology yielded clear evidence of potential chronicity of the tendinopathies. As an alternative, either more extensive tendon biopsies or ultrasonographic tissue characterization as a noninvasive diagnostic tool could have been used initially to further determine the age of the lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>As tendon composition and biomechanical properties may vary significantly between horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] intraindividual controls (control = contralateral limb) are preferred in experimental settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For these reasons, both front limbs of two horses showing clinical signs of bilateral SDFT tendinopathy were included in the ACS group and as controls. Unfortunately, this could not be realised in more horses. Only two out of five clients who agreed to their horse or the respective limb being included as a control accepted an intralesional injection of these control tendons. Thus, the objective to create two separate control groups, one with the lesion left untreated and one with an intralesional saline injection, could not be achieved. Treatment modalities of control groups in clinical and experimental trials may be seen controversially. On the one hand, it is of interest to compare the effect of controlled exercise plus the effect of the substrate injected intralesionally with the effect of controlled exercise alone (= argument against intralesional injection of a control substance into control tendons). On the other hand, the mere puncture and needle decompression of acute tendon defects may have a therapeutic effect independent of the substrate injected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Against that background, it seems preferable to treat control tendons with sham injections to demonstrate the effect of the substrate injected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (ACS in the present case).</p><p>Tendon biopsies were used because clinical assessment of tendon healing and B-mode ultrasonography alone are limited with regard to sensitivity and reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and longitudinal needle biopsies were established in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and equine surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] as minimally invasive and well-tolerated techniques. They allow an insight into tendon architecture as well as the immunohistochemical detection of, for example, collagen type I and III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Disadvantages, however, are the potentially therapeutic, albeit unknown, effect of the biopsy process on tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], their limited reproducibility and the relatively small volume of tendon tissue harvested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>Although mean degree of lameness did not differ between groups, this does not necessarily imply similar functional repair of the lesions, since SDFTs are generally more exposed to maximal load during heavy athletic activities than during trot, i.e. later during rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The observation that, compared to day 0, a significant decrease in lameness occurred earlier in the ACS group, i.e. until day 11, compared to the controls (day 36) may be influenced by effects attributed to ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Detection of lameness in horses with bilateral SDFT lesions may be more challenging than detection of unilateral gait abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It cannot be excluded that the two horses with bilateral SDFT tendinopathy may have shown bilateral lameness or an additional contralateral lameness, respectively, if diagnostic analgesia had been performed.</p><p>Clinical signs of inflammation were monitored using semiquantitative clinical score systems which may be subject to some inaccuracy. This could have been improved by the use of computerized gait analysis, thermography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and measurements of the metacarpal circumference in combination with ultrasonography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. None of the inflammatory signs, including swelling, differed between groups, but palpable swelling decreased significantly within the ACS group between days 50 and 78 in contrast to controls. On the one hand this may be attributed to auto- and paracrine effects of ACS on endogenous growth factor expression, since in a rodent Achilles tendon transection model bFGF expression was enhanced but not before 8 weeks, i.e. delayed after ACS injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On the other hand controlled exercise exerted anti-inflammatory effects on tendons from both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] which did not, however, lead to a significant decrease in swelling in controls.</p><p>The decrease of palpable swelling in the ACS group between days 50 and 78 correlates positively with the ultrasonographic finding that TL-CSA and %T-lesion decreased only in the ACS group between before treatment and day 78. T-CSA, however, remained unchanged throughout the entire observation period in both groups. This proves that the decrease in swelling in the ACS group rather reflects a decrease in cutaneous, subcutaneous and peritendinous swelling than an altered tendon thickness in the late proliferation and early remodelling phase (i.e. until around day 45). This may be due to a therapeutic effect of inadvertent reflux of small volumes of ACS into the subcutis during intralesional injection. Ultrasonographic measurements of extratendinous swelling are challenging and were not included in the present study, although they could have been helpful to further confirm findings of palpation. In contrast to the results of this study, rat Achilles tendons showed an increase in tendon thickness after ACS treatment compared to the control tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, comparability is limited since the rat tendons, in contrast to the present study, were sutured and received three treatments of ACS.</p><p>The present study shows that, compared to control tendons, a single intralesional injection of ACS leads to a significant reduction of %T-lesion and an increase in echogenicity (TES) 78 and 106 days after treatment. This finding corresponds to an earlier (until day 22) increase in TES and an earlier (until day 78) increase of the percentage in parallel orientated fibre bundles (T-FAS) in the ACS group compared to controls. These effects could be the result of stimulation of repair tissue, i.e. improved fibrillogenesis in the early proliferative phase of tendon healing (4&#x02013;45 days after injury) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] in which most horses were presented and treated. This may have been a consequence of the potential IL-1Ra-mediated anti-inflammatory action which is attributed to ACS by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], although IL-1Ra concentrations in ACS were not determined in the present study. Another potential pathway may be the supplementation of growth factors, such as IGF-1 and TGF-&#x003b2;, which are supposed to be increased in equine ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. IGF-1 is known to be decreased for approximately 2 weeks in experimentally induced tendinopathy and a beneficial bolstering effect of exogenous IGF-1 on low endogenous IGF-1 production during the early repair phase of tendinopathy has been hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. ACS has been shown to display significant effects on the endogenous expression of growth factors potentially via auto- and paracrine pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It remains unclear why the significant differences between groups with regard to %T-lesion and TES were not consistent until the end of the observation period despite tendencies to significance. This may be attributed to a time-limited effect of ACS (see above). Ultrasonographic tissue characterization has been established in recent years as a more precise alternative to B-mode ultrasonography to monitor the process of tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], particularly if only a probe with a relatively low resolution is available as in the present study.</p><p>With regard to histologic scores, a difference between groups was seen at day 36. Here, cell nuclei were flattened in the ACS group compared to controls, which is suggestive of decreased tenocyte proliferation in the late proliferative phase (4&#x02013;45 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] as a response to the ACS injection. In agreement with this, it has been shown that tendon fibroblasts with a spindle-shaped nucleus have reduced apoptotic and proliferative indices, as demonstrated in human patellar tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A consequence might be a decreased cellular production of inelastic collagen type III, which has been described to peak between 3 to 6 weeks after injury in equine experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, immunohistochemistry in the present study revealed no difference of collagen type III expression between groups which might be due to considerable variations of different types of collagen between individual lesions, as described for naturally developed lesions in horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>The more favourable development of collagen type I expression in the ACS group between days 36 and 190 indicates qualitative improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], such as increased tensile strength of the repair tissue in the remodelling or maturation phase (45&#x02013;120 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which is potentially caused by the mechanisms mentioned, i.e. an IL-1Ra-mediated anti-inflammatory mechanism or the supplementation of growth factors, such as IGF-1 and TGF-&#x003b2;. Collagen type I was seen to be elevated for 6 months after injury in equine experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This rather reflects the progress in control tendons of the present study and correlates with previous findings in naturally injured equine tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In contrast to an experimental Achilles tendinopathy model using ACS-treated rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], no difference in collagen type I expression was detected between groups in the present study. However, rat Achilles tendons were treated three times at 24-hour intervals with the first injection 24 hours after induction of the lesion, i.e. in the acute inflammatory phase of tendon healing. By contrast, tendons in the present study received only a single intralesional injection of ACS up to 14 days after the onset of clinical symptoms, i.e. mostly at the end of or even after the acute inflammatory phase. In the latter investigation, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used, which allows quantification of mRNA transcription of different collagen types, provided that enough tissue is available. Cytokines such as IL-1Ra and the growth factors IGF-1 and TGF-&#x003b2; have a short half-life and they may be degraded and consumed within a short time period after exogenous application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, tendon healing may not only be enhanced by direct binding of cytokines and growth factors to cell surface receptors, but also due to indirect effects by stimulation of endogenous production of growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Therefore, the effect of ACS is potentially enhanced by several consecutive injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], as reported anecdotally to be common in equine practice and as recommended for the treatment of joint pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A single ACS injection was chosen to determine the effect of a low dose as a basis for research because, to date, neither dose-dependent in vivo studies nor a consensus on the treatment protocol are available for blood products such as ACS. Another aim was to keep the number of factors influencing outcome, such as repeated needle puncture of tendons, as low as possible.</p><p>The increase in collagen I expression after ACS injection in an experimental rat study did not coincide with an improved maximum load to failure, despite leading to an improvement in tendon stiffness during biomechanical testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although biomechanical testing is regarded as the method of choice, it could not be accomplished in the present study due to the inclusion of client-owned horses. In general, the degree of lameness and, to a limited extent, the echo pattern of the injured tendon reflect biomechanical properties. These parameters, however, did not significantly differ between groups in the present study at the end of the observation period. Due to the reduced group size, differences in long-term recurrence rate after return of the horses to full exercise could not be calculated statistically.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This clinical trial in horses with acute tendinopathies of the SDFT shows that a single intralesional ACS injection contributes to significant reduction of lameness within 10 days and to improvement of ultrasonographic parameters of repair tissue between 11 and 23 weeks after treatment. Intralesional ACS treatment potentially decreases proliferation of tenocytes 5 weeks after treatment and increases their differentiation, as demonstrated by an elevated collagen type I expression in the remodelling phase. Repeated ACS injections should be considered to enhance positive effects. Future controlled long-term investigations should be performed in a larger number of horses to determine the effect on recurrence rate.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>%T-lesion</term><def><p>Percent total lesion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACS</term><def><p>Autologous conditioned serum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>bFGF</term><def><p>Basic fibroblast growth factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGF-1</term><def><p>Insulin-like growth factor-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL</term><def><p>Interleukin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-1Ra</term><def><p>Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIZ</term><def><p>Maximal injury zone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSC</term><def><p>Mesenchymal stem cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDFT</term><def><p>Superficial digital flexor tendon</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T-CSA</term><def><p>Total cross-sectional area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TES</term><def><p>Total echo score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T-FAS</term><def><p>Total fibre alignment score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGF-&#x003b2;</term><def><p>Transforming growth factor-beta</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TL-CSA</term><def><p>Total lesion cross-sectional area</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>FG had the idea of performing the study, designed the study and co-ordinated it.
