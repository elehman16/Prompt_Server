The involved wrist counteracted this flexion force by actively extending against resistance. The amount of force applied was the maximum load tolerated for 3 sets of 15 repetitions daily. The participants were warned that the exercises would be quite painful. They met with the therapist twice a week for the first 2 weeks, then once per week for 12 weeks. They were instructed to apply more force as pain tolerance improved. No other treatments were administered by the therapist, and participants were asked to stop any other treatments for their condition.
