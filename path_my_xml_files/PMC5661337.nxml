Hospitalized neonates experience on an average of 14 painful procedures during the first 2 weeks of life.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is known that respiratory support and related procedures, such as endotracheal suctioning in neonates, provoke pain. Research has shown that preterm neonates respond intensively to pain as compared with term neonates.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Procedural pain in neonates can be controlled by nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods. Nonpharmacological methods used to relieve procedural pain have short-term impact and are easily tolerated.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Although nonpharmacologic interventions have given promising results in various routine procedures, their role in relieving the pain associated with suctioning in ventilated preterm neonates is still under scrutiny. To control procedural pain, medications such as fentanyl and morphine are being used; however, the use of drugs is not without risk and may cause symptoms such as respiratory depression, nausea, seizures, and physiological dependence.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] These side effects may deter the clinician from using them routinely for procedural pain relief.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hence, this study was conducted to compare the efficacy of various nonpharmacologic (Expressed breast milk [EBM], swaddling, and sucrose) means to relieve the procedural pain associated with suctioning in preterm neonates on assisted ventilation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was carried out from March to August 2016 after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee.

</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Methodology</title><p>We conducted the study in two phases. In the first phase of the study, we assessed whether suctioning in preterm neonates on assisted ventilation was a painful procedure. After demonstrating that suctioning was associated with pain, in the second phase of the study, we evaluated the comparative efficacy of EBM, swaddling, and sucrose in alleviating pain during suctioning in preterm neonates on assisted ventilation.</p><p>Preterm neonates on assisted ventilation requiring suctioning were enrolled for the study. Pain assessment was performed using the premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Before commencement of phase 1 of the study, all senior residents were trained to assess need for suctioning and pain evaluation using the PIPP score, in preterm neonates on assisted ventilation. All senior residents were certified for competency in the above by the senior faculty.</p><p>The components of PIPP score include gestational age, behavioral state, vital parameters (heart rate, oxygen saturation), and facial characteristics as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="A1">Annexure 1</xref>. The weight was recorded on an electronic infant weighing scale with an accuracy of &#x000b1;1 g. Gestational age was calculated using the date of last menstrual period and first trimester ultrasonography. In case of discrepancy, New Ballard Score was considered definitive for gestational age assessment. The behavioral state of the neonate was assessed by observing the neonate's activity, status of eyes (open or closed), and facial movements. The heart rate and oxygen saturation were recorded using the Masimo pulse oximeter (model radical 7) with signal extraction technology. Facial characteristics were assessed using video recording (Panasonic high-definition camcorder, model HDC-HS9, Osaka, Japan) done during the procedure of suctioning. For all age groups, a total score &#x0003c;6 indicates minimal/no pain while a score &#x02265;12 indicates moderate to severe pain. The suctioning was performed by two senior residents and simultaneous video recording was done by the investigator.</p><p>In the second phase of the study, the effect of EBM, swaddling, and sucrose on pain relief during suctioning in preterm neonates on assisted ventilation was assessed. A trained senior resident assessed the need to do suctioning in preterm neonates on assisted ventilation as per unit protocol. The procedure of suctioning was carried out only when needed by the neonate and no procedure was done only for the purpose of the study.</p><p>The suctioning episodes in neonates on assisted ventilation were randomized to receive either EBM (Group 1) or swaddling (Group 2) or sucrose (Group 3) by a computer-generated randomization sequence. Randomization was done in variable random blocks of three or six. Treatment allocations were inserted in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes and were sealed. Just before suctioning, a senior resident opened the sequentially numbered envelope and allocated the group. An eligible neonate requiring suctioning could be enrolled more than once and each individual suctioning episode was randomized. In Group 1, 2cc EBM was administered to the neonate 2 min before suctioning. In Group 2, the neonate was swaddled for 10&#x02013;15 min before suctioning while in Group 3, 2cc sucrose was administered to the neonate for 2 min before suctioning. After demonstrating that suctioning is indeed a very painful procedure in phase 1 of the study, it was deemed ethically unacceptable to include a no-intervention control group based on the evidence that exposure of preterm infants to pain procedures without treatment is harmful. The suctioning was performed by two senior residents and simultaneous video recording using Panasonic high-definition camcorder (model HDC-HS9, Osaka, Japan) was done by the investigator.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Sample size calculations</title><p>Sample size for the first phase of the study was calculated using formula for hypothesis of one sample mean.

These findings should be interpreted with caution as the sample size for subgroup analysis was inadequate and the study was not powered to conclude the efficacy in subgroups.</p><p>There is enough literature to describe the efficacy of nonpharmacological means such as breastfeeding, administration of EBM, swaddling, Kangaroo Mother Care, facilitated tucking as well as pharmacological interventions such as administration of fentanyl and morphine during various procedures performed in NICU such as heel prick, intravenous cannulation, and removal of adhesives.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Recently published studies demonstrated the effectiveness of EBM in providing pain relief during heel lancing and venipuncture.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In a Cochrane review that assessed the impact of breastfeeding or breast milk for procedural pain, it was noted that neonates in the breastfeeding group had statistically significant less increase in the heart rate, reduced duration of crying during procedure compared to swaddled group, or pacifier group.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Swaddling as an effective nonpharmacological measure to alleviate pain during heel lancing is also well studied; however, evidence for its effectiveness as a pain-relieving measure during suctioning is lacking.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Simonse <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the efficacy of sucrose in reducing pain in neonates associated with heel lancing.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, there is scarcity of data for interventions to relieve the pain associated with suctioning.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A recent study evaluated the effect of facilitated tucking on pain relief during endotracheal suctioning in preterm neonates using the PIPP score.
