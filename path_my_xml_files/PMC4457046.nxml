Numerous studies have confirmed that medical students can improve their skills and achieve proficiency through simulation training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Ureteroscopy and cystoscopy are essential for the diagnosis and therapy of urological diseases, and repeated hands-on training and standardized learning are necessary for mastering the skills required. However, due to ethical and fiscal concerns, traditional hands-on training of new practitioners with patients has been supplanted by methods that rely on endourological simulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Both virtual and physical ureteroscopic and cystoscopic simulators have been created, and their value for training new students in the required surgical skills has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Virtual models include the virtual-reality simulator for ureteroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the virtual reality endourological simulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the popularity of virtual models is limited by their high cost and the lack of haptic feedback for the trainee that is provided by physical simulators and clinical experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Current physical simulators are primarily bench models, such as the Uro-Scopic Trainer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the adult ureteroscopy and renoscopy simulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the relative fidelity of these simulators, novices often report that they cannot successfully relate the computer display to actual conditions encountered during surgery. The disparity between the simulated experience and reality encountered in clinical practice translates into greater risk of surgical error and a longer training period.</p><p>It seems logical that simulators fabricated from transparent material could help alleviate the shortcomings of the training methods described above. A transparent model could allow trainees to more readily observe and correct their errors during the course of training and self-evaluate their skills. To test this theory, we designed and fabricated both transparent and non-transparent ureteroscopy and cystoscopy simulators between October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014. The present randomized, controlled trial study investigated the relative viability of these simulators as endourological training tools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physiological parameters</title><p>The physical dimensions of the simulator were chosen to conform to normal adult human anatomy (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Each recruited student verbally consented to participate in the study and signed a consent form. All students attended the same 1-day didactic lecture given by an endourologist, and two six-hour&#x000a0;days of video instruction encompassing genitourinary anatomy, cystoscopy, ureteroscopy and ureteroscopic procedures, ureteral stent insertion and removal by transurethral cystoscopy and stone extraction by transurethral cystoscopy or ureteroscopy. A 50-point examination paper designed by the endourologist lecturer and based on the course content was administered to test the students&#x02019; theoretical knowledge the next day. The examination paper consisted of 50 multiple-choice questions, and each question on the exam had just one right answer.</p><p>The day after the exam, students were randomly assigned to three groups. Random assignment was conducted using a random number table, and each group had 12 participants. Students used the transparent simulator in the experimental group (Group 1) and the non-transparent simulator in the experimental control group (Group 2). Within each group, students were further separated into working pairs, with one student operating and the other assisting. Under the supervision of an experienced instructor, students repeatedly practiced cystoscopy, guidewire insertion, ureteral stent insertion and removal, ureteroscopy and stone extraction using the simulator. Each 2-person team spent approximately one hour per day training on the simulator. In both groups, each student participated in 12 one-hour training sessions.

The control group was taught by an experienced instructor in the field of cystoscopy and ureteroscopy. The total instruction time for Group 3 was equal to the hands-on training time of the experimental groups, but no hands-on training was conducted.</p><p>During the training period, a student-centered educational approach was emphasized. The students themselves planned and managed their own learning. The instructors were responsible for finding and correcting the students&#x02019; errors, as well as answering the trainees&#x02019; questions.

The reasons for this deficit include fiscal constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], lack of clinical training positions, a rapidly increasing number of medical students and intense doctor-patient conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Consequently, the opportunities for undergraduates or postgraduates to participate in programs for the training of clinical skills are severely limited, and junior doctors complete their training without becoming sufficiently acquainted with surgical procedures.</p><p>Much research has been conducted seeking effective methods of improving operational skill training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many of these studies have concluded that the development of improved training simulators and simulation training programs are promising methods for improving access to hands-on clinical skills training. However, Matsumoto <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] conducted a study comparing a low fidelity endourological bench simulator with a high fidelity model, with regard to the endourological proficiency of trainees. The low fidelity simulator was assembled from a Penrose drain (urethra), an inverted Styrofoam cup (bladder), molded latex and two embedded drinking straws (ureters). The investigators concluded that novices trained on the two simulators achieved a similar level of skill improvement, and that the key to the design of bench models was the identification of essential constructs rather than the accurate representation of anatomy.</p><p>Furthermore, Chou <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] concluded that a virtual reality simulator was as effective as a bench simulator for teaching basic ureteroscopy skills to inexperienced trainees. The virtual reality simulator would also eliminate recurring costs, require minimal instructor input and could drastically reduce training costs once the initial training protocol was established. Shashikant <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] compared the use of a live porcine model with a virtual reality simulator and determined that the overall usefulness of the models were similar. Endourological training using a live porcine model was found to be more realistic, but the virtual model was more feasible for repetitive tasking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the advantages of virtual simulators, they lack haptic feedback and trainees report that they do not always effectively simulate the actual conditions encountered during surgery.</p><p>To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted that investigate the effectiveness of transparent simulators for training endourological skills. This study reports the relative effectiveness of using transparent anatomic models compared with non-transparent models for teaching proper ureteroscopic and cystoscopic techniques.</p><p>In the preliminary evaluation, we recruited 10 urologists to evaluate the simulators. The urologists determined that the simulators were anatomically accurate, easy to use and could potentially serve as ideal training devices.</p><p>We then recruited 36 first-year medical students who were given training with the transparent simulator (Group 1), the opaque simulator (Group 2) or no practical training (Group 3). The groups received identical initial instruction by an expert lecturer and subject matter videos. There were no significant differences among the three groups in their theoretical knowledge, according to the results of a 50-point exam given at the conclusion of the instruction. Consequently, the significant differences in performance scores of the three groups at the conclusion of simulator training indicated that, compared with verbal instruction alone, both transparent and non-transparent simulator training resulted in higher cystoscopy and ureteroscopy proficiency. Furthermore, the transparent simulator was more effective in training endoscopy techniques than the opaque simulator. Our results are consistent with those reported by other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The main factor contributing to the significant difference in procedural skills between students trained with the transparent and opaque models was likely the ability of the former to observe internal anatomical structure and the various procedural stages while training. The use of optically transparent materials was key to the success of the simulator, because it provides immediate visual feedback for the trainee during the procedure. The transparent model enhances and reinforces the trainee&#x02019;s recall of the surgical approach, and errors are immediately apparent that would be concealed by an opaque device. Additionally, the use of transparent materials permits the tutor to better observe the operation and provide students with immediate and relevant feedback.</p><p>A potential concern regarding the transparent simulator may be that transparent materials are prohibitively more costly. However, this is not the case. Optically transparent materials are widely used industrially and in daily life, and the cost of these materials is no more expensive than that of any common plastic. The acrylic used to manufacture our device cost&#x02009;~&#x02009;$60 per kilogram, whereas the common opaque plastic ABS resin that might have been used to manufacture an equivalent opaque device costs&#x02009;~&#x02009;$50 per kilogram. The discrepancy between the prices of the transparent and the non-transparent materials in the manufacture of each simulator is almost negligible.</p><p>A number of limitations of the present study should be considered. The differences between the no training and model-based training groups were relatively small, and the scores of the intervention groups were not high. The relatively low scores may have been due to insufficient training time and trainee unfamiliarity with the examination simulator; therefore, a longer training period and increased trainee familiarity with the commercial simulator might have improved scores. However, whether increased training time and trainee familiarity with the simulator would have increased or decreased the differences between the different trainee groups requires further investigation. Additionally, the silicone rubber used to fabricate the model was not perfectly transparent. It is possible that improved transparency of the training simulator could further improve the final assessment of procedural skills. Therefore, future devices may make use of other materials, such as hydrogels, that have better transparency. Finally, our study does not address whether the tutors were satisfied with the transparent simulator as a teaching tool. Yet, there is no denying that the instrument was helpful for the trainees. In view of these limitations, additional studies should be conducted, including studies that extend training time, explore the use of different transparent materials and evaluate the efficacy of the simulator from a teaching perspective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of a model simulator allowed trainees to achieve higher ureteroscopy and cystoscopy proficiency compared with verbal instruction alone, and the transparent simulator was more effective than the non-transparent device.
