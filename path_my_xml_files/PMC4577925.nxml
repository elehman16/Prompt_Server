The standard treatment for this condition is panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). This laser treatment is inherently destructive, with predictable adverse effects on visual function, and a safer alternative is required. Intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors can induce short-term regression of retinal neovascularisation. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to determine the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of intravitreal aflibercept, an inhibitor of VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PLGF), in PDR, and to investigate the impact on local oxygenation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a phase IIb randomised controlled single-masked multicentre clinical trial to determine the impact of repeated intravitreal aflibercept injections in the treatment and prevention of PDR. 220 participants with treatment-na&#x000ef;ve or treated but active retinal neovascularisation in at least one eye will be randomly allocated 1:1 to intravitreal aflibercept injections or PRP for a period of 52&#x02005;weeks. The primary outcome is the change in best-corrected visual acuity in the study eye at 52&#x02005;weeks. Secondary outcomes include changes from baseline in other visual functions, anatomical changes and cost-effectiveness. Ocular and non-ocular adverse events will also be reported over 52&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has been approved by the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) committee with respect to scientific content and compliance with applicable research and human subjects&#x02019; regulations. Findings will be reported through scientific publications and research conferences. The results of this study will provide clinical evidence for the feasibility, efficacy safety and cost-effectiveness of intravitreal aflibercept for PDR.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN 32207582.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common complication of diabetes and is caused by progressive damage to the retinal blood vessels with increasing duration of diabetes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The two major sight-threatening complications of DR are diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> PDR is characterised by growth of new blood vessels that can cause severe sight loss as a result of vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment and neovascular glaucoma (NVG).</p><p>Multiple molecular mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of DR. However, a final common pathway involves retinal hypoxia and consequent upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, treatment options for PDR aim either to promote retinal oxygen availability or to inhibit VEGF. Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is applied to the peripheral retinal tissue to ablate areas of the peripheral retina and thereby reduce retinal oxygen consumption.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Increased oxygen availability in an unlasered retina downregulates VEGF production, inducing regression of retinal neovascularisation (NV). However, PRP-induced regression of new vessels is variable, and although timely PRP can protect visual acuity, serious adverse effects are common.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The development or worsening of pre-existing macular oedema causes vision loss in 13%. In addition, loss of peripheral vision, night vision or contrast sensitivity affects nearly 5%. Non-responders and severe cases may also require vitrectomy. Nine-month follow-up of 209 eyes with PDR treated with PRP in the National Health Service (NHS) showed that 46% did not reach the driving standard, of whom 13% had a poor visual acuity outcome of &#x02264;6/60 Snellen.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> An alternative treatment option that could either obviate or delay the need for PRP treatment for PDR would therefore be desirable.</p><p>Novel intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies including aflibercept, ranibizumab and bevacizumab have substantially improved the treatment prognosis for a wide range of ocular diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, DMO and retinal vein occlusions. Anti-VEGF treatment has superseded macular laser treatment and is now the standard of care for DMO involving the central macula <italic>(</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk">http://www.nice.org.uk</ext-link><italic>).</italic> Several clinical and preclinical studies indicate that VEGF is a key mediator in the development of retinal NV. Injection of VEGF into the eye of a non-human primate stimulates growth and permeability of new vessels on the retina, simulating PDR, and also induces NVG.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> There is also clear evidence that hypoxic retina produces VEGF.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Levels of VEGF mRNA and protein are elevated in a manner that is spatially and temporally consistent with the role for VEGF in the growth of new vessels.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> VEGF levels are highest in ocular fluid in patients with PDR compared with other retinal diseases.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Evidence in support of a direct role of anti-VEGF agents blocking retinal new vessel growth has also been reported using a soluble VEGF receptor, anti-VEGF aptamers and VEGFR1-neutralising antisera.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Recent evidence also indicates that monthly anti-VEGF treatment can reduce the severity and delay the progression of DR over 24&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Several case series using different anti-VEGF agents have shown that anti-VEGF therapy is effective in causing transient regression of retinal NV in PDR.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The impact of this treatment on visual function and the effects of these agents on retinal NV compared with PRP remain unclear. It is possible that a long-acting anti-VEGF agent such as aflibercept may be sufficient to preclude the need for laser treatment as long as the eye continues to receive the treatment. Accordingly, we need to investigate this further by conducting a robust multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of repeated intravitreal aflibercept relative to PRP in treating and preventing the recurrence of PDR.</p><p>Currently, there are two multicentre trials evaluating the efficacy of ranibizumab in PDR (clinicaltrials.gov). However, these studies are including only participants previously untreated with high-risk PDR, a group that is less prevalent in the UK owing to the relatively prompt managment of early PDR identified by the nationwide screening programmes. Furthermore, these trials exclude cases that have been partially treated or are poorly responsive to prior laser therapy. The aim of the proposed study is to determine the impact of anti-VEGF therapy in a typical UK patient cohort with PDR. A mechanistic substudy will further explore the pathogenesis of PDR in terms of whether repeated intravitreal aflibercept retards the progression of PDR by (1) causing regression of retinal NV, (2) improving oxygen saturation within retinal vessels and (3) reducing quantifiable areas of retinal non-perfusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a phase IIb randomised controlled single-masked multicentre clinical trial that will test the non-inferiority of intravitreal aflibercept to the standard of care of PRP on 220 participants with PDR at 52&#x02005;weeks. Forty willing participants (20 in each arm) will also undergo retinal oximetry as part of the mechanistic substudy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008405F1">figure 1</xref> for the trial flow diagram).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008405F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The trial design showing the assessments in each arm (CTU, Clinical Trials Unit).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008405f01"/></fig><p>Inclusion criteria:

The primary outcome is the change in BCVA measured as the ETDRS letter score from baseline to 52&#x02005;weeks.

This helps ensure that aflibercept is superior to observation alone in the event that it is found to be non-inferior to PRP. Therefore, in the wider patient population, if aflibercept is no more than five letters worse, then it will be defined to be non-inferior. The sample size is based on providing a 95% CI for the between-arm difference in mean change in visual acuity that will be sufficiently narrow to detect non-inferiority (by the CI lying entirely above the margin) with high power, while keeping a false declaration of non-inferiority to 5% through use of a statistical test applied at the two-sided 5% level of significance.</p><p>The SD of the change in visual acuity, after adjustment for baseline, is anticipated to be 10.3, based on the estimate from a relevant trial.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>With 110 patients randomised per arm (total 220), 182 will be followed up to the 52-week outcome (allowing for a 17% dropout or per protocol (PP) exclusion).

The primary outcome will be compared between arms primarily at the 52-week point and secondarily at the 12-week point using a linear mixed effects model with patient as a random effect to allow for within-patient correlation of repeated measures over time. The fixed effects will consist of the baseline of the outcome using the missing indicator method and any remaining minimisation stratifiers, including study site. These will be included as main effects and interactions with times. The test for non-inferiority will be one-sided at the 2.5% significance level, and presented as an estimated effect with a two-sided 95% CI compared with the non-inferiority margin.</p><p>For the analysis of the primary outcome, the mixed effects model will be refitted in a reduced PP population, excluding patients found to be ineligible at entry, and those not receiving the full randomised treatment up to and including the 8-week visit (whether due to discontinuation, exclusion or other reason for missing a randomised treatment in this period). Non-inferiority will only be concluded if this is declared by both the ITT analysis and the PP analysis at 52&#x02005;weeks. Non-inferiority will also be assessed in ITT and PP populations at 12&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Secondary outcome analysis</title><p>Secondary outcome analyses will be on an ITT basis only, and assessed with tests at the two-sided 5% level of significance. Continuous outcomes will be compared between arms using a linear mixed effects model, as specified for the primary outcome ITT analysis. Continuous and binary outcomes will be reported as differences in proportions assessed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. All tests will be two-sided at the 5% significance level and interpreted cautiously with a focus on interpreting effect sizes with 95% CIs. Safety outcomes will be reported as unadjusted patient proportions and rates within and between arms with 95% CIs using exact methods where appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Sensitivity and other planned analyses</title><p>Sensitivity to the missing at random assumption made in the primary outcome analysis will be undertaken to assess sensitivity to the handling of the missing 52-week data, and to the use of concomitant treatments, and will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.</p><p>If non-inferiority is concluded, superiority will be assessed, and also the effect on the primary outcome will be presented with 95% CI within baseline retinopathy status subgroups: na&#x000ef;ve PDR and non-na&#x000ef;ve PDR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethical issues</title><p>The main ethical issues in relation to this study are the use of intravitreal injections. However, this is now the standard of care for wet age-related macular degeneration, DMO and retinal vein occlusion. There are at least five extra visits that the participants need to undergo in excess of the standard of care. The precise risks and benefits of participating in the clinical study will be outlined in patient information sheets, formulated with service user involvement.</p><p>Participants in the mechanistic substudy have to undergo retinal oximetry, an additional non-invasive imaging of the retina at baseline, as well as at 12 and 52&#x02005;weeks and at the point of withdrawal. There are no known risks for retinal oximetry.</p><p>Participants will be treated with the standard of care (PRP) if the disease recurs after they have completed the study. This information is reflected in the patient information sheet.</p><p>Any breach of confidentiality will be minimised by adherence to the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and the approved protocol. <bold>T</bold>he trial will be employing an electronic data capture system (Infermed MACRO). Access to the system will be restricted to authorised site personnel.</p><p>Aflibercept will be delivered in exactly the same dose and formulation as notified in the marketing authorisation for wet age-related macular degeneration and macular oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion. All adverse events will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) throughout the study regardless of their severity or relation to study participation.</p><p>The protocol is approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee London&#x02014;South East (14/LO/0203). The chief investigator will submit an annual report of all SAEs to the Sponsor, and the Research Ethics Committee and the MHRA. The Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will be provided listings of all SAEs on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The study may be prematurely discontinued on the basis of new safety information, or for other reasons given by the DMEC and/or Trial Steering Committee (TSC), Sponsor or Research Ethics Committee concerned.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Dissemination plan</title><p>The research will be published in high-impact ophthalmology and diabetes journals and presented in scientific meetings in the retinal section in ophthalmology. We also plan to present in key conferences on diabetes. Each participant will receive a summary of the results and discussion.
