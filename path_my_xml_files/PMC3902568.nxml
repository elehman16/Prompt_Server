It has been estimated that 40-50% of patients admitted to the ICU in Europe and USA present some degree of malnutrition,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] a proportion that is not much different in Colombia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] There is strong evidence suggesting malnutrition is associated with increased rates of complications,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in the same way as obesity has been related to worse prognosis in critically ill patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Energy requirements have been estimated using formulas derived from healthy individuals,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] generating controversy about their applicability in critically ill patients. High patient heterogeneity (surgical, medical, immunosuppressed, and polytraumatized patients), as well as diversity in stress related factors add to the problem of determining precise requirements which are changing with the patient's conditions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The major metabolic alteration in the acutely and critically ill patient is a hypercatabolic state, with increased protein breakdown and decreased muscle protein synthesis, which lead to increased excretion of nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and creatinine. Increased metabolic rate, fever, hyperglycemia, amino acid, and free fatty acid mobilization contribute to a net negative nitrogen balance, which, if prolonged, is detrimental for the patient.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Nutritional therapy recommendations in the ICU are different in the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN)[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN)[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] guidelines, which increases uncertainty in clinical practice.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] There is a lack of evidence of when to start nutrition therapy, as well as to the amount of calories needed. Based on the 2007 ESPEN guidelines for enteral nutrition in intensive care, enteral nutritional support should be initiated in all patients not expected to be on a full oral diet within 3 days (grade C of recommendation).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, also based on expert opinion, the amount of nutrition delivered during the acute phase of critical illness should not exceed 20-25 kcal/kg/day, as this might be associated with a less favorable outcome. In addition, during the recovery phase, patients should receive a total of 25-30 kcal/kg/day.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>As a result, appropriate nutritional regimen includes assessment of the risk of overfeeding as well as underfeeding of the critically ill patient. Observational studies have shown deleterious clinical outcomes associated with overfeeding, especially with parenteral nutrition.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Likewise, the major disadvantage of enteral nutrition is the risk of underfeeding, which has also been associated with increased mortality[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and higher risk of bacteremia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Pati&#x000f1;o <italic>et al</italic>., studied the use of a high protein, hypocaloric parenteral nutrition for critically ill patients (glucose 150-200 g/day and protein 1.5-2 g/kg/day) instead of a high glucose load regimen. Their observations suggested that this kind of strategy is more physiologic and beneficial to overcome the initial phase of the critically illness, avoiding the increase in the stress-related hyperglycemia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] There is also a recent observational study that concludes that higher provision of protein and amino acids correlates with decreased mortality in critically ill patients, even after adjusting for baseline prognostic variables as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Different studies have shown a relationship between multiple organ dysfunction, morbidity and mortality in the ICU setting,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the importance of organ dysfunction scoring systems as prognostic predictors. SOFA score[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] is an objective and relatively simple surveillance instrument. It assesses six organ systems (cardiovascular, renal, central nervous system, hematological, liver, and respiratory); assigning a 4-level scale of organ dysfunction for each organ system, which are then aggregated; higher scores represent higher dysfunction. There is a positive correlation between total maximum SOFA score and mortality in critically ill patients.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Delta SOFA, the change in total SOFA score at 48 and 96 h, as compared to admission score, has shown to be a good predictor of patient outcome, including mortality.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The objective of this study was to compare two enteral nutritional regimens in the critically ill patient, and their impact in the development of severe organic failure, as measured with the SOFA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Study population</title><p>This randomized, double blind clinical trial was performed at the 30-bed ICU of a tertiary-level university hospital in Bogota, Colombia. Patients were recruited during the 12-month period between August 2011 and July 2012. Study population consisted of adult patients (18 years or older) admitted in the ICU, who were expected to require enteral nutrition through nasoenteric tube for at least 96 h. Patients that had received previous nutritional support were excluded, as were patients that received concomitant parenteral nutrition, pregnant women, patients in transplantation program, those with contraindications for enteral nutrition, chronic renal failure, uremic encephalopathy, diabetes, morbid obesity, or do-not-resuscitate orders on admission.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization was performed using dark sealed envelopes with computer-generated random allocations. Only patients who completed 96 h of follow-up were considered for the analysis; patients who did not fulfill the follow-up period were excluded, and the envelope was returned to the sequence for patient replacement, until completion of the sample size (40 in each group). Study patients were prospectively followed-up until they were discharged from ICU, completed a follow-up of 21 days, or died, whichever occurred first. Only one of the members of the team (JDR) knew patient allocation, prescribed the formulations, and supervised the administration of the regimens; but ICU staff, who decided on daily care patient, was blind to patient allocation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients were allocated to two groups. The intervention group received hyperproteic hypocaloric enteral nutrition, defined as a goal of 15 kcal/kg/day, with more than 1.5 g of protein per kg of body weight. Control group received standard nutritional regimen with a goal of 25 kcal/kg/day. To achieve this goal we used an enteral formula in continuous feeding for both groups; the composition of the formula is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. To reach the protein goal, the study group regimen was enriched with additional protein modules, based on soy protein diluted in water and administered in two daily boluses [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Patients in the study group received hyperproteic regimen until day 7, if they needed any further enteral nutrition they were switched to standard nutritional regimen with a goal of 25 kcal/kg/day without protein boluses.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Composition of enteral nutritional used in both groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCCM-17-343-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Composition of the soy protein preparation used in the intervention group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCCM-17-343-g002"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Endpoints</title><p>SOFA score was measured at randomization (baseline) and then every 48 h.

Postoperative ileus and reintervention procedures with contraindication for enteral feeding were other reasons for not including surgical patients. Two-thirds of our patients had respiratory or central nervous system (CNS) indication for ICU admission. They were predominantly male and had, on average, a body mass index (BMI) in normal range.</p><p>Despite different prescriptions, the total amount of calories administered were similar in both groups (12 kcal/kg in the intervention group vs 14 kcal/kg in the control group). In the intervention group, however, 40% of total calories were from protein intake (30% from carbohydrates), while in the control group 20% of calories were from proteic origin (and 55% from carbohydrates). Both groups ended up with a caloric debt because the planned caloric goals (15 kcal/kg for the intervention group vs 25 kcal/kg for the control group) were not finally administered. We estimated the caloric debt in 17% in the intervention group and 40% in the control group. This difference is explained by variations in infusion speed as well as interruptions throughout the day. The intervention group was closer to the goal perhaps because the caloric intake was administered by exogenous protein boluses in addition to continuous enteral nutrition. Proteic delivery was significantly different in both groups (1.4 vs 0.76 g/kg <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.0001). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref> shows the primary and secondary outcomes.</p><p>Both our primary outcome, the delta SOFA at 48 hours and the number of hyperglicemic events showed statistically significant differences.

No hypoglycemic episodes, soy protein intolerance, or renal failure were reported in our sample.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Primary outcome (delta SOFA) and all secondary outcomes of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCCM-17-343-g005"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results suggest that hyperproteic hypocaloric enteral nutrition is associated with reduced risk of multiple organ failure. The loss of lean body mass during acute illness is well-known and has been associated with poor clinical outcomes;[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] the functional recovery after ICU discharge depends on the residual lean body mass. The objectives of nutritional support therapy are to overcome the acute catabolic phase, and to ameliorate the loss of body nitrogen, preserving rather than increasing the lean body mass. No precise method in clinical practice is available to determine the maximum acceptable loss of lean body mass, and to evaluate, in real time, the direct effect of nutritional therapy. In our usual practice, we estimate macronutrients using percentages of the total caloric amount, but in the critically ill patient population this approach is not appropriate. There is still controversy regarding the accurate nutritional therapy for critically ill patients, specially the amount of calories and the types of nutrients required.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The characteristics of the patients included in our study were not much different in age and gender distribution to those patients included in the Arab study of Arabi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (51 years, 68% male), who studied underfeeding in 480 ICU patients receiving parenteral nutrition; or the Turkish study of Altintas <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (58 years, 54% male), who analyzed prognostic characteristics of a sample of 71 ICU patients that required mechanical ventilation. The German study of Schneider <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] that studied low-volume enteral supplementation in ICU, had somewhat younger patients (47 years, 57% male). The APACHE II score of our patients, however, was substantially lower than in those three studies (our mean was 14.5, compared with 25.3 in the Arabi <italic>et al</italic>., study,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] 23.8 in Altintas <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or 21.6 in Schneider <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). This difference can be explained because their patients required parenteral nutrition[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or mechanical ventilation;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or were primarily polytrauma or sepsis patients.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In contrast, our sample was constituted by a wide variety of patients with mild to moderate severity in their critical illness state.</p><p>All the surgical ICU patients initially randomized were excluded since they did not complete follow-up; therefore, our analysis was based on medical ICU patients alone. This leaves out an important population which might benefit from hyperproteic nutrition. Respiratory system failure, followed by neurologic diseases, was the most important reason for ICU admission. Hyperproteic nutrition in this population might improve respiratory coefficient and oxygenation pattern.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Interestingly, our study found a nonsignificant trend to fewer days on ventilator. Our results were consistent with several studies[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that highlight the importance of high protein regimens, instead of a targeted caloric therapy.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that the hyperproteic hypocaloric regimen provides the energy requirements necessary for the cellular machinery to run during the acute phase of the illness, although it may lead to caloric debt. In recent years, therapeutic approaches in the ICU setting have changed towards more physiologic therapies, and the enhanced turnover and protein catabolism related to critical illness set the ground for an approach targeting hyperproteic nutritional support. In the literature there is not much evidence for the precise amount of nutrients required by the critically ill patient, but it has been suggested that hyperproteic nutrition regimens improve clinical outcomes.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Our results support our hypothesis: We found a benefit from the hyperproteic hypocaloric regimen, expressed as a higher delta SOFA score at 48 h. This score has been suggested to be an indicator of therapy effectiveness, and has been positively correlated with good clinical outcomes and lower mortality.</p><p>In our study, we guaranteed the protein load with an exogenous protein, soy protein, complementing the nutritional formulas used in clinical practice. The average amount of caloric intake in both groups was similar, lower than the caloric goals recommended by current clinical guidelines (and the amounts actually prescribed); the real difference between the two groups was in protein intake (less than 1 vs 1.5-2 g of protein per kg). This finding supports the idea that a proteic-caloric debt scenario, instead of a caloric debt scenario, might be detrimental for the success of nutritional therapy.</p><p>None of our patients presented soy protein intolerance or renal function impairment. Although patients with previous renal failure were excluded from the study, the premise that high protein intake increases the risk of renal failure is still a matter of controversy, at least in a population without previous renal disease.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Hyperglycemia in the critical care setting has been associated with complications and mortality,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and is crucial as a prognostic factor for survival. Therefore, close glycemic monitoring is highly desirable, but tight glycemic control with insulin infusion has been shown to increase the risk for hypoglycemic episodes.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The hyperproteic hypocaloric regimen we used in the intervention group produced less hyperglycemic events and may be associated with better outcomes in these patients. Although total caloric intake was similar, carbohydrate intake was much lower in the intervention group. We believe this shift from carbohydrates to protein as the main caloric source explains the difference in glycemic response. Nonetheless, there were no statistically significant differences in insulin requirements despite the differences in hyperglycemic events. Although insulin protocols do exit in our institution, insulin use depends on individual physician preferences.</p><p>One limitation of our study is the small sample size and low statistical power; this might be, at least in part, responsible for the lack of statistical significance observed in most of the secondary outcomes, which show a trend favoring the intervention group.</p><p>Another limitation is the per protocol analysis we used, instead of an intention to treat approach, which we discarded because we needed to guarantee at least 48 h of follow-up. If this approach leads to a biased analysis, it would be against our hypothesis, since more patients had an early discharge in the control group than in the intervention group, the latter would end up having patients with more severe disease.</p><p>Generalizability of this study in the clinical practice is difficult to predict because trained staff is needed to guarantee targeted protein delivery in order to achieve the goals of protein intake. While other studies replicate our findings we would suggest following the current caloric recommendations, but with a higher proportion of protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
