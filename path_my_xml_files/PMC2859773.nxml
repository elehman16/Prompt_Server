Here a Double-blind randomized trial will be performed, incorporating repeated treatment with albendazole (400 mg) or placebo at three monthly intervals. Household characteristic data, anthropometry, the presence of intestinal helminth and <italic>Plasmodium spp </italic>infections, and the incidence of malaria episodes are recorded. <italic>In vitro </italic>cultures of whole blood, stimulated with a number of antigens, mitogens and toll like receptor ligands provide relevant immunological parameters at baseline and following 1 and 2 years of treatment rounds. The primary outcome of the study is the prevalence of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>and <italic>P. vivax </italic>infection. The secondary outcome will be incidence and severity of malaria episodes detected via both passive and active follow-up. The tertiary outcome is the inflammatory cytokine profile in response to parasite antigens. The project also facilitates the transfer of state of the art methodologies and technologies, molecular diagnosis of parasitic diseases, immunology and epidemiology from Europe to Indonesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will provide data on the effect of helminth infections on malaria.

The study is reported in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines for cluster-randomized studies.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Worldwide, more than a billion people are infected by geohelminths, with a majority harboring roundworms (<italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>), whipworms (<italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic>), and/or hookworms (<italic>Necator americanus </italic>or <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Such helminths modify the immune system to induce predominant production of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (interleukin/IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13), associated with increased levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eosinophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Another hallmark of chronic helminth infections is their ability to induce a strong regulatory network characterized by T cell hyporesponsiveness and the increased production of suppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Their ability to induce regulatory responses is thought to be advantageous for both the parasite and the host as it allows the survival of the parasite for extended periods of time within the host while preventing overt pathological reactions that would otherwise be damaging to the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The latter may explain why such helminth infections rarely result in overt clinical manifestations.</p><p>Although the immunological consequences of helminth infections primarily reflect responses directed towards helminth antigens, there may be spill-over effects on responses to unrelated antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Whereas the marked Th2 polarization may compete with Th1 cytokines to affect the magnitude of a Th1 response to an incoming antigen, a strong regulatory response can dampen immune reactivity of both Th1 and Th2 types to a third party antigen. Not surprisingly, then, it is argued that helminth infections might modulate the human immune response to common co-infections such as malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Malaria itself is one of the most serious infectious diseases, infecting 5-10% of the world's population, with 300-600 million cases and more than 2 million deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In areas of high malaria transmission, the burden of disease is borne by infants and young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], whilst, in areas of lower transmission, primary infection might also occur later in life, causing severe illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Co-infection is the norm in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], since helminth infections of different species are often endemic in the same communities that are exposed to infection with plasmodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The question of whether helminth infections affect the course of malaria has been addressed in various reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] in the past few years. Only a small number of papers report on population studies and most of them were cross-sectional in nature, which in contrast to longitudinal studies might not be able to demonstrate the actual dynamics of infection. An early study by Murray and colleagues (1977) in a malnourished population at Anjouan, Comoros Islands suggest that <italic>A. lumbricoides </italic>might suppress malaria symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since then studies of co-infections have shown helminths to either exacerbate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or reduce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] the severity of malaria. The reasons for conflicting data on the effect of helminth co-infection on malaria disease outcomes could be due to differences in study design, study groups, and possibly, most importantly, the helminth species investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Although helminth infections are considered as pathogens, it is clear that their course of infection is relatively free of overt clinical manifestations and in recent years several reports have shown their suppressive effect on diseases such as allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], highlighting a possible beneficial effect on inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To assess the influence of helminth infections on inflammatory diseases taking into account environmental and genetic influences in a longitudinal setting, the ImmunoSPIN project <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immunospin.org">http://www.immunospin.org</ext-link> has been initiated. As part of the project ImmunoSPIN, the helminth-malaria sub project (ImmunoSPIN-Malaria) was designed to determine whether and how helminth infections may affect the course of a malaria infection. This study is a double-blind randomized trial of placebo and anthelminthic treatment to elucidate the impact of helminth infections on malaria longitudinally in an area where helminth infections and malaria coexist. It is expected to provide new information and contribute to our understanding of how regulatory responses that may be induced by chronic helminth infections affect inflammatory conditions, especially on malaria infection.</p><p>This paper presents the rationale of the ImmunoSPIN-Malaria study that, at the clinical and biological level, aims to discern plausible and meaningful interactions between these infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study area and population</title><p>Nangapanda is a sub-district of the Ende district, Flores Island, Indonesia and is situated in a coastal area with a population of about 22000 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Situated near the equator (8&#x000b0;45'S, 121&#x000b0;40'E)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], it is characterized by a uniform high temperature, in the range of 23-33.5&#x000b0;C, with humidity of 86-95%. Average yearly rain fall is 1.822 mm with about 82 rainy days, especially from November to April, with the peak in December until March. Malaria is reported to be highly prevalent in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Preliminary surveys conducted in 2005 and 2006 found this area to be endemic for geohelminths (<italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>, hookworms and <italic>T. trichiura</italic>) and malaria parasites (<italic>P. falciparum </italic>and <italic>P. vivax</italic>). The sub-district is divided into villages of which those located near the primary health centre (Puskesmas), Ndeturea, Ndorurea1, and Ndorurea are the focus of ImmunoSPIN-Malaria study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The map of the study area in Nangapanda, Flores, Indonesia</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2334-10-77-1"/></fig><p>The majority in the study area is Ende tribe and migrants from neighbouring district of Bajawa that have populated the island for more than 300 years. Most individuals work as farmers and grow their own food. Recently also government employees and individuals owning small businesses moved to the area. Individuals with Chinese and Arabic ethnicity have come to the area about 200 years ago and most of them, run business corporations with other tribes. There are very few other tribes from outside of Flores and most of them were brought from outside by marriage with Flores natives. The Nangapanda population is dynamic and individuals shift address within the area as well as move in and out of the area for purposes of studying, marriage, or searching for jobs.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design, data and sample collection</title><p>Baseline mapping of houses by Global Positioning System (GPS) system has allowed maps to be generated using ArcGIS 9,1 software (ESRI, USA). In order to perform spatial analyses based on individual data, geographical coordinates were assigned to each individual as well as centroid coordinates to households.</p><p>Community workers were recruited and trained to do questionnaires, follow-ups, malaria surveys (finger prick), and distribute treatment or placebo, as well as doing health promotion among the population. Each community worker will be in charge of a certain number of households that they visit monthly for recording movement and active follow-up of malaria symptoms, and three monthly for finger pricking and distributing the treatment.</p><p>The study is designed as a double-blind randomized trial with two arms. One arm is treatment with albendazole (single dose of 400 mg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], while the other arm is treatment with matching placebo (both tablets from PT Indofarma Pharmaceutical, Bandung, Indonesia). The treatment is provided every three months for a period of two years (a total of 8 treatments) to everyone, except children below two years of age, pregnant women or severely ill persons. Computer aided block randomization by household, using Random Allocation Software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] will be assigned to the treated and placebo groups. The treatment is coded as A or B and the codes are concealed from investigators and patients. Labels with the study subject ID are printed from a computer database and attached to the appropriate strip of treatment by a separate team located in Jakarta without the involvement of the study investigators. An interim analysis will be performed by the monitoring committee, 1 year after treatment to test for any adverse effects that retention of anthelminthic treatment might have on the growth of children and on the incidence of malaria episodes (in contrast to the hypothesis being tested). If the trial continues, the final unblinding of the codes will take place two years after treatment.</p><p>On approval of individuals in the area, peripheral blood will be collected from a subset of individuals over 4 years of age that were randomly selected for whole blood culture based on households. The assay will be done at baseline, 1 and 2 years after treatment. For those who are not included in whole blood assays, malaria evaluation by finger pricking will be obtained aiming to include the whole population in the study area.</p><p>Every household receives a card identifying all family members. This card is used when community workers visit homes and when family members visit the Puskesmas. Data on socioeconomic status and health status is collected at baseline and 2 years after treatment using questionnaires in Bahasa Indonesia. Monthly data such as birth, death and migration will be recorded. Newborns and individuals who enter the study area will be registered with a newly assigned ID number as well as their geographical coordinates. Active follow-up includes a questionnaire with questions on clinical complaints in general and clinical malaria in particular and will be conducted monthly by community workers. In addition to the questionnaire, blood slides will be collected at three monthly intervals to test for plasmodia. For examination of intestinal helminths, stool samples will be collected yearly. Samples will be used for microscopy and PCR analyses. Passive follow-up will be held in collaboration with the Puskesmas that keeps clinical records of individuals that visit either for consultation or for overnight admission, including information on diagnosis and treatment. If malaria is suspected, two blood slides will be collected: one to be examined by the Puskesmas staff and another for re-examination by the research team in Jakarta at the Department of Parasitology, University of Indonesia (UI).</p><p>All blood samples (serum, cell pellet, plasma, and whole blood), blood culture supernatants, as well as stool samples for PCR, will be kept at -20&#x000b0;C in a temperature recorded freezer which is checked twice a day and will be sent to Jakarta on dry ice for storage -20&#x000b0;C or -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes and case definitions</title><p>The study aims to determine whether and how helminth infections may affect the course of infection with malaria parasites and disease outcome.

Based on these findings a power calculation (given an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80) gave a sample size of 749 study subjects needed, in order to detect a 50% reduction or increase in the prevalence of plasmodia after 2 years of anthelminthic treatment. The effect of treatment will presumably be present in helminth carriers only and as an estimated 60% will be carriers of helminths during study period, giving an estimated 1248 subjects in each study arm will be needed.
