The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended universal supplementation of young children where anaemia rates are &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;%. However, large randomized trials have revealed that provision of iron to young children caused serious adverse effects because iron powerfully promotes microbial growth. Hepcidin &#x02013; the master regulator of iron metabolism that integrates signals of infection and iron deficiency &#x02013; offers the possibility of new solutions to diagnose and combat global iron deficiency. We aim to evaluate a hepcidin-screening-based iron supplementation intervention using hepcidin cut-offs designed to indicate that an individual requires iron, is safe to receive it and will absorb it.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study is a proof-of-concept, three-arm, double blind, randomised controlled, prospective, parallel-group non-inferiority trial. Children will be randomised to receive, for a duration of 12&#x000a0;weeks, one of three multiple micronutrient powders (MNP) containing: A) 12&#x000a0;mg iron daily; B) 12&#x000a0;mg or 0&#x000a0;mg iron daily based on a weekly hepcidin screening indicating if iron can be given for the next seven days or not; C) 6&#x000a0;mg or 0&#x000a0;mg iron daily based on a weekly hepcidin screening indicating if iron can be given for the next seven days or not. The inclusion criteria are age 6-23 months, haemoglobin (Hb) concentration between 7 and 11&#x000a0;g/dL, z-scores for Height-for-Age, Weight-for-Age and Weight-for-Height&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;-3 SD and free of malaria. Hb concentration at 12&#x000a0;weeks will be used to test whether the screen-and-treat approaches are non-inferior to universal supplementation. Safety will be assessed using caregiver reports of infections, in vitro bacterial and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth assays and by determining the changes in the gut microbiota during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A screen-and-treat approach using hepcidin has the potential to make iron administration safer in areas with widespread infections.

Using currently accepted criteria the prevalence rates for IDA in young children frequently exceed 50&#x000a0;% in low-income countries (as is the case in The Gambia) resulting in impaired immunocompetence and brain development and thus leading to substantial loss of human potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Low cost iron supplements are efficacious in combatting IDA; thus in countries with anaemia rates of &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;%, WHO recommended universal supplementation of pregnant women and young children. However, in 2006, the Pemba Trial was prematurely terminated due to significant increases in the number of serious adverse outcomes and deaths in young children receiving iron-folic acid supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This result was attributed to a malign interaction between iron, folic acid and malaria (since a parallel trial in a non-malarious area of Nepal revealed no increase in adverse outcomes), and WHO revised its policy guidance for iron supplementation to a more cautionary approach in areas with endemic malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The new guidelines recommended adoption of targeted supplementation (a screen-and-treat approach) or the use of centralized or point-of-use food fortification using micronutrient powders, which was considered likely to be a safer option. However, recent studies, including a very large trial from a non-malarious area in Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], have revealed important evidence of medically significant adverse outcomes associated with iron administration. It is assumed that all of these adverse outcomes may be attributable to host-pathogen competition for iron whereby supplemental iron has favoured pathogens more rapidly than their host. Thus there is an urgent need: a) to understand the pathways by which provision of iron favours pathogen virulence; and b) to use this knowledge to design safer modes for preventative and therapeutic provision of iron to infants and young children living in infectious environments in order to reduce infections and to allow maximal brain development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evidence of detrimental effects of iron</title><p>Iron is unique among nutrients in being both essential and highly toxic. This tension has driven the evolution of complex systems for regulating iron absorption, and safely chaperoning it during transportation, storage and utilization in a vast majority of living organisms including humans of complex systems for regulating iron absorption, and safely chaperoning it during transport, storage and utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The discovery of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin has thrown a sharp new focus on the adaptive/protective value of maintaining strict physiological control over iron absorption.</p><p>Initially the Pemba results were viewed with some scepticism in many quarters and/or were assumed to only affect malarious regions, as well as to be confined to supplementation as opposed to fortification. Yet, additional intervention trials have shown that administration of iron, either alone or as part of multiple micronutrient formulations, can lead to serious adverse effects as follows: a) a second trial in Tanzania showed an association between micronutrient supplements containing iron and the risk of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; b) two trials of iron-fortified foods given to children in C&#x000f4;te d&#x02019;Ivoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] caused significant adverse re-profiling of the gut microflora and evidence of intestinal inflammation; c) a large cluster-randomized single blind trial of iron-containing Sprinkles in 17,000+ Pakistani children has revealed significant increases in diarrhoea and pneumonia rates and a very significant increase in severe and bloody diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Finally, a recently published trial in young Ghanaian children receiving multiple micronutrient powders showed a trend towards lower malaria rates in the group receiving iron but an increase in hospitalisations among the iron-receiving group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The role of hepcidin &#x02013; the master regulator of iron metabolism</title><p>Iron homeostasis, and its distribution within the body, is maintained by regulating absorption of iron through duodenal enterocytes and by controlling the rate of iron recycling through macrophages. Hepcidin is a small peptide hormone that binds to and causes the degradation of ferroportin, an iron export protein highly expressed by enterocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. High levels of hepcidin thereby inhibit absorption of dietary iron and lock iron in macrophages, rapidly depleting serum iron (causing the protective hypoferraemia of the acute phase response) and lowering iron availability for erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. An abundance of genetic evidence in humans and experimental animals indicates that the ferroportin-hepcidin interaction is the dominant and non-redundant regulator of iron balance and iron distribution. Regulation of hepcidin is complex &#x02013; iron accumulation induces hepcidin, providing a negative feedback loop to maintain homeostasis, but hepcidin levels are also increased by inflammatory signals arising during infections. Iron deficiency and erythropoietic drive suppress hepcidin, releasing iron from cellular stores and increasing dietary iron absorption. Importantly, each of these signals is variable, and the balance between them determines hepcidin synthesis. Thus, an iron deficient individual may have high serum hepcidin due to an acute infection, but on the other hand severe anaemia may suppress hepcidin even in the presence of inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Iron redistribution as a component of innate defence against infection</title><p>It is widely accepted that the hypoferraemia of the acute phase response represents a highly conserved component of innate defence against a broad-spectrum of extracellular organisms that could elicit a rapidly fatal septicaemia if allowed unrestricted access to circulating iron. Several studies have proposed that iron-requiring intracellular organisms might have evolved their niche specificity precisely to capitalize upon the consequent iron-rich environment in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Such interactions may play a significant role in explaining susceptibility to secondary infections. Experimental validation in animal and human studies may have important therapeutic implications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Hepcidin-guided iron supplementation</title><p>Because hepcidin reports on the balance of iron status and inflammation, and because hepcidin also determines how well oral iron is absorbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], low hepcidin levels indicate both a requirement for iron and an ability to utilize it if provided. Individuals with high hepcidin may be iron replete, or inflamed, or both, but will not be able to absorb oral iron efficiently. In our recently published paper this is clearly illustrated in young children, and our results suggest a cut-off of 5.5&#x000a0;ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As discussed above, iron supplementation may provide limited benefit and be associated with deleterious consequences when given in the presence of inflammation. Therefore, providing an extra decision point (do not give iron unless hepcidin is below a cut-off level) in iron supplementation programs should make them both safer and more efficient. This will permit safe iron supplementation of young children in infectious areas allowing them to reach their full human potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Multiple micronutrient powders (MNP)</title><p>In this trial we will use a micronutrient powder (MixMe) as it is used by the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund and the World Food Programme. In a Cochrane systematic review (comprising eight large trials from a variety of settings, including malaria-endemic areas) assessing the effects and safety of home fortification with multiple micronutrient powders of foods consumed by children under two years, anaemia was reduced by 31&#x000a0;% and iron deficiency by 51&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The review found no difference in the effect of the intervention among children living in malaria endemic areas or areas with sporadic malarial cases. Based on this review WHO guidelines on home fortification were developed, strongly recommending home fortification with micronutrient powders to improve iron status and reduce anaemia among infants and young children 6-23 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>More recently two other trials investigating the effect of MNP, one in Ghana and one in Pakistan, have been published. The trial in Pakistan showed significant increases in diarrhoea and bloody diarrhoea and pneumonia rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], whereas the trial in Ghana showed a trend towards lower malaria rates in the group receiving iron but an increase in hospitalisations among the iron group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although our trial will not be powered to assess morbidity we will monitor our children very closely by collecting morbidity data twice weekly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The <italic>primary objective</italic> is to evaluate whether weekly hepcidin-based screen-and-treat at 12&#x000a0;mg iron/day, screen-and-treat at 6&#x000a0;mg iron/day and 12&#x000a0;mg iron/day universal supplementation for 12&#x000a0;weeks are all non-inferior.

The slope (k<sub>abs</sub>) of the regression reflects the absorption of iron per unit of time. The difference in the slopes between the groups will be equivalent to the average iron absorption over time in each group (k<sub>abs</sub> in groups A, B, and C, respectively).</p><p>The assumption of homogenous labelling will be assessed by testing the linearity of the slope between Days 0, 49 and 84. In each subject, k<sub>abs,i</sub> will be calculated from the slope of the isotopic ratio decrease over the intervention period. k<sub>abs,c</sub> will also be calculated for the control period (Day 84 and 168). k<sub>abs</sub> will be modelled using linear mixed models with time (intervention and control period) and treatment as fixed factors and subjects ID as random factors. The time treatment interaction on k<sub>abs</sub> will be assessed. A similar but separate analysis will be conducted on the total amount of iron absorbed, which will be estimated from the k<sub>abs</sub> value in each subject, and the group and time effect will be modelled with linear mixed models.

Combating anaemia due to iron deficiency is a challenge due to the potential negative side effects of iron when given to people with infections, as is common in The Gambia. The present randomised controlled trial of screen-and-treat aims to minimise unnecessary exposure to iron. This will decrease the potential adverse effects of giving iron at a time when the body can&#x02019;t utilise it and will allow maximising the absorption and utilisation of iron when it is most needed. If a screen-and-treat approach using a hepcidin cut-off to define &#x02018;ready and safe to give iron&#x02019; is non-inferior to universal supplementation, then this approach could be used in every health centre. We hypothesise that the development of a point of care test, which would immediately tell the nurse/physician if the person is ready to receive iron, would make iron administration more targeted and safer.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AGP</term><def><p>Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hb</term><def><p>Haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ID</term><def><p>Iron deficiency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDA</term><def><p>Iron deficiency anaemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MNP</term><def><p>Micronutrient powders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRC</term><def><p>Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBC</term><def><p>Red blood cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RDT</term><def><p>Rapid diagnostic test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sTfR</term><def><p>soluble transferrin receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSAT</term><def><p>transferrin saturation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank DSM Nutritional Products Ltd for providing the micronutrient powder (MixMe sachets) used as the supplement in this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This research is undertaken with a research grant provided by the Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation.
