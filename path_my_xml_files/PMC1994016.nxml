In pooled analyses of seven randomized, double-blind trials, 8 weeks&#x02019; treatment with olmesartan medoxomil was significantly more effective than placebo in terms of the response rate, proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure (BP) and mean change from baseline in diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Olmesartan medoxomil had a fast onset of action, with significant between-group differences evident from 2 weeks onwards. The drug was well tolerated with a similar adverse event profile to placebo. In patients with type 2 diabetes, olmesartan medoxomil reduced renal vascular resistance, increased renal perfusion, and reduced oxidative stress. In several large, randomized, double-blind trials, olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg has been shown to be significantly more effective, in terms of primary endpoints, than recommended doses of losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, or candesartan cilexetil, and to provide better 24 h BP protection. Olmesartan medoxomil was at least as effective as amlodipine, felodipine and atenolol, and significantly more effective than captopril. The efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil in reducing cardiovascular risk beyond BP reduction is currently being investigated in trials involving patients at high risk due to atherosclerosis or type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>olmesartan medoxomil</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>angiotensin receptor antagonist</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Individuals with hypertension are at a significantly greater risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. The largest study of the effects of hypertension on cardiovascular risk comes from analysis of data from more than one million adults who had no known baseline cardiovascular disease. This meta-analysis revealed a linear relationship between cardiovascular risk and increasing systolic blood pressure (SBP) in which each increase of 20 mmHg in SBP was associated with a doubling of cardiovascular risk in patients aged 40&#x02013;60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lewington et al 2002</xref>). More recently, the INTERHEART study has demonstrated that hypertension is one of the most potent predictors of myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Yusuf et al 2004</xref>).</p><p>The benefits of BP reduction in reducing morbidity and mortality in conditions associated with hypertension have been clearly shown. In clinical trials, treating hypertension reduced the incidence of stroke by 35%&#x02013;40%, myocardial infarction by 20%&#x02013;25%, and heart failure by &#x0003e;50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chobanian et al 2003</xref>). Thus, in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, the minimal goal of therapy is a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &#x0003c;140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of &#x0003c;90 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chobanian et al 2003</xref>) or &#x0003c;80 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">ESH&#x02013;ESC 2003</xref>). In hypertensive patients with diabetes or renal disease, the goals are &#x0003c;80 mmHg and &#x0003c;130 mmHg.</p><p>Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and the primary effector of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system (RAS), which plays a central role in the regulation of BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Brunner et al 1993</xref>). Evidence suggests that increased angiotensin II levels are an independent risk factor for cardiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Brunner 2001</xref>). Thus, the development of treatments like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which inhibit the activity of the RAS, provided an effective approach to the treatment of hypertension. However, ACE inhibitors are associated with various adverse effects such as cough and angioedema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Fletcher et al 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Vleeming et al 1998</xref>) and further research and clinical development has led to the development of highly specific angiotensin II receptor antagonists.</p><p>Angiotensin II receptor antagonists inhibit the RAS at the level of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, thereby providing effective antihypertensive efficacy without the side effects associated with ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists have proven efficacy in treating hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Burnier and Brunner 2000</xref>), and a tolerability profile similar to placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Mazzolai and Burnier 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the initial use of one of these agents has been shown to increase long-term patient persistence rates compared with those for patients initially prescribed ACE inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, beta-blockers, or thiazide diuretics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Conlin et al 2001</xref>).</p><p>Olmesartan medoxomil is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist that selectively and competitively inhibits the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mizuno et al 1995</xref>). Olmesartan medoxomil is administered once daily for the treatment of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Nussberger and Koike 2004</xref>). The agent has low potential for interaction with other drugs, and has been shown to be at least as effective as a number of other commonly used antihypertensive drugs. This article reviews the use of olmesartan medoxomil as monotherapy in patients with hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacological properties</title><sec><title>Pharmacodynamics</title><p>Olmesartan medoxomil is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The drug acts by selectively blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptor sites in vascular smooth muscle, thereby inhibiting the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II. In salt-restricted hypertensive adults, a single dose of olmesartan medoxomil lowered mean 24 h ambulatory BP and increased renin and angiotensin II concentrations in the plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Puchler et al 1997</xref>).</p><p>In bovine cerebellar membranes, olmesartan competitively inhibited binding of [<sup>125</sup>I]-angiotensin II to angiotensin II type 1 receptors, but not to type 2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mizuno et al. 1995</xref>). Olmesartan and the active metabolite of losartan (EXP3174) both antagonized contraction induced by angiotensin II in a dose-dependent manner in guinea pig aortic tissue. However, olmesartan medoxomil 0.3 nmol/L inhibited approximately 90% of the contractile response, whereas the same concentration of EXP3174 inhibited contraction by approximately 35%. The inhibitory effects of olmesartan and EXP3174 lasted for &#x0003c;90 and &#x0003c;60 minutes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mizuno et al 1995</xref>).</p><p>In rats, olmesartan medoxomil inhibited the angiotensin II-induced pressor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mizuno et al 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Koike et al 2001</xref>), and prevented production of markers of early cardiovascular inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Usui et al 2000</xref>), myocardial remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Takemoto et al 1997</xref>), and cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Tomita et al 1998</xref>) induced by inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis. Olmesartan medoxomil also reduced urinary protein excretion in a dose-dependent fashion in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Koike 2001</xref>) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Koike et al 2001</xref>). In animal models of atherosclerosis, olmesartan medoxomil has been shown to reduce the area of aortic plaque lesions and to reduce intimal thickening in cross sections of the aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Koike 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Koike et al 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Olmesartan medoxomil is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed into olmesartan in the gastrointestinal tract.

The effects of angiotensin II receptor blockade on renal hemodynamics in patients with type 2 diabetes have been studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled study involving olmesartan. When normotensive or hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes received olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg (n=19) or placebo (n=16) for 12 weeks olmesartan medoxomil decreased renal vascular resistance, increased renal perfusion and reduced oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Fliser et al 2005</xref>). In addition to significantly reducing mean ambulatory 24 h, daytime, and nighttime DBP and SBP from baseline, olmesartan medoxomil significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) increased renal plasma flow (from 602&#x02013;628 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and decreased filtration fraction and renovascular resistance. Plasma concentrations of 8-isoprostane 15(S)-8-prostaglandin F<sub>2a</sub>, a biochemical marker of oxidative stress, also decreased significantly with olmesartan medoxomil (p&#x0003c;0.05). In contrast, patients who received placebo showed no significant effect on BP, a significant decrease in renal plasma flow and increase in filtration fraction (p&#x0003c;0.05), and a non-significant increase in renovascular resistance. In patients with type 2 diabetes, such changes in renal hemodynamics and oxidative stress may contribute to the beneficial long-term renal effects of angiotensin II blockade with agents such as olmesartan medoxomil.</p><p>Patients with hypertension frequently suffer from other conditions that increase their risk of cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis. Chronic vascular inflammation is believed to play a major role in atherosclerosis and the EUropean Trial on Olmesartan and Pravastatin in Inflammation and Atherosclerosis (EUTOPIA) set out to investigate the effects of olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg on markers of vascular inflammation. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study, patients with essential hypertension and signs of vascular microinflammation were randomly allocated to treatment with olmesartan medoxomil (n=100) or placebo (n=99) for 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Fliser et al 2004</xref>). After 6 weeks, all patients also received once-daily pravastatin 20 mg. After treatment for 6 weeks, olmesartan medoxomil reduced serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, by 15% from baseline (p&#x0003c;0.05). Olmesartan medoxomil also significantly reduced levels of high-sensitivity tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (hsTNF-&#x003b1;) by 8.9% (p&#x0003c;0.02), interleukin-6 (IL-6) by 14.0% (p&#x0003c;0.05) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 by 6.5% (p&#x0003c;0.01). In contrast, there were no major changes in the placebo (ie, BP reduction) group. At the end of the trial, olmesartan medoxomil plus pravastatin, but not placebo plus pravastatin, had further reduced levels of hsCRP (21.1%, p&#x0003c;0.01), hsTNF-&#x003b1; (13.6%, p&#x0003c;0.01), and IL-6 (18.0%, p&#x0003c;0.01). These anti-inflammatory changes indicate that olmesartan medoxomil, in addition to its BP-lowering effects, may produce beneficial effects on atherosclerosis and thus on overall cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension who have atherosclerosis, or are at risk of developing it.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Comparative trials with olmesartan medoxomil</title><sec><title>Versus other angiotensin II receptor antagonists</title><p>The first study to evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of olmesartan medoxomil with another angiotensin II receptor antagonist was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in which 316 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (DBP 95&#x02013;114 mmHg) were treated with either olmesartan medoxomil or losartan for 12 weeks.

Olmesartan medoxomil had an early onset of action; after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment, the mean decreases in daytime DBP were 72% and 90% of those observed at 8 weeks, compared with 68% and 78% with candesartan cilexetil. Olmesartan medoxomil also reduced mean ambulatory 24 h DBP and daytime SBP by significantly more than candesartan cilexetil (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

In this trial, 440 patients were randomized 3:3:1 to one of the active treatments or placebo. After treatment for 8 weeks, olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine both reduced mean 24 h ambulatory DBP (primary endpoint) and SBP from baseline by significantly (p&#x0003c;0.001) more than placebo (DBP 7.7 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg vs 1.4 mmHg; SBP 12.2 mmHg and 12.3 mmHg vs 2.3 mmHg). Ninety percent CI comparing the mean change between olmesartan and amlodipine were &#x02212;1.88, 0.47 and &#x02212;1.96, 1.96, for 24 h DBP and SBP, respectively. Control rates of mean 24 h DBP &#x0003c;85 mmHg and SBP &#x0003c;130 mmHg were assessed, olmesartan medoxomil was significantly (p&#x02264;0.01) superior to both amlodipine and placebo. Using these criteria, for the olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and placebo groups the 24 h ambulatory control rates were 48.0%, 34.3%, and 11.1% (DBP) and 33.9%, 17.4%, and 3.7% (SBP), respectively. Absolute differences between the 90% CI Both agents were well tolerated; the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ significantly among the three groups (25.8%&#x02013;35.5%), and most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and judged to be remotely or definitely not related to treatment. As would be expected from the established tolerability profile of amlodipine, the incidence of edema was higher in the amlodipine group (9.1%) than the olmesartan medoxomil (4.3%) or placebo (4.5%) groups, as was the incidence of nausea (2.7%, 0%, and 0%). It should be noted that at the time of study design development target DBP &#x0003c;85 mmHg was considered clinically appropriate.</p><p>In the other trial, 187 patients received olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg once daily and 194 received felodipine 5 mg once daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Stumpe and Ludwig 2002</xref>). The dose of each medication could be doubled for non-responders after 4 weeks. After treatment for 12 weeks, there was no significant difference between olmesartan medoxomil and felodipine in reductions from baseline for mean sitting DBP (17.5 mmHg and 17.0 mmHg) and SBP (19.9 mmHg and 19.1 mmHg). The responder rates were 82.8% for olmesartan medoxomil and 83.3% for felodipine.

Additionally, the response rate was significantly higher for olmesartan medoxomil recipients (53% vs 38%, p&#x0003c;0.01). The average final dose for olmesartan medoxomil was 10.4 mg once daily (41.7% of patients were on the 5 mg dose) and for captopril was 37.0 mg twice daily (54.9% of patients on the 50 mg dose) after 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Versus a beta-blocker</title><p>In a double-blind study, 326 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean sitting DBP 95&#x02013;114 mmHg) were randomized to receive once-daily olmesartan medoxomil 10 mg or atenolol 50 mg for 12 weeks; after 4 weeks, the dose of either medication could be doubled for non-responders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Van Mieghem 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Stumpe and Ludwig 2002</xref>).

After a 2-week placebo run-in, patients received olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg/day open label for 8 weeks. After this, patients who did not achieve a DBP of &#x0003c;90 mmHg were randomised to 4 weeks of treatment with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/day or olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg/day plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day.

Combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB could be used to prolong and increase RAS blockade. However, such an approach would of course expose patients to the risk of ACE inhibitor-associated side effects such as cough.</p><p>A recent double-blind cross-over study in healthy normotensive males investigated the effects of RAS blockade with the olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg, and compared this with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 20 mg alone, or combined with olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg or 40 mg. The primary end-point was the degree of RAS blockade as assessed by SBP response to intravenously administered angiotensin I. At trough, the SBP response was 58% to either lisinopril 20 mg or olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg, 76% to olmesartan 80 mg and 80% to olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg plus lisinopril 20 mg. Thus, the 80 mg dose of olmesartan medoxomil was as effective as a lower dose combined with an ACE inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hasler et al 2005</xref>). This shows that using a higher dose of olmesartan medoxomil can produce an almost complete 24 h RAS blockade. Such a treatment strategy is preferable since it would of course be free from the side effect concerns associated with the use of an ACE inhibitor.</p></sec><sec><title>General practice</title><p>Patients with hypertension usually respond well to appropriate intervention in the setting of controlled clinical trials. However, the situation in general practice is less certain and issues such as compliance and the lower frequency of patient&#x02013;physician meetings have the potential to reduce the efficacy of treatment. In this context, two studies have assessed the efficacy and tolerability of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with hypertension in a general practice situation.</p><p>The OlmePAS study enrolled more than 12 000 patients in Germany. Physicians in more than 3400 clinical practices were involved in the study.

The OlmeTEL study (Olmetec zur Behandlung von Patienten mit essentialler Hypertonie.

The median dose of olmesartan medoxomil was 20 mg, and after 12 weeks, decreases from baseline of 27.6 mmHg and 16.0 mmHg were seen in office SBP and DBP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Mengden et al 2004</xref>).

ROADMAP is an important study because it has been designed to have sufficient power to assess whether changes in the onset of microalbuminuria will translate into reductions in the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease. The results of this landmark study are expected to be available around 2012, and may contribute to the development of new approaches to the management of patients with diabetes.</p><p>Atherosclerotic vascular disease is a major contributor to myocardial and cerebral infarction and hypertension is a major risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Studies mentioned earlier, such as those in animals and in markers of vascular inflammation (the EUTOPIA study) indicate that agents that inhibit the RAS such as olmesartan medoxomil may possess antiatherosclerotic efficacy. This is being investigated in Multi-centre Olmesartan Atherosclerosis Regression Evaluation (MORE) study. This multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study compares the effects of olmesartan medoxomil with those of atenolol on atherosclerosis in middle-aged to older hypertensive patients with increased cardiovascular risk. The MORE study will assess changes from baseline to various timepoints (including 28, 52, and 104 weeks) in carotid artery intimamedia thickness and plaque volume measured by 3D ultrasonography. It is hoped that initial results from the MORE study will be presented in 2006.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Tolerability</title><p>As outlined in earlier sections of this review, olmesartan medoxomil has a consistently excellent tolerability profile.

Based on incremental benefits calculated using Framingham models and the absolute reductions in DBP at 8 weeks from the clinical trial, treating patients in the studied setting with olmesartan medoxomil instead of the other three angiotensin II receptor antagonists may decrease the overall cost of medical care for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Cost effectiveness estimates of olmesartan medoxomil versus other angiotensin II receptor antagonists.

For example, when compared with valsartan, olmesartan medoxomil reduced estimated costs over 5 years in a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 patients by $16 231 000 for cardiovascular disease and $11 955 000 for coronary heart disease. The estimated reduction in costs with olmesartan medoxomil over 5 years when compared with losartan was estimated to be $15 149 000 for cardiovascular disease and $11 107 000 for coronary heart disease. At the time of the analysis, no price had been set for olmesartan medoxomil so it was assumed that the angiotensin II receptor blockers were all the same price. Olmesartan medoxomil has since been priced lower than other angiotensin II receptor antagonists in the USA; therefore the results from this analysis were probably underestimated.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is now apparent that intensive control of BP reduces the mortality and morbidity associated with hypertension, and clear BP goals have been set to guide physicians in their management of patients with hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chobanian et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">ESH&#x02013;ESC 2003</xref>) Although combination therapy will be required by many high-risk patients to reach BP targets, the initial use of an effective and well tolerated agent should improve patient compliance and reduce the number of steps needed to reach BP control.</p><p>Olmesartan medoxomil is a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist with proven BP-lowering efficacy. In a number of clinical trials, the agent generally lowered both mean DBP and SBP by at least 10 mmHg after treatment for 8 weeks. Importantly, the majority of patients in clinical trials achieved target DBP of &#x0003c;90 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Neutel 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Puchler et al 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chrysant et al 2003</xref>) Olmesartan medoxomil has a rapid onset of action, with significant improvements in efficacy compared with placebo observed from 2 weeks onwards. The drug is also well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.</p><p>A considerable body of data now exists that demonstrates the BP-lowering efficacy of olmesartan medoxomil. At doses recommended in the EU, olmesartan medoxomil has been shown to be significantly more effective, in terms of primary endpoints of sitting cuff or ambulatory daytime DBP, than other angiotensin II receptor antagonists (valsartan, losartan, irbesartan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Oparil et al 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Stumpe 2004</xref>), and candesartan cilexetil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brunner et al 2003</xref>) at their respective, recommended doses. The greater BP reduction seen with olmesartan may have long term clinical implications since even small decreases in BP have been associated with changes in the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Moreover, because of this improved efficacy, cost estimates indicate that olmesartan medoxomil may be more cost effective than valsartan, losartan, and irbesartan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Simons 2003</xref>). Additionally, olmesartan medoxomil has been shown to be at least as effective as the calcium channel blockers amlodipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chrysant et al 2003</xref>) and felodipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Stumpe and Ludwig 2002</xref>) and the beta-blocker atenolol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Van Mieghem 2001</xref>), and significantly more effective than the ACE inhibitor captopril at the doses tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Williams 2001</xref>).</p><p>Current treatment guidelines emphasize the need to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension. Patients with hypertension frequently suffer from other conditions that increase their cardiovascular risk, such as atherosclerosis. Studies such as the MORE study are helping to further define the potential benefits of olmesartan medoxomil in the overall reduction of cardiovascular risk by investigating its effects in patients with atherosclerosis. Patients with type 2 diabetes are also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and olmesartan medoxomil may come to play a major role in treating such patients. Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with olmesartan medoxomil has been shown to reduce renal vascular resistance and oxidative stress, and increase renal perfusion in addition to significantly reducing BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Fliser et al 2005</xref>). Such effects may translate into beneficial long-term renoprotective effects and this is being investigated in the 5 year ROADMAP study, which commenced in 2004. This study will assess whether olmesartan medoxomil can prevent or delay the onset of microalbuminuria, and whether this translates into protection against cardiovascular events and renal disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes. Studies such as MORE and ROADMAP should help to establish that olmesartan medoxomil offers benefits in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction that go beyond BP reduction.</p><p>As well as having a good tolerability profile, olmesartan medoxomil has a low potential for drug interactions, and a pharmacokinetic profile that allows it to be administered once daily. Recent studies show that olmesartan medoxomil produces almost complete 24 h blockade of the RAS. These factors will make the agent easy to prescribe, and should aid patient treatment compliance.</p><p>In conclusion, olmesartan medoxomil is an effective, fast-acting, and well tolerated antihypertensive agent that can be administered once daily. At recommended doses, it is significantly more effective at reducing BP than several other agents of its class. Thus, olmesartan medoxomil represents a good option for the initial intensive treatment of patients with hypertension.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The author wishes to thank Phil Jones of Adis
