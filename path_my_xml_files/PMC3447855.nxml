In independent trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, the GLP-1RA liraglutide produced reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) as great as 1.6%, in body weight of &#x0223c;3 kg, and in systolic blood pressure of 2&#x02013;7 mmHg; it also improved &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Two other GLP-1RA regimens, exenatide twice daily and exenatide once weekly, decreased HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 0.8&#x02013;0.9% and 1.3&#x02013;1.9%, respectively, and produced weight reductions similar to liraglutide (up to 3 kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In contrast, smaller reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (0.4&#x02013;1.0%) and negligible weight changes have been reported with currently available DPP-4 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The greater efficacy of GLP-1RAs is probably related to the pharmacological levels of these agonists stimulating GLP-1 receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In contrast, DPP-4 inhibitors modestly affect the levels of endogenous GLP-1, thus producing smaller glycemic reductions and negligible weight effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Although longer-term, head-to-head trials with the two incretin classes are scarce, we recently reported the results of a 52-week, head-to-head comparison of liraglutide and sitagliptin added to metformin in participants with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The results showed that liraglutide (1.2 or 1.8 mg/day) produced significantly greater sustained decreases than sitagliptin 100 mg/day in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02212;1.3 and &#x02212;1.5%, respectively, vs. &#x02212;0.9%), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (&#x02212;1.7 and &#x02212;2.0 mmol/L, respectively, vs. &#x02212;0.6 mmol/L), and body weight (&#x02212;2.8 and &#x02212;3.7 kg, respectively, vs. &#x02212;1.2 kg), with a comparable rate of hypoglycemia although an initially higher frequency of nausea in the liraglutide groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Furthermore, a significantly greater percentage of patients achieved the American Diabetes Association target of HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% with liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg) than with sitagliptin (50.3 and 63.3% for liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day, respectively, vs. 27.1% for sitagliptin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Apart from the higher incidence of gastrointestinal events with liraglutide, as expected with GLP-1RAs, the overall frequencies of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and minor hypoglycemia were generally comparable between liraglutide and sitagliptin groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Significantly greater reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, and body weight relative to sitagliptin were also reported with the GLP-1RA exenatide once weekly in a 26-week, head-to-head trial (HbA<sub>1c</sub>, &#x02212;0.9% vs. &#x02212;1.5%; FPG, &#x02212;0.9 vs. &#x02212;1.8 mmol/L; body weight, &#x02212;0.8 vs. &#x02212;2.3 kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Although metformin is the established first-line therapy in type 2 diabetes, there is no consensus regarding optimal second-line therapy or an effective alternative agent when the first second-line therapy used fails to provide adequate glycemic control. Although head-to-head studies have reported that treatment with GLP-1RAs produce greater glycemic and weight benefits compared with DPP-4 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), there are very limited data available exploring the effects of switching from a DPP-4 inhibitor to a GLP-1RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). To address this important clinical question, we conducted an exploratory investigation during which we assessed the efficacy and safety of switching participants from sitagliptin to liraglutide after 52 weeks in a 26-week study extension. The efficacy and safety of continuing liraglutide therapy for 78 weeks were also examined.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design and outcome measures</title><p>The 52-week study design and patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

After 52 weeks, sitagliptin-treated participants were again randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either liraglutide 1.2 or 1.8 mg/day, through a weekly dose escalation of 0.6 mg/day, and were treated for another 26 weeks.

As in the main trial period, participants from Slovakia, Serbia, and Slovenia were also excluded from the DTSQ analyses during the extension (82 of 419 [19.6%]) because of the lack of linguistically validated questionnaires. The two liraglutide switch groups (those switching from sitagliptin to either 1.2 or 1.8 mg/day liraglutide) were pooled into one group during a post hoc analysis of DTSQ scores. This was done to increase the power of the analysis and to allow a clearer interpretation of score changes between weeks 52 and 78 as differences between oral and injectable treatments. Missing postbaseline data were imputed by means of the last observation carried forward method.</p><p>Changes from week 52 to 78 within groups were analyzed by paired <italic>t</italic> test.

The proportion of patients reporting SAEs in both switch groups was low and ranged between 2.9 and 6.0%, with no consistent pattern with respect to system organ class (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-2113/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). One death (acute renal failure) occurred in a 56-year-old woman who had previously received sitagliptin 100 mg/day for 385 days and was switched to liraglutide 1.2 mg/day and treated for 31 days.

Nausea was the most common gastrointestinal AE, occurring in about 21% of participants in each switch group. Nausea was generally transient after switching to liraglutide and declined a few weeks thereafter in both switch groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>). No major hypoglycemic episodes (defined as participant unable to self-treat) occurred after changing treatment to liraglutide.

Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common TEAEs in both liraglutide groups (mostly transient nausea was reported by 20.9 and 20.6% of participants, respectively). Two deaths occurred in participants originally randomly allocated to receive liraglutide during weeks 0&#x02013;78, both in the 1.8 mg/day group. One previously reported death from pancreatic carcinoma (diagnosed after 8 days of liraglutide treatment) occurred during the first 52 weeks and was classified by the investigator as unlikely to be related to the trial drug. The second death (bile duct cancer) occurred during the extension in a participant treated for 401 days (diagnosed after 316 days) and with a known choledocal stenosis in the medical history and cholecystectomy with stent implant since 2006. The event was classified by the investigator as unlikely to be related to the trial drug.</p><p>During the 78 weeks, two events of major hypoglycemia occurred in a 39-year-old female participant originally randomly allocated to receive liraglutide 1.2 mg/day. The first episode occurred during the main trial period and was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The second episode occurred during the extension, after 486 treatment days. Finger-stick glucose concentration was too low to register. The participant was hospitalized overnight for glucose stabilization; no seizures or loss of consciousness occurred. The participant recovered after 1 day, and the event was classified by the investigator as serious and possibly related to the trial drug. The rates of minor hypoglycemia, after exclusion of an extreme outlier in the liraglutide 1.8 mg/day group with 23 minor episodes, were 0.156 and 0.130 episodes/participant/year for liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day, respectively.</p><p>During the 78 weeks, mean serum calcitonin levels remained below the upper limit of normal for both sexes in the two treatment groups, and no cases of malignant thyroid neoplasm were reported. One case of pancreatitis (nonacute) occurred during the first 52 weeks and was described previously; no additional cases occurred after week 52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s11"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Switching from sitagliptin after 52 weeks to liraglutide for the next 26 weeks, both in combination with metformin, was associated with significant improvements in glycemic control, body weight, &#x003b2;-cell function, and overall treatment satisfaction. Apart from transient increases in gastrointestinal reactions, as is common when initiating GLP-1RA therapy, no additional or unexpected safety or tolerability concerns were raised by switching to either dose of liraglutide. Participants treated with liraglutide for 78 weeks had clinically significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (0.9&#x02013;1.3%) and weight (2.5&#x02013;3.1 kg), with safety and tolerability profiles consistent with previous reports and no new safety concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>These results are consistent with other long-term studies of liraglutide. In one trial, 2 years of treatment with liraglutide 1.2 or 1.8 mg/day changed HbA<sub>1c</sub> by &#x02212;0.6 and &#x02212;0.9%, respectively, and body weight by &#x02212;2.3 and &#x02212;2.8 kg, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In another, 26-week improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> were sustained for 2 years of treatment with liraglutide, and weight reductions were also maintained after 2.5 years (&#x02212;3.0 kg with 1.2 mg/day and &#x02212;2.9 kg with 1.8 mg/day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>The greater efficacy of liraglutide than sitagliptin observed in the first 52 weeks of this study is consistent with other head-to-head trials comparing a GLP-1RA with sitagliptin (the DURATION-2 [Duration therapy Utilization: Researching changes in A1c, weight, and other factors Through Intervention with exenatide ONce weekly] trial of exenatide once weekly vs. sitagliptin and the T-emerge-4 trial of taspoglutide vs. sitagliptin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The DURATION-2 trial also included a switch phase after 26 weeks. The 26-week reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02212;0.3%), FPG (&#x02212;0.7 mmol/L), and body weight (&#x02212;1.1 kg) after switching from sitagliptin to exenatide once weekly in the DURATION-2 trial extension were similar to the reductions observed in participants switched to liraglutide 1.2 mg/day in our study; however, greater mean decreases in these glycemic control indicators and weight occurred in patients switched to liraglutide 1.8 mg/day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>These glycemic and nonglycemic improvements after switching therapy are likely due to the different modes of action exhibited by DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin and the GLP-1RA liraglutide. Direct stimulation of GLP-1 receptors by GLP-1RAs dosed to pharmacological levels results in glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon release, increased satiety, and reduced food intake, thus translating to effective glycemic control and weight loss observed in multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In contrast, DPP-4 inhibitors act indirectly by preventing enzymatic degradation of the incretin hormones, GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Although DPP-4 inhibitors also stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon release, lower levels of endogenous GLP-1 achievable with these agents translate into reduced glycemic efficacy and negligible weight effects relative to GLP-1RAs.</p><p>The assessment of treatment satisfaction can provide valuable information on patient adherence and thus may help predict long-term treatment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Our results show that the switch from an oral therapy to an injectable was associated with an increase in overall treatment satisfaction, while patients&#x02019; perceptions of treatment convenience and flexibility remained essentially unchanged. The improved treatment satisfaction may result from weight loss or actual or perceived improvements in treatment efficacy. These results complement the greater treatment satisfaction with liraglutide compared with sitagliptin reported in the first 52 weeks of this trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and similar results have been reported in another study comparing sitagliptin with an injectable GLP-1RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The 78-week safety profile of liraglutide was generally consistent with that observed during the development program, with gastrointestinal disorders being the most prevalent AEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The liraglutide continuing groups had more gastrointestinal events than the sitagliptin group during the initial 4&#x02013;8 weeks of the 78 treatment weeks. Similarly, gastrointestinal events were the most frequently reported events after switching to liraglutide, as expected with GLP-1RAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In accordance with previous reports, nausea incidence peaked transiently after switching and declined after several weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Postmarketing reports of pancreatitis with exenatide, and later sitagliptin, resulted in the addition of pancreatitis as a withdrawal criterion in this trial as well, and a single case of chronic pancreatitis was reported during the first year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In addition, during the trial, calcitonin levels remained below the upper normal limits for both sexes with both liraglutide and sitagliptin, consistent with findings from all phase 3 trials with liraglutide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>Overall study design limitations included the absence of a placebo group and the lack of double blinding. Limitations that applied specifically to the switch period were the small number of patients per switch group and the lack of a control group (e.g., a sitagliptin continuing group) to serve as a reference and comparison for the observed efficacy changes in the groups switched to liraglutide. Because the number of patients was small, it was decided not to keep a sitagliptin continuing group and instead switch all sitagliptin recipients to liraglutide; however, another 2-year study with sitagliptin added to metformin has shown that efficacy tends to decline after the first year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), and thus no further improvement in sitagliptin-treated patients would have been expected had they not switched to liraglutide.</p><p>In conclusion, switching treatment from sitagliptin to liraglutide was associated with improvements in glycemic control, body weight, and treatment satisfaction, while the rates of hypoglycemia remained low. Overall, the switch was well tolerated, although it was accompanied by a transient rise in gastrointestinal reactions (mainly nausea), as expected with GLP-1 receptor agonists. The additional glycemic and weight reductions observed after switching second-line treatment to liraglutide show that this switch may be especially beneficial for those patients not achieving glycemic goals with sitagliptin, without the need for a third-line antihyperglycemic agent. It is reasonable to hypothesize that similar findings may be observed when comparing other long-acting GLP-1RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors. This exploratory study sets the stage for larger, more robust studies to examine the effects of switching from one second-line type 2 diabetes therapy to another.</p></sec>
