Nonetheless, their pattern of infiltration is more extensive than that of potentially resectable cancers so the potential for microscopically incomplete (R1) operations is significant when surgery is used as primary therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Given that complete microscopic (R0) resection represents a requisite component of curative treatment for patients with PDAC, preoperative treatment regimens designed to both optimize surgical outcomes and to select appropriate patients for pancreatectomy are increasingly being administered to patients with borderline resectable cancers in an attempt to maximize the likelihood for long-term survival.</p><p id="Par6">The therapeutic strategy utilized most frequently for borderline resectable PDAC is currently based entirely upon consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Typically, patients first receive 2 to 4&#x000a0;months of systemic chemotherapy followed by a conventionally fractionated course of radiation therapy given over 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks with a radiosensitizing fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabine. Patients who complete this multimodality regimen without evidence of disease progression undergo pancreatectomy with curative intent; those who progress systemically prior to the intended operation are treated with non-surgical palliative therapies. This approach leverages theoretical benefits associated with systemic chemotherapy (e.g., systemic antitumor activity for micrometastatic disease known to exist in almost all patients), radiation therapy (e.g., &#x0201c;sterilization&#x0201d; of surgical margins) and time (e.g., patient selection) in an attempt to maximize systemic control, local control, and ultimately, overall survival. Success with this strategy has historically been described primarily in single-institution, retrospective reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Alliance for Clinical Oncology Trial A021101, a recently-published, prospective pilot trial, we showed that this paradigm of multimodality therapy can also be implemented effectively in a multi-institutional setting; among 22 patients with borderline resectable PDAC who initiated treatment, 15 (68%) underwent pancreatectomy and the overall survival rate of all accrued patients at 18&#x000a0;months was 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">This paradigm of sequential administration of chemotherapy and chemoradiation was proposed at a time when gemcitabine&#x02014;a systemic agent with a response rate in PDAC of less than 10%&#x02014;was standard therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the &#x0201c;gemcitabine era&#x0201d;, the rationale for following systemic chemotherapy with chemoradiation was the latter&#x02019;s direct cytotoxic effect on the primary tumor, possibly leading to an improvement in local control or downstaging of the cancer to an extent that might facilitate an R0 resection. However, the added benefit of conventional chemoradiation remains unclear in this setting. Indeed, the sequential administration of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and chemoradiation led to a radiographic response in only 12% of borderline resectable primary tumors evaluated, and downstaged only 0.8% to technically resectable in one large, retrospective analysis of this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, conventional chemoradiation as advocated in the consensus guidelines is delivered over a duration of 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks prior to a 6&#x000a0;week break before surgery. Because chemoradiation acts principally upon the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes, the systemic micrometastatic disease that appears to exist in all patients with localized PDAC may therefore be suboptimally treated&#x02014;or untreated&#x02014;for as many as 3 to 4&#x000a0;months prior to resection using this strategy. Further, given the proximity of the adjacent dose-limiting stomach and small bowel, the delivery of high doses of radiation therapy to the tumor has been prohibited using conventionally fractionated regimens.</p><p id="Par8">The consensus treatment algorithm of systemic chemotherapy followed by conventional chemoradiation that is now frequently used for patients with borderline resectable PDAC requires rigorous review in the context of significant recent advances in both medical and radiation oncology. The systemic regimens now in routine use for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer&#x02014;FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel&#x02014;are associated with objective response rates of 32% and 23%, respectively, in the setting of metastatic PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given the relatively high response rates associated with these regimens compared to gemcitabine alone, it is conceivable that current systemic therapy may allow better treatment of systemic disease, which represents the key source of morbidity and mortality among patients with PDAC, without forgoing the potential local benefits of chemoradiation. The administration of chemotherapy alone in the preoperative setting for patients with both resectable and borderline resectable cancers is not without precedent: in a single-center study of patients with resectable PDAC, 27 (71%) of 38 patients who received preoperative gemcitabine and oxaliplatin underwent surgical resection and the median OS for all 38 patients was 27.2&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent multi-institutional pilot study of perioperative modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) in 21 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer resulted in a 94% R0 resection rate in 17/21 able to undergo resection, and a median OS of 33.4&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. And, in a retrospective evaluation of 64 patients with borderline resectable disease treated with preoperative gemcitabine/docetaxel and other systemic agents, 31 (48%) were resected and the median OS of all 64 patients was 23.6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Furthermore, to the extent that radiation therapy may have a role in &#x0201c;sterilizing&#x0201d; the surgical margins of borderline resectable tumors and thereby enhancing rates of R0 resection and local control, new, attractive alternatives such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT, 6.6&#x000a0;Gy&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5) use a dosing schedule of only 5&#x000a0;days. SBRT, using newer radiation machines with image guidance, fiducial markers, and motion management techniques, has facilitated the delivery of higher doses to the tumor and the reduction of toxicity to normal tissues. In a multicenter prospective study, gemcitabine followed by SBRT was shown to be safe in patients with locally advanced PDAC, with comparable quality of life and reduced abdominal pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although SBRT has not been prospectively tested in patients with borderline resectable PDAC, retrospective data are promising and support prospective evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Importantly, SBRT is recommended only to patients who are able to meet specific dose constraints, who can undergo placement of fiducial markers for targeting with daily image guidance, and for whom techniques to sufficiently reduce respiratory tumor motion to &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;mm are available. For patients who do not meet these criteria, hypofractionated image guided radiation therapy (HIGRT, 5&#x000a0;Gy&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5) is an alternate strategy in which a lower yet still potentially effective dose is delivered.</p><p id="Par10">A prospective trial to further the understanding of the relative contributions of preoperative systemic and local therapies for patients with borderline resectable PDAC is now timely and essential to further progress. A021501, a collaborative randomized phase II study, will establish a treatment strategy to which novel regimens can be compared in the future. This study will compare the efficacy of two preoperative regimens, one of which utilizes modern systemic therapy alone and one that uses systemic therapy and hypofractionated SBRT or HIGRT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par11">The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and estimate the 18-month overall survival (OS) rate of patients with borderline resectable PDAC receiving preoperative therapy consisting of one of the following regimens prior to intended surgical resection and postoperative therapy with 4&#x000a0;cycles of modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6): 1) Arm 1: 8&#x000a0;cycles of systemic mFOLFIRINOX, or 2) Arm 2: 7&#x000a0;cycles of systemic mFOLFIRINOX followed by hypofractionated radiation therapy.

Tumors with an interface with the SMV and PV measuring &#x0003c;180&#x000b0; and without an interface with either the CHA or SMA&#x02014;considered borderline resectable by other guidelines&#x02014;are considered resectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

Following the first four cycles of mFOLFIRINOX, patients are restaged with CT or MRI, and those without evidence of metastases and who maintain a PS of 0 or 1 receive either an additional 4&#x000a0;cycles of mFOLFIRINOX (arm 1) or an additional 3&#x000a0;cycles of mFOLFIRINOX followed by radiotherapy using either SBRT (6.6&#x000a0;Gy&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5) or HIGRT (5&#x000a0;Gy&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5).</p><p id="Par16">SBRT is strongly preferred over HIGRT and it is expected that the majority of patients eligible for this trial will receive SBRT. Only those patients who do not meet specific criteria as outlined in the protocol should be offered HIGRT to ensure patient safety. SBRT allows for simultaneous integrated boosts (SIB) to the tumor vessel interface (TVI). In contrast, HIGRT delivers a homogeneous dose without a boost to the TVI in order to minimize normal tissue dose. Each site must be credentialed for SBRT prior to enrollment and all radiation plans must be centrally reviewed prior to treatment. Pancreas tumors are not easily seen on cone beam CT scans at the time of SBRT. Placement of fiducial markers under echoendoscopic guidance within or near the tumor is required prior to radiation. An online tutorial for SBRT planning and delivery has been created to assist those sites who have not previously performed pancreas SBRT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.educase.com"><italic>www.educase.com</italic></ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Surgical resection</title><p id="Par17">Following completion of either chemotherapy alone (arm 1) or chemotherapy followed by radiation (arm 2), all patients are restaged with CT or MRI, and those without locally advanced or metastatic disease on immediate central radiologic review and who have a PS of 0 or 1 are required to undergo pancreatectomy within 4&#x02013;10&#x000a0;weeks.

Within each arm, a single-arm sequential design with one interim analysis for futility will be implemented. The final efficacy analysis and interim analysis will be based on the 18-month OS rate and R0 resection rate, respectively, and evaluated in each arm separately. The comparison of OS between arms will be carried out only if both arms are deemed promising at the end of the trial. A &#x0201c;pick-the-winner&#x0201d; strategy will be implemented to choose one treatment strategy for recommendation.</p><p id="Par25">The median OS of patients treated with multimodality therapy for borderline resectable PDAC reported in historical studies varies from 14 to 28&#x000a0;months, with a median of 21 to 22&#x000a0;months and an interquartile range of about 18 to 23&#x000a0;months. Most of the previous studies are retrospective single-institution studies subject to patient selection bias, which likely skew the reported OS higher. Thus, we consider the median OS of at most 18&#x000a0;months (equivalent to 18&#x000a0;m OS rate of 0.50, assuming exponential survival function) which is the lower bound of the IQR of literature reported data as the null hypothesis. To demonstrate clinical meaningful improvement in OS, we target an alternative hypothesis of a median OS of at least 27&#x000a0;months (equivalent to 18&#x000a0;m OS rate of 0.63; a 50% increase in median OS time).</p><p id="Par26">A maximum of 62 evaluable patients in each arm will provide 82% power to detect an absolute improvement of 13% in 18&#x000a0;months OS rate, i.e., testing alternative hypothesis that the 18&#x000a0;months OS rate is at least 63% against the null hypothesis that the 18&#x000a0;months OS rate is at most 50%, at a one-sided significance level of 0.07.</p><p id="Par27">One interim analysis will be conducted to assess treatment futility for each arm separately. For each treatment arm, the R0 resection rate will be evaluated when surgical data become available for the first 30 evaluable patients. If the R0 resection rate is at least 60% (null hypothesis), based on weighted R0 resection rate from historical data, the arm warrants continuing to full accrual for OS final analysis. If the observed R0 resection rate is significantly less than 60%, futility of that arm has been met and accrual of new patients to that arm will cease. Therefore, the interim analysis based on the R0 resection rate will be testing the alternative hypothesis of R0 resection rate&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;40% against the null hypothesis of R0 resection rate&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;60%.

This study, A021501, builds upon our previous work, A021101, and it will define standard preoperative treatment regimens to which future novel regimens can and will be compared in subsequent randomized trials.</p><p id="Par29">The statistical design of this trial focuses on evaluating whether clinical meaningful improvement in survival can be achieved by the tested regimens compared to historical data. This study uses a critically important interim surrogate endpoint (R0 resection rate) that is different from the final endpoint (18&#x000a0;month OS rate) and an interim analysis which allows elimination of a futile arm after only 30 patients are enrolled to that arm. If both arms are deemed promising at the end of the trial, a pick-the-winner strategy will be employed to choose one arm as the &#x0201c;winner&#x0201d;. Use of a proximate end point, the R0 resection rate, for the interim analysis protects patients from the possibility of being randomized to a futile arm while the whole study is still powered to detect a clinically important and meaningful improvement in the OS rate.</p><p id="Par30">The concept and design of this trial was developed and evolved by a multi-disciplinary team within the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology with the support and critical feedback of the National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s Pancreatic Cancer Task Force and members of the other participating cooperative groups. The trial represents a natural next step in an investigational program that has proceeded with the advice, investment, and involvement of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP). Indeed, at the request of CTEP, we performed an initial pilot study A021101 designed to rapidly assess the feasibility of a multi-institutional study of borderline resectable PDAC and to develop a standardized clinical and research infrastructure (e.g., rapid review of imaging, pathologic assessments, quality control of radiation protocols) specific to this disease stage that is necessary to study it. A021101 represented one of the most collaborative studies that has ever been conducted in the pancreas cancer space: it met its accrual endpoint early and within a year due to the enthusiasm of centers within the Alliance, ECOG-ACRIN, SWOG and NRG Oncology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The trial demonstrated that rapid, real-time central review of imaging is feasible, established other infrastructural elements viewed as critical to the conduct of multimodality treatment trials for pancreatic cancer, and has set the stage for this subsequent randomized phase II A021501 study which represents the natural next step in this line of investigation.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par31">
