Outcomes were assessed before and after treatment (week 8) and again 3 months later (week 20). The primary outcome was the pain intensity on a visual analog scale at week 8; secondary outcomes included pain on movement, pressure pain sensitivity, functional disability, health-related quality of life, well-being, anxiety, depression, stress perception, pain acceptance, body awareness, patients&#x02019; global impression of improvement, and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with sham, CST patients reported significant and clinically relevant effects on pain intensity at week 8 (&#x02212;21 mm group difference; 95% confidence interval, &#x02212;32.6 to &#x02212;9.4; <italic>P</italic>=0.001; <italic>d</italic>=1.02) and at week 20 (&#x02212;16.8 mm group difference; 95% confidence interval, &#x02212;27.5 to &#x02212;6.1; <italic>P</italic>=0.003; <italic>d</italic>=0.88). Minimal clinically important differences in pain intensity at week 20 were reported by 78% within the CST group, whereas 48% even had substantial clinical benefit.

It is influenced by and linked to the musculoskeletal system,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and presumably to the vascular and endocrine system as well as to the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the craniosacral theory, fascial restrictions within the craniosacral system lead to abnormal, arrhythmic motion of the cerebrospinal fluid. This craniosacral rhythm is assessable by palpation and quantifiable by encephalogram, myelogram, and magnetic resonance imaging.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There is also growing evidence for fascial involvement in pain chronification.

After baseline assessment, patients were randomized into either the CST group or an active attention-control group receiving light-touch sham treatment. Outcome measures were collected at week 8 after randomization (after intervention) and week 20 after randomization (3-month follow-up). The trial was conducted between February 2012 and May 2013 at the Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. Before patient recruitment, the trial protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany (11-4850-BO), and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01526447).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>A statistician who was not involved in conducting the study generated a nonstratified allocation sequence with randomly varying block lengths using the random number generator RANUNI from the SAS/STAT software (release 9.2, SAS Inc.). On the basis of these random number tables, he prepared sealed and opaque envelops sorted in the ascending order of randomization. To reveal patients&#x02019; group assignment, the envelop with the lowest number was opened directly after each baseline assessment by the trial coordinator who was involved neither in the random sequence generation nor in the assessment of study outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Criteria</title><p>Patients were recruited from specialist care, primary care, and noncare populations through advertisements. To assess eligibility, those who called were screened by a research assistant, whereupon eligible patients obtained written study information and a physical and neurological examination by a study physician. If all eligibility criteria were met, patients had to give written inform consent and were included in the study.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were an age of 18 to 65 years, chronic nonspecific neck pain for 3 months or more with at least moderate pain intensity of &#x02265;45 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and treatment naivety with respect to CST. Participation was not possible in cases of specific neck pain due to degenerative diseases (disk prolapse, scoliosis), inflammatory diseases (spondylitis, arthritis), neurological diseases (neuropathy, multiple sclerosis), physical trauma (whiplash, operation at the cervical spine), or neoplasms of the spine. Severe comorbid somatic and psychiatric disorders such as oncological diseases or major depression and current pregnancy also were exclusion criteria. Patients taking corticosteroids, opiates, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, or those with recently initiated or modified drug therapy or invasive/manipulative treatment were also excluded.</p><p>The sample size was calculated on the basis of pain intensity ratings of chronic nonspecific neck pain patients who received osteopathic manipulative treatment<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> using the G*Power software (release 3.1.3, Kiel University, Germany).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> To detect an expected group difference of 1.73&#x000b1;SD of 2.16 on a 10-point numeric rating scale (effect size of 0.84) with a power of 80%, a 2-sided <italic>t</italic> test with &#x003b1;=5% significance level required 24 patients per group. Accounting a possible loss of statistical power due to patient withdrawal of 10%, a total sample size of 54 patients was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>First, patients were blinded to the group allocation and to the fact that 1 group would receive sham treatment as it was recommended for manual therapy trials<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>; instead they were told that 2 different CST techniques would be tested. Second, investigators assessing outcomes remained blind to patients&#x02019; group allocation during the whole study period. Third, the statistician who conducted outcome analyses was blinded to the group allocation by renaming the groups with numbers.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Standardized treatment protocols comprised 8 units of CST or sham treatment once a week lasting 45 minutes each. Patients of both groups received initial structural CST examination, which was repeated at the end of each unit, and was treated by 1 of 4 licensed physiotherapists with advanced CST qualification, and on average 6 years of clinical practice. Treatment steps were recorded by therapists using a structured log.</p><sec><title>The Treatment Group</title><p>The CST protocol was designed to release restrictions of the cranium and the spine up to the pelvis and the sacrum using standardized application of gentle fascial traction, release, and unwinding techniques in accordance with the respective palpated restrictions.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The techniques applied included frontal and parietal lift, medial compression of the parietal bones, release of the sagittal suture and the atlanto-occipital joint, compression-decompression of the sphenobasilar and the temporomandibular joints, cranial base release, release of the hyoid diaphragm and the thoracic inlet, dural tube traction, respiratory and pelvic diaphragm release, lumbosacral and sacroiliac decompression, fascial unwinding of the neck/shoulders and lower limbs, and still point induction.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> If indicated, dialog techniques for increasing body awareness and assisting the process of somato-emotional release were used.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p></sec><sec><title>The Sham Control Group</title><p>The sham protocol was designed to be credible but not specifically effective.

The average pain on movement score was then calculated from all movement directions.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Pressure pain sensitivity was measured at the individual point of maximum pain and bilaterally at anatomically predefined sites (levator scapulae, trapezius, and the semispinalis capitis muscle). For these points, pressure pain thresholds were determined 3 times each using a digital algometer (Somedic AB, H&#x000f6;rby, Sweden) with a 1-cm<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> cylinder. Pressure was applied in steps of 40 kPa/s until patients stated pain in addition to pressure.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Functional disability was assessed using the Neck Disability Index, a 10-item questionnaire that enquired the disability in daily activities induced by neck pain. Scores of &#x0003c;9 indicate no perceived disability, 10 to 29 mild disability, 30 to 49 moderate disability, 50 to 69 severe disability, and 70 to 100 complete disability.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Health-related quality of life was assessed on 2 subscales, physical and mental quality of life, using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey. Subscales were standardized to a mean of 50&#x000b1;SD of 10 and a range of 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the lowest level and 100 the highest level of health.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Well-being was measured by the sum score of the 16-item Questionnaire for Assessing Subjective Physical Well-being (FEW-16).<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Each subscale is composed of 7 items with a maximum of 21 points. Scores below 8 indicated anxiety and depression levels within normal limits, 8 to 10 points indicated subclinical levels, and over 10 points a possible clinical disorder.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> To assess stress perception, patients obtained the Perceived Stress Questionnaire in the 20-item version.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Pain acceptance was measured by the 8-item Positive Life Construction Scale of the Emotional/Rational Disease Acceptance Questionnaire.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Body awareness was measured by the Scale of Body Connection, which is composed of 2 subscales: Body Awareness and Body Dissociation.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Patients&#x02019; ratings of their Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) were assessed on a 7-point scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Safety assessment was realized by asking patients at the beginning of each treatment unit about the frequency and the severity of side effects. In addition, patients were requested to document side effects as well as concurrent treatment and medication use in a daily log.</p><p>Furthermore, treatment expectancy was assessed as part of the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire on a 9-point rating scale from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very much).<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Treatment credibility and quality of the therapeutic alliance, measured by the Helping Alliance Questionnaire,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> were analyzed and reported separately.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population including all patients who were initially randomized, regardless of whether they had missing data or were not fully adhering to the treatment protocol.

The primary outcome was analyzed as a function of the treatment group (classified factor), patients&#x02019; expectations, and respective baseline values (linear covariates) using univariate analysis of covariance. Between-group differences (&#x00394;) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using 2-sided <italic>t</italic> tests, and an alpha level of 5%.

Minor adverse events during or subsequent to the treatment were reported by 6 patients in the CST group and included increased neck pain in 2 patients and pain in the jaw area, shivering, tiredness, strong emotional reactions, and weeping in 1 patient, respectively. Within the sham group, 8 patients reported minor side effects, which included transient headache or migraine in 7 patients, worsened neck pain in 3 patients, tingling sensations in 2 patients, and dizziness in 1 patient. In all reported cases, symptom worsening subsided shortly after the respective treatment unit. Another 2 patients, 1 from each group, discontinued study participation in consequence of recurrent headache during treatment, but were free of headaches at both follow-up assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Summary of Evidence</title><p>The present study is the first randomized controlled trial that revealed efficacy for CST in comparison with manual sham treatment. In a patient sample with a mean duration of 9.6 years of nonspecific neck pain, significant and clinically relevant effects on the pain intensity were found directly after the active treatment period and at week 20, a further 3 months later. Minimal clinically important differences in pain intensity at week 20 were reported by almost 78% within the CST group, whereas 48% even had substantial clinical benefit. An exploratory analysis also revealed significant between-group differences at weeks 8 and 20 for pain on movement, functional disability, physical quality of life, and patients&#x02019; global impression of improvement. Pressure pain sensitivity and body awareness were significantly improved only directly after 8 weeks of treatment, and anxiety only at week 20. No serious adverse events were reported.</p><p>Results are in line with previous pain research in CST and recommended neck pain treatments.

The effect sizes are comparable to those of neck pain guideline treatments<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and more than likely cannot be explained exclusively by nonspecific treatment effects, which were found to be only of small to medium effect sizes.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Specific effects of the used CST techniques seem to be probable, given the broad nociceptive and low-threshold mechanosensory innervations of the fasciae,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Treating fasciae has been shown to induce a decreased tone of intrafascial muscle cells, decreased muscles tension, and increased parasympathetic nervous system response and vagal tone, in vitro<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> and in vivo.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> Pain relief, decreasing muscles tension, and the experience of deep relaxation and release were also reported by the interviewed patients treated with CST.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Further described results of CST included the reduction of state and trait anxiety, whereas depression levels were often not influenced significantly.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Adverse events have been reported only by 1 randomized controlled trial in detail, with temporarily increased symptoms and tiredness occurring most often.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> In the CST theory, such transient symptom aggravation, tiredness, and the described emotional release reactions are usually understood as positive vegetative responses to treatment,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> which were also reported in studies of osteopathy, massage therapy, and acupuncture.<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Weaknesses</title><p>The strengths of the study design included the random and concealed allocation procedure, the intention-to-treat analysis, the active attention-control and touch-control condition, comparable concurrent treatments, and the successful blinding of patients<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and outcome assessors.</p><p>However, there are certain limitations. First of all, the sample size was relatively small and consisted of 81.5% of female patients, which may reduce the representativity and the generalizability of the results. Even so, the analyses conducted had adequate statistical power, suggesting comparable results even in bigger samples. Epidemiological surveys otherwise show a generally higher neck pain prevalence in women,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which in turn would explain the greater percentage of included women compared with men. Second, the comparability of the CST and the sham groups may be limited due to the allocation to the therapists. Whereas 3 therapists performed CST, only 1 therapist performed the sham treatment. However, secondary analyses have shown that the alliance to the assigned therapists did not systematically affect study outcomes.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Nonetheless, the treatment protocols used only allow for conclusions about the effect of CST on subjective clinical outcomes. It remains unclear whether CST techniques actually affect the indicated fascial structures and joints, and if so, whether these changes in turn would result in quantifiable physiological responses. The design therefore would have to include further objective physiological measures and an even more standardized application of fascial palpation techniques.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>CST was shown to be specifically effective and safe in reducing neck pain intensity and may improve the functional disability and the quality of life up to 3 months after the intervention. Particularly in chronic and recurrent neck pain, CST may be a worthwhile treatment option in addition to standard medical care. Further studies with rigorous methodological designs and long-term follow ups are needed to confirm CST efficacy in neck pain treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Rainer L&#x000fc;dtke, MSc, Karl and Veronica Carstens Foundation, Essen, Germany, for his statistical support; Arndt B&#x000fc;ssing, Prof MD, Institute of Integrative Medicine, Department of Health, Witten/Herdecke University, Herdecke, Germany, for his methodological support; Florian Gass, MD, Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany for his assistance in patient assessment; Petra Klose, PhD, Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany, for her assistance in literature search.
