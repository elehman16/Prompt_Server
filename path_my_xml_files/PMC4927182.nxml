A volunteer sample of patients with optic nerve damage (mean age 59.1 yrs) was recruited. The primary outcome measure for efficacy was super-threshold visual fields with 48 hrs after the last treatment day and at 2-months follow-up.

This improvement persisted for at least 2 months in terms of both within- and between-group comparisons. Secondary analyses revealed improvements of near-threshold visual fields in the central 5&#x000b0; and increased thresholds in static perimetry after rtACS and improved reaction times, but visual acuity did not change compared to shams. Visual field improvement induced by rtACS was associated with EEG power-spectra and coherence alterations in visual cortical networks which are interpreted as signs of neuromodulation.

After a spontaneous recovery period, visual field (VF) loss is considered irreversible which compromises vision-related quality of life (QoL) [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A systematic search for a means to improve such vision loss is urgently needed.</p><p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (ACS) of the brain are new methods to modify brain excitability and synchronicity in healthy subjects and patients with brain injuries affecting different modalities such as the motor [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], language [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], or somatosensory domains [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the visual system, exploratory evidence indicates that ACS can enhance neuronal function both in normal subjects [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and in patients with VF loss who still have some residual vision [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The proposed mechanism of action is neuromodulation of oscillatory brain activity towards a more synchronized EEG via entrainment of specific stimulation frequencies [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the reorganization of brain functional connectivity networks [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] is considered to be a novel and promising avenue for visual rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In a small sample study, ACS was delivered in frequencies ranging from theta to high beta via electrodes placed near the eye to re-activate residual vision in optic neuropathy [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here, 10 daily rtACS sessions increased light detection performance and improved patient-reported vision-related QoL which was moderately correlated with VF gains [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These improvements were associated with increased alpha-power at occipital sites in resting-EEGs [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and increased neuronal synchronization of functional connectivities between the occipital and frontal regions [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Yet, the level of clinical evidence is still not definitive because the trials included only small patient samples [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

The FOLLOW-UP diagnostic assessment was conducted after a therapy-free interval of at least 2 months.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0156134.g001"/></fig><p>The study design was prospective and double blind; neither the patients nor the diagnostic examiners were aware to which treatment arm the patient belonged. For allocation concealment, patients of the sham-group received minimal dose stimulation. The investigator administering the treatment was aware of the group identity but was instructed not to reveal to the patients which treatment they received. Patients were informed to which group they belonged only after the FOLLOW-UP tests, and all sham-stimulation patients were offered rtACS. Informed written consent was obtained prior to randomization. Study participants received a compensation for study participation. The ethics committees of the participating study centers in Magdeburg, Berlin, and Goettingen approved the study, and a statistical analysis plan was filed with the lead ethics committee. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01280877). The trial was registered in January 2011 upon receiving approval from the leading ethics committee in December 2010. The date range for patient recruitment and follow-up was from December 2010 until February 2012. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study sample description</title><p>Patients who suffered visual field loss caused by glaucoma (n = 33) or AION (n = 32) were randomized.

In the first trial a mean percentage increase (&#x000b1; standard deviation) of 65.61 &#x000b1; 104.35 was observed in the rtACS-group (n = 19) and 16.93 &#x000b1; 31.22 in the sham-group (n = 14).

Using these means and standard deviations in a sample size calculation (&#x003b1; = 0.05, two-sided, power 1 &#x02013; &#x003b2; = 0.80) for a two-sample t-test (Satterthwaite version) with nQuery Advisor 7.0 resulted in 41 patients per group for the first trial and 36 patients per group for the second trial. Therefore, we adopted a conservative approach of considering up to 10 percent drop-out and planned to recruit 45 patients per group. Patients were assigned to either the rtACS- or the sham-group by &#x0201c;Randomization In Treatment Arms&#x0201d; software (RITA, StatSol, L&#x000fc;beck) with stratified block randomization considering the study center and the VF defect depth at BASELINE as potential prognostic factors. High vs. low defect depth was defined as stimulus detection rates below vs. above 30% inside the VF defect.</p><p>Randomization resulted in comparable average baseline situation and demographics in the rtACS- and sham-group. Only the percentage of males vs. females was unequally distributed but this was independent of study results.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The following criteria were established prospectively.

Primary and secondary endpoints were defined prospectively.</p><p>VF mapping was conducted using a campimetric, high-resolution, super-threshold visual detection test (HRP) [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], a method that reveals areas of residual vision in the central VF with lower inter-test-variability than standard static perimetry due to target luminance above threshold. In a darkened room, the patient was viewing a 17" monitor from a chin-head-rest at a distance of 42 cm. White target stimuli were presented at random in a grid of 25x19 stimulus locations and the task was to hit the space bar. The procedure included a fixation control using isoluminant color changes of the fixation point. Eyes with intact vision or complete blindness were not considered. The primary endpoint was &#x0201c;percent change over BASELINE&#x0201d; in the HRP detection rate.</p><p>Secondary endpoints of HRP were percentage change of the stimulus detection rate in the defective VF (excluding intact areas), the central 5&#x000b0;-VF, and average reaction time in total HRP VF. Further secondary endpoints were static and kinetic perimetry results (foveal and mean threshold of 30&#x000b0;-VFs, mean eccentricity/VF size), best corrected near and far visual acuity (Landolt), and patient-reported outcome, i.e., an intervention-related questionnaire with a structured response format and a vision-related QoL questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-39) [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to evaluate subjective improvements of &#x0201c;visual field defect and related impairments&#x0201d; (15 items) and &#x0201c;general health and mental distress&#x0201d; (four items) at POST and FOLLOW-UP. Concerning static perimetry foveal threshold and mean threshold of 30&#x000b0;-VFs were obtained. A fast threshold strategy was used to determine threshold values at 66 positions within the 30&#x000b0; visual field. Target stimuli (size: III/4mm<sup>2</sup>, white, luminance: 318 cd/m<sup>2</sup>/ 0db, duration: 0.2 sec) were presented on a background with constant luminance of 10cd/m2. Mean threshold refers to the average dB values of 66 test positions. In kinetic perimetry the VF border was determined for 24 meridians (spaced by 15&#x000b0;) in randomized order at a constant luminance threshold of III/4e (0dB) and a velocity of 2&#x000b0; per sec. Mean eccentricity refers to the average of 24 meridians. Mean visual field size refers to the area inside the VF border in kinetic perimetry, i.e., the sum of 24 triangles (X axis eccentricity multiplied by Y axis eccentricity /2).</p><p>The percent change over BASELINE was determined at 48 hrs (minimum interval) after the last stimulation day (i.e., the 10th stimulation session) (POST) and at 2 months FOLLOW-UP (FU) for each endpoint as 100*(POST resp. FOLLOW-UP&#x02013;BASELINE) / BASELINE. HRP reaction time (absolute differences), visual acuity (logarithmic values) and questionnaire data were shown as absolute values. For binocular defects the value of both eyes was averaged. Since there were no center effects (neither as the main factor nor as an interaction with the treatment arm), nor dependencies of BASELINE results for the primary endpoint, the primary data analysis and secondary between-group comparisons were performed for the pre-defined hypothesis with a one-sided U-test (p-value&#x0003c;0.05). The Hodges-Lehmann effect estimator and 95%-confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Within-group comparisons were calculated with Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank-tests. Analyses were done in MatlabR2011b and SPSS 21.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>EEG power spectra after rtACS</title><p>All subjects were seated in a dimly lit room and instructed to keep their eyes closed during the whole recording session. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded for 2 min before and after each stimulation session using 16 electrodes (10&#x02013;20 system) with impedances &#x0003c;10k&#x02126; with eyes closed (at rest) in a darkened room. The EEG-signal at occipital (O1, O2) areas of interest (AOIs) was referenced against the grand-average and preprocessed with ASA&#x02122;- software (ANT, Enschede, Netherlands) including a bandpass-filter (0.5&#x02013;40Hz, filter-slope 24dB/oct.), 2 sec bins, and baseline correction. Power-spectra at occipital sites O1 and O2 were assessed with Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to determine bandwidth specific power (&#x003bc;V2) with automatic artifact-rejection (min/max allowed amplitude: &#x000b1;75.00&#x003bc;V), normalized power-spectra and DC-correction during FFT-averaging. Resting state eyes-closed EEG immediately before and after one day of treatment was analyzed after the first rtACS session. The EEG data were analyzed in 3 steps. First, we defined 5 spectral bands: delta, 1&#x02013;3 Hz; theta, 3&#x02013;7 Hz; alpha (alpha I), 7&#x02013;14 Hz; and beta, 14&#x02013;30 Hz. Between-group comparisons were conducted with independent samples t test. The effects of rtACS or sham-stimulation on EEG measures were analyzed as &#x00394;EEG = EEGpost&#x02212;EEGpre.

Isotropic conductivities were assigned to head tissues such as scalp, cerebrospinal fluid, gray and white matter (0.43, 1.79, 0.33, 0.142; [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), air pockets (1e-6 S/m), skull (0.01 S/m [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and eye tissue (0.6, 1.05, 0.4 S/m for sclera, intraocular and nerve tissue [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. One circular electrode (height/diameter: 3/10 mm, conductivity: 1.5 S/m) was placed above the subject's right eyebrow and a return electrode was modeled as the last axial slice of the neck region (SCIRun software, current injection: +/-0.5 mA [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The simulation represents a quasi-static solution of the Maxwell equations and serves as an approximation for current density estimation of one time sample during rtACS when the cathode and anode reaches its maximal current intensity value.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec017"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Safety</title><p>None of the participants reported discomfort during the stimulation. One serious adverse event with subsequent hospitalization occurred, but it was unrelated to rtACS.

Temporary dizziness was reported once after a single rtACS-session. Mild headache during a single stimulation session was reported once by an rtACS-subject and once by a sham-subject. Further reports were mild headaches immediately after a stimulation session by four rtACS- and two sham-subjects and cutaneous sensations in eight sham- and 12 rtACS-subjects.

Repeated daily stimulation with non-invasive rtACS significantly improved detection performance in VFs with persistent effects for at least 2 months beyond the stimulation period as shown by static perimetry. Kinetic perimetry appeared to be insensitive to visual field dynamics. VF improvement in static measures was associated with increased vision-related QoL and subjective visual functioning in patients with binocular vision impairment. However, in contrast to what was seen in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the &#x0201c;objective&#x0201d; improvement of VFs did not correlate significantly with &#x0201c;subjective&#x0201d; measures, i.e., there was a mismatch between both levels of analysis which can be attributed to the fact that only a small proportion of subjective vision can actually be explained by &#x0201c;objective&#x0201d; VF results as previously discussed [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. About 2 of 3 patients treated with rtACS reported being satisfied with the treatment even though only 1 of 3 patients was aware of vision improvements.</p><p>We performed computer simulation to estimate the amount of current that was being delivered to components of the visual system in a 40-yrs old male control subject. Computer simulations of rtACS current flow and estimated current density levels revealed that the stimulation current propagates through the eyeball and optic nerve to subcortical and midbrain regions with secondary stimulation at the brain stem and in cerebellar regions. Although the simulation model does not consider the extent of optic nerve damage the results provide meaningful insights indicating that most of the current affect frontal parts of the brain including eyeball and optic nerve while only low levels were found in the visual cortex. This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that cortical EEG changes after rtACS are due to &#x0201c;physiological&#x0201d; synchronous activation of retinal ganglion cells following eye and optic nerve stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For future studies in this area current flow simulations may help to target both safety considerations and improved stimulation paradigms.</p><p>Our findings of improved visual functions are consistent with the hypothesis that rtACS can modulate perceptual thresholds in &#x0201c;areas of residual vision&#x0201d; as previously reported in studies that also used current stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156134.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or behavioral vision training methods [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156134.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156134.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The improvement of visual functioning together with spectral power and connectivity changes in the occipital EEG alpha band [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] are consistent with the hypothesis of a retinofugal entrainment by rtACS that improves visual perception through rhythmic firing of retinal ganglion cells. Indeed, in the present study we cannot exclude that some of the effects on coherence are due to volume conduction effect. Future studies might use high-density EEG, which would allow using source reconstruction algorithms (e.g. LORETA). Such algorithms typically reduce the volume conduction problem and thus allow a more spatially precise localization of neurophysiological effects and more reliable estimation of functional coupling. As recently shown by patients with optic nerve damage who suffer from desynchronization of spatial and temporal processing deficits of their brain functional networks [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156134.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] the therapeutic effects of rtACS may be mediated by re-synchronizing the brain networks, which were desynchronized by the vision loss. Because well-synchronized dynamic brain networks are critical for cognitive processing of visual information [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we conclude that a visually deprived brain with re-synchronized functional networks can process reduced visual input more efficiently thereby activating or amplifying, residual vision even many years after the damage has occurred [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>According to the prevailing view, tACS entrainment leads to a frequency-specific phase realignment of the endogenous oscillations with the applied alternating current with a subsequent frequency-specific power enhancement [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The beneficial functional consequence of rtACS for visual perception may possibly be explained by retinofugal entrainment and brain functional connectivity modulation [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156134.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another issue of interest is the specificity of the range of current frequencies used for stimulation. In future studies it will be important to systematically study the effects of specific frequencies for parameter optimization [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Application of the optimal frequencies might improve efficacy and will also shed light on the role of specific brain oscillations in their ability to activate residual vision.</p><p>It may be argued that visual improvements after rtACS can be explained by perceptual learning due to repeated testing. However, this is unlikely because we ascertained stable visual field baselines before starting the treatment and the primary and secondary outcome criteria did not improve to the same extent in the sham-group which was exposed to the same number of diagnostic test repetitions. Since we observed a <italic>decrease</italic> in RT when ACS treated patients responded to small light stimuli presented during visual field testing, another alternative explanation for improved vision outcome is a secondary effect of an increase in attention in the treatment group due to rtACS which then results in general performance improvements in vision tests as well. However, this interpretation is not supported by results of a basic alertness test. Here, we observed a general RT <italic>increase</italic> in response to large centrally presented stimuli as used during the alertness test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156134.s007">S1 Table</xref>). In other words, despite lower overall alertness, visual processing to (smaller) visual stimuli was faster. Our interpretation is that visual processing following ACS treatment may be more efficient, but the precise relationship between general alertness and modality-specific (visual) attention in patients with visual field defects requires further study.</p><p>An important question in brain stimulation studies is what constitutes an appropriate sham-condition. In prior rtACS-studies, the sham-condition was an auditory sound that mimicked current delivery [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Below phosphene-threshold stimulation was employed by others [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Both of these sham conditions cannot completely rule out that patients correctly guessed to which group they belonged (because of lack of phosphene experience in shams), leaving open the possibility of an expectation bias. Our sham-condition avoided this bias by using a &#x0201c;minimal dose&#x0201d; sham-condition where phosphene perceptions also occurred. However, the draw-back of this kind of sham procedure is that a &#x0201c;minimal dose&#x0201d; may actually have some, albeit small, therapeutic effects that cannot be separated from possible placebo effects of the current study design. Indeed, the sham group significantly improved in some parameters as well. The reason we selected a &#x0201c;minimal dose&#x0201d; treatment for sham controls is that this equalizes the expectations in both groups. Indeed, one would not expect that patients generate a hypothesis on their own that fewer phosphenes were less effective. However, considering that phosphenes may contribute to a placebo effect, it cannot be ruled out that patients in the rtACS-group who experienced more significant visual phenomena during stimulation might have had a greater feeling of that a powerful treatment was occurring than those who only experienced a flash once a minute.</p><p>Several open questions should be addressed in future studies. Important issues are whether non-invasive current stimulation-induced visual system changes are due to neuroplastic alteration, if they can be potentiated by vision training [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and if rtACS can also improve vision in patients with post-chiasmatic lesions [<xref rid="pone.0156134.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, for general diagnostics low contrast visual acuity as a sensitive outcome measure and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measurements to better define study inclusion criteria should be considered to explore altered axonal and neuronal integrity in the afferent visual pathway. While additional studies are needed to further explore the mechanisms of action, our results warrant the use of rtACS treatment in a clinical setting to activate residual vision by brain network re-synchronization, which can partially restore vision in patients with stable vision loss caused by nervous system damage.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="sec027"><title>Reliability of visual field measurements</title><sec id="sec028"><title>Reliability parameters of the primary outcome measure</title><p>The absolute change of HRP fixation accuracy and percentage of responses outside the valid response window in HRP were considered as reliability parameters.

Together with reliability parameters of HRP, the eye-tracking results documented excellent retinotopic reliability of the primary outcome measure, validating that improved visual detection could not be explained by altered eye movements (such as saccades towards the blind field). Mean fixation was within the central area of 1&#x000b0; horizontally and 0.5&#x000b0; vertically for both groups at all time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156134.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).
