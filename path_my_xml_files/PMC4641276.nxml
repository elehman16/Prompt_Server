In Pakistan it is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity after cancer and ischemic heart disease.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The number of expected cases with stroke in our country is 250/100,000 each year, progressing to 350,000 new cases annually. Burden of stroke is escalating in Asia and incidence ranges from 182 to 342 per 10,000 populations.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Upper extremity motor impairment is the most disabling consequence of stroke that limits independent living.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> About 85% of stroke population exhibits an initial weakness in arm that persists in 55% to 75% of patients even after three to six months.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, full recovery of hemiplegic arm occurs in only 5 to 20% of patients.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hemiplegic arm reduces the ability to actively perform functional arm movements such as reaching, grasping and manipulating an object that result in difficulties in activities of daily livings (ADLs).<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Rehabilitation of upper extremity is a challenge, various therapeutic strategies like neurodevelopmental technique (NDT), splinting, biofeedback and electrical stimulation are designed, however the best method to improve upper limb function is still not clear.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Two widely practiced therapies to improve motor function of hemiplegic upper extremity are motor relearning programme and constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT). Motor relearning programme focuses on task specific learning through effective use of feedback and practice and studies have shown that it is effective in enhancing motor function recovery of post stroke paretic limb.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, CIMT is a more recent intervention and has gained much attention in the treatment of post stroke paretic arm.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> After stroke, patients are incapable to use the hemiplegic arm thus compensate by using the unaffected arm more, leading to learned non use phenomenon. CIMT helps to overcome learned non use by constraining movement of unaffected arm with a sling or mitt and encourage repetitive task practice of affected arm including shaping, a behavioral technique.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A number of studies reported that CIMT significantly improves functional activities and maximizes motor function of paretic upper limb.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of CIMT over motor relearning programme. Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) is proved to be effective in western countries<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but the evidence for this kind of intervention is lacking in Pakistan. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of CIMT over motor relearning programme to improve motor function of hemiplegic upper extremity after stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this randomized controlled trail 42 males and females stroke patients having first attack of stroke and hemiplegic upper extremity had functional level of &#x02265; 20 degrees of wrist extension and &#x02265;10 degrees of extension of all digits were included. Subjects were between 35-60 years of age and diagnosed with ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes confirmed by CT/MRI scan. Patients were excluded if they had cognitive deficit, recurrent or cerebellar strokes, severe aphasia, balance and equilibrium problems, severe shoulder pain affecting therapy or other neurological deficits.</p><p>The research was started after approval from institutional review board (IRB) of Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS). Sample was recruited from Physiotherapy department of Institute of Physical Medicine &#x00026; Rehabilitation (IPM&#x00026;R) and Neurology OPD of Civil Hospital Karachi through non-probability purposive sampling technique. Informed consent was taken from the patients. Then patients were randomly allocated to CIMT group and MRP group by using computer-generated random numbers kept in sealed envelopes. Each group had 21 patients. After baseline assessment, patients in CIMT group were asked to perform tasks only with the hemiplegic upper extremity with the unaffected hand restraint in a mitt. The patients in MRP group were asked to perform tasks with both affected and unaffected upper extremities. Tasks were attempted in different positions like supine lying, sitting and standing.</p><p>Both interventions consisted of 6 sessions per week, two hours duration of each session, for three consecutive weeks. Pre and post treatment evaluation of motor function of hemiplegic upper extremity was determined by using upper arm section of Motor Assessment Scale. Upper limb section of MAS includes, Upper arm function item, hand movements item and advanced hand activities item. An activity of daily livings (ADLs) was measured by using self care item of Functional Independence Measure Scale (FIM) which includes 5 items (eating, grooming, bathing, dressing upper body and dressing lower body. Outcome of both treatment groups was re-evaluated on 18<sup>th</sup> visit.

Results of the present study showed improvements in both groups but significantly in CIMT group.

This Learned inhibition of movement is overcome by a behavioral technique called shaping used in CIMT.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The second mechanism by which CIMT has been established to give good functional results is use-dependent neural plasticity.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is associated with the large alterations in function that CIMT generates in humans after stroke and monkeys after simulated stroke.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The motor relearning approach focuses on task specific learning through effective use of therapist&#x02019;s feedback to enhance the recovery of motor skills of hemiplegic arm in post stroke patients.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Conversely CIMT is based on the theory of learned non use and forcing the use of hemiplegic arm in post stroke hemiparesis by immobilizing the normal arm in a sling or mitt and encourage repetitive task practice of hemiplegic arm including shaping, a behavioral technique used in CIMT.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>CIMT group showed more significant improvement in motor function and self-care performance of hemiplegic upper extremity as compared to MRP group in patients with sub-acute stroke assessed by the MAS and FIM scales. Thus CIMT is proved to be more statistically significant and clinically effective intervention in comparison to motor relearning programme among the patients aged between 35-60 years. Further studies are needed to evaluate CIMT effects in acute and chronic post stroke population.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold><italic>Declaration of interest:</italic></bold> None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold><italic>Grant Support &#x00026; Financial Disclosures:</italic></bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abro</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Abbasi</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hafeezullah Sammo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheikh</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Incidence of stroke in context of hypertension in local population</article-title><source>Pak J Physiol</source><year>2007</year><volume>3</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khealani</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hameed</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Mapari</surname><given-names>UU</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Stroke in Pakistan</article-title><source>J Pak Med Assoc</source><year>2008</year><volume>58</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>400</fpage><lpage>403</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18988415</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Study to assess the effectiveness of modified constraint-induced movement therapy in stroke subjects: A randomized controlled trial</article-title><source>Ann Indian Acad Neurol</source><year>2013</year><volume>16</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>180</fpage><lpage>184</lpage><comment>doi: 10.4103/0972-2327.112461</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23956560</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Winstein</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Taub</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Uswatte</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effect of constraint induce movement therapy on upper extremity function 3 to 9 months after stroke</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2006</year><volume>296</volume><issue>17</issue><fpage>2095</fpage><lpage>2104</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17077374</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alon</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Levitt</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Functional Electrical Stimulation Enhancement of upper extremity functional recovery during stroke rehabilitation: Neurorehabil Neural Repair</article-title><year>2007</year><volume>21</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>207</fpage><lpage>215</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Veerbeek</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>van Wegen</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>van Peppen</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Wees</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hendriks</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Rietberg</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>What is the evidence for physical therapy poststroke?
