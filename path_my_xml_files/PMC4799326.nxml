The surgical incision started proximally at the level of the upper patellar margin and centrally between the medial patellar margin and the medial epicondyle. A descending incision was then made, directed toward the supero-medial margin of the tibial tubercle. We separated the medial third of the patellar ligament (PL) from the rest of the ligament with dissection up to the patella. The PL was carefully detached from the patella up to the transition between the proximal third and medial third of the patella (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We placed the stitches between the periosteum and the ligament using FiberWire absorbable threads (Arthrex, Naples, FL) to safely rotate the graft (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The femoral insertion of the MPFL covered an area more posterior and proximal to the medial epicondyle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>A tunnel was then drilled using a bit of the same diameter as the graft, and this was secured with an absorbable interference screw (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) or with anchors (also absorbable or nonabsorbable). At the end, we sutured the distal edge of the vastus medialis muscle to the graft, which bestowed a dynamic component upon the reconstruction. No lateral release procedure was performed.</p><p>Rehabilitation started on the day of the patient's first return visit and the subject used an immobilizer for three weeks; isometric quadriceps exercises as well as analgesia, cryotherapy and electrostimulation were started during this period. The surgeon performed passive mobilization of the knee during the fortnightly visits and weight bearing was permitted immediately after surgery. The exercises for gain of range of motion were increased in the third week, with introduction of the stationary bicycle without load. Initial proprioception and closed kinetic chain exercises were executed and gradually evolved into open chain exercises.

In general, the surgical group presented higher mean values in both knees and in both sexes. The scatter graph between the measures of the Kujala score and of the age of the patients in each group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) did not indicate an association between these quantities, and Pearson's correlation coefficient was equal to 0.07 for the surgical group and -0.12 for the conservative group. We highlight the result of a low extreme value for the Kujala score (equal to 16), which corresponds to a measure of the conservative group, observed in a 25-year-old woman.</p><p>The statistical analysis showed that the mean Kujala score was significantly lower in the conservative group (70.8) when compared to the mean value of the surgical group (88.9), with p = 0.001. This conclusion is maintained (with p = 0.002) even after considering control by sex, age and side of the operated knee. Note that if we disregard the extreme observation emphasized earlier (Kujala = 16), the mean value of the conservative group rises from 70.8, with standard deviation (s.d.) of 19.2, to 73.7, with s.d. of 14.6. However, the removal of this value does not change the conclusions described previously, as the mean value of this group still appears significantly lower than that of the surgical group (p &#x0003e; 0.001), even after control by the covariables considered (p = 0.001).</p><p><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents the percentages of the Kujala score according to group, sex and side, considering the score divided into three or two categories (in this case, grouping poor and fair).</p><p>The analysis indicates association between group and Kujala score, while the surgical group presented a higher percentage of good/excellent results (71.5%) when compared with the conservative group (25.0%), with p = 0.003.

The odds of a patient being classified as Kujala excellent/good in relation to fair/poor for those operated with the surgical method are 7.5 times the same odds for those operated with the conservative method, with a confidence interval of 95% ranging from 1.9 to 30.0. This odds ratio also appears significantly different from 1 after control by the variables sex, side of knee affected and age of the patient (OR: 7.2; CI 95%: 1.7 to 29.6).</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Recurrence and/or subluxation in the conservative group</title><p>In relation to cases of recurrence and/or subluxation in the conservative group, it was observed that of the 20 procedures evaluated, 35.0% (with confidence interval of 95% ranging from 14.1% to 55.9%) exhibited recurrence or subluxation. It is also worth noting that of the two patients who had both sides affected, one of them presented recurrence on the right side and subluxation on the left side, and the other did not present any occurrence on either one of the sides.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>There are many studies in relation to the surgical treatment of patellar dislocations with more than 100 surgical techniques, open or arthroscopic<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(1)</sup></xref>.</p><p>There are few randomized controlled studies<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and only one systematic review<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(1)</sup></xref> comparing the conservative and surgical treatments.</p><p>In these studies, the authors recommend non-surgical treatment for primary patellar dislocations, except in cases where there is evidence of an osteochondral fragment. In case of the presence of an osteochondral fracture, arthroscopy is recommended for removal of the fragment or open repair according to its size. More specifically, the well-designed prospective, randomized study of Nikku <italic>et al</italic> (1997)<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(8)</sup></xref> compared surgical treatment with conservative treatment in 125 patients with two years of follow-up. The results were evaluated subjectively by the patients&#x02019; general opinion (excellent, good, reasonable and poor), by the Lysholm II score and by the visual analogue scale (VAS). The authors concluded that the surgical and conservative treatments produced almost identical results after two years in relation to the subjective scores, recurrence of instability and function. However, greater complications only occurred after surgical treatment. Conclusions based on this study are hard to reach due to the reports of conservative treatment presented by Maenpaa and Lehto (1997)<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(13)</sup></xref>, which showed that more than half of the recurrences took place two years or more after the first dislocation.</p><p>In 2005, Nikku <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(7)</sup></xref> published their randomized, prospective study over a mean period of seven years with 125 patients. The study compared the conservative treatment, with immobilization and functional rehabilitation, with proximal realignment surgery (extensor mechanism realignment, repair of the medial patellar ligaments and/or lateral release). Their clinical results were very similar between the conservative and surgical groups. For this reason, Nikku <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(7)</sup></xref> do not recommend proximal realignment surgery for the treatment of primary patellar dislocations. This case series is a randomized, prospective, level I study, with long-term follow-up that compares the surgical conduct with the closed treatment of primary patellar dislocations. Moreover, episodes of redislocation and recurrent subluxation were included in a group together, and called episodes of instability, which contributed to the slightly higher recurrence rate in our series. We believe, like Stefancin and Parker (2007)<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(1)</sup></xref>, that the difference in surgical procedures makes it impossible to compare the two studies of Nikku <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(7)</sup></xref> and our study. As observed in many other surgical procedures, the results of the series of cases of MPFL repair appear to overestimate the success rates when compared with those of the randomized trials. Moreover, a wide range of different surgical procedures was carried out in the surgical group in the study conducted by Nikku <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(7)</sup></xref>. Surgical intervention in 10% of the patients consisted of isolated lateral release. In an additional 81% of the patients, the medial retinaculum was repaired or duplicated, but the MPFL was not specifically used. Consequently, these results should not be extrapolated for procedures that involve repair or reconstruction of the MPFL. Finally, the trial of Nikku <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(7)</sup></xref> included both adults and children.</p><p>Another prospective and comparative, yet nonrandomized study, was that of Sillanpaa <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(12)</sup></xref>. Our criticism consists of the fact that the magnetic resonance scan was only performed in the conservative group and the fixation of the surgical group was only performed in the patella. Another two comparative studies were those of Palmu <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(14)</sup></xref> and Buchner <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(9)</sup></xref>. However, the first only studied patellofemoral dislocation in children and adolescents and the second is a retrospective study in which the authors excluded the patients with predisposing factors shown in the radiographies.</p><p>Finally, a recent randomized, prospective study was that of Christiansen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(6)</sup></xref>. The main criticism of the study is that the patients from the surgical group were submitted to ligament repair on average 50 days after the traumatic episode and the lesion was fixed only at the femoral site.</p><p>We recently presented a nonrandomized prospective study comparing conservative treatment with MPFL repair<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(15)</sup></xref>. In spite of the better rates of subjective scores and the lower number of recurrences of the surgical group in comparison to the conservative group, two patients presented subluxations with the same minimum follow-up time as our study on MPFL reconstruction.</p><p>Our study is the first randomized, prospective study comparing conservative treatment with a technique for reconstruction (and not repair) of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) described previously by Camanho <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(10)</sup></xref>. We believe that MPFL reconstruction is the most appropriate form of surgical intervention for treating an acute traumatic patellar dislocation, since despite the controversy involving the site where the MPFL lesion occurs<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, there are studies showing that intrasubstance injury of the MPFL is not infrequent<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(17)</sup></xref>. In his article, Nomura<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(18)</sup></xref> showed the site of the MPFL injury through open exploration carried out on 27 knees after acute patellar dislocation. The MPFL suffered avulsion of its femoral origin in 10 knees, and one intrasubstance tear of the ligament was identified in another 16 knees. Sillanpaa <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(12)</sup></xref> observed an internal tear in the substance of the MPFL in 10 patients (23%) in their study. In our clinical practice, the NMR often evidences a focal lesion on the femur or patella; however, we also observe signal alteration in the ligament in many cases, either due to a partial or total lesion, or just distension of the MPFL. This could indicate that repair and reinsertion of the MPFL at the AT, which is the insertion site of the MPFL, or failure in the identification and correction of the incompetence of the MPFL at the rupture site would compromise reasonable surgical treatment, which is also proposed by Christiansen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(6)</sup></xref> and Hautamaa <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(19)</sup></xref>, respectively.</p><p>Another aspect that we view as yet another advantage of reconstruction in relation to MPFL repair is the fact that it heals in an elongated manner, as proposed by Arendt <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(20)</sup></xref> in a review article of 2002.</p><p>Some case series present results that are also encouraging with the reconstruction of MPFL in the treatment of acute patellar dislocation<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(16)</sup></xref>. The importance of associating techniques that recreate the anatomy and biomechanics of the MPFL is essential in surgery.

The direction of the fibers of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) and its anatomic relationship with the intramuscular septum proximally, and with the adductor magnus tendon distally, allow the VMO to traction the patella in oblique direction and thus to work as a dynamic medial stabilizer of the patella.</p><p>In relation to our technique, we believe that lateral release should never be executed in acute cases. According to literature, the role of lateral release is not clear when combined with surgery of medial patellar structures<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. It was concluded that the performance of the lateral release in unstable patellae does not improve the clinical results, while this procedure can be beneficial for unstable and painful patellae.</p><p>The role of lateral release is not clear, but Desio <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(25)</sup></xref> suggested that lateral release may even increase lateral patellar instability, since their biomechanical study found that the lateral retinaculum contributes 10% to the retention strength. It is not known whether the lateral release performed in this study caused any effect on patellar instability. It was presumed that lateral release could cause additional instability in the hypermobile patellar joint. In this study, however, the dislocations were primary traumatic lesions and no hypermobile patellar joint was found<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.</p><p>Although recent review studies still consider conservative treatment the first option, some studies associate this treatment with evolution to recurrences<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. In 1979, McManus <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(32)</sup></xref> published a study on the natural history of acute patellar dislocation. Recurrent dislocations occurred in 15% of the patients, with an additional 33% of patients experiencing sensations of instability or apprehension. Hawkins <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(33)</sup></xref> also gave an account of the natural history of acute patellar dislocation. Redislocation occurred in 15% of the patients, and a sensation of insecurity or knee instability persisted in another 20% of the patients. Maenpaa and Lehto<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(13)</sup></xref> monitored 100 patients treated nonoperatively after patellar dislocation for 13 years on average. Forty-four percent of the patients presented recurrence, and another 19% presented recurrence of subluxation and patellofemoral pain.</p><p>Surprisingly, there is little evidence in relation to the conservative treatment of primary patellar dislocation<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(2)</sup></xref>. Treatment protocols range from immediate mobilization without the use of a brace to plaster cast immobilization in extension for six weeks. Immobilization in extension could provide the medial structures, particularly the MPFL, with a better means of achieving their healing. However, this entails the stiffness that frequently accompanies prolonged immobilization. The patient's adhesion can also be a factor in the decision for conservative treatment. For these reasons, many clinicians decide on a short period of immobilization followed by knee rehabilitation with or without a brace.</p><p>In our study, in the conservative treatment group, the patients remained in extension with the brace for three weeks followed by physiotherapy focused on range of motion and quadriceps strengthening.</p><p>Articular cartilage lesions are more common than previously believed and were reported in about 10% to 40% of the cases<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(9)</sup></xref>; however, according to Nomura<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(18)</sup></xref>, this incidence can be as high as 95% of primary patellar dislocations. What we take into account is the fragment size and the intraoperative evaluation of the need to fix the lesion. In our study, we excluded two patients with osteochondral fragments (diameter &#x0003e; 15 mm) that required fixation.</p><p>As regards our results, we consider the superiority of the results of the reconstruction group plainly obvious in comparison to the conservative group, both in relation to recurrence (and consequently instability) and in relation to the specific Kujala patellofemoral score.</p><p>As regards the Kujala score, our results upon quantitative analysis showed a clear advantage of the reconstruction group.</p><p>According to a study by Sillanpaa <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(12)</sup></xref>, the Kujala score can be analyzed qualitatively: with a maximum possible score of 100 points (without symptoms), a rating of 95 points or more is excellent; 94 to 85, good; 84 to 65, reasonable; and 64 or less, poor. Analyzing our sample this way, we still evidenced superiority of the surgical group in the results of this score.</p><p>Our study presents some points to be criticized: firstly due to the short follow-up time (in spite of the minimum period of two years) for us to evaluate mainly the recurrence rate. There is a tendency for redislocation with a longer follow-up time, both in the conservative and in the surgical series<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. The short follow-up of the surgical series can explain the better results obtained after primary surgery.</p><p>The second criticism is our failure to separate the cases of patients with predisposing factors considered in literature. In this study we really did not analyze the predisposing factors. However, a recent study by our service clearly demonstrates that the predisposing factors did not influence the results<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(15)</sup></xref>. As the reconstruction study followed the repair study we did not consider predisposing factors.</p><p>Finally, another criticism concerns the number of patients studied when compared with other studies in literature<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. However, we believe that our statistical analysis presented power of comparison in relation to the score used since it was necessary for the sample size to be at least 16 patients per study group and for this to have been calculated with power of 90%, and type I error (a) of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We were able to conclude that the treatment with reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament with the patellar tendon produced better results, based on the analyses of post-treatment recurrences and on the better end results of the Kujala questionnaire after a minimum follow-up of two years.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stefancin</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>First-time traumatic patellar dislocation: a systematic review</article-title><source>Clin Orthop Relat Res</source><volume>455</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>93</fpage><lpage>101</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17279039</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mehta</surname><given-names>VM</given-names></name><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Nomura</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Fithian</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An algorithm guiding the evaluation and treatment of acute primary patellar dislocations</article-title><source>Sports Med Arthrosc</source><volume>15</volume><issue>2</issue><year>2007</year><fpage>78</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17505322</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmad</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>BE</given-names></name><name><surname>Matuz</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Immediate surgical repair of the medial patellar stabilizers for acute patellar dislocation.
