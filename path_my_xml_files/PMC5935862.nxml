Insulin resistance is a major pathway to the development of T2DM <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and it is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The rapid rise in T2DM burden in recent decades has been attributed to a deterioration in diet quality <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, increase in obesity prevalence <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and reduction of physical activity <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Dietary prevention of T2DM has largely focused on nutrients and food groups <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, but evidence is emerging that the choice of beverages, such as coffee, can also affect the development of T2DM.</p><p id="p0230">Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Clues to the potential beneficial effect of coffee against T2DM were first published in 2002 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Since 2002, more than 20 prospective cohort studies conducted in the U.S., Asia, and Europe showed an inverse association between coffee intake and T2DM <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In a recent meta-analysis, coffee intake was inversely associated with T2DM risk in a dose-dependent manner with 4 cups/day being associated with a 25% lower risk <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although observational studies statistically adjusted for confounders, residual confounding by unmeasured or imperfectly measured confounders may persist, affecting the accuracy of results. Therefore, randomized trials are needed to provide more conclusive evidence about the effect of coffee on glucose homeostasis. In addition, trials can include detailed measurements that provide insights into the biological mechanisms that may underlie the putative effect of coffee on risk of T2DM.</p><p id="p0235">Data on the modulation of glucose homeostasis by coffee from trials are limited. Limitations include small sample sizes, lack of a suitable placebo beverage to facilitate blinding, short follow-up periods, and the use of surrogate insulin sensitivity measures. In the trials conducted by Kempf et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and Wedick et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> that evaluated 12 and 8 weeks of coffee consumption respectively, no change in insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance was observed, but adiponectin levels significantly increased after coffee consumption. Ohnaka et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, in a 16-week trial reported a decrease in 2-h glucose levels after coffee consumption although no change in insulin sensitivity was observed. In a crossover trial, van Dam et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> reported an increase in fasting insulin levels after very high coffee consumption, which could reflect either an increase in insulin resistance or reduced insulin clearance. Furthermore, by assessing fasting hepatic glucose production in a 2-week randomized crossover trial, Lecoultre et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> concluded that coffee attenuated fructose-induced hepatic insulin resistance.</p><p id="p0240">Thus, results from conducted coffee trials have been inconclusive. We therefore designed the Coffee for Metabolic Health (COMETH) study, a double-blind randomized trial, with an aim to investigate the longer term (24 weeks) effects of coffee on insulin sensitivity in overweight participants using the gold standard technique of hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. In addition, with a larger sample size and a coffee-like placebo beverage to facilitate masking, we sought to overcome the limitations of previous trials. In this article, we describe the rationale, methodology and baseline characteristics of participants in the COMETH study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Aims and hypothesis</title><p id="p0245">The primary aim of the COMETH study was to examine the effects of 24 weeks of regular coffee consumption on insulin sensitivity in adults who were at higher risk of developing T2DM.

<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A 2-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure was carried out after an overnight fast. During the clamp procedure, participants were intravenously saturated with exogenous insulin at a high infusion rate (40&#x000a0;mU of insulin per m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area per min). This results in increased glucose disposal [uptake into peripheral tissues; mainly skeletal muscles (&#x0223c;85%)] <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>
<italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> while hepatic glucose production is suppressed. Concurrently, exogenous glucose was infused to replenish the increased glucose disposal mediated by insulin infusion. Using a bedside glucose analyzer (YSI Incorporated, USA), the rate of glucose infusion was adjusted at 5-min intervals to maintain euglycemic levels (5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L). Blood samples were obtained at 0, 90 and 120&#x000a0;min to determine plasma insulin levels for HOMA-IR and metabolized glucose (M-value) computations. By maintaining a euglycemic steady-state, the rate of glucose infusion would reflect the rate of systemic glucose disposal into peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscles. Therefore, individuals with slower rates of glucose infusion (i.e. lower M values) are acknowledged to be more resistant to insulin than individuals with faster rates of infusion.</p><p id="p0495">The GIR over the final 30&#x000a0;min of the clamp procedure reflects the steady-state glucose disposal rate (GDR) or metabolizable glucose (M-value). The M-value is the measure of insulin sensitivity of the clamp procedure and it is typically standardized to body weight (Kg) or fat free mass (Kg); less frequently to body surface area (m<sup>2</sup>) or metabolic size (KgFFM&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;17.7) <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

Although most observational studies statistically address confounding, residual confounding may persist. Randomized trials are therefore needed to provide more conclusive evidence. However, to date, few trials have been conducted to investigate the effect of coffee on glucose metabolism <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, trials conducted thus far had limitations such as small sample sizes, lack of randomization or blinding, short duration of follow-up and use of surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity. Therefore, we designed the COMETH study, a randomized placebo-controlled 6-month trial that examined the effect of consuming 4 cups of coffee per day for 24 weeks on insulin sensitivity assessed with a glucose clamp.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Recruitment</title><p id="p0630">According to our sample size calculations, we had planned to recruit and enroll 130 participants after accounting for an expected dropout rate of 20% to obtain a minimum sample size of 104. Recruitment for coffee trial was challenging, because it required the selection of participants who were willing to either consume 4 cups of coffee for 6 months or consume only the placebo beverage for six months. Long-term adherence to coffee consumption requires selection of persons who regularly consume coffee. However, given the strict inclusion and exclusion parameters, recruitment of subjects proved to be challenging from the commencement of study activities. As such, we expanded the scope and increased the intensity of recruitment activities and achieved a total enrolment of 128 participants by the enrolment deadline.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="p0635">This study had several strengths. Firstly, this study was double-blinded. Central to masking was the production of a well-designed placebo beverage that tastes, smells and looks like coffee unlike in previous trials <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, where water was used. This allowed the aversion of subconscious or conscious preconceptions in investigators, thereby minimizing diagnostic suspicion bias in the assessment of insulin sensitivity. In addition, the blinded placebo group allowed us to account for a possible Hawthorne effect because lifestyle modifications, such as those culminating in weight changes, could influence insulin sensitivity. Importantly, the placebo beverage allows for a standardized replacement of coffee, otherwise, people who typically consume coffee may be tempted to drink some other beverage (e.g. tea or malt beverages) instead of water.</p><p id="p0640">This study provided a larger sample size and a longer duration of intervention and follow up. Previous trials <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> were relatively short ranging from 2 to 16 weeks with sample sizes ranging from 26 to 49 subjects. The longer intervention period with greater statistical power increases the likelihood that we will be able detect longer term effects of coffee on insulin sensitivity.</p><p id="p0645">An important advantage of this study over previous trials was the employment of the gold standard measure of insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) to assess the potential influence of coffee on the risk of diabetes. Previous trials <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> had relied on surrogate measures such as the HOMA-IR or the Composite Insulin Sensitivity Index (CISI) <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> derived from fasting glucose and insulin data or data from an oral glucose tolerance test.</p><p id="p0650">The 4-week run-in period not only conferred a washout period but also enabled us to evaluate long-term tolerance to caffeine depletion among participants who are habitual coffee drinkers. Given the relatively longer intervention period compared to earlier trials, the run-in period was critical in identifying overt non-compliers who had problems abstaining from coffee consumption and were likely to drop out from the study should they be enrolled.</p><p id="p0655">Several limitations of our study should also be noted. Because the extent of glucose disposal in adipose tissues remains unclear, previous studies based on glucose clamps have typically reported insulin sensitivity measures standardized to both body weight and fat free mass <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In our study, because of logistical reasons, we did not include &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; assessments of FFM such as DXA scans and we will therefore only report body weight standardized M-values as the primary outcome while the M/I ratios and FFM standardized insulin sensitivity measures will be reported as secondary outcomes.</p><p id="p0660">Due to methodological reasons (see section <xref rid="sec2.9" ref-type="sec">2.9</xref>), we decided to slightly change our primary outcome from M/I<sub>ffm</sub> to M<sub>bw</sub>. It is unclear how this change will affect our statistical power. On the one hand not dividing by insulin values may increase our power as M<sub>bw</sub> is not affected by additional measurement error in the assessment of insulin concentrations <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. On the other hand, it may reduce our power if fluctuations in insulin concentrations during the final phase of the clamp introduce extraneous variation. It is less likely that the use of body weight instead of fat free mass in the calculation will have a substantial impact as we do not expect the coffee intervention to affect body composition.</p><p id="p0665">Although this study required abstention from coffee consumption, covert non-compliance (silent drop outs or drop-ins) is a possibility given the ubiquitous availability of coffee. Inadvertent consumption of coffee among placebo group subjects or abstention of study product use among coffee group subjects could potentially diminish the effect of coffee in our study. We employed several strategies to assess compliance bias such as counting of unused study beverage sachets and the use of a study diary. Still, these methods rely on cooperation of subjects and complementary objective biomarkers of compliance would have been preferable. Unfortunately, identifying biomarkers that specific to coffee proved to be difficult. Chlorogenic acid metabolites, although not specific to coffee, will be measured and used as a marker for compliance at a group level.</p><p id="p0670">Incomplete blinding is a possibility because our recruited participants are habitual coffee drinkers who could recognize the effects of caffeine. At the end of the study, we will ask subjects to guess which arm they had been randomized to and this will inform us whether blinding was successful.</p><p id="p0675">Given the randomized controlled and double-blind nature of our trial, the measurement error in insulin sensitivity assessment in participants is unlikely to differ between the coffee and the placebo group. As a result, this measurement error is likely to underestimate the treatment effect.</p><p id="p0680">Finally, we investigated the possible efficacy of coffee in improving insulin sensitivity in a population consisting of non-diabetic, non-smoking, Chinese, Malay and Asian Indians. As a result, our results may not be generalizable to persons with diabetes, smokers, or other ethnic groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Interpretation of outcomes</title><p id="p0685">There are three possible outcomes in our study. Firstly, we may find no difference in insulin sensitivity over the 24-week period between the placebo and coffee groups. This would suggest that there is no evidence of coffee's beneficial influence on insulin sensitivity. One explanation could be that our study was not sufficiently powered or the follow duration was not long enough to observe the appreciable effects of coffee on insulin sensitivity. Another explanation could be that the association seen in observation studies could have been due to coffee modulating diabetes risk through pathways other than that involving insulin sensitivity. A null finding could also indicate that coffee may act in a later stage of diabetes development when individuals are more insulin-resistant or have pre-diabetes.</p><p id="p0690">Secondly, we may find that the improvement of insulin sensitivity in the placebo group is significantly greater than the coffee group. Such a result would be in conflict with our hypothesis that coffee could reduce diabetes risk. A previous report had indicated that caffeine adversely affects glucose metabolism by reducing insulin sensitivity following acute administration <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. So, an increase in insulin resistance among the coffee group could reflect a long term persistent adverse effect of caffeine on glucose metabolism.</p><p id="p0695">Thirdly, we may find that the improvement of insulin sensitivity in the coffee group is significantly greater than the placebo group. This would corroborate the abundance of observational studies in which coffee consumption was inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Such a result would suggest that 24 weeks of daily coffee intake is sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity. Importantly, this evidence would suggest that coffee modulates type 2 diabetes risk through biological mechanisms that involve insulin sensitivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Trial status</title><p id="p0700">As of October 2015, enrollment of participants and data collection are complete.
