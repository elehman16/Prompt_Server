Among 458 patients (364 men, mean age 76 years), who had either EVAR (<italic>n</italic> = 177) or open repair (<italic>n</italic> = 281) started, there were 155 deaths and 88 re-interventions within 30 days of randomization analysed according to a pre-specified plan. The mean maximum aortic diameter was 8.6 cm. There were no substantial correlations between the six morphological variables. Aneurysm neck length was shorter in those undergoing open repair (vs. EVAR).

However, aortic morphology, likely to be a key factor controlling the success of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for ruptured aneurysms, has not been investigated in detail previously. Aortic morphology also might be an important factor in open repair as suggested by a retrospective review of &#x0003e;200 cases of open repair for aneurysm rupture in a single Swiss centre.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Nearly, all patients with rAAA undergo computerized tomography (CT) scan, so that aortic morphology can be assessed rapidly. One liberal definition of suitability for endovascular repair, which has been used by laboratories for centralized assessment of CT scans, includes an aneurysm neck length &#x02265; 10 mm, neck diameter &#x0003c;32 mm, and neck angle &#x0003c;60&#x000b0;.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The Swiss study indicated that the 30-day mortality for open repair of patients outside this definition was increased by 8- to 9-fold compared with those within this definition,<sup><xref rid="EHU521C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> whereas a Dutch study found no difference.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> There are no previous reports of whether any specific morphological features (including maximum aneurysm diameter) influence the success of either EVAR or open repair and should be used to guide the type of emergency repair selected for individual patients.</p><p>Here, this issue of how aortic morphology influences outcome of ruptured aneurysm repair, after either EVAR or open repair, is addressed using data from the IMPROVE trial.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This also extends to exploring whether aortic morphology contributed to the surprising early finding of the IMPROVE trial that women appeared to benefit more from an endovascular strategy than men.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This was an important observation, since in general the mortality of women undergoing repair of a ruptured aneurysm is higher than in men.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="EHU521C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>In the IMPROVE trial,<sup><xref rid="EHU521C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> 613 eligible patients, with an in-hospital clinical diagnosis of ruptured AAA, were randomized before anatomical suitability for EVAR had been ascertained, either to a strategy of EVAR if considered anatomically feasible or open repair. Patients who were randomized to the endovascular strategy group but following immediate CT scan were deemed to have an aortic anatomy unsuitable for EVAR were, by protocol, treated with open repair. The 613 patients derived from a total cohort of 1275 patients: half (352/672) of the non-randomized patients were moribund upon admission with repair considered futile, and died without aneurysm repair. Ethical approval for the participation in the IMPROVE trial of patients in England and Wales was from South-Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee 08/H0505/173, in Scotland from Scotland A Research Ethics Committee 08/MRE00/90 and in Canada from University of Western Ontario Health Sciences Research Ethics Board 17698. This study included all patients randomized in the IMPROVE trial,<sup><xref rid="EHU521C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> with a confirmed diagnosis of ruptured AAA, a pre-operative CT scan available for core laboratory analysis and who received an operation to repair the rupture. This group consisted of 458 patients (364 men and 94 women) <italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHU521F1">1</xref></italic>. Groups were analysed according to operation received and not by randomized group (the open repair group contains those randomized to EVAR strategy who were found to be not anatomically suitable); hence, the results presented are observational and therefore careful control of potential confounding was required. There are no ESC guidelines for the management of ruptured AAA.

In a minority of CT scans, no radiographic contrast was used (due to patient contrast allergy or the presence of renal impairment). In these cases, only limited data were recorded from the CT scans.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Analysis of CT scan data</title><p>CT scans performed within the trial were analysed at St George's Vascular Institute core laboratory using the St George's Vascular Institute Protocol<sup><xref rid="EHU521C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> to provide independent diagnosis of rupture and comprehensively characterize the aneurysm morphology. This protocol is accurate and reproducible with high levels of inter/intraobserver agreement.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The CT images were acquired in the DICOM (Digital Image and Communication in Medicine) format from the hospital archive. The DICOM files were transferred on anonymized CDs to the core lab and analysed using CT reconstruction software (3Surgery; 3Mensio Medical Imaging B.V., Bilthoven, The Netherlands). After semi-automated 3D segmentation of the aorta, a central luminal line (CLL) was defined and installed, then multiplanar reformatted images were obtained in parallel (vessel stretched) and perpendicular (orthogonal) views. A baseline was then manually identified on the stretched vessel view at the level of the lowest renal artery to start the measurements. Lengths were measured along the CLL in the stretched vessel view as the distance between two predefined anatomical landmarks. Total (external wall to external wall), luminal, and non-luminal volumes were measured semi-automatically. The following standard definitions are made:

As previously,<sup><xref rid="EHU521C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> missing data were multiply imputed before analysis using chained equations (variables used for imputation are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehu521/-/DC1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Table S1</italic></ext-link>). The analyses focused on repairs performed on aortas within and outside liberal instructions for use,<sup><xref rid="EHU521C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> as well six morphological variables: maximum AAA diameter, aneurysm neck diameter at the distal renal artery, aneurysm neck length, neck conicality, proximal neck &#x003b1;-angulation, and maximum common iliac diameter. The proximal neck &#x003b1;-angulation was selected over the distal &#x003b2;-angulation used in IFU, because of clinician preference (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; angles were correlated, <italic>&#x003c1;</italic> = 0.59). For neck conicality, the ratio of the most distal neck diameter measured (D1) to the diameter at the distal renal artery (D2) relative to the centre line distance between these two levels (L) was used. The relative change per unit length is then calculated as (D1/D2-1)/L. Logistic regression models were fitted adjusting for pre-specified confounders (age, sex, Hardman index,<sup><xref rid="EHU521C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> lowest recorded systolic blood pressure, randomized group, and treatment commenced). A further model additionally adjusted the estimates for the effect of all the other morphological variables. For the IFU analysis, odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and <italic>P</italic>-values (calculated using Wald's test) are presented, with an additional sensitivity analysis to allow for the type of anaesthesia used for patients receiving EVAR.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Each of the six morphological variables were considered as continuous covariates and odds ratios are reported based on a 1 SD increase to allow fair comparison of their relative importance. The interaction with sex was investigated in all models.

As the aneurysm neck shortens, conventional EVAR becomes either impossible or, if attempted, carries a very high mortality rate. The strong, but previously unconsidered, relationship between short aneurysm neck length and high mortality after open repair explains why mortality after open repair remains high: many of these patients have juxtarenal aneurysms. Open juxtarenal aneurysm repair requires cross-clamping of the aorta above the renal arteries, with inevitable compromise of the visceral circulation, especially in shocked patients. In contrast, for longer aneurysm necks (&#x0223c;15 mm or more), infra-renal aortic clamps can be used for open repair, with operative mortality similar to that for EVAR (&#x0223c;25%).</p><p>Most ruptured aneurysms are very large even in the presence of hypotension, mean diameter 8.6 cm in this series, compared with at least 2 cm smaller in most elective repair series<sup><xref rid="EHU521C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and a diameter of 2 cm or less in healthy infra-renal aorta. As the aneurysm increases in diameter, it might be expected that aneurysmal dilatation would extend both proximally and distally to involve a greater length of the aorta and diminish the proportion of patients within liberal IFU for EVAR (just 58% in this series). Increasing aneurysm diameter also increases the risk of complications and reinterventions after elective endovascular repair.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="EHU521C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Although the anatomical assessment of suitability for EVAR is defined primarily by neck length, diameter and angle, and access artery characteristics, it was neck length that was the most common factor precluding EVAR (&#x0003c;10 mm in 23%, &#x0003c;15 mm in 33%). For each increase of 15 mm in neck length, 30-day mortality decreased by a factor of &#x0223c;20%, with a similar effect on 24 h mortality. The design of the IMPROVE trial, where patients were randomized before assessment of anatomical suitability for EVAR, enabled the elucidation of this clinically important relationship between aneurysm neck length and mortality following aneurysm repair in patients considered eligible for repair. No conclusion can be drawn for the higher risk or moribund patients who were excluded from the trial.</p><p>This finding may help explain why population-level observational studies and meta-analyses of observational studies report that for ruptured aneurysm operative mortality for EVAR is about half that for open repair: the long aneurysm neck patients get EVAR and the short aneurysm neck patients get open repair. This follows earlier data from the EVAR-2 trial suggesting that the patients with shorter neck lengths have a much higher risk of rupture.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Randomized trials, which compare patient groups with similar aortic morphology (particularly neck length) have failed to show any difference in operative mortality between EVAR and open repair.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="EHU521C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="EHU521C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The association of short aneurysm neck length with high operative mortality for ruptured aneurysm repair also partly may explain the worse outcomes in women than men: aneurysm neck length was shorter in women and a higher proportion of women than men have short aneurysm necks or juxtarenal aneurysms and open repair is associated with a very high mortality (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHU521TB3">3</xref></italic>). The women in this series also had common iliac morphology suitable for the seal of a distal EVAR limb in the common iliac artery, whereas in men this often might have to extend into the external iliac artery. Taken together, this might begin to explain why women, who are morphologically suitable for EVAR, appear to benefit more than men from an endovascular first strategy.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The emerging hypothesis that, for ruptured aneurysms, neck length is more important than the type of repair, needs to be tested in a separate large set of unselected patients. No such data set containing sufficient numbers of both EVAR and open repair patients could be identified. However, further credence concerning the key role of neck length comes from this IMPROVE data set by comparison of 30-day mortality by intention to treat (by randomized strategy group) and as treated (mimicking an observational study), with and without adjustment for neck length. The odds ratios for 30-day mortality by intention to treat (unadjusted), as treated (unadjusted), and as treated (adjusted for neck length) were 0.87 (0.58, 1.32) <italic>P</italic> = 0.525, 0.63 (0.41, 0.97) <italic>P</italic> = 0.034, and 0.78 (0.50, 1.24) <italic>P</italic> = 0.298, respectively. The unadjusted as-treated estimate, which may be biased due to patient selection, shows a 30-day mortality benefit for EVAR, but after adjustment for aneurysm neck length there is no evidence of a difference between 30-day mortality after EVAR and open repair.</p><p>Findings from our analysis of how aneurysm morphology influenced early reintervention rates were less convincing, probably because patient and events numbers were fewer, not all reinterventions were aneurysm specific and endoleaks are uncommon within the first 30 days.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Maximum aortic diameter and common iliac diameter may emerge as important morphological parameters in analyses of longer term aneurysm-specific reinterventions. This would be consistent with the relevance of these two parameters in predicting complications after elective aneurysm repair.<sup><xref rid="EHU521C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="EHU521C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>In this era of endovascular therapy, these findings have important implications for reducing the operative mortality from ruptured aneurysm repair. First, these patients need to be treated in centres offering excellence in both endovascular and open repair. Second, future reporting of the outcome of ruptured aneurysm repair needs to be by category of neck length, for juxtarenal vs. localized infra-renal disease, with thoracoabdominal aneurysms reported separately. Third, endovascular techniques to repair short necked and juxtarenal aneurysms, including fenestrated or branched endografts, chimneys or snorkels as adjuncts to conventional EVAR and endovascular sealing technology, need to be developed and audited, to identify whether such innovations could lower operative mortality for this group of patients. Fourth, with aneurysm screening focusing largely on men, the proportion of women undergoing repair of ruptured aneurysm may increase and endografts designed for women, to increase the proportion eligible for endovascular repair, may be necessary to save lives.</p><p>In summary, aneurysm neck length rather than type of repair (endovascular or open) predicts the early survival from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>CT scan core laboratory</title><p>Anjum A.
