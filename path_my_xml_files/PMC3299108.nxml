This study was done to determine the beneficial effects of TEA on pulmonary function in elderly patients undergoing CABG surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Approval of the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent were obtained from all patients. Fifty patients between 65 and 75 years with physical status of ASA II and III scheduled for elective CABG were included in the study. Patients were randomly enrolled (sealed envelope) to receive either general anesthesia (GA group) alone or GA combined with TEA (TEA group).</p><p>Preoperative documentation of a normal prothrombin time (PT) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were required. Antiplatelet therapy was withdrawn 1 week before surgery. Exclusion criteria were local infection at the site of puncture or septicemia, pre-existing coagulopathy, redo open heart surgery, endocarditis, neurologic disorder, hepatic disease, pulmonary disease, heart failure. Upon arrival in the operating room, all the patients had an intravenous catheter (18G) inserted in a large antecubital vein and they received ringers&#x02019; solution (4&#x02013;6 ml/kg/h), ECG, peripheral oxygen saturation SPO<sub>2</sub> and noninvasive blood pressure were monitored (Kontron Kolorman, Model Number 7550, Italy). Supplemental oxygen was provided via a face mask. Patients were then premedicated with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and tramadol 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg IV under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine arterial line was inserted in radial artery under complete aseptic technique, also right internal jugular vein or subclavian vein was canulated under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine and complete aseptic technique. In the TEA group, epidural catheter was inserted through an 18G needle into the epidural space at least 2 h before heparinization at a thoracic interspace between T4 and T5, using loss of resistance technique. If blood was returned during epidural catheter placement, the epidural needle and catheter were removed and placed at T3&#x02013;T4 or T5&#x02013;T6 interspace. After a negative epidural test dose of 3 mL 1.5% lidocaine the epidural catheter was injected with 0.125% bupivacaine with 1 &#x003bc;g/mL fentanyl at a rate of 5 m/h and was continued till 24 h postoperative. Epidural block was tested by loss of sensation to cold and pinprick. Epidural catheter was removed on the postoperative day where there is no clinical evidence of bleeding. In both groups, general anesthesia was induced in all patients with fentanyl 10 &#x003bc;g/kg, thiopental 2&#x02013;3 mg/kg and pancronium 0.1 mg/kg for muscle relaxation and tracheal intubation. Patients were mechanically ventilated with 100% O<sub>2</sub> and the endtidal CO<sub>2</sub> was monitored by main stream capnography and maintained between 30 and 35 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, incremental doses of fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) to maintain heart rate (HR) and blood pressure within 20% of the basal value with a maximum dose 20 &#x003bc;g/kg and incremental doses of pancronium to maintain muscle relaxation. Normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass graft (CPBG) with a membrane oxygenator was used in all the patients. Anticoagulation with heparin 300&#x02013;400 IU/kg to maintain an activated coagulation time &#x0003e;480 s. After aortic cross clamping, all the patients received cold blood cardioplegia. Cardioplegia was delivered 20 mL/kg for the first dose and 10 mL/kg for the subsequent doses in antegrade manner in aortic root. Surface cooling using packed iced saline was used. Cardioplegia was repeated every 30 min. Anesthesia was maintained on CPB by propofol infusion 200 mg in 100 mL dextrose 5% in a dose of 50&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;g/kg/min after adding 2 mg/kg to the CPB prime. Heparin anticoagulation was reversed with protamine at the end of CPB. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the patients were ventilated with a servo-ventilated. They received as needed, tramadol 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg IV; they were warmed with a warming blanket until central temperature was 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Extubation criteria included an adequate level of consciousness and muscle strength, stable cardiovascular status, normothermia, adequate pulmonary function (PaO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003e;80 mmHg with fraction of inspired oxygen &#x02264;0.4) and minimal thoracotomy tube output.</p><p>Both groups received tramadol IV on demand for pain relief during the first 24 h after surgery and recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data recorded</title><p>

This may be explained by the aggressive use of a wide variety of effective interventions to treat unfavorable measured changes in cardiovascular function. Also, Mehta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and Salvi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] reported that TEA had no significant changes in MAP, HR, CI, or systemic vascular resistance (SVR).</p><p>The total dose of intraoperative fentanyl was significantly lower in the TEA than in the GA group.

Sympathetic blockade in patients with coronary artery disease as it leads to optimization of oxygen demand/supply in the already impaired myocardium with resultant enhanced coronary perfusion and enhanced coronary perfusion and enhanced ventricular functions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Patients in the TEA group had statistically significant improvement in pulmonary function tests compared with GA group, probably due to better analgesia, as evidenced by lower VAS values, and use of 0.0125% bupivacaine, which is unlikely to produce motor block.</p><p>These findings are consistent with Gruber <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] and Steneth <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] who found better pulmonary function test values after thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing CABG surgery.</p><p>As regard postoperative complications, nausea and vomiting were more frequent in the TEA than in the GA group. This in accordance with Goodarzi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] who found that nausea and vomiting were more frequent in the epidural morphine than the other group; this may be due to the rostral spread of epidural morphine to the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Three patients in the TEA group developed pruritus, which may be due to histamine release, activation of peripheral opioid receptor, or production of excitatory morphine metabolites.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Although these side effects occurred more likely with morphine, they might be due to fentanyl[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] or tramadol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>We conclude that old age is an important risk factor for impairment of pulmonary function in patients undergoing CABG surgery. TEA reduced severity of postoperative pulmonary function and restoration was faster in TEA group. Also, earlier extubation and awakening, better analgesia, lower VAS, better recovery of pulmonary function tests with no significant adverse effects. We recommend the use of TEA in elderly patients undergoing CABG due to its advantages, absence of potential risk associated with this technique, and high incidence of postoperative atelectasis in elderly patients. Moreover, absence of proven difference in morbidity might be explained by limited number of patients in this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
