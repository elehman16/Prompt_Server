This study examined this process in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD with an acute respiratory tract infection (RTI) enrolled in a 12-week, randomized clinical trial (TICARI 1; NCT01483625), originally designed to examine the efficacy and safety of once-daily tiotropium 18 &#x000b5;g in this population. Symptomatic recovery was assessed using the EXAcerbation of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT), a 14-item diary completed by patients each evening, to assess the severity of breathlessness, cough, sputum, chest symptoms, sleep disturbance, feeling week or tired, and feeling worried or concerned. Over 12 weeks, 49.3% of patients recovered without a relapse, 29.3% recovered and subsequently relapsed, and 21.4% had persistent symptoms (ie, did not meet the recovery criteria). Results were consistent across health outcomes, including health status, dyspnea, activity limitation, and work productivity. The study findings suggest that a significant portion of newly diagnosed and treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients have difficulty recovering from an acute RTI. Further study of the short- and long-term effects of these events and the effectiveness of various treatment options is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often undetected or under-diagnosed until it has progressed to more advanced stages.<xref rid="b1-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This may be due, in part, to difficulty recognizing that the symptoms, such as cough, sputum production, and/or shortness of breath, may signal respiratory impairment in need of diagnosis and treatment. Patients may underestimate or understate their symptoms, assuming that they are due to normal aging, body weight, smoking, or other factors. Progressive airflow limitation may only become evident to the patient and clinician when the respiratory system is challenged by an acute respiratory tract infection (RTI). These events can be viewed as opportunities for clinicians to diagnose COPD and to initiate maintenance therapy in patients who are more aware of their condition and are at risk for repeated acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD).<xref rid="b2-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Little is known about AECOPD and the effect of treatment in newly diagnosed and treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with COPD. In studies of patients with an established COPD diagnosis, recovery times have been shown to be longer in individuals with moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction who have more pronounced decline in lung function during the event and, in some cases, recovery is incomplete.<xref rid="b6-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In a study of COPD patients with moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction, recovery time became longer and symptoms more frequent during an AECOPD as the disease progressed.<xref rid="b3-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Patients with sudden onset of AECOPD were found to have more respiratory symptoms, but a shorter recovery time, compared with those with gradual onset of AECOPD.<xref rid="b7-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The extent to which the addition of COPD maintenance treatment to RTI treatment improves pulmonary function and alters the trajectory of recovery in maintenance treatment- na&#x000ef;ve patients with COPD is unknown. Tiotropium, a long-acting anticholinergic, has been shown to improve pulmonary function, relieve symptoms, and reduce exacerbation frequency in patients with stable COPD<xref rid="b8-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> (ie, patients who were exacerbation free for 4 or 6 weeks prior to randomization). The Tiotropium In COPD patients with an Acute Respiratory Infection 1 (TICARI 1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01483625) trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tiotropium in maintenance treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with COPD presenting to the outpatient clinic with symptoms of an acute RTI. Unfortunately, the study was terminated early due to difficulties in patient recruitment, resulting in inadequate statistical power to detect treatment differences. However, the data collected provided an opportunity to examine the course of AECOPD from diagnoses to week 12 in this little-studied patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Original study design</title><p>TICARI 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase IV trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tiotropium in patients with acute RTI symptoms, who were either newly diagnosed with COPD at study entry or had a previous diagnosis and maintenance treatment na&#x000ef;ve for &#x02265;6 months pre-randomization. The study design is detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-13-1515">Figure 1</xref>. The study was conducted in the United States in primary care practices.

Patients, meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, were randomized at visit 1 in a 1:1 ratio to tiotropium bromide 18 &#x000b5;g or placebo, delivered via HandiHaler&#x000ae; (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany). Doses were self-administered once daily in the morning for 12 weeks, and patients were followed for an additional 30&#x000b1;3 days from the last dose. The target randomization sample size of 300 patients was not achieved, despite an enrolment period extension, resulting in inadequate power to achieve statistical significance in the primary efficacy endpoint, trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>). Data from 140 subjects across treatment groups were available for exploratory analyses.</p><p>The study was approved by Chesapeake Research Review, Inc., Columbia, MD, USA (IRB00000790) and by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA (IRB00010346).

Patients were also excluded if they received COPD maintenance treatment during the 6 months pre-randomization; specifically, therapy with any long-acting bronchodilator, short-acting anticholinergic, inhaled corticosteroid, or maintenance use of systemic corticosteroids for &#x0003e;14 consecutive days for respiratory indications.</p><p>Patients were issued an electronic diary (eDiary [In2itive&#x02122; device; Vitalograph, Maids Moreton, UK]) at visit 1, to use during the study.</p><p>During the study, patients received usual care for an acute RTI, including antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids. They were also provided with rescue medication (open-label albuterol hydrofluoroalkanes metered-dose inhaler), which could be used at any time during the trial for symptom relief. Only the albuterol provided by the trial sponsor was allowed for rescue medication.

The test has eight items assessing cough, phlegm (mucus) production, chest tightness, breathlessness when going up hills/stairs, activity limitation at home, confidence in leaving home, sleep, and energy. Subjects rate each item on a scale of 0&#x02013;5; item responses are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 40; where higher scores denote worse health status. The minimum clinically important change score is estimated to be 2 points,<xref rid="b23-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and a difference of 4.7 units between stable and exacerbating patients with COPD has been reported.<xref rid="b20-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The FACIT-SF for dyspnea and functional limitation<xref rid="b21-copd-13-1515" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> is a 20-item questionnaire with two components. One component assesses dyspnea severity over the past 7 days while the second quantifies its effect on the performance of 10 common everyday tasks. For severity, patients rate their dyspnea in relation to specific tasks, with scores ranging from 0 (no shortness of breath) to 3 (severely short of breath). For functional limitation, patients describe how difficult it was to perform the tasks, with scores ranging from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (much difficulty). For both the sections, if a task is not undertaken because of dyspnea it is scored 3, otherwise it is counted as a missing value. Raw scores for each section range from 0 to 30, which are converted to scale scores (dyspnea, 27.7&#x02013;75.9 and functional limitation, 29.7&#x02013;76.7).

Lost work days, work impairment, and activity impairment over the 12-week treatment period were also assessed (WPAI).

Due to recruitment difficulties, the study was underpowered to detect treatment differences.

Patients included in the study presented with symptoms of acute RTI and were evaluated clinically; however, no laboratory tests for specific pathogens were performed. At visit 1 (baseline), 12 patients had airflow obstruction determined by spirometry, but on repeat spirometry at visit 5, they did not meet the GOLD criteria for airflow obstruction and were therefore unclassified. The patients had to demonstrate obstruction after four puffs of albuterol, thus excluding those patients with mild RTI-related bronchoconstriction. Patients with a history of smoking &#x02265;100 cigarettes over their lifetime was considered an inclusion criteria; however, this level of smoking could be considered mild, as generally most patients thought to be at risk of COPD have a &#x02265;10 pack-year smoking history. In this study, the proportion of patients with a &#x0003c;10 pack-year smoking history was only 5.7%. Furthermore, no association between smoking status (active vs former) and recovery status was observed.</p><p>Further investigation on the initiation of maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed or treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients and patterns of recovery from exacerbations in this population is warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AECOPD recovery time for these newly diagnosed and maintenance treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients was at least 5 days, with around half experiencing relapse or persistent symptoms over the 12-week follow-up.
