Conversion rate was 4.7% for the H group, which was significantly lower than the 33% conversion rate for the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). Post-operative morbidity rates differed slightly: 19% and 23% in the H and control groups, respectively (p=ns).

It should be noted, however, that these trials reported difficulties associated with laparoscopic-open conversion.</p><p>While the surgeon&#x02019;s experience plays a vital role in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammation, the employed surgical technology is also of crucial importance.</p><p>The HARMONIC SCALPEL&#x000ae; (H) is the leading ultrasonic cutting and coagulating surgical device, ensuring minimal charring, desiccation, and lateral thermal tissue damage.</p><p>Harmonic scalpel technology reduces ligature demand during simultaneous cutting and coagulation. Additionally, unlike conventional monopolar diathermy, patients are not exposed to electric currents to complete the device circuit, which increases the instrument&#x02019;s safety. The harmonic scalpel features greater precision near vital structures and produces minimal smoke, thereby improving visibility in the immediate surgical field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Several retrospective studies have demonstrated important advantages of harmonic scalpel use in laparoscopic cholecystectomies, including more effective hemostatic and biliostatic support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>However, there are currently no prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the advantages of the harmonic scalpel (H) compared to conventional monopolar diathermy (MD) during laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) in cases of acute cholecystitis (AC).</p><p>Our preliminary experience with a series of 101 cases of H-mediated laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address acute cholecystitis (AC) demonstrated a lower conversion rate (without significantly increasing morbidity rates) compared to a control group of 100 patients who underwent VLC for AC without H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this study, the mean VLC operating time for the H group was 71.4+/&#x02212;14.3&#x000a0;minutes (range: 42&#x02013;112 minutes) compared to 87.4+/&#x02212;10.8&#x000a0;minutes for the control group (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Similarly, blood loss was significantly lower in the H group than it was in the MD control group. For the H group, the intra-operative conversion rate was 4.9%; the mortality rate was 1%; and the post-operative morbidity rate was 7.9%, all of which were less than or equal to the conversion, mortality, and morbidity rates of the control group: 12%, 1%, and 9%, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;ns).</p><p>Given this encouraging preliminary data, we designed and implemented the HAC Trial to verify these results.</p><p>This RCT was designed to test the hypothesis that, compared to conventional monopolar diathermy (MD), the harmonic scalpel (H) can effectively reduce intra-operative laparoscopic-open conversion rates for laparoscopic cholecystecomies in cases of acute cholecystitis without adversely affecting rates of post-operative morbidity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The HAC study is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Large clamps were inserted through a 5&#x000a0;mm right lower port to achieve a secure hold on the gallbladder. In the MD (control) group, the cystic artery and duct were clip-ligated; however, in the H group, the cystic artery and duct were closed directly by H-mediated action. There was no instrumental &#x0201c;cross over&#x0201d; between the experimental (H) and control (MD) groups; for patients in the control group, surgeons only used monopolar diathermy, while in the H group, surgeons used the harmonic scalpel exclusively. The gallbladder and intra-peritoneally "dropped" stones were collected in an endoscopic retrieval bag and extracted through the umbilical port site, which was widened for removal if necessary. A closed system suction drain was placed intra-abdominally and later removed on post-operative day 1. Fascial closure was only applied at the umbilical port site, while dermal incisions at all other port sites were closed with staples. The decision to undergo intra-operative conversion to laparotomy was made by the attending surgeon, and the circumstances of each conversion were documented in detail.

This information was then entered into continuous or categorical variable databases, as appropriate, for further statistical analysis. Following the surgical procedure, a normal sterile dressing was applied to cover the abdomen. A second surgical team, aware of the intra-operative findings but blind to the surgical dissection instrument, then assumed care of the patient. This second team was also responsible for post-operative care and hospital discharge, evaluating the clinical outcome of patients during their recovery. During the recovery phase, the initial surgical team was always available for consultation in the event of an emergency.</p><p>Patients were deemed ready for discharge upon fulfillment of comprehensive evaluation criteria: 1) apyrexia, 2) absence of diseases requiring hospitalization, 3) return of bowel function, and 4) patient compliance. No placebo drugs were used in the course of this study. No incentives were offered to the patients to encourage surgery or follow-up assessments. The patients were free to withdraw from the study at any time.</p><p>The study&#x02019;s primary objective was to demonstrate the ability of the harmonic scalpel (H) to reduce intra-operative conversion rates compared to the conventional monopolar diathermy (MD) approach during laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) in cases of acute cholecystits (AC); it also sought to highlight any significant differences regarding morbidity and mortality rates, operating time, and hospitalization.

Both the duration of surgery and the length of post-operative hospitalization were lower in the delayed cholecystectomy group, while the length of overall hospital stay was lower in the early cholecystectomy group.</p><p>The meta-analysis conducted by Gurusamy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] analyzed the results of 5 RCT&#x02019;s involving a total of 451 patients. No statistically significant differences were reported in the <italic>outcomes</italic> of the 2 groups; even the conversion rates and the incidence of iatrogenic lesions of CBD were comparable. 17.5% of the patients in the late VLC group developed recurrent cholecystitis and, among them, 40% had undergone intra-operative conversion to an <italic>open</italic> procedure. Additionally, post-operative hospitalization was on average 3&#x000a0;days shorter in the early VLC group compared to the late VLC group. However, it should be noted that the power of these studies was not strong enough to determine the rarest <italic>outcomes</italic>, such as those involving iatrogenic lesions.</p><p>The meta-analysis conducted by Lau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in 2007 included 204 patients and discovered evidence of failed non-surgical treatment in 23% of cases in the late VLC group; the study also found a statistically significant decrease in hospitalization (1.12&#x000a0;days) for patients in the early VLC group with no significant differences in duration of surgery, conversion rate, or morbidity rates.</p><p>The latest meta-analysis was conducted by Shikata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and overviewed 1,014 cases. No statistically significant differences were reported in the conversion rates between the early and late treatment groups, but post-operative hospitalization was significantly shorter for patients in the early VLC group.</p><p>As previously noted, these meta-analyses demonstrate that early VLC correlates with shorter hospitalization and reduced recurrence rates without increasing morbidity rates.</p><p>The <italic>Tokyo Guidelines</italic> confirmed the clinical advantages of early VLC. These guidelines also introduced a classification system of cholecystitic severity in incremental stages, highlighting the importance of draining high risk patients while allowing for delayed surgery for patients with mild, early stage, cholecystitis due to the scheduling constraints of surgical facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>These meta-analyses endorse a laparoscopic approach to treating acute cholecystitis; evidence supporting this approach is derived from 2 prospective RCTs comparing open and laparoscopic cholecystectomies.</p><p>The first of these studies (Johansson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) noted no difference in post-operative pain, morbidity, or recovery time. The intra-operative laparoscopic-open conversion rate was 22.8%; this metric was, by definition, only applicable to the laparoscopic treatment group. Further, the duration of surgery proved significantly longer in the laparoscopy group than in the open group (90 and 80&#x000a0;minutes, respectively) without differences in the median post-operative length of hospitalization (2&#x000a0;days in both groups).</p><p>The second study (Kiviluoto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) reported an intra-operative conversion rate of 16%, which was likely attributable to distortion of the cystohepatic (Calot&#x02019;s) triangle. Post-operative hospital stay and recovery time were both shorter in the laparoscopic group, while post-operative complications were more prevalent in the open group; no CBD iatrogenic lesions were reported in either treatment group.</p><p>Recently, a Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial was conducted by the Italian Polispecialistic Society of Young Surgeons (<italic>Acute Cholecystitis Trial Invasive Versus Endoscopic Trial</italic>; ACTIVE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], whose results will soon be published.</p><p>As previously noted, all of the RCTs cited in this study demonstrate high conversion rates, which have been confirmed by other retrospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A recent review from the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] involving 43,821 laparoscopic cholecystectomies reported a 9.4% conversion rate for emergency procedures. Similarly, in a US-based study of intra-operative laparoscopic-open conversion in cases of acute cholecystitis, the national conversion rate ranged from 5% to 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Statements by Kiviluoto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] define the AC-driven cholecystectomy as a <italic>technically demanding</italic> surgical procedure requiring <italic>experienced hands</italic>. This issue of technical difficulty in laparoscopically treated cases of acute cholecystitis continues to strain the surgical community. Similar statements were confirmed by the Tokyo Guidelines.</p><p>In cases of acute (early VLC) or chronic inflammation (delayed VLC), even minor bleeding can obscure anatomical structures and lead to intra-operative conversion. Minor bleeding is one of the most common causes of laparoscopic-open conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Given the demanding technical proficiency required of laparoscopic intervention, the surgeon&#x02019;s prior experience greatly influences the course and outcome of the procedure.</p><p>Ultrasonically activated scalpels have proved safe and effective for laparoscopic cholecystectomies, beginning with their earliest use in 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Several retrospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] have demonstrated the harmonic scalpel&#x02019;s usefulness during VLC in providing hemostatic and biliostatic support, as well as addressing malacia of the cystic duct. Further, the harmonic scalpel can facilitate clip-mediated closure with reliable sealing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A study by Power et al. further demonstrated the clinical efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed with the harmonic scalpel; in a case series, duration of surgery and blood loss were both minimal, the conversion rate was low (3.9%), and no bile duct injuries occurred. The researchers concluded that use of the harmonic scalpel greatly facilitated dissection, thereby reducing operating time and decreasing the likelihood of conversion to open surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given its reliable technical precision in difficult cases, the harmonic scalpel also facilitates the so-called <italic>dome</italic>-<italic>down cholecystectomy</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Another recent study compared laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed with either the harmonic scalpel or clip and cautery; while bile leaks and bile duct-related injuries were not observed in either group, the laparoscopic group featured shorter operating time and a lower incidence of gallbladder perforation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>The preliminary results of our prospective series of 101 cases of acute cholecystitis treated laparoscopically using the harmonic scalpel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] confirmed that the use of this instrument effectively reduced the intra-operative laparoscopic-open conversion rate without adversely affecting post-operative morbidity and mortality, although it should be noted that the difference in the conversion rate did not achieve statistical significance (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08). This discrepancy may be attributable to the higher incidence of second-stage necrotizing cholecystitis observed in the harmonic scalpel treatment group; such cases were included among those treated with early laparoscopic cholecystectomy given that they did not violate the 72-hour window between diagnosis and surgery. Higher incidence of necrotizing cholecystitis leads to a higher degree of anatomical distortion, thereby increasing the risk of conversion. As such, it can be inferred that an even lower conversion rate might have been observed in the H group had the treatment groups featured comparable pathology</p><p>These preliminary results were used to design the present RCT.</p><p>We hypothesize that the improved hemostatic and biliostatic support achieved using the harmonic scalpel reduces the incidence of intra-operative bleeding and biliary complications, which leads to lower rates of intra-operative conversion.</p><p>This reduction is likely more evident in technically demanding cases with a higher degree of anatomical-related difficulty, such as those involving necrotizing cholecystitis.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that patients in the H and MD groups with delayed admission to surgery featured comparable characteristics, namely a higher incidence of necrotizing cholecystitis.</p><p>Of these difficult cases, those in the harmonic scalpel group featured a lower conversion rate and a reduced mean intra-operative loss.</p><p>While there were no statistically significant differences in morbidity rates between the H and MD groups, this is likely attributable to the &#x0201c;protective effect&#x0201d; of the increased rate of intra-operative laparoscopic-open conversion in the MD group.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the reduced conversion rate did not necessarily result in shorter post-operative hospitalization, as evidenced by 20% of non-surgical morbidities in both treatment groups involving older patients (mean age of 71&#x000a0;years) with severe cholecystitis (necrotizing cholecystitis in 70% of severe cases).</p><p>While instances of non-surgical morbidity influenced both treatment groups, they may have had a greater affect on the H group.</p><p>In the MD group conversion rate was 33% and this value was higher than 12% reported for MD group in the preparatory retrospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Probably this outcome could be explained by the difference in necrotizing AC rate reported in the present RCT (70%) compared to necrotizing AC rate in the preparatory retrospective study (10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In necrotizing AC the procedure is more difficult and the conversion rate using MD can reach 75% as reported also by other Authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Despite the low level of statistically significant difference (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04), the HAC Trial successfully demonstrated the usefulness of the harmonic scalpel in laparoscopic cholecystectomies for necrotizing cholecystitis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of H appears to correlate with lower intra-operative conversion rates during VLC procedures in cases of acute cholecystitis (AC) without significant increases in morbidity rates or decreases in post-operative hospitalization.

The use of H is recommended in cases of gangrenous AC in order to expedite the surgical procedure and reduce the likelihood of bleeding and intra-operative conversion.</p><p>To ensure cost-effectiveness, the decision to use the harmonic scalpel should be based on the results of diagnostic laparoscopy.
