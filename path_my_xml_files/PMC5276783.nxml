on the variability of inter-joint coordination in the elderly during walking. [Subjects
and Methods] Twenty elderly participants with no recent history of orthopedic
abnormalities (age, 67.9 &#x000b1; 2.7&#x02005;years; height, 163.7 &#x000b1; 8.9&#x02005;cm; weight, 67.1 &#x000b1; 11.6&#x02005;kg) were
recruited for this study and randomly allocated to a modified Pilates exercise group or a
control group. Three-dimensional motion analysis was performed on both groups to evaluate
the effects of the Pilates exercise. [Results] There was no significant difference in the
joint variability of the ankle, knee, and hip joints between the groups, both before
training and after training. However, there was a significant increase in the hip-knee
deviation phase value in the exercise group after the program was completed, and this
increase was also significant when compared with that in the control group. [Conclusion]
This study has demonstrated that an 8-week modified Pilates exercise program can have a
positive impact on the gait of elderly participants, potentially by enhancing
neuromuscular adjustment, which may have positive implications for reducing their fall
risk.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Elderly gait</kwd><kwd>Inter-joint coordinate variability</kwd><kwd>Pilates exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pilates exercise is for making neutral spine position and involves various muscle exercises
for improving muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility. It is known that the Pilates
exercise has a positive effect on daily life, as it enhances balance and walking
capabilities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since it can aid in the
development of deep muscles such as the erector spinae, transverse abdominis, and internal
oblique muscles, it has been frequently used as a rehabilitation exercise for stabilizing
the spine and reducing back pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, many researchers have utilized a modified form of Pilates exercise involving
props for rehabilitation in the elderly and in patients with chronic stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It has been reported that this modified Pilates exercise is safe compared with ordinary
Pilates exercise. The proper level of exercise can also be adjusted as required<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, it can be useful for those with poor physical function and limited mobility,
particularly as it can be done daily at home without the added difficulty of having to visit
a rehabilitation center.</p><p>Bird and Fell<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that Pilates
exercise with props enhanced both the knee extensor and the ankle dorsiflexor muscles in
elderly participants. Other researchers have also reported that the improvement of muscular
strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility in the trunk and the lower extremities resulting
from performing Pilates exercise can enhance static/dynamic balance, which is required for
gait in daily life and in particular, it has a positive effect on reducing the fall risk
factors<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The decrease in walking ability due to reduced lower limb neuromuscular function is an
important cause of falls in the elderly. With falls being a major cause of mortality in the
elderly, and up to one-third of the elderly population experiencing at least one fall each
year<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, development of exercises and rehabilitation programs for the
elderly could be an important preventive measure for reducing the incidence of falls.</p><p>Winter<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> described gait as a dynamic
process for performing movements through high-level proprioceptive sense, neuromuscular
adjustment, and coordination among body segments and joints. In other words, even if lower
limb muscular strength is improved, poor coordination between segments can affect the
ability to walk efficiently. He also reported that excessive variability in walking or
improper coordination between segments and joints can also result in gait imbalance and
falls.</p><p>Thus far, many gait-related studies in the elderly have used gait parameters or joint
kinematics in designing interventions to prevent potential falls. It is, however, difficult
to confirm enhancement in neuromuscular adjustment or coordination with these variables.
Therefore, previous studies that examined the walking ability of elderly participants who
had undergone rehabilitative Pilates exercise programs could not provide insight into the
fundamental mechanism of falls or gait imbalance.</p><p>Inter-joint coordination is a method of investigating the coordination of two adjacent
joints during walking. It is calculated through continuous relative phase (CRP) as the phase
plane formed based on angle and angular velocity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many researchers report that inter-joint coordination controls the
body&#x02019;s center of mass and can be expressed as the ability to maintain dynamic balance<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unlike the traditional end-point
variability, which refers to the changes in each segment or joint movement, the variability
of inter-joint coordination indicates the variation in the pattern of performed movements.
Accordingly, the changes in the variability of inter-joint coordination are represented as
inherent properties of neuromuscular control, which determines the risk of injuries such as
falls<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an 8-week modified
Pilates exercise program on the variability of inter-joint coordination in the gait of
elderly participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty elderly participants were recruited for this study (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects (n=20)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training group (n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 males / 5 females</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 males / 3 females</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.6 (2.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.1 (2.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.3 (11.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.0 (12.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.5 (8.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.9 (9.2)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are group means (standard deviation).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>). None of the participants had a history of orthopedic abnormalities within
the past year. The selected participants were randomized into two groups of equal size&#x02014;the
Pilates exercise training group (TG) and the control group (CG). During the intervention
period, the TG participated in Pilates exercise training and received regular treatment at a
disabled rehabilitation center, while the CG received only regular treatment at the disabled
rehabilitation center.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the university&#x02019;s institutional review board prior to
study commencement.</p><p>The Pilates exercise used in this study was a mat-based Pilates program. To ensure that
elderly participants could perform the exercise adequately, the intensity was modified, and
additional props such as balls, magic rings, and resistance bands were used. The program was
conducted by two licensed Pilates instructors three times a week for 8 weeks. Each session
lasted 60 minutes and comprised a warm-up exercise, the main exercise, and a cooldown
exercise.</p><p>Eight sets were performed for each movement in this Pilates training. For improving core
muscles stability, breathing exercises were conducted in a sitting posture before and after
all training sessions. The mat-based Pilates training program was composed of spine mobility
exercise, upper limb exercise, and lower limb strengthening exercise; the detailed movements
for each part of the program were as follows: 1) for spine mobility exercise chin up and
down and seated forward and side spine stretches with a TheraBand; 2) for upper limb
exercise, draw a sword and seated detoid lifts with a TheraBand; and 3) for lower limb
strengthening exercise, side-lying top- and bottom-leg pulse-downs with a magic circle and
seated foot and ankle strengtheners with a TheraBand. Of note, unlike general mat-based
Pilates training, the lower limb strengthening exercise included in this program helps to
strengthen the quadriceps, gluteus medius, adductor magnus, gastrocnemius, and anterior
tibialis.</p><p>A 3-D gait motion analysis with 8 infrared cameras was performed before and after the
exercise period. Before the experiment, the cameras were set around a 10&#x02005;m gait path for
sufficient tracking redundancy and were calibrated using the nonlinear transformation
method. To identify lower limb movement and calculate inter-joint coordination variability
during walking, 16 reflective markers were attached to the lower body of the subjects.
Bilateral markers were placed on the iliac crest, posterior superior iliac spine, and
greater trochanter. Additional markers were placed on the sacrum, left lateral femoral
epicondyles, lateral malleolus, heel, 3rd metatarsal, and 5th metatarsal. Finally, two
markers were placed on the left lateral thigh and shank. After sufficient warm-up, each
subject was asked to walk on the 10&#x02005;m gait path at his or her preferred walking speed.
Subjects&#x02019; gait trials were captured into the host computer with 8 infrared cameras (Oqus
300, Sweden) and five strides from the middle of the gait path were recorded. Gait was
captured at a sampling rate of 100&#x02005;Hz, and to reduce the random error from electronic
devices, a Butterworth 4th order low-pass filter was used at a cutoff frequency of 6&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>To obtain the CRP, the angle and angular velocity of lower extremity joints were
calculated. These variables were interpolated 100% such that 1% represented each moment of
the gait<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thereafter, to remove the
differences in amplitude and frequency among joints and to prevent the loss of data when the
angular velocity was 0, the following two formulae were used to normalize the angle and
angular velocity from 1 to +1<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p><disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-3463-e001.jpg"/>,</disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-3463-e002.jpg"/>,</disp-formula></p><p>where,

(&#x003c9;), the phase angle (&#x000d8;) of each joint within the range of 0&#x02013;180&#x000b0; was calculated using the
right horizontal axis as the origin. The two segments to be checked for inter-joint
coordination (i.e., the thigh and shank) were then selected, and the difference between the
phase angles of the proximal and distal joints in each segment were used to calculate the
CRP (&#x000d8;<italic><sub>hip-knee</sub></italic>, &#x000d8;<italic><sub>knee-ankle</sub></italic>).</p><p>CRP<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>

(DP), which was a mean value of the standard deviation calculated from each data point of
the CRP. To evaluate the variability in single-joint coordination, an identical method was
used to calculate variability of angles of the ankle joint, knee joint, and hip joint in
terms of the mean standard deviation.</p><p>To verify the effects of the Pilates exercise on the variability of inter-joint
coordination in each subject&#x02019;s lower extremities, 2-way ANOVA with repeated measure was
used. Bonferroni correction was used as a post hoc test, as required. For all tests in this
study, statistical significance was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was a significant increase in the hip-knee DP value for the TG after the Pilates

variability of inter-joint coordination during walking in elderly participants. The
traditional concept of variability starts from &#x0201c;end-point variability.&#x0201d; According to this
concept, low variability indicates a stable performance while performing motions aimed at
achieving certain movements. Arutyunyan et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> and Hausdorff<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that the gait of healthy adults tends to demonstrate lower variability than that of
the elderly, and this is also true of performance of higher-level athletes compared to
lower-level athletes. Accordingly, research on biomechanics and motor control has used this
variability as a marker of performance level<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Unlike the variability described above, in the dynamic system theory, coordinative
variability is considered diverse coordination patterns that appear while performing tasks
rather than essentially good or bad of the performance<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, or is considered to
present the adaptability required for adjusting movements<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, increased
coordinative variability is interpreted as enhanced adjustment of coordination patterns
required for adapting to new movement patterns or maintaining particular movements<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, decreased coordinative variability can explain
the causes of injuries or diseases that occur when the decrease in coordinative variability
reaches a decisive point<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Arutyunyan et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
performance of higher-level athletes indicates low variability and high coordinative
variability compared with that of lower-level athletes and that this signifies that higher
coordinative variability allows diverse coordination patterns among segments or joints for
achieving particular movements. In addition, Seay et al.<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup> emphasized the connection between the diversity of coordination
patterns and risk of injuries in their report, as their &#x0201c;no injury history&#x0201d; group showed the
highest coordinative variability, followed by their &#x0201c;injury history&#x0201d; group and then their
&#x0201c;current injury&#x0201d; group.</p><p>In this study, there was no significant difference in lower extremity joint variability
between the intervention and control groups (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table
3</xref>, p&#x0003e;0.05), but significantly increased hip-knee coordinative variability was
found in the TG compared with the CG (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>,
p&#x0003c;0.05). Our results are consistent with previous studies on inter-joint coordination for
preventing and reducing the risk of falls during walking in elderly participants<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. These studies also reported that elderly participants had
significantly reduced hip-knee coordinative variability compared with that of healthy adults
and that the higher the hip-knee coordinative variability, the more neuromuscular control
strategies were shown during walking.</p><p>In our study, the Pilates exercise group revealed an increase in hip-knee coordinative
variability, while joint variability remained unchanged. This may be because the Pilates
exercise developed the deep muscles, which may have helped to improve the flexibility of the
pelvis and hip joints<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This also suggests that more diverse
coordination patterns are gained while maintaining the variability of the joint angular
position.</p><p>In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that an 8-week modified Pilates exercise program
can have a positive impact on the gait of elderly participants, potentially by enhancing
neuromuscular adjustment, which may have positive implications for reducing their fall
risk.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Culligan</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Scherer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Dyer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A randomized clinical trial comparing pelvic floor muscle
