Stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on monocytes and macrophages by MTB antigens leads to an up-regulation of VDRs. Binding of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> activates VDRs and induces cathelicidin-mediated killing of Mycobacteria
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) and risk of progression from infection to disease, tends to occur more often in patients with low 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] while, close contacts of TB patients display a 5-fold increased risk of contracting TB with each relative 1&#x02013;log decrement in 25- hydroxyvitamin D level
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Historically cod liver oil and sunshine, both excellent sources of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, were used for the treatment of TB. More recently, single doses of 25-hydroxyvitamin D have been demonstrated to enhance mycobacterial killing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However two recent Vitamin D supplementation trials failed to demonstrate any benefit
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] possibly due to the low doses used. We hypothesized that supplementation with <italic>therapeutic doses</italic> of vitamin D in patients with active TB, may improve outcomes. Our study objectives were to determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical indicators and immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized double blinded, multi-centre, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating centres; Aga Khan University Hospital (ERC approval no. 1238-Med/ERC-09) and Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases, Dow University Hospital (IRB-94/DUHS-09) and is listed on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01130311). The trial was funded through a grant obtained from the Aga Khan University Research Council (URC grant No. 0000058579). The study was conducted from October 2009 to July 2010 with enrolment of the first participant in October 2009 and last participant in April 2010. The protocol was made available at clinicaltrials.gov in May 2010. All patients provided written, informed consent prior to participation. Consecutive adult patients (&#x02265;16&#x02009;years) with smear positive, active pulmonary TB diagnosed within one week and enrolled at outpatient TB clinics were included. Based on clinical history taking and clinical records, patients with extra- pulmonary TB, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatic disease, renal failure, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroidism or those taking any corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, thiazide diuretics or drugs known to interfere with vitamin D levels (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, theophylline) were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and secondary outcome variables</title><p>The primary outcome variables were differences in weight gained and resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities. Secondary outcomes were differences in whole blood cell antigen-stimulated Interferon-gamma(IFN-g) responses, differences in sputum conversion rates and improvements in the TB score. An ad hoc analysis looked at the differences in the cytokine response, and clinical recovery based on differences in baseline vitamin D status.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>Baseline clinical data, chest radiographs, sputum and blood samples for 25 hydroxyvitamin D assay and cytokine analysis were collected. The randomization sequence was generated by the Dept. of Pharmacy, Aga Khan University, who were responsible for dispensing the study drug/placebo. The study co-ordinator and physician available at the study site enrolled participants who were eligible. All patients continued to receive Directly Observed Therapy (DOTS) with 2&#x02009;months of 4 antituberculous drugs [Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide] followed by 6&#x02009;months of Isoniazid and Ethambutol. Eligible patients were screened, enrolled and randomized by a computer-generated stratified, random assignments list (block randomization). The 2 study arms were either administered 600,000&#x02009;IU of intramuscular vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) for 2 doses one month apart or an equivalent volume of normal saline matched for colour. Doses were given at enrolment and repeated 4&#x02009;weeks from baseline. This dosage formulation of vitamin D is as recommended for vitamin D supplementation by the Pakistan Endocrine Society [<italic>personal communication</italic>]. The patient, primary physicians, investigator physicians, study coordinator, site assistants were blinded to the treatment allocation.</p><p>Clinical assessments and sputum microscopic examinations were performed at all visits (0, 4, 8 and 12&#x02009;weeks of therapy). Chest radiographs and blood samples for cytokine assays were obtained at 0 and 12&#x02009;weeks. Clinical examination was used to calculate a TB score
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] for all visits. The TB score is a validated assessment tool developed to objectively measure change in the clinical status of TB patients. Its components include self-reported symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, night sweats, chest pain, haemoptysis), clinical signs (tachycardia, pallor, fever, auscultatory findings) body mass index (BMI) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) was recorded to an accuracy of 0.5&#x02009;cm at the mid-point of the acromion and the olecranon process over the biceps muscle of the non-dominant arm, using a non-stretchable measuring tape. Height was recorded in metres, and weight in kilograms using a standard weighing machine at all visits. Body Mass Index (BMI)&#x02009;=&#x02009;weight (kg)/height (m<sup>2</sup>). The TB score achieved can range from 0&#x02013;13. TB scores were further divided into 3 severity classes; Severity Class I (TB score 0 to 5), Class II (TB score 6 &#x02013; 7) and Class III (TB score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;8). Baseline 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured and divided into &#x02018;Optimal&#x02019;&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x02009;ng/ml, &#x02018;Insufficient&#x02019; 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;ng/ml and &#x02018;Deficient&#x02019;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x02009;ng/ml.</p><p>Chest X-rays were interpreted independently by 2 consultant pulmonologists who were blinded to the treatment allocation process. Three separate methods of disease categorization were employed. This included classification into &#x02018;minimally&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderately&#x02019; and far advanced categories of radiographic infiltrates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Secondly, cavity size and change in size from 0 to 12&#x02009;weeks was recorded. Thirdly, the bilateral lung fields were divided in to 3 zones (6 total) and disease extent was recorded as &#x02018;Zone involvement&#x02019; (Table&#x02009;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Here we illustrate that vitamin D supplementation enhances mycobacterial-antigen induced IFN-g secretion in patients with Deficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, thereby improving cell mediated immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>25-hydroxyvitamin D is recognized as an important immune-modulator in TB. 1, 25 (OH) <sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> binding with VDRs activates cathelicidin-mediated mycobacterial killing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] whilst 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency increases the susceptibility and vulnerability to TB
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. G interferon (IFN-&#x003b3;) is a proinflammatory cytokine, which plays a critical role in resistance to MTB infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Infection with MTB induces T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and alveolar macrophages to express IFN-g and induces IFN-&#x003b3;-driven monokines that regulate granuloma formation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. IFN-g responses have been shown to be depressed in patients with advanced forms of tuberculosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We observed a significant improvement in MTBs-induced IFN-g responses after 12&#x02009;weeks of ATT in vitamin D &#x02018;Deficient&#x02019; patients who received 25-hydroxyvitamin. This is the first vitamin D supplementation study where groups have been stratified into those with differing disease severity and also according to their baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.</p><p>Previous reports by Ulrichs et al. have shown that IFN-g producing cells against ESAT6 in tuberculosis patients increase post-tuberculosis therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, we were unable to demonstrate any difference in ESAT6-induced IFN- &#x003b3; responses between patients prior to and post-treatment. This is in concordance with a recent report by Coussens et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] that did not show any change in ESAT-6 induced IFN-g in patients post-antituberculous therapy. ESAT6 and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP10) are both encoded by the region of difference 1 (RD1) present in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and in virulent <italic>M. bovis,</italic> but absent from <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and environmental mycobacteria
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Antigen based interferon g release assays (IGRAs) have a varied sensitivity in endemic and non-endemic settings, attributable to exposure to environmental mycobacterial and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and resulting T cell IFN-g responses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> whole sonicate (MTBs) contains cross reactive epitopes to <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG vaccine strain and environmental mycobacteria and therefore, can induce potent cytokine responses from T cells, macrophages and other polymorphonuclear cells. MTBs induced responses have been useful in differentiating severity of disease in TB. Patients with advanced disease display decreased IFN-g responses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We observed that after 12&#x02009;weeks of ATT, the Class III severity groups had significant increases in MTBs-induced IFN-g responses. This increase in mycobacterial-antigen induced IFN-g responses represents host immunity in patients with advanced pulmonary disease, possibly leading to improved resolution of the disease. Further analysis of to determine the impact of host 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels on immune recovery revealed that in patients who received vitamin D supplementation, MTBs-induced IFN-g secretion was significantly increased after 12&#x02009;week of anti-tuberculous therapy only in patients who had &#x02018;Deficient&#x02019; 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (&#x0003c; 20&#x02009;ng/mL) at initiation of treatment whilst this immune recovery was absent for TB patients with &#x02018;Deficient&#x02019; 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels in the placebo group. This data suggests a role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplementation in boosting host immunity particularly in those with deficient 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels. It is possible that only patients with &#x02018;Deficient&#x02019; 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels showed an improvement perhaps due to a critical level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D required by the host for optimal activation of IFN-g secretion and because this limit was already reached in the other 25-hydroxyvitamin D groups where no enhancement of mycobacterial antigen-induced IFN-g response was observed.</p><p>Weight gain is routinely followed as an outpatient marker of clinical improvement in TB and we observed improvements in clinical status; i.e.; weight gain compared to the placebo group. This corresponds with the earliest reports of the benefits of vitamin D in TB patients published in 1848
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] that describes disease arrest, weight gain and reduction in mortality in patients with TB treated with cod liver oil compared to standard therapy alone. More recently, Martineau et al. demonstrated that a single oral dose of 2.5&#x02009;mg (100,000&#x02009;IU) of ergocalciferol significantly reduced growth of mycobacteria
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]<italic>.</italic> A randomized, placebo controlled study on 67 Indonesian patients, by Nursyam et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] reported that pulmonary TB patients given 420,000&#x02009;IU of vitamin D over 6&#x02009;weeks had significantly higher sputum conversion rates as compared to placebo (p 0.002). Martineau et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] showed that 100,000 IUs of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation significantly improved sputum conversion rates in patients with the T<italic>aq1</italic> 25-hydroxyvitamin D receptor polymorphism of the <italic>tt</italic> genotype. We speculate that this occurred due to broader effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on muscle, vascular and homeostasis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>We also found that the vitamin D treatment group had lesser disease (compared to placebo) by chest radiography after 12&#x02009;weeks of therapy. This finding is consistent with a recent small placebo controlled trial on 24 children in Egypt that reported greater clinical and radiographic recovery after 1000 IUs of oral vitamin D supplementation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and a case report of an African &#x02013;American patient with refractory, drug sensitive TB who improved only after being treated with 1,200,000&#x02009;IU of ergoclaciferol
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>However, two recently published large randomised, controlled trials by Martineau
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and Wejse et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] found no difference in clinical outcomes or mortality after 10&#x02009;mg (400,000&#x02009;IU) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> and 300,000 IUs of cholecalciferol or placebo were given to 146 pulmonary TB patients in London, United Kingdom and 365&#x02009;TB patients in Guinea-Bissau. It maybe speculated that the differences in response to 25-hydroxyvitamin D seen between our study and Wejse&#x02019;s could be due to variations in VDR polymorphisms, variability in 25-hydroxyvitamin D dosages or differing levels of baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.</p><p>We found 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplementation to be very safe, even in patients without deficiency. Only two patients in the vitamin D arm died during the study; one death was due to respiratory failure occurring within the initial 2&#x02009;weeks of antituberculous therapy. It can be speculated whether this was a paradoxical response leading to acute lung injury.</p><p>We used a &#x02018;higher&#x02019; dose than the 2 recent negative studies reported by Wejse and Martineau et al., but closer to therapeutic recommendations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We speculate that this may account for the differences observed in the 2 groups at 12&#x02009;weeks. We consider it a limitation of our study that we were unable to follow our patients to the end of treatment (6&#x02009;months). It is possible that the benefits of 25-hydroxyvitamin D replacement may become more apparent between the groups with longer follow up.</p><p>Another limitation of our study is that we did not collect information on dietary intakes However the study groups were well matched at enrolment and represented a variety of socioeconomic and ethnic groups, which may reduce the possibility that one study arm was disproportionately better nourished.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study proposes that high dose vitamin D supplementation can lead to a more marked clinical and radiological recovery in all patients with pulmonary TB and boost host immune responses in patients deficient in 25-hydroxy vitamin D.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviation</title><p>IFN- g: Interferon gamma; MTB: Mycobacterium tuberculosis; MTBs: Mycobacterium tuberculosis sonicate; TB: Tuberculosis; DOTS: Directly Observed Therapy; BMI: Body Mass Index; MUAC: Mid Upper Arm Circumference; VDR 25-hydroxyvitamin: Vitamin D receptors; TLR: Toll-like receptor; MMP: Mycobacterium-induced matrix metalloproteases; ATT: Anti-tuberculous therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>NS and MA had full access to the data and take responsibility for the integrity of the data analysis.
