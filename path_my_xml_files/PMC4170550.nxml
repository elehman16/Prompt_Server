Custom-cast posts and cores are traditionally used to restore endodontically treated teeth. However, various studies have shown that as these metallic materials have a much higher elastic modulus than the supporting dentine the mismatch in the modulus could lead to stress concentrating in the cement lute, leading to failure. Root fracture is also a feature commonly associated with teeth restored with such post systems.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Over the years, various prefabricated post systems have been introduced and successfully used in clinical situations which decrease chair time and reduce the cost to the patient. However, there is a continuous need for evaluation of various post systems to make evidence based decision in the clinical context.</p><p>Retention of the posts is believed to be essential for the longevity of restorations placed on endodontically treated teeth.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Retention values provide a rapid and convenient way of comparing post stability.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Posts with greater retention are more resistant to dislodgement as a result of lateral occlusal stresses. Therefore, the present <italic>in vitro</italic> study was conducted to evaluate the retention of three different prefabricated post systems and to assess their suitability for use as an alternative to conventional cast posts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Freshly extracted single-rooted healthy human mandibular first premolars, 60 in number were selected.

</p><p>Specific post drills for each post supplied by the manufacturer was used for preparation of the post space. A slow speed hand piece was used for this purpose. The post space of 9 mm depth was prepared. Resin patterns of the prepared post spaces were fabricated for 15 specimens and were numbered. All the posts were marked at 9 mm from the apex using permanent marker. Self-adhesive dual cure resin cement was used for cementation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The specimens were mounted in sectioned aluminum cylinders (12 mm diameter and 20 mm length) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>] filled with autopolymerizing acrylic [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. The acrylic cylinders were separated from the aluminum cylinder. They were stored in water for 24 h and subjected to pull-out bond test.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Teeth with cemented posts</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-4-87-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Sectioned aluminum mold specimen</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-4-87-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Specimen mounted in universal testing machine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-4-87-g005"/></fig><p>The acrylic cylinder was attached to the specimen holding jaws of the Hounsfield H10KS, Universal testing machine [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>]. A vertical uniaxial tensile load (5000 N load cell) was applied to the exposed portion of the dowel with a cross head speed of 2 mm/min until failure occurred.

The difference in mean load between cast metal and stainless steel was also found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, all the post showed significantly lower retention compared to that of cast metal control group. The results obtained were consistent with those of Wood and Hedlund <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These studies have suggested that a well-adapted cast post and core restoration may be more retentive in function than a prefabricated post and core restoration that does not match the canal shape. Another study done by Stegaroiu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed greater retention of cast post compared to prefabricated stainless steel post upon cyclic loading. Posts are dislodged when the cement fatigues and the bond strength to dentine is eventually lost. Thus, a thick cement layer, especially in the case of prefabricated post may have been more influenced by the cohesive failure within the cement layer as compared to the well-fitted cast posts, which have a thin layer of cement around it. This finding could explain the greater retention of cast post. The lowest values of bond strength were obtained for those of carbon fiber posts. The conventional cast posts and the stainless steel posts were retained significantly more strongly than the carbon fiber posts. Sidoli <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in a similar study found that carbon fiber post and core system exhibited significantly inferior stress values of failure when compared with a well-established conventional cast post and core combination. A comparable result was recorded in a study done by Purton and Love which showed that stainless steel posts were retained significantly more strongly than the carbon fiber posts.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Another study done by Purton and Payne showed similar results.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Failure at the post/cement interface indicated failure of the cement to adhere to the carbon fiber posts.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It appears that any potential chemical bonding between the resin in the carbon fiber posts and the resin luting cement does not achieve a high strength.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It is possible that the heat processed carbon fiber posts have little free resin available for chemical reaction. Moreover, the difference in the performance of the two posts was most likely due to the mechanical retention offered by the serrations on the stainless steel posts. Visual inspection of the surface of the cast posts, glass fiber posts and stainless steel posts after dislodgement from the root canals showed that cement was retained on their surfaces, but there were areas free of cements, implying that the mode of failure was a combination of adhesive and cohesive failure. The carbon fiber posts after dislodgement from the root canal showed that there were no remnants of the luting agent on these posts. This implies an adhesive failure at the interface between the cement and the post due to lack of any potential chemical bonding between the cement and the carbon fiber posts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this study showed that the bond strength of all the prefabricated post was significantly lower than the conventional cast post. Among the experimental group, stainless steel posts were the most retentive, whereas the carbon fiber posts were the least retentive. There was no significant difference in the mean bond strength between the stainless steel and glass fiber posts. Though, no single prefabricated post, could achieve results close to the control group, the most retentive among the experimental group was stainless steel post. However, conditions where nonmetallic posts are indicated most preferred type of post can be the glass fiber post owing to their superior esthetic properties.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
