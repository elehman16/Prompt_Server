outcome of mechanical oral hygiene procedures or even to replace mechanical plaque
control. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) is presently the most effective compound having
pronounced antimicrobial effects both on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as
well as on fungi and some viruses<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. CHX is a positively charged
bisbiguanide, which can adsorb to different negatively charged sites including mucous
membranes, salivary pellicle on teeth and titanium implant surfaces as well as several
components of the biofilm on the tooth surfaces such as bacteria, extracellular
polysaccharides and glycoproteins<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. However, it has not been recommended for long periods because of
the observed side effects<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>The reported side effects of CXH are alteration in taste, increase of calculus
formation, staining of teeth and mucous membranes and, more rarely, oral mucosa
desquamation and parotid swelling<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. However, the most obvious and important local side effects are the
brown staining of the teeth, restorative materials and dorsum of the tongue<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
as well as supragingival calculus formation<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>Non-enzymatic browning (Maillard reactions) and formation of pigmented metal sulfides
are considered the possible mechanisms of tooth discolorations due to CHX
application<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, clinical and laboratory studies provided
strong evidence that staining is caused by interaction or precipitation of dietary
chromogens with locally adsorbed CXH<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In the presence of food components, CHX dyes produce colored compounds
on hydroxyapatite<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, when
associated with tea and coffee intake, brown staining of tooth and acrylic previously
exposed to CXH is more likely to occur<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Corroborating these findings, Addy, et al.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (1979) demonstrated that tea, coffee and red wine were
particularly chromogenic.</p><p>CXH has proven in many clinical trials to be effective in reducing the formation of
dental plaque and preventing gingivitis<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. However,
calculus formation seems to be increased<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. All previous studies
reporting CHX anti-plaque efficacy and related side effects utilized a previous
disruption of present biofilms in all dental surfaces. However, there is a lack of
evidence if the presence of biofilm formed on tooth surfaces would increase the side
effects of CHX. Zanatta, Antoniazzi and R&#x000f6;sing<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> (2007) demonstrated that 0.12% CHX mouthrinses showed
lower anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis effects over previously plaque-covered surfaces
compared to plaque-free surfaces. Thus, the working hypothesis of this trial is that the
presence of plaque when starting CHX rinsing as a sole measurement for plaque control
would increase staining and calculus formation. This would indicate the necessity of
previous prophylaxis. The presence of plaque could be one predisposing factor to
staining, since its components would facilitate staining.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of 0.12% CXH gluconate on
staining and calculus formation in previously plaque-free and plaque covered surfaces,
by means of an experimental gingivitis clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>The present study is a randomized split-mouth clinical trial. The study protocol was
subjected to and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Lutheran University of Brazil,
Canoas, RS (CEP-ULBRA 2006-095H). The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier's registration is
NCT00818376.</p><sec><title>Test panel</title><p>The test panel was recruited from the dental students of the Lutheran University of
Brazil, Canoas, RS, Brazil. In order to assess the power of the present study, using
the power calculation with data from mean calculus formation in the present study at
day 25, taking into consideration the paired design, a mean difference of 0.20 and
accepting an &#x003b1;-error of 0.05, revealed a power of 0.85.</p><p>The mean age of the volunteers was 28.15&#x000b1;3.15 years. At recruitment, subjects
were asked about their medical and dental histories. Written and oral explanations
detailing the study purpose and design were given for each subject. Subjects that
preliminarily met inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected for a dental screening
appointment. If the subject met all the inclusion/exclusion criteria, an informed
consent was handed out and, upon acceptance, signed by the volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>- Age between 18-35 years;</p><p>- Male, in order to avoid hormonal influences during the experimental period,
especially concerning gingival inflammation;</p><p>- No relevant medical conditions that could interfere on the periodontal health;</p><p>- Willingness to comply.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>- Probing pocket depth &#x0003e;3 mm and/or clinical attachment loss &#x0003e;2 mm at any
site;</p><p>- Antibiotic and/or anti-inflammatory therapy within 3 months prior to baseline
examination;</p><p>- Oral mucosal lesions;</p><p>- Smokers;</p><p>- Need for antibiotic premedication;</p><p>- History of hypersensitivity to CHX;</p><p>- Any condition device that could act as plaque retentive factor (carious lesions;
inadequate restorations; dental implants; orthodontic appliances; fixed or removable
prostheses).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Parameters</title><p>The following clinical parameters were assessed in the order listed below from all
teeth, excepting the third higher/lower molar.</p><p>- Presence of calculus (C) in all teeth, at 6 sites per tooth (mesiobuccal,
mid-buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, mid-lingual and distolingual) was scored as a
dichotomous index: 0 - Absence of calculus; 1 - Presence of calculus.</p><p>- Discoloration Index proposed by Lobene<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> (1968) and modified by Macpherson, et al.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (2000). This involves visual stain
assessment of the buccal/labial and lingual/palatal aspects of the index teeth. The
modification consisted of dividing each aspect into 4 separate sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>), classified as: - Gingival (G): 2 mm
wide strip running parallel to the gingival margin. The limit towards the incisal
edge given by the end of the interdental papilla; - Body (B): Central area of
buccal/lingual aspect, between gingival and distal/mesial sites, extending to incisal
edge; - Mesial (M): Visible area between line angle and adjacent tooth, ending at the
interdental papilla and starting at gingival site; - Distal (D): as for mesial (M)
site.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The stain sites of an anterior tooth: Body (White); Gingival (Grey); Mesial and
Distal (black)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-18-05-0515-g01"/></fig><p>Stain was recorded using two separate characteristics, namely intensity and area
(extent). The criteria and codes for intensity were: 0= no stain present with the
natural tooth coloration; 1= slim stain; 2= clearly visible stain, orange to brown;
3= dark stain, dark brown to black.</p><p>The area (extent) of the stain was recorded only if an intensity score of 2 or 3 was
given. The area criteria and codes for proximal, gingival and body sites were: 1= up
to 1/3 of area affected; 2= between 1/3 and 2/3 of area affected; 3= more than 2/3 of
area affected.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of intraexaminer reproducibility</title><p>Before starting the trial, multiple sessions of training exercises for clinical
parameters were performed. After the examiner was trained, the intra-examiner
reproducibility was assessed. For reproducibility, 4 chronic CHX users, who were not
included in the study population, were recruited. After an informed consent, subjects
were evaluated two times with one day intermission. In each session, the examiner
scored all teeth, except the third molars. The results of presence/absence of
calculus and stain index<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> were
analyzed by Kappa-statistics. The K-coefficient was 0.96 and 0.68 for calculus and
Stain indexes, respectively.</p><p>The outline of the experimental procedures is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Experimental design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-18-05-0515-g02"/></fig><p>To achieve optimal gingival health and to standardize gingival baseline conditions,
all subjects participated in a pretrial period during 14 days. Thorough professional
scaling and polishing with a rubber cup and prophylactic paste and dental floss was
performed. If hygiene was judged unsatisfactory, individual instructions were given
on how to improve the performance.</p><p>- Baseline: On day zero, the presence of calculus and the stain index were recorded
in all subjects. After the recordings, a prophylaxis was performed and detailed
explanations to discontinue all the plaque control measurements were provided
again.</p><p>- Day 4: Each subject had one upper and one lower quadrant randomly assigned by a
heads or tails raffle made by the examiner, as "test" (supragingival plaque-covered
sites) and the other two quadrants as "controls" (supragingival plaque was
professionally removed by the examiner to warrant plaque-free surfaces). After the
prophylaxis on control quadrants, the Quigley &#x00026; Hein Plaque Index was recorded in
all teeth to ensure that control quadrants were plaque-free. Following, all subjects
continued the oral hygiene withdrawal for a 21 days and started to rinse twice daily
with 15 mL of a mouthrinse containing 0.12% CHX (Noplak, Daudt, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP,
Brazil).</p><p>- Day 11 and 18: Presence/absence of calculus and stain index was recorded in all
teeth.</p><p>- Day 25: Similar to days 11 and 18. After the recordings, a professional scaling and
prophylaxis was performed to remove stain and calculus and all subjects were free to
return the normal habits of mechanical plaque control. Gingivitis was treated if
necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Blindness</title><p>On days 11, 18 and 25, the examiner was kept unaware of randomization sequence and
blinded to which quadrant was test or control. However, because of the nature of the
study, it is not possible to assume that the examiner had not become aware of
quadrant allocation because plaque accumulation was clinically different between test
and control quadrants essentially on days 11 and 18. Whether this problem may have
biased the examiner is not ascertained.</p></sec><sec><title>Compliance</title><p>The necessary volume of CHX to all the experimental period was 630 mL (15 ML- 12/12
h). However, to ensure compliance, more than 630 mL of CHX solution was given in
flasks with 1 L volume, with different volumes in each flask. At the end of the
experiment, the remaining solution was turned in to check the individual
compliance.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using commands that take into account clustering of
observations within subjects (Stata 9.2 for Windows, Stata Corporation, College
Station, TX, USA). A robust variance estimator was used to adjust for the clustering
of teeth into individuals. Wald tests were used for comparisons, and the p-value was
adjusted for multiple comparisons. The level of significance was set at 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All 20 subjects who fulfilled all inclusion/exclusion criteria completed the study.
Checking of compliance revealed that all volunteers adhered to the instructions, with
the correct amount of left over rinsing solution given back. No other side effects, such
as taste alterations, allergic reaction, etc. were observed. Gingival inflammation in
this test panel evaluated by the Gingival Index for test was 0.21&#x000b1;0.02 and
0.93&#x000b1;0.03 at baseline and day 25, respectively, whereas in control surfaces it
was of 0.18&#x000b1;0.01 and 0.52&#x000b1;0.03 at the same time points. Statistically
significant higher values were shown for initially plaque-covered surfaces<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p><p>The intensity of stain as assessed by discoloration index did not differ among
experimental groups at baseline. When test and control surfaces were compared, higher
degrees of staining were present in test surfaces at days 11, 18 and 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Mean discoloration intensity index in surfaces initially plaque-free or

before the start of CHX plaque control regime would result in different levels of CXH
side effects (stain and calculus formation). Initially plaque-covered surfaces (test
group) showed significantly higher degrees of stain intensity and extent of surface area
as well as calculus formation as compared to initially plaque-free surfaces (control
group). These results showed that the initial professional prophylaxis seems to have a
greater effect in reducing CXH side effects.</p><p>The etiology of extrinsic tooth discolorations due to CHX rinsing is not fully
understood. Non-enzymatic browning reactions (Maillard reactions) and formation of
pigmented metal (Fe, Sn) sulfides hypotheses is not supported by direct and conclusive
<italic>in vivo</italic> evidence<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, the main possible mechanism of extrinsic tooth stain is the
reaction products of food and beverage, where aldehydes and ketones, natural
constituents of various foods, may react with CHX forming colored products. However, a
discoloring capacity of CHX combined with tea, red wine and coffee has been demonstrated
both <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>Clinical investigations have demonstrated marked variations in the individual
discoloration tendency after a period of CHX rinsing<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. However, the
significant increase in stain in previously plaque-free surfaces has been demonstrated
by means of staining indexes<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Our results are in accordance to these
observations. In the present investigation, we found an important effect of the presence
of plaque over intensity and extent of tooth staining, since surfaces without
supragingival plaque at the beginning of CHX rinsing showed significant lower staining
as compared to surfaces with established plaque over 21 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">4</xref>). Thus,
initially plaque-covered surfaces were stained earlier than plaque-free surfaces.</p><p>There is scarce evidence investigating the presence of plaque over CHX side effects.
Corbet, et al.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> (1997) demonstrated in
a population with large amounts of plaque and calculus, a significantly higher mean of
stain, as assessed by a discoloration index system when compared to a parallel control
group (Placebo solution). In our study, we used a randomized split-mouth design. Thus,
each subject was its own control. Both test and control surfaces were exposed the same
dietary compounds influence. This methodological aspect aimed at reducing
inter-individual variability, reducing bias and consequently increasing statistical
confidence in the results obtained. Furthermore, a single calibrated clinical examiner
(unaware of group allocation) assessed all clinical parameters. The observed results
indicate the mechanisms by which staining is higher in plaque-covered surfaces is
subject to further investigations. However, a possible explication could be that plaque
presence could increase the CHX salivary protein precipitation.</p><p>The increase of calculus formation due to CHX mouthrinse is a usual finding in early
long-term investigations<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, short-term studies suggested
reduced calculus formation with CHX rinsing<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Our data showed that
initial prophylaxis was important to reduce calculus formation. Control surfaces showed
little amounts of calculus formation over 21 days (about 12% of surfaces), while test
surfaces presented 34.4% of calculus. Thus, plaque-covered surfaces presented calculus
earlier than plaque-free surfaces. These results may be explained by the fact that
supragingival calculus is essentially mineralized plaque<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The process of mineralization and the CHX influence on
the process are not fully understood, but involves localized supersaturation,
nucleation, crystal growth and the transformation of precursor phases such as dicalcium
phosphate dehydrate, octacalcium phosphate and amorphous calcium phosphate into more
stable, crystalline deposits of hydroxyapatite<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The higher tendency to calculus formation in lingual aspects of
lower anterior and buccal aspects of upper posterior tooth surfaces may be due to the
location of the submandibular and parotid ducts location. In these areas, the abundant
supply of urea from the saliva and the high salivary film velocity tend to promote base
formation to plaque and calcium phosphate precipitation<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Hence, it has been advocated that these locations may be
more susceptible to calculus formation because of the low sucrose concentration in
saliva with a high saliva film velocity promoting clearance of salivary sugar and acid
from plaque, and the higher plaque pH associated to better access to salivary
urea<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However, these results
have to be interpreted with care because our criteria for calculus included both stained
and non-stained calculus. Thus, the increased scores could represent the incremental
build-up and hardening of stain in the gingival third of the crowns.</p><p>In the present study a modified tooth stain index was used. Macpherson, et al.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (2000) demonstrated that this stain
index was more advantageous because it allowed to assess sites with most visible stain
separately and offered higher discriminatory power due to a lower coefficient of
variation when compared with conventional counterpart<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. The reason to assess calculus in a dichotomous index
was to facilitate the assessment in all present teeth due to the most calculus index use
only specific teeth and regions. On the other hand, while these calculus indexes allow
for quantification of calculus presence, a dichotomous calculus index shows only
calculus presence or absence. However, it did not compromise our results because we
aimed at verifying if calculus formation would be present first over plaque-covered
surfaces.</p><p>CHX was selected for the antimicrobial treatment because it is the best characterized
and most effective chemical antiplaque agent known today<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The concentration selected corresponds
to that used clinically for plaque control (0.12% or 2%). Moreover, extensive evidence
showed similar plaque reduction and gingival inflammation effectiveness when comparing
0.2% and 0.12% CHX concentrations<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.
Franco Neto, et al.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (2008) recently
explored this issue demonstrating that the use of 15 mL of 0.12% CHX rinsing did not
differ from 10 mL of 0.2% for plaque formation and gingival bleeding in a cross-over
double blind 14 days rinsing period study design. It should be emphasized that for some
individuals 15 mL is a high amount and might be uncomfortable. However, evidences show
that 0.12% CHX seems to reduce stain side effects, mainly tooth staining<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p><p>The results of the present study are intriguing and should be interpreted from a
clinical perspective. Clinicians prescribe rinsing sometimes without professionally
cleaning teeth. This could be a practice that would increase the undesirable side
effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The initially plaque-covered and plaque-free surfaces presented tooth stain and calculus
formation with different magnitude and timing. The clinical relevance of these results
is subject to individual interpretation. However, significant differences in calculus
formation and staining were found and the clinical impact consists in an indication that
it is always desirable to diminish such side effects. Whenever possible, when starting
with CHX regimes, plaque should be previously removed in the best achievable way in
order to reduce side effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to thank the Lutheran University of Brazil, Canoas, RS, and the
