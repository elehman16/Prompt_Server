aerobic training for early and severely impaired stroke survivors. [Subjects] The subjects
were forty-eight early stroke survivors. [Methods] Eligible subjects were recruited and
randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. Both groups participated
in comprehensive rehabilitation training. Low intensity aerobic training was only
performed by the experimental group. Outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer motor score,
Barthel index, exercise test time, peak heart rate, plasma glucose level and serum lipid
profiles. [Results] Patients in the experimental group finished 88.6% of the total aerobic
training sessions prescribed. In compliant participants (adherence&#x02265;80%), aerobic training
significantly improved the Barthel index (from 40.1&#x000b1;21.1 to 79.2&#x000b1;14.2), Fugl-Meyer motor
score (from 26.4&#x000b1;19.4 to 45.4&#x000b1;12.7), exercise test time (from 12.2&#x000b1;3.62&#x02005;min to
13.9&#x000b1;3.6&#x02005;min), 2-hour glucose level (from 9.22&#x000b1;1.16&#x02005;mmol/L to 7.21&#x000b1;1.36&#x02005;mmol/L) and
homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistence index (from 1.72&#x000b1;1.01 to
1.28&#x000b1;0.88). [Conclusion] Preliminary findings suggest that early and severely impaired
stroke patients may benefit from low intensity ergometer aerobic training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Aerobic training</kwd><kwd>Early and severely impaired stroke hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Feasibility and efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low fitness levels and poor cardiovascular disease risks are highly prevalent among stroke

limitations and safety concerns preclude very early and weak stroke patients from aerobic
training. Previous studies have mainly focused on non-disabled stroke patients and it is
still unclear whether severely affected stroke survivors could perform aerobic exercise
training at levels requisite to produce aerobic gains. Therefore, it is necessary to explore
the application of aerobic training across a broader range of stroke course and disability
levels<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study was designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of aerobic training for
very early and weak stroke survivors. The hypothesis was that low-intensity ergometer
aerobic training would be well-tolerated by severely impaired stroke survivors to improve
their functional levels and cardiovascular risks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects were recruited from the Rehabilitation Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of
Nanjing Medical University in eastern China. They were hospitalized throughout the
intervention period. This trial was approved by the hospital ethics committee in accordance
with the Declarations of Helsinki revised in 1983. The purpose, nature, and potential risks
of the trial were fully explained to the subjects who were free to withdraw anytime if they
or their relatives request. All subjects gave their written, informed consent before
participating in this study.</p><p>Subjects were included in the study if they were two weeks post stroke; six weeks within
stroke onset; 45 to 75&#x02005;years of age; unable to walk with any walk aid; severely impaired
with the affected leg scored 3 or less on the 7-point Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment
scale<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; cardiovascular stable as
determined by 12-lead ECG; had no orthopedic disease that might have precluded ergometer
exercise training; were not taking medicines that might have significantly altered heart
rate; and were able to understand the purpose and content of the study. The exclusion
criteria were: signs and symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage; transient ischemic attack and
those with severe cerebral edema; O2 dependence; angina; unstable cardiac condition;
peripheral arterial occlusive disease; abnormal high fever; high blood pressure over 200/110
mmHg; dementia; aphasia operationally defined as incapacity to follow 2-point commands;
untreated major depression or other medical conditions that precluded participation in
exercise training.</p><p>Both the exercise test and aerobic training were conducted using the same ergometer
(Monark, Sweden). Before aerobic training, the adapted symptom-limited graded exercise test
was performed. Participates sat on a wheelchair which was firmly immobilized. Their feet
were fixed to the pedals by soft belts. Ergometer power output was increased by 2.5&#x02005;W every
3 minute until exhaustion based on patients maximal tolerance. Our prior study has proved
the feasibility of aerobic exercise for severely impaired stroke patients and in this study,
ten eligible subjects were tested twice at entry to the present program. As a result, they
all finished the test at the same workload and for the same reason (test-retest percentage
agreement =100%). Peak heart rate was defined as the highest observed during the exercise
test and it was used to calculate the targeted heart rate for aerobic training. Subjects
were excluded from the study if they could not produce enough power output (less than 5W)
during adapted exercise test.</p><p>Eligible subjects were randomly allocated to an experimental group and a control group. The
sealed envelope and block sampling method was used to achieve equal numbers in each group. A
researcher unaware of the study performed the randomization procedure. The investigators
were not blinded to group assignment, however, all the involved therapists and outcome
assessors were blinded with respect to the baseline data and group assignment.</p><p>Both groups exercised five days per week for six weeks. Every training day, they received a
comprehensive rehabilitation training program including three 40-minute sessions of physical
training, two 15-minute sessions of occupational training, one 30-minute session of
acupuncture or traditional Chinese manipulation and one 30-minute session of physical agent
therapy. Physical training was mainly composed of stretch, balance, range of motion, gait
training based on Bobath technique. Strength training was added when necessary. However, the
amount of strength training was strictly controlled because it may have had negative effects
on spasticity. One 40-minute session of physical training was replaced by low intensity
ergometer aerobic training three days per week in the experimental group. Prior studies have
demonstrated that routine rehabilitation training for severely compromised stroke survivors
provides little aerobic stimuli<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low-intensity ergometer aerobic training was based on the peak heart rate. The targeted
aerobic training intensity was calculated using the Karvonen equation<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.<disp-formula>Target Heart Rate = (peak HR in the exercise test &#x02212;
resting HR) &#x000d7; 50&#x02013;70% + resting HR</disp-formula></p><p>Every aerobic training session consisted of five minutes warm-up, thirty minutes targeted
intensity training and five minutes cool down period. Two breaks of less than thirty minutes
were allowed per 30-minute training session. One additional therapist helped to correct
patients performing wrong compensatory actions, keep them in good posture, verbally
encourage the use of the affected leg and to monitor the training intensity to ensure the
treatment fidelity. The first week of aerobic training was also supervised by a doctor
experienced in cardiology. The resistance of the ergometer was adjusted to achieve the
targeted heart rate level. A cardiac monitor or heart rate belt will be used and the
resistance was progressively increased to ensure that the heart rate was always within the
target zone.</p><p>The demographic properties of the participants such as age, sex and body weight were
recorded. Data of the time interval between admission and stroke onset, type of stroke, and
lesion site were collected from medical records. The actual number of aerobic training
sessions finished by participants in the experimental group was recorded. Only aerobic
training sessions with targeted intensity training times of 30 minutes reached was defined
as finished one and short breaks of less than two minutes were allowed twice per session. In
the first week, subjects&#x02019; blood pressure and heart rate at rest, 15 and 30 minutes during
training and 5 minutes post training were recorded using a cardiac monitor (Dash 4000). All
patients were also evaluated before and after the intervention using the tests described
above: Exercise test: The adapted exercise test was conducted to record peak heart rate and
exercise test time; The Fugl-Meyer motor assessment and Barthel index: These two tools were
used to accessed the motor function score and abilities of daily living respectively; The
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): After 12 hours of overnight fast, patients underwent the
standard OGTT to measure fasting glucose, fasting insulin, two-hour glucose level and the
homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) [ HOMA-IR = insulin (&#x003bc;U/mL)&#x000d7;
glucose (mmol/L)/22.5 ]. An intravenous catheter was inserted to facilitate blood sampling
and 75g glucose were ingested at the beginning of the test; Serum lipids profiles: Blood
samples obtained by venipuncture following overnight fasting. Serum for total triglycerides
were assayed. HDL cholesterol was determined in plasma, and LDL cholesterol was calculated
using the Friedewald equation.</p><p>Data were entered onto the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12.
All the datas were expressed in terms of mean&#x000b1;SD. To explore the effectiveness of aerobic
training, a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used after confirming the
normality of the data distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to examine the effects of time
and intervention on the Fugl-Meyer motor score, Barthel index, exercise test time, peak
heart rate, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2-hour plasma glucose, HOMA-IR and serum lipid
profiles (Total triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol) respectively. When main
effects were detected, student t test with the Bonferroni correction was performed as a post
hoc test. P-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. Primary analysis compared the
effects of aerobic training on all outcome measures according to intention to treat
analysis. Secondary (per protocol) analysis was performed based on participant compliance
with the exercise program (defined as attending &#x02265; 80% of sessions).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Over four years and nine months, 48 eligible subjects were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1449-g001"/></fig>).

During the intervention period, there were no changes in medication for all
the subjects for the addition of anti-hypertensive drugs for three subjects (2 with
angiotensin receptor blockers and 1 with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor agent).</p><p>Each subject in the experimental group was prescribed 18 aerobic training sessions (3 times
&#x000d7; 6 weeks) in total. Two of 24 patients (8.3%) were transferred to another hospital for
reasons unrelated to exercise training (one was transferred to a hospital in his home city
and another was transferred to the surgery department of a bigger hospital for deep vein
because of thrombosis).Three patients (12.5%) gave up aerobic training for psychological
reasons (give up due to discomfort or unpleasant feelings) after they had finished 9, 6 and
6 sessions respectively. Twelve patients (50%) missed one to three sessions for various
reasons but finished all the other sessions (defined as compliant since they finished &#x02265; 80%
of sessions). Seven patients (29.2%) finished all the aerobic training sessions prescribed.
All subjects could adhere to routine rehabilitation training except those transferred to
other hospitals.</p><p>Two patients transferred to another hospitals were excluded from the evaluation of aerobic
training feasibility. The other 22 patients in the aerobic training group finished 351
(88.6%) of the total 396 (22 patients &#x000d7;18 sessions) aerobic training sessions prescribed. If
the three patients who gave up aerobic training were also excluded, 19 patients finished 330

prescribed.</p><p>Twelve aerobic training sessions (342 prescribed ones minus 330 actual finished ones) were
missed by compliant patients. Six sessions were missed because of general fatigue, 2
sessions were missed because of pain or discomfort in the affected leg (pain or discomfort
in muscle or knee), and patients refused to do 2 sessions for psychological reasons (didn&#x02019;t
want to do). In addition, 3 patients also reported affected leg discomfort several times
during ergometer aerobic training, which did not affect their daily life or adherence to the
training schedule.</p><p>No other adverse event occured during the aerobic training or intervention period. Systolic

effective for extremely early and weak stroke survivors. Our results may provide additional
support for the use of aerobic training for stroke survivors across a wide spectrum of
disease course and functional levels.</p><p>Compared with previous studies, subjects in this study had unique features of early stroke
course and low functional levels. Several adaptations to the aerobic training regime were
made accordingly. First, the intensity was lower. We set the intensity according to outcomes
in the adapted exercise test, in which the output power was increased by 2.5&#x02005;W every three
minutes. Second, less than two minutes rest were allowed twice per session. Third, subjects&#x02019;
feet were firmly fixed to the ergometer pedals. Lastly, aerobic training was supervised by
an therapist. As a result, most aerobic training sessions could be tolerated. Our
preliminary results may be meaningful as an initial step in establishing an aerobic training
modality for early and weak stroke survivors. However, many patients were precluded from the
training due to clinical safety concerns. Some aerobic training sessions were missed by
subjects and their reasons for absence were mainly general fatigue, local discomfort in the
unaffected leg as well as psychological issues. Accordingly, much works is needed to make
aerobic training more acceptable to such subjects. Improvement of aerobic training equipment
such as the introduction of an ergometer combined with functional electrical
stimulation<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, specific measures to
target pain or discomfort in muscle, bone, or joint as well as more intense education and
encouragement should be considered in future trials.</p><p>Subjects with several functional and vascular disease risks were included in the study to
explore the efficacy of aerobic training. The preliminary results demonstrate that it may
result in aerobic gains which promote functional, fitness and reduce vascular disease risk
factors of compliant patients. Changes in the exercise test and OGTT results indicate that
peripheral adaptations may be largely responsible for the training effects, since there were
improvements in muscle property and insulin sensitivity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The underlying molecular
changes needs to be further explored. Previous studies have shown that aerobic training is
effective in improving the fitness levels of stroke patients<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our training intensity was much lower because of our subjects&#x02019;
functional limitation. The intensity of aerobic training is a meaningful research theme.
Several studies have indicated that high intensity intermittent aerobic training may be more
effective in improving fitness levels<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and it also is feasible for stroke patients. Our initial results imply that high intensity
aerobic training may not be necessary for stroke patients. However, future investigations
are needed to determine the most suitable aerobic training intensity for stroke survivors at
each stage and functional level.</p><p>Only compliant patients showed improvements in exercise test time and OGTT results. This
may indicate that training effectiveness is based on aerobic training compliance. Our study
had several limitations. The sample size was small. It was determined by the number of
subjects enrolled for training rather than power analysis. Besides, there was a large
variation in subjects&#x02019; basic characteristics including gender and type of disease. Moreover,
many subjects were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or for medical
reasons. This selection bias may affect the generalizability of our findings to
population-based samples. There was also a significant drop out rate. In clinical setting,
it is possible that patients may have deduced which group they were in and the outcome
observers may not have been totally blind. There was also a significant difference between 1
or 2 and 3 on the 7-point Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment scale. Future studies should
divide subjects into subgroups based on this scale to further explore the effects of aerobic
training. Regarding the final results, there may have been several influencing factors.
First, the rehabilitation training program was individualized. The individual content of
rehabilitation program may have influenced the result. Training modalities other than low
intensity aerobic training, such as strength training also may have contributed to fitness
gains. Second, for the weak subjects, a longer exercise test time may have been possible
through familiarization with the equipment. We tried to overcome these influencing factors
by enforcing the same training volume in total and for each training modality and the
training program was quite similar since all the patients were at the same stage of motor
recovery and disease course.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was supported by the Jiangsu 333 High Level Elite Project Foundation (20090108)
