It provides a media to express love, which is the base for all sorts of creative activities. The absence of this function hampers the marital relationship, leading to frustration and, sometimes, ending in divorce, and causes inadequacy in performing the routine duties. In this study, 53 patients having diabetes mellitus were surveyed to find out the incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED). Considering the high prevalence of the disease and the need to look for alternative medicine, a clinical trial on 44 patients of ED was carried out. These patients were divided into two main groups: diabetic and non-diabetic, and were further divided into two subgroups as trial group and placebo group. In the trial group, <italic>Ashvattha Kshirpaka</italic> prepared with 10 g powder of its root bark, stem bark, fruit and tender leaf buds was given twice a day. In both the diabetic and the non-diabetic subjects, Ashvattha provided encouraging results on ED as well as on seminal parameters in comparison to the placebo.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Erectile dysfunction</kwd><kwd><italic>Klaibya</italic></kwd><kwd>Diabetes Mellitus</kwd><kwd><italic>Madhumeha</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Ashvattha</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Ficus religiosa</italic> Linn</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sex is a basic instinct, but sexual behavior is a learned ability. <italic>Dharma, Artha, Kama</italic> and <italic>Moksha</italic> are among the four Purusharthas &#x02013; objectives of life &#x02013; mentioned in Ayurveda. The achievement of each of these is the basic need of every individual. Among various phase of sexual response, the most essential is the achieving of normal erection with sufficient rigidity for penetrative intercourse, the absence of which ends in failure and dissatisfaction. This condition has been elaborately described as &#x0201c;<italic>Klaibya</italic>&#x0201d; in the Ayurvedic classics and as &#x0201c;Erectile dysfunction&#x0201d; (ED) in the modern texts. Traditionally, etiological factors of ED have been classified as organic, psychogenic or mixed. This way of classifying ED is relatively useful for organizing our intervention, although it is completely arbitrary. Strictly speaking, a penis that does not respond with an erection to an &#x0201c;effective&#x0201d; stimulation may be a consequence of what we call organic factors. However, every ED problem is &#x0201c;psycho-organic,&#x0201d; because it affects the man as a whole (both physically and psychologically) as well as his partner and the couple's relationship. The incidence of ED is increasing day by day with the increase in the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disorders, peripheral neuropathy, anxiety, stress, depression and their medications. However, no direct reference is available in the Ayurvedic classics to say that <italic>Madhumeha</italic> leads to <italic>Klaibya</italic>. Of course, Vagbhatta has mentioned <italic>Mushka Avadarana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and <italic>Vrishana Avadaranam</italic> and <italic>Bastimedhratoda</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] as complications of <italic>Prameha</italic>. Charaka has mentioned <italic>Daurbalya</italic> as a complication of <italic>Madhumeha</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Among the 10 <italic>dushyas</italic> of <italic>Prameha, Shukra</italic> is one, and its dushti ultimately leads to <italic>Klaibya</italic>. ED is also increasing due to the changes in the lifestyle and increased addictions, particularly smoking. Hence, it is the need of the hour to conduct researches in finding out safe, easily available, economic and potent medicines for the management of ED. Ashvattha (<italic>Ficus religiosa</italic>) is such a type of easily available herb that can be found throughout India. Sushruta has mentioned its aphrodisiac effect in men.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] It is used as <italic>Pumsavana</italic> in <italic>Atharva Veda</italic> (A. V., 6/2/11/1). Here, <italic>Pumsavana</italic> does not mean only to get male child, rather it is related to get the desired sex in the baby. In that way, it may also strengthen the men's genital organs to have qualitative and quantitative development in the Shukra without which we cannot get a male child. It also has hypoglycemic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and hypolipidaemic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] activity. Hence, the drug was selected to manage the ED in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>

However, the SLP motility, NP motility and total abnormal forms placebo groups showed better results than the Ashvattha group.</p><p>It may be noted that one of the non-diabetic patients suffering from ED who was treated with Ashvattha had secondary infertility since 4 years due to oligozoospermia (sperm count: 12 millions/ml).

The effect of Ashvattha in the improvement of erection and rigidity may be because of its <italic>Vrishya</italic> property by the virtue of <italic>Guru Guna</italic>. The <italic>Guru Guna</italic> has been mentioned as one among the six qualities of <italic>Vrishya Dravya</italic> by <italic>Charaka</italic> (Cha. Chi. 2/4/36). The aphrodisiac effect of Ashvattha is also described in the texts. The better effect on ejaculation score may be because of <italic>Stambhaka</italic> effect due to its <italic>Shita Guna</italic> and <italic>Kashaya Rasa</italic>. This acts as <italic>Shukra Stambhana</italic> and prevents premature ejaculation. The results found in orgasm and performance anxiety score may be due to its <italic>Shita Virya</italic>, cooling property and because of good performance by improvement in erection and ejaculation and by psychological counseling. The effect on post-act exhaustion may be due to the <italic>Guru Guna</italic> and <italic>Balya</italic> property of the test drug. Improvement on self and partner's satisfaction after intercourse may be because of improvement in erection, rigidity and the time of ejaculation. Moreover, the psychotherapy provided by the counseling also plays an important role in the satisfaction. The percentage-wise improvement in serum testosterone and serum DHEA-S may be due to its <italic>Shukra Vriddhikara Vrishya</italic> property, as these male androgens are being correlated with <italic>Sarva Shariragata Shukra</italic>. However, these results were statistically insignificant. Here, <italic>Guru</italic> and <italic>Shita Guna</italic> are similar to the properties of Shukra (Cha. Chi. 2/4/50). Here, the <italic>Shukra Vriddhikara Vrishya</italic> effect due to its <italic>Guru Guna</italic> and <italic>Shita Virya</italic> might have increased the sperm count. Ashvattha had caused mild increase in serum testosterone and DHEA-S levels, and testosterone stimulates sertoli cells to secrete paracrine agents that stimulate sperm proliferation and differentiation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The effect of Ashvattha on total motility and RLP motility may be due to its zinc content. Zinc is one of the contents in seminal plasma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and its role in increasing the motility is proven by modern researches.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] It is an important micronutrient in many enzyme systems in the body and takes part in metabolism of protein, fat and carbohydrate. It is also a component of insulin, growth hormone and antioxidant enzymes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The results found in diabetics were lower than those in non-diabetics because of the complex etiology of neurogenic, vasculogenic and endocrinal factors of diabetes. No encouraging result was found in the post-act exhaustion, which may be because of the additional debility due to diabetes in these patients. It cannot be concluded that placebo has a better effect than Ashvattha in reducing the blood sugar level because of a smaller sample size. Moreover, one patient among the six patients of the placebo group was a newly diagnosed case of DM, with high blood sugar levels. He was advised strict diet restriction due to which the post-treatment blood sample showed drastic reduction in the blood sugar levels. This single patient's result contributed to the overall better effect of the placebo group than in the treated group. Serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides were both reduced with Ashvattha, which may be due to its hypolipidemic effect, <italic>Kashaya Rasa, Ruksha Guna</italic> and <italic>Medohara</italic> properties. Other minerals and trace elements found in Ashvattha, like calcium, iron, copper and manganese are very much constructive for a healthy state. From these, it is clear that in both the diabetic and the non-diabetic patients, Ashvattha provided better improvement in comparison with the placebo.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Diabetes is one of the most common physical causes of ED associated with reduced quality of life among those affected. The etiology of diabetic impotence is complex, with neurogenic, vasculogenic and disordered local neuroeffector regulatory mechanisms contributing to the pathology of ED. A survey study reveals that ED is more common in DM, and with advancement of age and chronicity of the disease, the severity of ED increases. Socioenvironmental factors like distressed relationships, adverse life experiences, major financial crisis, bereavement and psychological stress have a profound influence on the mind and are capable of causing psychogenic ED. It seems that ED in diabetics is more difficult to cure in comparison with ED in non-diabetic subjects. Ashvattha showed a highly significant increase in total sperm count and total motility in non-diabetic subjects. Thus, it is a new addition in the list of <italic>Shukra Vriddhikara Vrishya</italic> drugs. It can be used in treating Oligoasthenozoospermia. On the basis of the results obtained, it can be concluded that Ashvattha is far better in comparison with the placebo in providing better cure to the patients of ED (<italic>Klaibya</italic>).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Ashtanga Hridaya with Ayurveda <italic>Rasayana</italic> and Sarvanga Sundari Comm, Nidana Sthana</article-title><year>2000</year><volume>10</volume><issue>23</issue><publisher-name>Chaukhambha publication</publisher-name><fpage>504</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Ashtanga samgraha, Athavale AD with Indu commentary published by Athvale MA</article-title><year>1980</year><volume>10</volume><issue>17</issue><publisher-loc>Nidana Sthana</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Trikamji</surname><given-names>Yadavji</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Charaka Samhita comm.
