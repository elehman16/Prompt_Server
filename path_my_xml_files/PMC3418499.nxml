Possibly, a high skin temperature causes a rating of perceived exertion (RPE)-mediated decrease in exercise intensity. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of skin temperature on power output during a 7.5-km cycling time trial. Thirteen well-trained male subjects performed a 7.5-km cycling time trial at 15&#x000b0;C and 50% relative humidity (CONTROL), with radiative heat stress during the time trial, and with (PRECOOL) or without (HEAT) precooling. Heat stress was applied by infrared heaters positioned in front of the cycle ergometer between 1.5 and 6.0&#x000a0;km. Skin, rectal, and pill temperature, power output, heart rate, and RPE were measured during the trial.

During exercise, several heat dissipation mechanisms (e.g., radiation, convection, evaporation) act together to prevent an excessive rise in core temperature (Fortney and Vroman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1985</xref>). However, when metabolic heat production cannot be compensated by heat dissipation (uncompensable heat stress), core body temperature may rise to critically high values. When an individual becomes hyperthermic, the activation of muscle motor units by the brain may be reduced, the sensation of fatigue occurs, and exercise performance can be seriously compromised (Gonzalez-Alonso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>; Nielsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1990</xref>; Nybo and Nielsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001</xref>).</p><p>Although a reduction in power output occurs with attainment of a high core temperature, studies on the effect of environmental heat stress on self-paced exercise performance have reported a reduction in power output, even when core temperature was not close to nominally critical values (Altareki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>; Ely et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>; Kay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2001</xref>; Marino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>; Tatterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2000</xref>; Tucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>). In general, either early reductions in power output are observed or there is an inability to maintain a desired power output until the end of exercise. One possible explanation for the observed reductions in power output during self-paced exercise can be that exercise intensity is decreased to compensate for the environmental heat stress. A decrease in power output results in modulation of the rise in core temperature and thereby delays the attainment of a core temperature at which homeostasis could become compromised (Marino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>; Tucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). This concept is one of the pillars of a recently developed model in which the regulation of exercise intensity during self-paced exercise is explained (Noakes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>; St Clair Gibson and Noakes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Tucker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>; Tucker and Noakes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2009</xref>). Within this model, it is proposed that the body functions as a complex system in which both anticipation and feedback are important in the regulation of exercise intensity during self-paced exercise. The anticipative component is reflected in the presence of a template of an acceptable rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise. This so-called RPE template is a theoretical construct based on expected exercise duration, previous experience, and physiological (e.g., skin temperature, core temperature) and psychological (e.g., motivation level) inputs before exercise (Tucker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>). It describes an acceptable rate of increase in RPE during exercise that allows successful completion of the event while avoiding homeostatic disturbance. The feedback component includes integration of afferent information from different physiological systems (e.g., core and skin temperature, heart rate, and muscle glycogen content) during exercise. Information from these systems is used to constitute a conscious RPE that is matched with the RPE template. If the conscious RPE is different from the RPE template, the recruitment of skeletal muscle motor units, and thereby the power output, is adjusted (Tucker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>).</p><p>Two factors that have been proposed as inputs for the anticipatory/feedback model of exercise regulation are skin temperature (Schlader et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011b</xref>) and the rate of heat storage (Altareki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>; Marino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>; Tucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). Cooling of the skin before the start of aerobic self-paced exercise has demonstrated beneficial effects on pacing pattern and performance (Kay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1999</xref>; Ross et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>). Schlader et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011b</xref>) observed that skin temperature and thermal perceptions at the start of a 60-min cycling time trial were determinants of the selection of initial exercise intensity, with lower skin temperatures resulting in an increase in average power output. Although precooling seems to be beneficial for endurance exercise rather than for intermittent and short duration exercise (Marino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>), lowering body temperature before exercise increases the &#x02018;thermal reservoir&#x02019; (Nielsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1994</xref>) and can possibly have positive effects on exercise performance. Tucker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>) instructed cyclists to cycle at a RPE value of 16 in cool (15&#x000b0;C), normal (25&#x000b0;C), and hot (35&#x000b0;C) conditions. They observed a greater rate of decline in power output in the hot condition than in cool and normal conditions. Additionally, they found a significantly greater rate of heat storage in the first 4&#x000a0;min of the trial in the hot condition. This greater rate of heat storage was a result of a higher skin temperature in the hot condition, as rectal temperature remained similar between conditions during this period. Since the calculation of rate of heat storage in this study has been invalidated (Jay and Kenny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>), the influence of this parameter on the regulation of exercise intensity remains questionable. However, the initial difference in the skin temperature does appear to be an important factor for the regulation of exercise intensity. In summary, the skin temperature seems to be an important factor for both anticipation (selection of power output at the start of exercise) and feedback control (modulation of power output during exercise) of exercise intensity in self-paced exercise.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, changes in skin temperature mainly affect power output during mid-duration and long-duration exercise (Duffield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>; Ross et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>; Schlader et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011b</xref>; Tucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). If skin temperature is also an important input factor for the selection and modulation of power output during short-duration, self-paced exercise remains essentially uninvestigated. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of a manipulation of skin temperature before and during exercise on performance and pacing pattern of a 7.5-km cycling time trial. We hypothesize that a lowering of skin temperature before the time trial increases initial power output, whereas an increase in skin temperature during the time trial decreases power output.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirteen well-trained male cyclists participated in this study (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

After the incremental test, subjects were given a 30-min recovery period before starting a 7.5-km practice cycling time trial to become familiar with the distance and procedure of the time trial. During the familiarization session no physiological parameters were measured. Apart from that, the trial was identical to the experimental trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cycling time trials</title><p>Three experimental trials were performed in a balanced order and scheduled at least 2&#x000a0;days apart. Each trial consisted of a 30-min passive habituation period followed by a 3-min warming-up period and immediately after that a 7.5-km cycling time trial. The subjects were instructed to complete the time trial as fast as possible and were blind to performance measurements (power, cadence, and heart rate), but were given feedback about the covered distance. The three experimental conditions were: control (CONTROL), heat stress (HEAT), and precooling&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;heat stress (PRECOOL). In CONTROL, subjects remained seated in an environmental chamber at 20&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. This period was followed by the cycling time trial at 15&#x000b0;C and 50% RH. HEAT was similar to CONTROL with the only difference being a period of extreme radiative heat stress that was imposed from 1.5 to 6.0&#x000a0;km during the time trial. The heat was generated by a panel consisting of 22 ceramic infrared heaters (FSR400, Elstein-Werk, Northeim, Germany), each generating a maximum of 400&#x000a0;W of heat. After the subject had completed 20% of the time trial, the heat panel was quickly positioned in front of the cycle ergometer, and after 80% of the distance was completed, the heat panel was quickly removed. This resulted in a distance of 4.5&#x000a0;km during which the subjects were exposed to the heat radiation. To maximize the effect of the sudden radiative heat exposure, subjects were wearing only cycling shorts and shoes and there was no airflow over the body. To quantify the heat radiation, a DRM Delta Radiometer (Helmut Hund GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) was positioned at a distance from the heat panel that was equal to the distance from the subject&#x02019;s trunk to the heaters. PRECOOL started with a precooling period of 30&#x000a0;min. In this period, subject remained seated in an environmental chamber set at 10&#x000b0;C and were wearing a water-perfused suit (Med-Eng BCS4, Allen-Vanguard, Ottawa, Canada) connected to a thermal water bath (Tamson TLC-15, Tamson instruments, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). The temperature of the water was maintained at 3&#x000b0;C. This suit covered the entire body, leaving only the area between mouth and eyes uncovered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measurements</title><p>Three hours before arrival at the lab, participants ingested a disposable core temperature capsule (Jonah, Hidalgo, Cambridge, UK) to measure intestinal temperature.

The main outcome was that skin temperature does not affect the selection and modulation of exercise intensity in this type of short-duration exercise. Therefore, we have to reject our hypothesis that a lowering of skin temperature before the time trial increases initial power output and that an increase in skin temperature during the time trial decreases power output.</p><p>The experimental set-up used in this experiment was similar to the set-up used by Johnson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>), who investigated the effects of the sudden application of hypoxia on power output during a 5-km cycling time trial. The protocol allowed us to investigate the importance of skin temperature as anticipatory signal at the start of exercise, and as afferent (thermophysiological) feedback during exercise. Because of the abrupt change in heat stress, also the temporal aspect of the response in power output could be investigated.</p><p>In this study, the average skin temperature at the start of the cycling time trial was 2.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.7&#x000b0;C lower for PRECOOL than for HEAT. Therefore, the precooling intervention was successful. No differences were found in rectal and pill temperature, heart rate, RPE, and respiratory measures. Interestingly, initial exercise intensity was similar for these conditions (247&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;79&#x000a0;W for PRECOOL and 258&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;71&#x000a0;W for HEAT), despite the difference in skin temperature. These observations imply that for this type of exercise (short-duration, self-paced), skin temperature at the beginning of exercise is not an important factor for the selection of initial exercise intensity. In a recent study, Schlader et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011b</xref>) examined the effect of skin temperature at the start of a 60-min cycling time trial on power output. They observed that the average power output was higher when subjects started with a low skin temperature and the skin was warmed during the time trial, than when they started with a high skin temperature and were cooled during the time trial. The higher average power output was mainly a result of the higher initial power output in the cold-to-hot trials. They concluded that, in contrast with our study, skin temperature (and accompanying thermal perception) at the beginning of the exercise was an important input signal for the selection of initial exercise intensity. This suggests that the signal of skin temperature is interpreted differently based on the anticipated duration of the event.</p><p>Another interesting observation in this study was the lower average power output during the cycling time trial for PRECOOL than for CONTROL. Our original hypothesis that precooling could increase the &#x02018;thermal reservoir&#x02019; and thereby improve performance (Marino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>; Nielsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1994</xref>), therefore, needs to be rejected for performances shorter than 12&#x000a0;min. Although skin temperature at the beginning of the exercise was markedly reduced in PRECOOL (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), changes in power output (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) were not observed. Since the applied method of precooling was whole-body cooling, also the legs were precooled. Therefore, a possible explanation for the reduction in average PO in PRECOOL could be a lower muscle temperature, leading to a greater contribution of anaerobic glycolysis at the beginning of exercise (Beelen and Sargeant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1991</xref>) and possibly a less effective muscle performance (Bennett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1984</xref>).</p><p>In this experiment, we showed that the application of radiative heat stress during exercise in PRECOOL and HEAT resulted in an increase in mean skin temperature during the time trial, whereas mean skin temperature slightly decreased over time in CONTROL (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Since both RPE and power output during the time trial were similar for CONTROL and HEAT, it can be concluded that in short-duration, self-paced exercise, skin temperature during exercise does not seem to be an important feedback signal for the RPE-based regulation of exercise intensity. This finding is supported by the weak inverse correlation between skin temperature and power output during the heat stress period and appears to be in disagreement with previous studies (Altareki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>; Tucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). Tucker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>), for example, observed a significantly higher rate of heat storage in the first 4&#x000a0;min of a RPE-clamped cycling trial in the heat (35&#x000b0;C) compared to cool (15&#x000b0;C) and normal (25&#x000b0;C) temperatures. Because rectal temperature was similar for the three conditions, the higher rate of heat storage was a result of a higher skin temperature. Since the rate of decline in exercise intensity was significantly higher in the heat, it can be deduced that afferent feedback regarding skin temperature affected the selection and modulation of exercise intensity. However, one important difference between the study of Tucker and our study is the duration of the time trial. In Tucker&#x02019;s study, the trial duration varied between 34.0 and 50.2&#x000a0;min depending on experimental condition, whereas in our study the distance of the time trial was (only) 7.5&#x000a0;km and the trial duration was ~12&#x000a0;min, which is at least three times shorter than in Tucker&#x02019;s study. The short duration of the time trial and the associated limited rise in core temperature in our study may explain the discrepancy in results between our study and previous studies. Traditionally, core temperatures of 39.0&#x000b0;C or higher are associated with fatigue during exercise in the heat (Cheung and Sleivert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004</xref>; Nybo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>). In short-duration exercise, however, the rise in core temperature is limited and probably exercise-limiting hyperthermia does not occur. However, recent studies show that aerobic performance in the heat can be reduced without marked hyperthermia (Altareki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>; Ely et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). In these studies, core temperature values were ~0.5&#x000b0;C higher than in our study, but still well below the values that are generally associated with fatigue.</p><p>Although the short duration of the time trial (and the associated limited rise in core temperature) could explain the absence of visible reductions in exercise intensity during the time trial, we suggest that during this type of short-duration, self-paced exercise, thermal information is relatively unimportant for the selection and adaptation of exercise intensity. We concur that the importance of signals in the regulation of pacing strategy differs with the distance/duration of the exercise bout (de Koning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>). In De Koning&#x02019;s study, the relative importance of physiological feedback signals in the regulation of pacing strategy was compared with the monitoring of different gauges by the driver of a race car during a race. One particular gauge is more important during short races, whereas another gauge is more important during long races. It appears that (the increase in) skin temperature is not an important physiological signal during a short-duration exercise bout. Since the radiative heat stress applied in this study elicited relatively large changes in skin temperature, we do not expect that an even greater increase in skin temperature would elicit RPE-mediated changes in power output. For future studies, it would be of interest to investigate from which distance/duration, a change in skin temperature does become an important feedforward and feedback signal. This signal seems to play a minor role in a cycling time trial of 7.5&#x000a0;km and duration of ~12&#x000a0;min, whereas it is important in cycling time trials of ~35&#x02013;50 (Tucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>) and 60&#x000a0;min (Schlader et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011b</xref>).</p><p>Not only skin temperature, but also thermal perceptions have been suggested as relevant signals for the selection and modulation of exercise intensity (Schlader et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011a</xref>), possibly by affecting the motivation to continue exercise in the heat (Cotter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>). In our study, thermal sensation was lower and thermal discomfort was higher before the start of the time trial in PRECOOL compared to HEAT. At the completion of the time trial, no differences were found between the conditions in either thermal sensation or thermal discomfort. The lower thermal sensation and the higher thermal discomfort before the start of the time trial could have resulted in a downwards shift of power output during exercise. Unfortunately, we did not record ratings of thermal sensation and discomfort during exercise, so the relationship between changes in thermal perception during exercise and power output remains unclear. For future studies, we would recommend recording thermal perceptions during exercise as these signals appear to be especially relevant for the selection and modulation of exercise intensity (Schlader et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011a</xref>).</p><p>In this study, mean skin temperature was determined using four iButtons. Using more locations to measure skin temperature would have increased the measurement accuracy (Mitchell and Wyndham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1969</xref>), but relatively more iButtons would then have been in close contact with the radiation of the heat panel. Although the iButtons were adequately shielded from the radiation, this might possibly have caused an overestimation of mean skin temperature, which we wanted to prevent. Moreover, since the subjects did not perceive their skin to be cold (Livingstone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1987</xref>), we believe the measured change in skin temperature reflects the actual change in skin temperature caused by the interventions, and that using only four measurement locations did not limit our findings. To determine core body temperature, both a rectal thermistor and a disposable core temperature capsule were used. Since both rectal and intestinal temperature react slower to a changing body temperature than esophageal temperature (Byrne and Lim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>), using these methods may limit our findings. However, using esophageal temperature as an index of core body temperature was not an option due to health risks associated with the esophageal thermistor and the extreme radiative heat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Changes in starting skin temperature and skin temperature during a 7.5-km cycling time trial do not affect performance and pacing pattern.
