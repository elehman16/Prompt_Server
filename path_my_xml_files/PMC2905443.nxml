In the USA, 70% of patients start HD with a CVC as the vascular access, and 30% of the prevalent patients are being dialyzed using a permanent catheter [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The use of CVC is associated with an increased mortality. Foley and colleagues reported that annual mortality was 26% for patients, and adjusted mortality hazard ratio was 2.18 with a CVC compared to patients with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Results of the HEMO study indicate that patients with CVC at the start and end of the observation period have an increased relative mortality risk of 3.4 compared to patients with AV fistula at both time points. Patients who switched from CVC to an AV fistula had a mortality risk of only 1.4 [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, the increased mortality risk seems to be directly associated with the use of CVC. One possible and likely cause of the increased mortality is infection and sepsis related to the CVC. Indeed, exit site infection is significantly related to death by sepsis [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, preventing CVC infection is of utmost importance.</p><p>Bismuth is a substance whose antimicrobial effects have been known for many years. Bismuth inhibits the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [<xref rid="ref5 ref6 ref7" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. The mechanism of antimicrobial action is not completely known but involves inhibition of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> rho transcription termination factor [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and iron transport [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More importantly, bismuth inhibits biofilm production by Staphylococci and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species [<xref rid="ref5 ref6" ref-type="bibr">5,6</xref>]. We therefore evaluated the impact of bismuth-coated CVC on clinical outcome in patients in need of vascular access for extracorporeal therapy in a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was conducted in the nephrology departments of three different clinics (Berlin, Munich and Bottrop). All patients in need of vascular access for acute extracorporeal therapy of presumably more than 1 week duration were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria were age &#x0003c;18 or &#x0003e;75 years, known hepatitis B or C, known HIV infection, a positive blood culture within 10 days before randomization, pregnancy, hospitalization of more than 14 days, respirator therapy, treatment with antibiotics or participation in another clinical study within 30 days before randomization.</p><p>Patients were informed by the study coordinators and gave written informed consent. The local ethics committee of all three clinics approved the study protocol. The study has been registered under ISRCTN 81821807.</p><p>End points were catheter survival, i.e. days to removal for any cause as well as bacterial contamination, DNA content of the catheter segments and laboratory results such as whole blood count, fibrinogen, antithrombin III and C-reactive protein.</p><p>After obtaining written informed consent, patients were randomized to either standard catheters (SC, GamCath&#x000ae;, Gambro) or to bismuth-film-coated catheters (FCC, GamCath Dolphin&#x000ae; Protect, Gambro). In order to obtain the Conformit&#x000e9; Europ&#x000e9;ene (CE)-sign, the catheters had been extensively tested with respect to bismuth release and toxicity before market authorization. The catheters meet the requirements according to current ISO 10993 (no risk to patient of toxicity from the exposure to Dolphin Protect&#x000ae; catheters). Randomization was performed by a list provided before the start of the study. The patients and clinicians who inserted the catheters were blinded to the study group assignment. Catheters were used according to clinical needs and placed considering universal hygienic precautions according to the European Best Practice Guidelines [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Between treatments, 30% citrate solution was used as a locking solution. Before each treatment, blood was obtained for whole blood count, fibrinogen, antithrombin III and C-reactive protein. These parameters were measured in the central laboratory of each clinic using routine methods.</p><p>Catheters were removed due to the discretion of the treating physician either when there was no longer need for extracorporeal therapy, when an alternative vascular access became available or when infection was suspected on clinical grounds.</p><p>After aseptic removal of the catheters, both lumina were flushed with 10 ml of sterile saline, and the effluent fluid was collected and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Then, the catheters were cut in three pieces under aseptic conditions and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Microbiology</title><p>Rinse fluids (10 ml) were filtered through membrane filters (Millipore, 0.45 &#x000b5;m, F4PN04370), and filters were subsequently cultured on sheep blood agar for 48 h at 36&#x000b0;C. The catheter tips (app. 2 cm) were placed in 10 ml of sterile saline and subjected to ultrasound sonication for 2 min at 35 kHz (Dentil, SonoRex RK100 H). The fluid supernatant was then filtered as described above, and filters were cultured on sheep blood agar for 48 h at 36&#x000b0;C. Colony-forming units (CFU) were counted and characterized with standard microbiological methods.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Detection of oligonucleotides</title><p>For detection of DNA sticking to the catheter surface, the tip of the catheters as described above as well as the next 2-cm piece (called shaft piece) were cut and placed in Tris&#x02013;EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5). The catheter pieces were subjected to sonication for 30 min and the buffer then assayed for oligonucleotides (ODN). ODN were detected using the Quant-it OliGreen kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) that labels ODN with a fluorescent dye and subsequently detects the bound amount of dye using a FLUOtest Optima fluorescent plate reader. The test was performed as described by the manufacturer; the sensitivity of the assay was 1.2 ng/ml.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistics</title><p>Catheter survival was analyzed by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis (log rank Mantel&#x02013;Cox test).

On the other hand, the secondary end point bacterial colonization was significantly lower for coated catheters compared to standard catheters indicating that bismuth coating of catheters was effective. The reason why less bacterial colonization did not translate into the clinical end point of catheter survival was the non-anticipated relatively short duration of catheter requirement in the present study. The mean duration of catheters in place was 18 and 15 days, respectively. Most patients received a catheter for acute malfunction of their usual vascular access or for acute renal failure; removal of catheters was mostly related to no further need instead of infections. Thus, the advantages of bismuth-film-coated catheters regarding colonization likely did not have enough time to turn into improved catheter survival. Indeed, when comparing tunneled and non-tunneled catheters, a difference in catheter survival was evident only at 2 weeks and later after catheter insertion [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In another study comparing different lock solutions, the difference in catheter survival was only evident after 50 days and later [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The present study demonstrates advantages of bismuth-coated catheters regarding bacterial colonization; further trials are warranted in patients with longer requirement of catheters to establish the benefits of coated catheters on catheter survival, morbidity and costs. In addition, bismuth has potential toxic effects such as cytotoxicity or neurotoxicity [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that may only be observed after treating a larger population. However, the total amounts of bismuth on the catheter surface is very low; we did not observe local reactions, and bismuth inhibits bacterial growth substantially at concentrations well below the toxic threshold in tissue culture [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Central venous catheters are widely used as vascular access. Data from the DOPPS study indicate that in Germany, 25% of incident HD patients start dialysis with catheters, while in other countries the use of catheters is even more common (France 40%, USA 70%). During recent years, the use of catheters in prevalent HD patients has even increased further [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Catheter-related blood stream infections are a significant cause for mortality in patients in intensive care units with up to 35% mortality [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Besides increasing mortality, catheter-related infections are associated with additional costs. It was calculated that one episode of catheter-related blood stream infections increases hospital expenditure between $11 000 and $54 000 [<xref rid="ref15 ref16" ref-type="bibr">15,16</xref>]. Thus, preventing catheter-related infections is of enormous clinical importance.</p><p>There are several options to prevent catheter infections. The use of antibiotics or bactericidal substances in lock solutions is more effective than heparin alone to prevent infections [<xref rid="ref12 ref17" ref-type="bibr">12,17</xref>]. The implementation of simple but strict standards for catheter placement and care significantly decreases catheter-related infections [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The present study indicates that the use of bismuth-coated catheters decreases bacterial colonization of HD catheters and may prevent potentially lethal catheter-related blood stream infections.</p><p>In the present study, many subjects (26 of 103) had to be excluded from analysis. Reasons for exclusion were mainly due to failure of proper catheter preservation/collection after removal. This large number was not anticipated and may have been caused by the complex procedure of catheter collection. However, exclusion occurred equally in all three participating centers and was equally distributed in both groups. We therefore do not consider exclusion of subjects as a major bias influencing our results.</p><p>A proposed strategy to reduce catheter-related blood stream infections catheter-related blood stream infections is the use of catheters impregnated or coated with antimicrobial substances such as chlorhexidine, bismuth, platinum and silver sulfadiazine or the antibiotics cefazolin or minocycline and rifampicin (for review, see [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). A number of studies during the last two decades are available on the effectiveness of antimicrobial catheters in preventing catheter-related blood stream infections and show that externally coated chlorhexidine&#x02013;silver catheters significantly reduce the risk of catheter-related blood stream infections in the intensive care unit [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a study on silver-coated, tunneled HD catheters, Trerotola <italic>et al</italic>. reported slightly but not significantly lower infection and colonization rates compared to uncoated catheters [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Minocycline&#x02013;rifampicin-coated catheters appear to be even more effective in preventing catheter-related blood stream infections. Despite these studies, coated catheters are not commonly used. There are reservations about the quality of the trial evidence, e.g. most studies were not blinded and were driven by manufacturers [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, all studies used either catheter colonization or catheter-related blood stream infections as end points; none of these studies investigated hard clinical end points such as mortality, length of hospital stay etc. Other factors related to cost, toxicity and increased microbial resistance prevented the recommendation for these catheters. Also, the use of these devices may divert resources needed to implement other evidence-based preventive measures that are more likely to be effective than coated catheters [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Our study demonstrated significant differences in catheter colonization between a noncoated and a bismuth-coated catheter in a clinical setting. We did not choose mortality as an end point because a much larger number of subjects would have been needed to demonstrate a significant difference in mortality. However, the present study was randomized, prospective and fully blinded to both patients and participant physicians. Thus, the design was superior to most previous studies on coated catheters. It is also one of the first studies in patients in need of extracorporeal therapy exclusively and the first one using bismuth-coated catheters. We could demonstrate that bismuth coating of central vein catheters for HD reduces bacterial colonization without showing signs of adverse events. Bismuth-coated catheters may not eliminate the problem of catheter-related blood stream infections but at least improve its rate. Given the great importance of CVC infections for both prevalent and incident HD patients, further and larger trials may prove that Bismuth-coated catheters may contribute to lower morbidity and possibly mortality of HD patients.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title/><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
