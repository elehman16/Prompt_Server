However, its effectiveness for knowledge acquisition is less validated. We performed a randomized study with the primary aim of investigating whether HFS, in association with frontal lessons, would improve knowledge about advanced life support (ALS), in comparison to frontal lessons only among medical students. The secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of HFS on knowledge acquisition of different sections of ALS and personal knowledge perception. Participants answered a pre-test questionnaire consisting of a subjective (evaluating personal perception of knowledge) and an objective section (measuring level of knowledge) containing 100 questions about algorithms, technical skills, team working/early warning scores/communication strategies according to ALS guidelines. All students participated in 3 frontal lessons before being randomized in group S, undergoing a HFS session, and group C, receiving no further interventions. After 10 days from the end of each intervention, both groups answered a questionnaire (post-test) with the same subjective section but a different objective one. The overall number of correct answers of the post-test was significantly higher in group S (mean 74.1, SD 11.2) than in group C (mean 65.5, SD 14.3), p = 0.0017, 95% C.I. 3.34 &#x02013; 13.9. A significantly higher number of correct answers was reported in group S than in group C for questions investigating knowledge of algorithms (p = 0.0001; 95% C.I 2.22&#x02013;5.99) and team working/early warning scores/communication strategies (p = 0.0060; 95% C.I 1.13&#x02013;6.53). Students in group S showed a significantly higher score in the post-test subjective section (p = 0.0074). A lower proportion of students in group S confirmed their perception of knowledge compared to group C (p = 0.0079). HFS showed a beneficial effect on knowledge of ALS among medical students, especially for notions of algorithms and team working/early warning scores/communication.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-fidelity simulation (HFS) is a learning method consisting on reproduction of medical scenarios through the use of a computerized manikin that can be programmed to recreate clinical conditions and to react to learners&#x02019; actions in a controlled and safe setting.

[<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Advanced life support (ALS) is a set of life-saving protocols, skills and information aiming to support vital functions in cardiorespiratory arrest victims and other life-threatening situations developed by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC). [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this context, lack of knowledge is associated with mismanagement and poor patients&#x02019; outcome. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] According to the theory of adult experiential learning by Kolb, the learning process consists of four circular phases: 1) concrete experience 2) reflective observation 3) abstract conceptualization 4) active experimentation. <italic>Concrete experience</italic> is the source for observation and reflection. During the second phase of <italic>reflective observation</italic>, the learner is involved in a process of attentive consideration of events, leading to creation of a general sense from the offered particular experience. The learner is then prone to actively test the product of the experiential learning in different situations, starting the circle again. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] HFS provides the learners a realistic experience, the possibility to reflect on actions and to create abstract concepts, which may eventually be applied in new situations of their daily clinical practice. Through this process, knowledge may be created and/or reinforced by the transformation of experience. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Few studies have been designed with the primary aim of investigating the usefulness of HFS for knowledge acquisition in the setting of ALS and no studies investigated its effect on different categories of notions. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Moreover, the outcome of knowledge was not always assessed by a tool with enough sensitivity and specificity, possibly explaining the mild to moderate effect size of simulation, when compared to alternative learning methods, in previously published meta-analyses. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] HFS is also costly and time-consuming, as it needs specialized personnel, equipment and spaces. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Therefore, its effectiveness for knowledge acquisition should be demonstrated by a study designed to assess the additional contribution of HFS for the learning process of ALS. The primary aim of our study was to compare frontal lessons, followed by a HFS session, with frontal lessons alone as a learning method for ALS among medical students. The secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of HFS on knowledge acquisition of different sections of ALS and personal knowledge perception of students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We obtained the approval from the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital &#x0201c;P.

Students randomized in the control group (Group C) were asked to answer the post-test questionnaire consisting of both <italic>subjective</italic> and <italic>objective</italic> sections. The <italic>subjective</italic> section was identical to the pre-test apart from one additional question asking whether the participant had changed his/her personal perception of knowledge in light of the training on ALS. The <italic>objective</italic> section consisted on 100 true-false questions, different from those included in the pre-test but still regarding the topics included in the syllabus. The same 2-hour interval of pre-test was allowed for its completion. Participants randomized in the group S were divided in 3 groups in order to complete the simulation sessions within 3 days. The simulation sessions were run by an instructor with a crisis resource management official certification (Institute of patient safety, inPASS). The high-fidelity simulator SimMan 2 by Laerdal (Stavanger, Norway) was used for the simulation sessions. During HFS, algorithms, technical skills and team working/early warning scores/communication strategies were incorporated into each scenario. At the beginning of each session, the students had the possibility to interact with the simulator, devices (e.g. defibrillators, monitors, airway management equipment) and environment. A student was randomly assigned as team leader and the remaining participants as team members. Each student participated in 3 different scenarios acting as team leader at least in one of them. An investigator completed a checklist of topics to be included in each scenario. Simulations sessions were conducted using the <italic>on the fly</italic> modality <italic>with trends and handlers</italic> in which the instructor maintains a full manual control of all simulator features and parameters with the addition of some pre-programmed sets of actions and physiological parameters modifications.

We expected a standard deviation (SD) of 15 in each group. The sample size was increased by 15% for non-parametric tests use (when appropriate). A further 15% was added for drop out/lost of follow-up students, according to our experience. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Therefore, we planned to include 50 students in each group. We analyzed variables distribution with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and checked the plot distribution of the data for detection of skewness. Homoscedasticity was tested by the F-test. We calculated and reported mean and SD for variables with a normal distribution. When homogeneity of variance was observed, a Student&#x02019;s T-test was adopted for comparison of independent groups. In case of unequal variances, a Welch-test was performed and reported. We expressed variables without a normal distribution as median and interquartile ranges (IQR, 25<sup>th</sup>&#x02014;75<sup>th</sup>) and comparisons were performed with Mann-Whitney U-test. Mann-Whitney U and the test statistic Z (corrected for ties) were reported as a measure for differences between groups. A frequency table was constructed and the chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used for comparisons of proportions. For the post-hoc analysis, a multiple regression model was constructed. An overall post-test score equal or higher than 70% in the objective section was adopted as dependent variable. The threshold of 70% of right answers in the post-test as a target of meaningful knowledge acquisition was selected by consensus before the study, according to previous experience. A stepwise method was used for inclusion of independent variables into the model. We tested the power of the calculated model by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test. We calculated and reported odds ratios as a measure of correlation between variables. Internal consistency of the subjective questionnaire was investigated by the Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha statistic.

Our study design aimed to test HFS as an additional learning tool for medical student and not as an alternative classic teaching method. The rationale behind this design is that participants to HFS session should have a certain grade of knowledge about the topic of HFS sessions in order to take the best out of all simulation phases. Background knowledge can be provided by preliminary teaching lessons, self-learning and/or previous clinical experience. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Since medical students in our study could have had heterogeneous background knowledge about ALS, we decided to standardize preliminary knowledge giving them the same information through frontal lessons. However, pre-test results showed no significant differences in baseline knowledge between the two groups.</p><p>Considering the different categories of knowledge, a significant difference in correct questions between the two groups was observed only for algorithms and team working/early warning scores/communication strategies. Consistent results were reported after considering not correct answers. Of note, we decided to analyze also not correct answers since we believe that knowledge acquisition may be measured either as a gain in correct answers in the post-test or a lesser number of not correct answers (wrong and not given answers). It may be argued that HFS enhances those notions requiring an interaction among team members or rapid adoption of sequence of actions. The advantage of HFS for learning notions about ALS algorithms may be explained by the reflective practice during each scenario and debriefing session. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Therefore, most students in group S referred to feel confident and able to recognize all possible rhythms of presentation of a cardiac arrest. However, during debriefing, they freely reported that living a HFS and experiencing the need for a rapid decision making in a stressful environment is different and this experience led them to reconsider their previously reported opinion about their knowledge of ALS. Team working is a key issue for safe and effective patient care. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Even if principles of leadership and team working has been established and embodied in curricula, it seems that HFS provides a useful contribution for their reinforcement. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Categories of team communication, leadership, coordination and decision-making have been included in a team performance framework influencing patient outcome. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] These finding are particularly true for ALS and have been confirmed in previously published studies on simulation and further investigated in light of the underlying psychological dynamics. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] We may argue that being involved in a HFS scenario as a team leader or team member had a positive influence in deep comprehension of these notions through their direct experience. Poor communication among team members has been recognized as a potential source of error and adverse events in critical care setting. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Communication strategies have been developed in order to provide healthcare practitioners a method for an effective transmission of information in a structured and organized manner. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] In all scenarios of our study, we created events forcing participants to transmit information and orders to other colleagues through the adoption of a structured communication strategy. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We believe that this had a positive effect on knowledge acquisition about team working/communication among students in group S. This finding has been previously reported in studies investigating the benefit of simulation for team working during inter-professional scenarios. [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>Participation in a HFS simulation session was independently associated with a higher post-test score since students who underwent a HFS showed a four times probability of scoring 70% or higher on post-test questionnaire. The pre-test score had a negligible, though significant, influence on a higher post-test scoring. We decided to include the variable <italic>last year of medical school</italic> in the logistic regression model since, in Italy, students attend lessons of ALS during the emergency medicine course during the last year. Another reason is that they may have more clinical experience than younger colleagues. However, attending the last year of medical school did not show a correlation with post-test score.</p><p>This study has limitations. Firstly, one may argue that part of the observed benefit of HFS on knowledge could be attributed simply to the additional learning intervention by itself, leading to a repetition of the same information, irrespective of its modality. However, we believe it is unlikely that any learning intervention would have provided the same effect on knowledge instead of HFS. The reason for this belief is that HFS is intrinsically different from any other intervention since the learner goes through the adult learning circle with his/her background without any passive acquisition/recalling of notions. Of note, according to our results, only specific categories of knowledge (algorithms and team working/early warning scores/communication) received a significant benefit from HFS.</p><p>It may be argued that our <italic>2-versus-1</italic> interventional design presents intrinsic limitations that could have been overcome adding another session of frontal lesson for the students who underwent only the first lesson. This strategy would have the value of comparing two educational strategy consisting of two interventions each (frontal lesson plus frontal lesson versus frontal lesson plus HFS) perhaps leading theoretically to a more balanced comparison. However, our study design was aimed to be pragmatic and reflecting the real world of medical education. Frontal lessons and HFS are nowadays the most common educational methods used in medicine and the aim of our design was to compare them in terms of efficacy in knowledge recreating the real educational practice where they are often associated. In our opinion, an association of two frontal lessons about the same topic within a short period of time would not reflect real educational practice and may lead to a difficult interpretation of the results and difficult application in daily activity by the educators.</p><p>Another limitation may be attributed to the lack of previous assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of our questionnaires for detection of the effect of the intervention. However, we decided to formulate 100 different questions for pre-test and post-test, exploring the categories of algorithms, technical skills and team working/early warning scores/communication in order to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of our tool. Another limitation is the difficult exact reproducibility of each scenario (depending on participants&#x02019; competence and interactions). However, we tried to standardize each scenario by including all knowledge categories described in the syllabus and further confirming their observation during simulation by a checklist. Before each scenario, we randomly selected a team leader and team members. Of note, all participants in each simulation scenario were invited to join a learning conversation with the instructor and other participants during the debriefing session. We preferred to administer the post-test questionnaire on a single day for all students in group S in order to avoid the possible diffusion of questions among participants performing the test on different days. Another limitation could be the additional learning activities of the students during the post-intervention period before the post-test. It is possible that, during this time period, students could have reviewed the information provided during lessons. We believe that it is not possible to avoid this event and we decided to provide the official ERC ALS guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0125685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] website link in order to standardize the source of information. Finally, another limitation is the single assessment of knowledge during the period following the interventions. However, we selected an intermediate time frame of 10 days from the end of both frontal lessons and HFS sessions, in order to avoid the previously reported <italic>boosting effect</italic> occurring soon after an educational intervention while excluding the possible influence of other, unpredictable factors (e.g. academic lessons, daily-work activities) which would have intervened in case of a longer follow-up.
