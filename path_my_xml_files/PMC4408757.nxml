A core aim of the study was to empirically test two central ICT propositions on the effects of using the coached person&#x02019;s Positive Emotional Attractor (vision/PEA) versus Negative Emotional Attractor (improvement needs/NEA) as the anchoring framework of a onetime, one-on-one coaching session on appraisal of 360&#x000b0; feedback and discussion of possible change goals. Eighteen coaching recipients were randomly assigned to two coaching conditions, the coaching to vision/PEA condition and the coaching to improvement needs/NEA condition. Two main hypotheses were tested. Hypothesis<sub>1</sub> predicted that participants in the vision/PEA condition would show higher levels of expressed positive emotion during appraisal of 360&#x000b0; feedback results and discussion of change goals than recipients in the improvement needs/NEA condition. Hypothesis<sub>2</sub> predicted that vision/PEA participants would show lower levels of stress immediately after the coaching session than improvement needs/NEA participants. Findings showed that coaching to vision/the PEA fostered significantly lower levels of expressed negative emotion and anger during appraisal of 360&#x000b0; feedback results as compared to coaching to improvements needs/the NEA. Vision-focused coaching also fostered significantly greater exploration of personal passions and future desires, and more positive engagement during 360&#x000b0; feedback appraisal. No significant differences between the two conditions were found in emotional processing during discussion of change goals or levels of stress immediately after the coaching session. Current findings suggest that vision/PEA arousal versus improvement needs/NEA arousal impact the coaching process in quite different ways; that the coach&#x02019;s initial framing of the session predominantly in the PEA (or, alternatively, predominantly in the NEA) fosters emotional processing that is driven by this initial framing; and that both the PEA (and associated positive emotions) and NEA (and associated negative emotions) play an important and recurrent role in shaping the change process. Further study on these outcomes will enable researchers to shed more light on the differential impact of the PEA versus NEA on intentional change, and how to leverage the benefits of both emotional attractors. Findings also suggest that coaches can benefit from better understanding the importance of tapping intrinsic motivation and personal passions through coaching to vision/the PEA. Coaches additionally may benefit from better understanding how to leverage the long-term advantages, and restorative benefits, of positive emotions during coaching engagements. The findings also highlight coaches&#x02019; need to appreciate the impact of timing effects on coaching intentional change, and how coaches can play a critical role in calibrating the pace and focus of work on intentional change. Early arousal of the coachee&#x02019;s PEA, accompanied by recurrent PEA&#x02013;NEA induction, may help coachees be/become more creative, optimistic, and resilient during a given change process. Overall, primary focus on vision/PEA and secondary focus on improvement needs/NEA may better equip coaches and coaching recipients to work together on building robust learning, development, and change.

Coaching is generally understood to involve practical, goal-focused forms of one-on-one learning and behavioral change (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Peterson and Hicks, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 1999</xref>). Promoting learning and behavior change in coaching contexts involves work on intentional change.</p><p>Intentional change is deliberate, altering, demanding. It results from the conscious effort to establish new behaviors that are different from what they currently are or appear to be (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ford and Ford, 1994</xref>). A key challenge for coaches is finding ways to support coachees for practicing new behaviors and/or building new habits and competencies. Although problem-focused coaching is an accepted approach to intentional change, positive psychology theory and research support the idea that vision-focused coaching helps coachees be more energized and resilient during work on desired change as compared to problem focused coaching. As <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kauffman (2006)</xref> argues, &#x0201c;an explicitly positive psychology framework suggests that a language of strength and vision rather than weakness and pain be the firm foundation on which the coaching work rests&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kauffman, 2006</xref>, p. 220).</p><p>The proposed shift from problem-focused coaching to vision-focused coaching does not imply that the &#x0201c;Pollyanna Principle&#x0201d; (i.e., excessive optimism) should drive the coaching agenda. Instead, coaches are encouraged to help their clients move more deftly between attention to vision and values, and attention to problems and improvement needs. Intentional change theory (ICT) proposes that executive coaches who anchor a coaching process in the coaching recipient&#x02019;s vision <italic>(PEA framing/early induction of positive affect)</italic> trigger positive cognitive emotional processing associated with the broaden and build effect (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2000a</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson and Joiner, 2002</xref>), i.e., ways in which positive emotions broaden and build thought-action repertories and attentional focus; speed recovery from negative emotional experiences and crises; optimize emotional well-being, physical health, and resilience; and undo the damaging effects of negative emotion (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson, 2000b</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gottman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Tugade et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Isen and Reeve, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tugade and Fredrickson, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, executive coaches who anchor a coaching process in the coaching recipient&#x02019;s improvement needs <italic>(NEA framing/early induction of negative affect)</italic> trigger negative cognitive affective processing associated with adaptive response to extrinsic requirements and/or threats, i.e., ways in which negative emotions assist rapid recognition of problems, appraisal of negative feedback, evaluation of weaknesses, surfacing of fears and anxieties, and mobilization of psychophysiological energy for coping with situational concerns (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">French, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sanford and Rowatt, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Parrott, 2014</xref>). <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> presents the proposed differential impacts of PEA framing versus NEA framing.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Differential impacts of PEA framing versus NEA framing on a coaching recipient&#x02019;s change process</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-06-00455-g001"/></fig><p>This paper empirically tests these ICT propositions and offers suggestive empirical support for the advantages of coaching to vision [i.e., coaching to the Positive Emotional Attractor (PEA)] versus coaching to problems and improvement needs [i.e., coaching to the Negative Emotional Attractor (NEA)].

Negative emotions (aroused by the NEA) trigger a different process by calling attention to current social and environmental challenges and stressors that may compromise one&#x02019;s effectiveness. While both positive and negative emotions play an important role in intentional change, it is critically important to leverage the beneficial effects of positive affect (aroused by the PEA) throughout the change process.</p><p>The PEA is defined as the personal values, hopes, dreams, possibilities, strengths, optimism, and self-directed learning goals that make up the Ideal Self, i.e., our vision of what we most aspire to be and become (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boyatzis, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Boyatzis and Akrivou, 2006</xref>). The organizing power of vision/the PEA stems from positive emotions (and emotional appraisals) aroused by affirming thoughts, feelings, memories, meaning, and self-worth that constitute the Ideal Self &#x02014; and by arousal of the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and neural circuits predominantly in the left prefrontal cortex. When intentional change is initiated by connecting to vision/the PEA, change becomes grounded in intrinsic motivation, personal passion, resonant meaning, belief in possibility and the psychophysiological benefits of PSNS arousal and neurogenesis.</p><p>The NEA is defined as the present reality, requirements, problems, shortfalls, fears, pessimism, and improvement goals that constitute the Real Self (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boyatzis, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, 2006</xref>), i.e., our conception of what we actually are in everyday life. The organizing power of the NEA stems from negative emotions (and emotional appraisals) associated with and aroused by dissonant thoughts, feelings, memories, meaning and concerns about self-efficacy that comprise the Real Self &#x02014; and by NEA arousal of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and neural circuits predominantly in the right prefrontal cortex.</p><p>During intentional change, negative emotions aroused by the NEA help the individual remain cognizant about salient environmental requirements and personal improvements that must be made. Negative emotions also support analysis of what needs to be done first, (priority setting), what stands in the way (obstacles, barriers), what resources are lacking, and what is not presently working (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Diamond and Aspinwall, 2003</xref>). This information is central to the development of change goals and helps the individual to outline realistic approaches to behavior change.</p><p>The drawback of negative emotional arousal is that it keeps the person more narrowly focused on the challenges of present reality and introduces psychophysiological reactions that trigger self-protective cognitive and physiological response, but at the cost of &#x0201c;directing blood to large muscle groups, closing down non-essential neural circuits, suspending the immune system, and producing cortisol&#x0201d; (cortisol&#x02019;s upside is that it catalyzes defensive response, but the downside is that cortisol inhibits neurogenesis and &#x0201c;overexcites older neurons, rendering them useless&#x0201d;; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boyatzis, 2006</xref>, p. 25).</p><p>Because episodes of negative emotional arousal tax the mind and body, and because intentional change is characterized by recurrent arousal of negative emotions, it is important to leverage the restorative effects of positive emotions throughout the change process. Failure to leverage the restorative effects of positive emotion compromises recovery from negative emotional episodes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gottman et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Interplay of Positive Emotion and Negative Emotion in Intentional Change</title><p>Recurrent arousal of positive emotion (activated by vision/the PEA) and negative emotion (activated by the Real Self/NEA) is a central feature of intentional change. Desired change is more lasting and effective when vision/the PEA serve as the primary focus of the change effort and when the Real Self/NEA is the secondary focus (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boyatzis, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Howard, 2006</xref>). Change efforts primarily framed by arousal of vision/the PEA foster more robust learning and development than change efforts predominately framed by Real Self/NEA arousal. Promoting change through vision/PEA arousal grounds the change process in constructive cognitive and physiological processes that enhance motivation, effort, creative thinking, optimism, flexibility, resilience, and recovery from stressful thoughts, feelings, or experiences. Conversely, change promoted through NEA arousal activates defensive emotional processes concerned with minimization or prevention of losses, self-protection, and use of vigilance means (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brockner and Higgins, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Higgins et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Grounding the change process primarily in vision/the PEA, and secondarily in the Real Self/NEA, does not compromise an actor&#x02019;s engagement in capacity-building coping responses moved by the NEA. For example, a study by <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Isen and Reeve (2005)</xref> found that positive affect fostered intrinsic motivation without compromising involvement in meeting extrinsic requirements. When NEA arousal occurs within a change event that is framed by early PEA arousal, the individual is more resilient and flexible in overcoming challenges and stressors identified through negative emotional processing. Grounding a change process primarily in the PEA promotes the kind of change recommended by <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">DiClemente (1999</xref>, p. 211), i.e., change that responds to environmental demands, yet is &#x0201c;reinforced by incentives that are owned by the individual so that they become integrated into the life of that individual.&#x0201d; Coaching primarily to vision/the PEA, and secondarily to the Real Self/NEA, leverages the advantages of both positive <italic><underline>and</underline></italic> negative emotion.</p></sec><sec><title>Timing</title><p>Intentional change theory (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boyatzis, 2006</xref>) places great emphasis on the <italic>timing and sequence</italic> of affect induction. The ICT model is a non-linear process model wherein desired sustainable change is enhanced by deliberate early induction of positive affect (PEA arousal) followed by recurrent engagement in both negative emotional processing and positive emotional processing (the interplay of positive emotion and negative emotion). Early PEA arousal, followed by the interplay of positive and negative affect, organizes emotional self-regulation that enables coachees (a) to initially ground the change effort in intrinsic motivation triggered by PEA arousal; (b) as the change process unfolds, to handle salient challenges and stressors through proactive coping responses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aspinwall and Taylor, 1997</xref>) triggered by NEA arousal; and (c) to continually re-center and reenergize through adaptive behaviors moved by PEA arousal. The unfolding PEA&#x02013;NEA interplay is dynamic (self-organizing, emergent, unpredictable), iterative (repeated in fits and starts), and non-linear (multidirectional and fluctuating; it is ordered by episodic disruption, modification, and trial-and-error rather than straight linear progression).</p><p>According to the ICT perspective, a key advantage of recurrent PEA&#x02013;NEA arousal is that it enables people to leverage vision and strengths (promotion-focused activity/the Ideal Self) during the change process while also dealing with problems and fears (prevention-focused activity/the Real Self). When the interplay of positive and negative emotions occurs within a change process framed by early PEA arousal, individuals access the broad range of adaptive coping behaviors moved by both kinds of affective processing. Application of vision-focused coaching (anchoring intentional change primarily in the PEA and secondarily in the NEA) is enormously helpful in situations characterized by high challenge, rapid change, or chronic stress (e.g., fierce competition, extreme financial strain, chronic illness, job loss, organizational restructuring, etc.). Again, recurrent PEA&#x02013;NEA activation leverages hope, optimism, resilience, strength, and other proactive responses, <italic>and also promotes</italic> assessment of problems or threat, pragmatic reasoning, and self-protective coping.</p><p>Intentional change theory views on recurrent PEA&#x02013;NEA arousal are undergirded in part by selected cognitive emotion research on temporal effects in emotional processing during work on behavior change. For example, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson&#x02019;s (2000b</xref>, pp. 595&#x02013;603) review of empirical research on the &#x02018;peak-and-end rule&#x02019; suggests that under-researched timing effects play a significant role in determining specific ways in which positive and negative emotions influence evaluation of change requirements and future possibilities. Similarly, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Gross (2001)</xref> found that specific emotion regulation strategies have different impacts depending on <italic>when</italic> they are employed. His research suggests that <italic>antecedent-focused strategies</italic> (feelings, behaviors, and physiological responses experienced early in the process of assessing a stimulus event) have more calming behavioral and physiological effects as compared to <italic>response-focused strategies</italic> (feelings, behaviors, and physiological responses experienced after a person&#x02019;s event response-tendencies are activated). Other regulatory focus theories have demonstrated that framing a task as promotion-focused (e.g., vision/PEA priming) versus prevention-focused (e.g., improvement needs/NEA priming) triggers timing effects. In one set of studies framing a task as prevention-focused fostered preferences to initiate action earlier than did framing the task as promotion-focused (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Freitas et al., 2002</xref>). Based on this result, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Freitas et al. (2002)</xref> reasoned that initially framing a new activity as promotion-focused <italic>(conceptualized in ICT as a primary focus on vision/the Ideal Self)</italic> fosters a willingness to adopt it, but once the activity has begun, reframing it as prevention-focused <italic>(conceptualized in ICT as a secondary focus on improvement needs/the Real Self)</italic> fosters interest in meeting or completing the activities&#x02019; requirements.</p><p>In a related stream on non-linear dynamics in human emotion and flourishing, work on positivity ratios (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gottman, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gottman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Losada and Heaphy, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson and Losada, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson, 2013</xref>) contributes evidence that it is possible to describe the emotional experience of human systems <italic>(individuals, teams, groups, organizations)</italic> in terms of the ratio of positivity to negativity (P/N) identified through the coding of expressed emotion in spoken and verbal communication, and that high positivity ratios are associated with effective behavior, performance, and flourishing &#x02013; while low positivity ratios are associated with less optimal outcomes.</p><p>While not conclusive, taken together these researches suggest that the timing and sequence of affect induction may play an influential role in the change process such that early arousal of vision/the PEA increases intrinsic interest/openness to change, and recurrent PEA&#x02013;NEA arousal promotes robust work on both vision/the Ideal Self <italic><underline>and</underline></italic> improvement needs/the Real Self. Few studies have empirically tested ICT propositions on how positive and negative emotional interplay shapes the experience of coaching recipients during real-time coaching sessions, or the influence of coaches&#x02019; timing and framing <italic>(coaching to vision/the PEA versus coaching to improvement needs/the NEA)</italic> on the coaching process and experience. As described in the following sections, the present study contributes preliminary findings on these dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study examined the emotional experience of eighteen coachees during a onetime, hour-long, one-on-one executive coaching session conducted by an executive coach. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two coaching conditions: the vision/PEA condition or improvement needs/NEA condition.

In the improvement needs/NEA condition the coach used the participant&#x02019;s perceived improvement needs, weaknesses, and current reality (Real Self) as the primary framework. Two main hypotheses were tested.

In addition to help on interpreting their 360&#x000b0; feedback results, all coachees received support from the coach on exploring 2&#x02013;3 possible change goals. Discussion of change goals built on participants&#x02019; analysis of their feedback results.

To assess positive emotion experienced by the coachee during the coaching session, all coaching sessions were audio taped and transcribed. Positive emotion experienced by the coachee was analyzed by measuring the percentage of positive versus negative emotion words in transcripts of coaching recipients&#x02019; speech during the coaching sessions. Only transcripts of the coachee&#x02019;s speech were assessed for purposes of this study; the coach&#x02019;s speech was not analyzed. The transcripts were content analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Pennebaker et al., 2003</xref>) that assesses the emotional, cognitive, structural, and process components present in verbal and written speech.

Conversely, participants in the PEA group focused primarily on future possibilities and strengths, engaged in a lesser amount of negative emotional processing than did the NEA group (and perhaps were more energized by the coaching conversation than participants in the NEA group), hence were sadder to see the session come to an end.

For example, at the beginning of the coaching session PEA participants were induced by their respective coaches to focus on the Ideal Self (hopes, strengths, desired future), and NEA participants were induced to focus on the Real Self (improvement needs, weaknesses, current reality). The significant interaction effect for future suggests that early PEA arousal led the PEA group to (1) focus on the future in segment A (indicated by a higher percentage of words coded for future as compared to the NEA group); (2) switch its focus to present reality in segment B (indicated by a relative decrease in percentage of words coded for future in segment B); and (3) refocus on the future in segment C (indicated by a relative increase in percentage of words coded for future in segment C). Conversely, early NEA arousal led the NEA group to (1) focus on present reality in segment A (indicated by a lower percentage of words coded for future as compared to the PEA group); (2) switch its focus to the future in segment B (indicated by a relative increase in percentage of words coded for future in segment B); and (3) refocus on present reality in segment C (indicated by a relative decrease in percentage of words coded for future in segment C).</p><p>Again, ICT (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Boyatzis, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Howard, 2006</xref>), supported by selected emotion regulation research (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Freitas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Diamond and Aspinwall, 2003</xref>) and cognitive emotion research on non-linear dynamics in human flourishing/positivity ratios (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gottman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Losada and Heaphy, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sanford and Rowatt, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson and Losada, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson, 2013</xref>), proposes that intentional change is characterized by recurrent PEA-NEA arousal, and that (associated) interplay of positive emotion and negative emotion shapes the form and flow of intentional change. In the current study, segment-to-segment reversals documented by the significant interaction effects for sadness or depression and future can be viewed as suggestive evidence on recurrent PEA&#x02013;NEA&#x02013;PEA arousal (PEA condition) and recurrent NEA&#x02013;PEA&#x02013;NEA arousal (NEA condition), and related PA&#x02013;NA interplay during the coaching hour.</p><p>As discussed earlier (see Role of the Positive Emotional Attractor (PEA) and Negative Emotional Attractor (NEA) in Intentional Change to Timing), negative emotions facilitate identification of situational requirements, weaknesses, and problems &#x02014; and mobilize extrinsic motivation and self-protective coping.

Overall, the PEA group&#x02019;s significantly higher expression of personal interests/passions and significantly lower demonstration of negative emotions and anger, as compared to the NEA group, are interpreted as preliminary evidence that the NEA group was more narrowly focused on extrinsic requirements and self protective coping than was the PEA group, and indirect evidence that the PEA group may have experienced higher levels of positive emotion than did the NEA group. Interestingly, comparison of means for the PEA group (<italic>M</italic> = 2.896) versus NEA group (<italic>M</italic> = 2.886) on the non-significant main effect for positive emotions reveals a trend in this direction (mean for PEA &#x0003e; NEA.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis<sub>2</sub>: Level of Stress Immediately After the Coaching Session</title><p>Hypothesis<sub>2</sub> predicted that participants in the PEA condition would show lower levels of stress immediately following the coaching session than participants in the NEA condition. Level of stress was assessed by the measuring the cortisol levels (ug/dl) of participants in the PEA and NEA groups before and after their respective coaching sessions. Cortisol assays were analyzed by a clinical research laboratory and pre to post-coaching change in salivary cortisol was calculated for each participant (n-18). The change in mean cortisol levels (post&#x02013;pre) was compared between the PEA and NEA groups using a two-tailed independent <italic>t-</italic>test.

Given the ongoing theoretical debate on precisely what specific contexts and essential elements elicit cortisol responses, there is a need for follow-up examination of H<sub>2</sub>. For example, individual factors such as participants&#x02019; basal cortisol rhythms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adam and Gunnar, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kurina et al., 2004</xref>), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) reactivity to psychological stress (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 1999</xref>), and responsivity to and/or mobilization for change (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1996</xref>) may have influenced the cortisol results reported herein. Also, socio-environmental factors such as quality of social support and social relationships have been shown to influence cortisol activation (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Seeman and McEwen, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Smyth et al., 1998</xref>). Consistent with these findings, it is possible that PEA and NEA participants showed no significant post&#x02013;pre increase in mean cortisol levels due to receipt of (valued) social support from the executive coach in the just-concluded coaching session.</p><p>The above interpretation regarding the possible influence of social support and current mood on participants&#x02019; observed cortisol level is supported by the finding of no significant between group differences on measures of current mood (pre-coaching and post-coaching) and satisfaction with the coaching experience and relationship (immediately after the coaching session and 1 month later). These results suggest that (1) NEA participants were not more displeased with or upset by the coaching experience (i.e., digestion of 360&#x000b0; feedback results, consideration of change goals, help from the coach) than were PEA participants, and (2) NEA participants&#x02019; higher levels of negative emotions and anger can be viewed as evidence of emotional processing triggered by primary arousal of the coached person&#x02019;s NEA/Real Self/extrinsic motivation, and secondary arousal of his or her PEA/Ideal Self/intrinsic motivation.</p><p>Similarly, the present finding may suggest that the coaching engagement simply was not a stressful experience, i.e., that the negative emotion experienced during the coaching session by participants in both groups did not reach the level of threat required to trigger a physiological stress reaction (i.e., a cascade of negative neuroendocrine activation). For example, the experience of negative emotion during a particular coaching session may not be detrimental in and of itself. Negative emotions can actually assist the coachee in feedback appraisal, recognition of problems, goal setting, and other cognitive-emotional tasks during intentional change. In this study NEA participants demonstrated a significantly higher level of negative emotions and anger than did the PEA group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Secondary Measures</title><sec><title>Secondary Hypotheses on Current Mood and Satisfaction with the Coaching Experience and Relationship</title><p>Two secondary hypotheses were examined on current mood and satisfaction with the coaching session and relationship. Immediately after the coaching session and 1 month later, participants in the PEA condition were predicted (1) to show higher levels of positive mood and (2) to show higher levels of satisfaction with the coaching experience and relationship than were participants in the NEA condition. The study employed three self-report measures on current mood (transitory arousal state, goal directed thinking, optimism) and one self-report measure on coaching satisfaction. All tests were computed using &#x003b1; = 0.05. Analysis of all self-report measures yielded statistically non-significant main effects.</p><p>Non-significant results on current mood may indicate that participants were not consciously aware of small changes in momentary arousal of positive versus negative emotion during the coaching session; antecedent research has found that self-report measures and reaction tests are less effective in measuring cognitive-emotional processing than approaches that employ linguistic analysis (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pennebaker and Lay, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The non-significant result on satisfaction with the coaching session and relationship may suggest that both groups were satisfied with the coaching experience despite present findings on lower levels of negative emotion and anger in the PEA group versus NEA group. One explanation for the non-significant finding on coaching satisfaction is that study participants were mid-career professionals heading competitive dental practices. They also were first-time recipients of an executive coaching assessment. As practicing dentists and heads of group practices (31.6%) and solo practices (68.4%), participants in both conditions may have viewed the coaching session as a rare opportunity to receive executive coaching support and 360&#x000b0; feedback on their interpersonal abilities and dental team leadership skills.</p><p>In any case, non-significant findings on the self-report measures (current mood; satisfaction with the coaching experience and relationship) highlight the potential importance of the coach&#x02019;s ability to anchor a coaching session in the coached person&#x02019;s PEA, and to give secondary attention to the NEA. This ability may be critical because the coached person may or may not be aware of the restorative benefits of positive emotional processing, nor able to optimize the long term benefits of grounding in the PEA.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was the first ICT study to empirically examine the differential impact of inducing the coached person&#x02019;s vision/PEA versus improvement needs/NEA during a real-time coaching session on appraisal of 360&#x000b0; feedback results and exploration of change goals. Findings showed that participants primarily coached to vision/PEA experienced a significantly lower level of negative emotions (<italic>p</italic> = 0.048) and anger (<italic>p</italic> = 0.024) during the coaching session as compared to participants primarily coached to improvement needs/NEA. In addition, the vision/PEA group focused significantly more on leisure activity (personal interests and passions such as competitive car racing, athletics, volunteerism, travel) than did improvement needs/NEA participants (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014).</p><p>Time series analysis of the beginning (segment A), middle (segment B), and ending (segment C) sequences of the coaching sessions offered suggestive evidence that both groups experienced notable changes in positive and negative emotional processing during the coaching hour. A significant interaction effect for level of sadness or depression (<italic>p</italic> = 0.011) documented segment-to-segment change in expressed sadness; and a significant interaction effect for future documented segment-to-segment change in expressed attention to the future (<italic>p</italic> = 0.036).</p><p>Consistent with social complexity perspectives on the capacity of small occurrences to have large impacts over time (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Casti, 1994</xref>), the present findings are interpreted as preliminary evidence that framing a coaching session in the coached person&#x02019;s vision/PEA (versus Real Self/ NEA) enhances work on intentional change. Although participants in both groups appeared to benefit from the coaching experience (no significant between group differences were found on level of stress, post-coaching current mood, or post-coaching satisfaction with the coaching experience and relationship), the data suggest that the PEA group demonstrated significantly lower levels of expressed negative emotions and anger during the coaching hour as compared to the NEA group. Given the comparatively elevated levels of negative emotion and anger exhibited by the NEA group, it is reasonable to suggest that framing a coaching session in vision/the PEA may foster a higher level of positivity (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gottman, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gottman et al., 2002</xref>), leverage the broaden-and-build benefits of positive emotion/positivity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2000a</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">b, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson and Losada, 2005</xref>), and create a richer emotional space (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Losada and Heaphy, 2004</xref>) than was experienced by the NEA group. The significant between-group difference on discussion of personal interests or passions (i.e., the measure on leisure activity) lends support to this idea. Last, significant findings on segment-to-segment changes in sadness or depression and future (time series changes observed in both groups) are interpreted as suggestive evidence on recurrent mobilization of positive <italic>and</italic> negative emotion during intentional change.</p><sec><title>Implications for Research</title><p>A core aim of this study was to conduct an empirical investigation on specific ways in which the coached person&#x02019;s cognitive affective processing influences the form and flow of his or her work on desired change during real time coaching sessions &#x02014; and specific ways in which his or her coach can leverage this processing to promote sustained change. Few coaching studies have empirically tested propositions from a theoretical model on the differential influence of positive versus negative emotional processing in intentional change. Moreover, few empirical studies have explored what happens in live coaching sessions. This study contributes preliminary findings upon which to build future research on the impact of positive versus negative emotional processing in real-time coaching contexts, empirical work of potential relevance to emotion and coaching researchers alike.</p><p>Findings showed that framing a coaching session in vision/the PEA resulted in the vision/PEA group&#x02019;s comparatively lesser experience of negative emotions and increased discussion of personal interest/passions as compared to the improvement needs/NEA group. On the other hand, framing the session in improvement needs/the NEA resulted in comparatively higher experience of negative emotions and lesser focus on personal interests/passions. Even so, these findings leave open the question of whether PEA framing directly activates positive emotions, as was predicted in Hypothesis<sub>1</sub>. Based on significant main effects and significant <italic>post hoc</italic> tests, the findings are viewed as suggestive evidence that vision/PEA framing does activate positive emotions and their beneficial effects, and that replication of the present study on larger sample sizes will yield the predicted results (i.e., higher levels of positive emotion in coaching sessions framed by early vision/PEA induction).</p><p>Also meriting further investigation are current findings on the beneficial effects of recurrent PEA arousal. This study found that framing the coaching session primarily in vision/the PEA, with secondary focus on the NEA, resulted in recurrent arousal of the PEA during the coaching hour, lower levels of negative emotion/anger, and elevated expression of personal interests/passions. Conversely, participants who received coaching framed primarily in improvement needs/the NEA experienced higher levels of negative emotions/anger and lesser discussion of personal interests/passions. More study is needed to establish that recurrent PEA arousal activates positive emotions as opposed to merely decreasing the level of negative emotions, and that predominant NEA arousal does not foster sufficient PEA recurrence to optimize recovery from the harmful effects of negative emotional processing.</p><p>Present findings on time series change in expressed emotion during the beginning, middle, and ending segments of study coaching sessions offered indirect evidence on the interplay of positive and negative emotions during the coaching hour. Questions remain about precisely <italic>how</italic> primary focus on vision/the PEA and secondary focus on improvement needs/the NEA shapes this interplay and assists behavior change. Time series research on coaching is needed to further examine the relationship between positive and negative emotional interplay in real time coaching sessions &#x02013; and the optimal balance between positive versus negative emotional processing during intentional change.</p><p>Overall, for recipients of an hour-long coaching session, early vision/PEA arousal (1) fostered a significantly lower level of negative emotions and significantly greater consideration of personal passions (as compared to early improvement needs/NEA arousal); (2) led to significantly lower levels of anger during initial appraisal of feedback results (as compared to early NEA arousal); and (3) generated different patterns of time series change in emotional processing over the coaching hour (as compared to patterns generated by early NEA arousal). Taken together, these results suggest that vision/PEA arousal versus improvement needs/NEA arousal impact the coaching process in quite different ways; that the coach&#x02019;s initial framing of the session predominantly in the PEA (or, alternatively, predominantly in the NEA) fosters emotional processing that is driven by this initial framing; and that both the PEA (and associated positive emotions) and NEA (and associated negative emotions) play an important and recurrent role in shaping the change process. Further study on these outcomes will enable researchers to shed more light on the differential impact of the PEA versus NEA on intentional change, and how to leverage the benefits of both emotional attractors.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for Practice</title><p>Both researchers and practitioners have called for empirical research that can ground coaching practice in tested theory and techniques. Current findings suggest that coaches can benefit from better understanding the importance of tapping intrinsic motivation and passions through coaching to vision/the PEA. Coaches additionally would benefit from better understanding how to leverage the long-term advantages, and restorative benefits, of positive emotions during coaching engagements. The findings also highlight coaches&#x02019; need to appreciate the impact of timing effects on coaching intentional change, and how coaches can play a critical role in calibrating the pace and focus of work on intentional change. Early arousal of the coachee&#x02019;s PEA, accompanied by recurrent PEA&#x02013;NEA induction, may help coachees be/become more creative, optimistic, and resilient during a given change process. Also, primary focus on vision/PEA and secondary focus on improvement needs/NEA may better equip coaches and coaching recipients to work together on building robust learning, development, and change.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Findings are based on participants&#x02019; response to a one-time, hour-long coaching session. As first-time recipients of an executive assessment, research participants may have been unfamiliar with management coaching and may not have known precisely what to expect.
