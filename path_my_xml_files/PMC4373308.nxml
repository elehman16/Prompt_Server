Our previous work has demonstrated that if poorly controlled this can impair educational performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim:</title><p>The primary aim of this trial was to assess the impact of a primary care&#x02013;based professional training intervention on clinical outcomes in adolescents with seasonal allergic rhinitis. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cluster trial in which UK general practice staff were randomised to a short, intensive workshop on the evidence-based management of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The primary outcome measure was the change in the validated Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities (RQLQ(S)) score between baseline and 6 weeks post intervention (minimal clinically important difference=0.5). Secondary outcome measures of interest included health-care professionals&#x02019; knowledge and confidence in managing seasonal allergic rhinitis, number of seasonal allergic rhinitis-related consultations, relevant treatments prescribed and symptom scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Thirty-eight general practices were randomised (20 in the intervention arm) and 246 patients (50.2% males, mean age 15 years) were included in the primary outcome analysis. Health-care professionals&#x02019; knowledge and confidence of the clinical management of seasonal allergic rhinitis improved. This did not, however, result in clinically or statistically significant improvements in RQLQ(S): &#x02212;0.15, (95% confidence interval, &#x02212;0.5 to +0.2). There were no differences in consultation frequency, treatments issued for seasonal allergic rhinitis or symptom scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although associated with increases in professionals&#x02019; self-assessed confidence and understanding of seasonal allergic rhinitis management, this intensive training workshop did not translate into improvements in adolescents&#x02019; disease-specific quality of life or a reduction in rhinitis symptoms.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seasonal allergic rhinitis (also known as intermittent allergic rhinitis) is a very common condition in adolescence, with national<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> and international<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2 bib3 bib4">2&#x02013;4</xref></sup> studies suggesting that up to 40% of young people may be affected. It can be responsible for considerable morbidity in its own right; research focusing on children and adolescents with seasonal allergic rhinitis has identified particular problems with schoolwork,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> exam performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> as well as loss of sleep and reduced ability to concentrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> As a consequence, seasonal allergic rhinitis poses a substantial and increasing economic burden on health-care systems and the society at large.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> American estimates have, for example, suggested that health-care expenditure associated with allergic rhinitis has doubled since 2000, increasing to more than $11 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> It is now better recognised that many people with seasonal allergic rhinitis also have coexistent asthma and this, together with a greater appreciation of their shared pathophysiology, has led the World Health Organization to promote the idea of &#x02018;one airway, one disease&#x02019;&#x02014;i.e., that allergic rhinitis and asthma are different manifestations of the same disease.</p><p>Considerable time and resources are expended on educational interventions for health-care professionals, both in the United Kingdom and internationally, but despite these investments their impact on patient outcomes is still unknown. This is because such interventions are rarely evaluated beyond simple measures of satisfaction completed by the attendee, with little or no assessment of whether there is any impact on clinical practice or benefits to patients. Any intervention requiring time and/or financial commitment should be subject to the same rigorous evaluation as any other pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention, and this is particularly true in financially constrained times. More specifically, the management of people with seasonal allergic rhinitis (and allergic rhinitis more generally) has been highlighted as being suboptimal by a number of studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> with these inadequacies resulting in substantial&#x02014;potentially avoidable&#x02014;morbidity and cost. The overwhelming majority of people with seasonal allergic rhinitis are managed in the community;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> hence, this sector needs to be the focus of any attempt to improve the quality of care and outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>In an earlier multicentre randomised controlled trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> it was demonstrated that a part-time 6-month diploma-level allergy course was acceptable to attending primary health-care professionals, led to changes in relevant process measures (such as knowledge and confidence) and, importantly, translated into significant improvements in validated measures of disease-specific quality of life in adults. Although effective, many primary health-care professionals found this length of training difficult to incorporate into their practice, which raises important questions about the wider generalisability and sustainability of this approach. Following the approach advocated by the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s Framework for Complex Interventions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> we used our experiences from this earlier trial and related work on the training needs of primary care professionals in the context of managing seasonal allergic rhinitis to inform the development of the current intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> In seeking to mirror the ways in which the majority of UK health-care professionals receive their continuing professional education, we developed an intensive, evidence-based 1-day educational training intervention for primary care professionals. We then sought to evaluate the effectiveness of this training intervention for primary care&#x02013;based health-care professionals on adolescent disease-specific quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Overview of study design</title><p>We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial of an educational intervention, which involved randomising general practice staff to receive either evidence-based allergy training or to the control arm in which practices received written guidance on the evidence-based management of seasonal allergic rhinitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> We chose a cluster randomised controlled trial, as a parallel group trial design would have resulted in a high risk of contamination. In keeping with recommended practice, our trial protocol and detailed analysis plan were reported before the closure of the trial;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> any deviations from the methods described in the protocol are detailed below.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting and participants</title><p>This trial took place during the summers of 2009 and 2010 in 38 general practices within the recruitment areas of the Scottish Primary Care Research Network and England&#x02019;s Northern and Yorkshire Research Network. Scottish Primary Care Research Network and England&#x02019;s Northern and Yorkshire Research Network invited general practices to take part by email and letter. Each consenting practice was asked to nominate a member of their team to participate who had not received postgraduate allergy training in the previous 12 months. All patients aged 12&#x02013;18 years with current seasonal allergic rhinitis were eligible to participate. We defined current seasonal allergic rhinitis by the presence of a documented clinician diagnosis in the patient&#x02019;s electronic health record and any evidence of treatment(s) used for seasonal allergic rhinitis in the last 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Patients who fulfilled these criteria were invited to take part in the trial via a letter from the practice, which included a participant information sheet, consent form and reply envelope for return directly to the research team.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Practices were stratified on the basis of each of six regions: NHS Lothian; NHS South of Tyne and Wear; NHS North of Tyne; NHS County Durham; NHS North Yorkshire and York; and NHS Leeds; for regions where there were more than two clusters, a centrally administered minimisation scheme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> based on practice size and deprivation score was applied. Patients were masked to the allocation; however, it was not possible to mask the general practices as the intervention was attendance at a training workshop.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Education for Health (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.educationforhealth.org.uk/">http://www.educationforhealth.org.uk/</ext-link>) is one of UK&#x02019;s leading independent national training organisations offering accredited allergy training for professionals. We worked with Education for Health to develop an intensive 1-day evidence-based workshop, which was customised to meeting the needs of adolescents (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). The intervention consisted of an intensive study day focused on the diagnosis and management of young people with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The programme began with an assessment of the participant&#x02019;s current allergy knowledge, followed by the presentation of a case study, a discussion about the importance of getting the diagnosis of allergy correct and reasons for treatment failure. This was then followed by a brief overview of the pathophysiology of allergy in general, before moving into a more detailed discussion of this in the context of seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma. Embedded within the programme were practical sessions on nasal spray and inhaler device technique. Delegates were given a copy of the British Society of Allergy &#x00026; Clinical Immunology allergic rhinitis algorithm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and all treatment discussions were based on the World Health Organization&#x02019;s Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> and British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/101/index.html">http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/101/index.html</ext-link>) guidelines on the management of allergic rhinitis and asthma, respectively (current at the time of the study). There was ample time for individual and group discussions to ensure that individual learning styles were catered for and any queries were addressed.</p><p>Health-care professionals (1 general practitioner and 19 practice nurses) nominated by the general practices who were randomised to the intervention arm attended these 1-day intensive workshops delivered by experienced Education for Health trainers. The course was repeated on five occasions.</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>Health-care professionals (again nominated by the practices and in this case all nurses) in the control practices received an allergic rhinitis algorithm developed by the British Society of Allergy &#x00026; Clinical Immunology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> which was adapted for use in primary care by Education for Health. No training was offered to the 18 health-care professionals randomised to the control arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives and outcomes</title><p>Our primary outcome of interest was the difference in the change in adolescents Standardised Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ(S)) score between baseline and 6 weeks post intervention in the intervention arm compared with the control arm. Consenting patients completed the RQLQ(S) and a symptoms score, which was measured on a 10-point visual analogue scale. Data were collected from two cohorts of patients in two separate years: 2009 and 2010. Baseline RQLQ(S) and symptom scores were recorded in May and early June 2009/2010; patients were then seen by their health-care professional, and follow-up RQLQ(S) and symptom scores were recorded in late June and July 2009/2010 (i.e., during the peak of the grass pollen season).</p><p>Our secondary outcomes of interest were:</p><p>

This was calculated using Sampsize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> assuming an s.d. of 1.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> and intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.02. There is little evidence in the literature of the likely size of the design effect from clustering in trials of this kind, and the choice of the relatively low ICC value of 0.02 was based mainly on the finding of no evidence of clustering in our earlier adult study using RQLQ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We undertook a complete case analysis for our main analysis.

A limitation of this study may be that patients in the control arm of the cluster trial also consulted with a health-care professional, which it could be argued may not reflect routine primary care. It was necessary to design the study this way in order to understand the cause of any potential effectiveness of the educational intervention and to be able to distinguish this from any impact of simply being seen for seasonal allergic rhinitis. Control arm practices received an algorithm and information leaflet for the management of seasonal allergic rhinitis, both of which were adapted by Education for Health. One way of disentangling this issue would have been to include a third arm in which practices received no intervention; however, this was not possible within the constraints of this trial. An additional possible limitation of this study is that cluster sizes were not balanced. We used general practice list size in the minimisation scheme; we may, however, have reached a better balance in clusters if we had used number of adolescents, as this varied between clusters more than we had anticipated. The effect of this imbalance on the power of the study was small, and we still achieved the power required.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation of findings in relation to previously published work</title><p>Patients in this study had on average relatively mild impairment of quality of life measured by the RQLQ(S), which is in line with a similar study exploring the quality of life of perennial rhinitis sufferers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Patients were recruited from a primary care setting, using a clinician diagnosis of seasonal allergic rhinitis or a prescription for drugs used in nasal allergy in the last 2 years, rather than objective evidence of moderate or severe disease. As also observed in our earlier perennial rhinitis trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> the impact of this training intervention may have been more evident if we had restricted trial entry to those with more severe disease. This would, however, have reduced the generalisability of the intervention to everyday general practice.</p><p>We would have expected more consultations in the intervention group if the training had achieved a sustained change in clinical practice, but this was not the case. The training days were delivered by practising health-care professionals and based on current evidence-based guidelines for the management of seasonal allergic rhinitis developed by the British Society of Allergy &#x00026; Clinical Immunology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> The prescribing data included all repeat prescriptions; therefore, if the intervention practices followed the guidance given in the workshop, patients with persistent symptoms would be receiving an antihistamine, nasal steroid and/or topical ocular treatments, as appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for future research, policy and practice</title><p>Future trials need to build on the findings of both this and our earlier trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and find ways of equipping participants of such short courses with the skills necessary to bridge the gap between knowledge and day-to-day practice. A key consideration is not only to upskill primary care&#x02013;based health-care professionals but also to develop their ability to effect organisational change. The increasing opportunities for blended learning&#x02014;i.e., a combination of both face-to-face and virtual training&#x02014;should also provide opportunities for periodic, convenient and accessible reinforcement of key messages. Developing such initiatives and then formally trialling their effectiveness is important to help ensure that the National Health Service and other health-care systems internationally invest their limited resources in evidence-based educational interventions of proven effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this intensive seasonal allergic rhinitis training workshop for primary care health-care professionals was found acceptable and increased self-assessed confidence in attendees, but this did not translate into improvements in symptom control or quality of life of adolescents with seasonal allergic rhinitis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Scottish Primary Care Research Network and the Northern and Yorkshire Research Network for their help in recruiting general practices, the health-care professionals for attending the training and delivering the intervention, and the patients for volunteering to take part in the trial.
