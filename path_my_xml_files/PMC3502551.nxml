Specifically, high-intensity exercises both produce transient hyperammonemia and influence the distribution of white blood cells. Carbohydrates and glutamine and arginine supplementation were previously shown to effectively modulate ammonia levels during exercise. In this study, we used a short-duration, high-intensity exercise together with a low carbohydrate diet to induce a hyperammonemia state and better understand how arginine influences both ammonemia and the distribution of leukocytes in the blood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners (men, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;39) volunteered for this study. The subjects followed a low-carbohydrate diet for four days before the trials and received either arginine supplementation (100 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> of body mass&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup>) or a placebo. The intergroup statistical significance was calculated by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. The data correlations were calculated using Pearson&#x02019;s test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the control group, ammonemia increased during matches at almost twice the rate of the arginine group (25 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup> and 13 &#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). Exercise induced an increase in leukocytes of approximately 75%. An even greater difference was observed in the lymphocyte count, which increased 2.2-fold in the control group; this increase was partially prevented by arginine supplementation. The shape of the ammonemia curve suggests that arginine helps prevent increases in ammonia levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data indicate that increases in lymphocytes and ammonia are simultaneously reduced by arginine supplementation. We propose that increased serum lymphocytes could be related to changes in ammonemia and ammonia metabolism.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>White blood cells</kwd><kwd>Granulocytes</kwd><kwd>Amino acids</kwd><kwd>Immune response</kwd><kwd>Short-duration exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>We previously proposed that exercise can be used as a tool to study the interactions between metabolic stress and the immune system 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Exercise can be employed as a model of the temporary immunosuppression that occurs after severe physical stress 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Exercise impacts the immune response, and these effects depend on the intensity, duration and nature of the exercise 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Changes in the number of white blood cells (WBC) in circulation were previously described in various exercise experiments, including both high- and low-intensity exercises 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The immunological effects caused by exercise have been associated with the mechanical release of leukocytes from the vessel walls due to increased blood flow or catecholamine release, which is a mechanism that can be partially explained by cell adhesion signaling 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Hyperammonemia can be caused by urea cycle enzyme diseases, liver failure and exercise (for a recent review, see Wilkinson et al. 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). In general, ammonia (which here refers to the sum of NH<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) is highly toxic to humans, and hepatocytes maintain the blood concentration of ammonia in the 20&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M range. Ammonia can cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and reach levels greater than 800 &#x003bc;mol/L inside the central nervous system (CNS), which can lead to a decrease in cerebral function, neuropsychiatric disorders and death 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Ammonia-mediated excitotoxicity has been proposed as a mechanism for spreading damage in the CNS 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Ammonia levels change over time, and data obtained from exercises of different intensities have been used to help explain the effects of transient hyperammonemia 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A rise in ammonemia occurs after different types of exercise, and these changes can be managed by supplementation with amino acids or carbohydrates, which interfere with ammonia metabolism 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, we recently showed that a mixture of amino acids and ketoacids can interfere with the increase in ammonemia in both human and rat exercise studies 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Arginine (Arg) has a versatile metabolic role in cell function. It can be used as a precursor not only for protein synthesis but also for the synthesis of nitric oxide, urea, and other amino acids, such as glutamate 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Exercise studies show that mammals that receive Arg supplementation have greater concentrations of urea cycle intermediates in the serum, less lactatemia and better ammonia buffering than controls 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Arg supplementation has also been described as an immune system stimulator, mainly in the production of T cells 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>We used a sportomics approach to understand exercise-induced cellular and metabolic modifications in a field experiment 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Sportomics is the use of &#x0201c;-omics&#x0201d; sciences together with classical clinical laboratory analyses (e.g., enzymatic determinations, ELISA and western blotting) to understand sport-induced modifications. The suffix &#x0201c;-ome&#x0201d; means that all constituents are considered collectively; therefore, for example, proteomics is the study of all proteins, and metabolomics is the study of all metabolic processes. We treated data in a systemic way and generated a large amount of data in a type of non-target analysis using a top-down approach.</p><p>Here, we combined a high-intensity exercise with a previously described low-carbohydrate diet 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which act synergistically to increase ammonemia, to better understand the ability of arginine to modulate both ammonia and leukocyte changes in the blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>World-class Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitors (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;50 males) volunteered to take part in this double-blind, randomized study. Because they had difficulty in following the diet, 11 subjects withdrew from the study. The enrolled athletes had a minimum of three years of Jiu-Jitsu experience. Users of pharmaceutical drugs or nutritional ergogenic aids were excluded from the study. The included athletes had not sustained any injuries in the previous six months.</p><p>The subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The arginine-supplemented group (RG, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) ingested 100 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> of body mass&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup>, and the control group (PG, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) took 100 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> of body mass&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup> of lactose with supplement doses as described previously 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Each athlete received packs of indistinguishable capsules containing the daily doses and used them for four days, including the day of the experiment.</p><p>The athletes were briefed about the aim and the protocol of the study. Informed written consent was obtained from all of the subjects, and the experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines from the ethics committee for human research of the Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro and the requirements for performing research on human subjects (Health National Council, Brazil, 1996).</p></sec><sec><title>Diet</title><p>Athletes from both groups followed a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) as previously described 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. LCD adherence was verified by diet evaluation before the experiment and ketonuria. The athletes refrained from caffeine, ethanol and smoking for three days before the trials. To decrease the glycogen stores, the experiment was conducted after 12 h of fasting. The last supplement doses were given 90 min before the match.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment</title><p>The participants engaged in a six-minute Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu match in full gear. The matches were performed at similar temperatures and levels of humidity and began with the athletes kneeling to avoid injuries from falling. The subjects were instructed to maintain high mobility and avoid finishing the match. The opponent in the match was not subjected to an LCD and was exchanged for a rested opponent after 3 minutes of elapsed match time to maintain an intensity that was as high as possible in the study subjects. The matches occurred between individuals in the same weight category.</p><p>The exercise intensity was evaluated during a pilot experiment, and the athletes displayed a range from 85% to 90% of their maximum heart rate; we also observed that the match promoted a similar kinetic ammonia serum increase for all athletes (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Blood sampling</title><p>Blood samples were collected following venipuncture at rest immediately before and ~1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 min after the match. Because the fight took 6 minutes, the data in the figures are shown with times 7, 9, 11, 13 and 16 min after the beginning of the exercise. The pre-match sample was collected just before the exercise began, which occurred 90 min after the last dose of arginine or lactose, and the first post-match sample was collected immediately after the match ended (30&#x02013;60 sec). Blood was collected in tubes containing K<sub>3</sub>EDTA and refrigerated until the hematological analysis (up to 2 h).</p><p>The blood analyses were performed at least in triplicate. Red blood cells and platelets were also measured. Samples for the biochemical assay were collected in tubes with a coagulation enhancer and splitting gel (Vacuette, Greiner Bio-One) and immediately centrifuged (3,000&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g, 10 min). The blood serum was aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen for future analyses. The sera were analyzed using clinical kits for the following muscle injury markers and biochemical variables: ammonia, creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), &#x003b3;-glutamyltransferase (&#x003b3;GT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glucose, urea, creatinine, urate, total protein, albumin, bilirubin, globulins, and serum hemoglobin. No changes in plasma volume were detected during the experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Calculations and statistics</title><p>The area under the curve (AUC) for the blood ammonia data for each individual in each treatment was determined using the equation AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;{Ai(Ti&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 - Ti)&#x02009;+&#x02009;(1/2)(Ai&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 - Ai)(Ti&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 - Ti)}, where A denotes ammonia concentration (&#x003bc;mol/L) and T denotes time (min). The blood ammonia accumulation rate during the match was calculated by the difference between the ammonia concentrations before and approximately 1 minute after exercise divided by 6 minutes.</p><p>The data are shown as the mean and standard error. The data were normalized to the pre-exercise values. The intergroup statistical significance was calculated by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the intragroup significance was established by Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. The data correlations were calculated using Pearson&#x02019;s test.

The athletes of both groups had similar anthropometric values (Table 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Despite the high levels of classic muscle injury markers, such as CK (EC 2.7.3.2) and LDH (EC 1.1.1.27), the concentrations of these enzymes in the blood did not change after the match. The liver injury markers ALP (EC 3.1.3.1) and &#x003b3;GT (EC 2.3.2.2) also remained stable in both groups. The same stability was observed with the less specific markers AST (EC 2.6.1.1) and ALT (EC 2.6.1.2) (Table 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The amount of globulins in the blood increased in both groups after exercise, with an 11% increase in the RG and a 15% increase in the PG (Table

Blood ammonia is normally in the range of 20&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M, and concentrations above this range have been correlated with the incidence of encephalopathy, coma and death 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. During exercise, ammonemia can exceed 350 &#x003bc;M without obvious symptoms 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study, we used an LCD (to deplete glycogen stores) combined with a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu session using a sportomics protocol to investigate the increase in blood ammonia and changes in the white blood cell levels following exercise.</p><p>The blood ammonia increased four- to six-fold after a six-minute match and reached levels as high as 610 &#x003bc;M in one individual. These values are higher than the published averages, even if we consider other match-based studies 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], which confirms that this experimental protocol is a powerful short-term metabolic stress inducer. The velocity of the ammonia increase was partially (50%) retarded by previous Arg intake, and the total ammonia was lower in the RG. In addition, the analysis of individual ammonia clearance suggests a greater velocity in the supplemented group.</p><p>An increase in blood ammonia depends on different factors, including glycogen stores, amino acid deamination and glucose availability 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We used this knowledge as the rationale for depleting the glycogen stores using an LCD. In our study, blood glucose increased up to 30% in response to exercise and remained at this elevated level until the final measurement ten minutes after the match irrespective of Arg supplementation. This finding rules out an effect of Arg on ammonemia due to Arg supplementation-induced glucose production. The shape of the ammonemia curve suggests that Arg promotes buffering against the ammonemia increase likely by increasing ammonia clearance via the promotion of higher levels of urea cycle intermediates, as previously described 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>We performed a biochemical pre-evaluation of our subjects to assess the integrity of their liver function. The liver function of the athletes was assessed based on their hepatic metabolic function and hepatocyte integrity, which were measured by the presence of intracellular hepatocyte enzymes in blood. Neither blood urea nor urate production showed any significant differences between the groups before or after exercise. This finding is acceptable because we measured the total production of both metabolites in the blood over a short time period. The long-term supplementation of both glutamine and alanine increases the resting level of blood urea 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study, we did not find any differences in urea or urate at rest between the groups. Both groups had a similarly increased basal urea level compared with normal subjects due to the LCD. These data reinforce the possibility that Arg acts as a reservoir for increased ammonia detoxification instead of being used as a carbon skeleton donor.</p><p>Exercise has been proposed to have a biphasic effect on immune function 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], with various immune cell functions temporarily impaired following acute bouts of intense exercise 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In this study, we observed an increase in the number of leukocytes after exercise. We did not find changes in either packed cell volume, which is an internal control for volemic changes, or thrombocytes (data not shown). We did not detect a significant increase in the eosinophil or neutrophil count in response to either exercise or Arg supplementation. In contrast, we found a significant effect of supplementation on basophils and lymphocytes in response to exercise.</p><p>Distinct effects on white blood cells due to exercise have been reported in previous studies. In a study on heavy-resistance exercise, Kraemer et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] reported a decrease in eosinophils, which was contradicted by later studies that showed an increase in the total leukocyte count without differences in specific leukocyte counts 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Even with an increase in the neutrophil count of 50&#x02013;70% in some athletes, neutrophil levels did not change significantly in response to exercise in our study, which was expected based on previous reports 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Little is known about the response of granulocytes to acute exercise. However, some data have suggested that neutrophils increase following acute exercise, which is similar to the neutrophil increase caused by trauma 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and that high-intensity exercise decreases neutrophil and thrombocyte adhesion 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These findings together can help explain our results.</p><p>An increase in leukocytes after acute exercise was extensively described in a review by Gleeson 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In our study, we found a 75&#x02013;85% increase in leukocytes. This increase was mainly due to an increase in lymphocytes, which agreed with a previous report 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, we also observed protection against the leukocyte and lymphocyte increases in the RG. Carbohydrate supplementation decreases both leukocyte and lymphocyte trafficking during exercise and attenuates lymphocytosis after acute exhaustive resistance 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our data rule out a protective effect of Arg against the leukocytosis that might occur due to changes in glycemia.</p><p>A previous report by Sureda et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] showed that neutrophilia and lymphopenia occurred after exhaustive exercise with constant plasma concentrations of Arg and ornithine but decreased citrulline. Supplementation with 3 g&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup> Arg can increase the availability of Arg, ornithine and citrulline 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Because we used 100 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup> (6.5&#x02013;12.0 g&#x000b7;day<sup>-1</sup>), the supplementation used in our experiments may have resulted in an increased reservoir of these urea cycle intermediates 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>A limitation of our study is the absence of blood amino acid measurements. Indeed, in another set of data, we measured blood amino acid levels after Arg supplementation, showing that this time frame was sufficient for Arg absorption (unpublished data). In this study, we showed a high correlation between the increases in the lymphocyte count and blood ammonia, both of which were prevented by Arg supplementation. In an elegant study, Garg et al. 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] recently proposed that T cells could act in concert with glia to protect neurons. This protection occurs via the liberation of lactate and glutamate from T cells following the release of cysteine (a precursor of glutathione synthesis) by astrocytes to protect neurons and the release of lactate to feed the neurons. Previous reports have also shown metabolic protection from lymphocytes in target tissues, including the maintenance of cognition 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In addition, our data show that the increase in blood globulins is affected by Arg supplementation. Given these data, we propose that increases in serum lymphocytes could be related to changes in ammonemia and ammonia metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The modulation of arginine through supplementation in exercise is well established.
