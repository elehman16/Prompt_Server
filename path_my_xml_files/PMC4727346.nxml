In recent decades, considerable efforts have been made to support peripheral nerve regeneration but often with limited and minor success. At least one-third of patients will never regain normal sensitivity of the injured finger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Subsequently, nerve dysfunction may lead to impaired function of the whole hand. This is especially true if the thumb as well as the index and small fingers are affected. Painful neuroma formation is frequently observed after peripheral nerve injuries of the hand. Sixty percent of these patients are observed with persistent pain lasting for years in up to 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Injured nerves do not spontaneously restore their function. Continuity of the nerve has to be re-established by microsurgical intervention. Standard treatment for traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap is an end-to-end suture, whereas nerve gaps are generally treated using autologous nerve grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, functional results often are disappointing, and painful neuroma formation is frequently observed after nerve repair. Moreover, autologous nerve grafting comes along with significant donor site morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To overcome this problem, alternative treatment options such as biosynthetic nerve grafts (little bio-absorbable implantable tubes) have been developed, primarily for the repair of short gap injuries. Nerve tubes should bridge the gap in this situation, protect the nerve from scar formation, and guide the regenerating axons to the distal stump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The basic design of these nerve tubes is similar, but they are made of different absorbable biomaterials. For chitosan, a bioactive effect is reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>This study should focus on the use of nerve tubes in addition to the primary microsurgical repair of traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap. So far, evidence for this approach is lacking. However, consolidated findings regarding tension in nerve repair and reconstruction of nerve gaps using chitosan tubes, as well as the biomaterial chitosan itself, are available to support the procedure.</p><p>Above all, tension in the repaired nerve prohibits the healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The use of a nerve tube allows a tension-free suture. Possibly, that is the reason why nerve repair using a nerve tube bridging a gap of several millimeters was shown to have even better results than primary repair in injuries without nerve loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Promising clinical results have already been observed for nerve gap reconstruction using nerve tubes. The meta-analysis of Meek et al. summarizes the available literature and reports good and excellent results after 11&#x000a0;months in 75&#x000a0;% of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the authors still conclude that prospective randomized controlled trials with a systematic comparison of standard treatment and biosynthetic implants are lacking and that a systematic evaluation of only one biomaterial is required. Whether the repair of nerve lesions without a gap using a chitosan nerve tube can obtain comparable results is uncertain.</p><p>Chitosan, a derivative of chitin, is a biocompatible and biodegradable material and is similar to natural glycosaminoglycans. In vivo studies showed positive effects on the survival and orientation of the Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], as well as on the survival and differentiation of the neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the substance itself seems to prevent painful neuroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it potentially is the ideal material for nerve tube reconstruction. In this study, chitosan nerve tubes will be tested for use in treating traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap for the first time.</p><p>The assessment of sensory recovery after peripheral nerve surgery also remains challenging. Sensitivity of the hand is a complex process and can only be assessed with several tests addressing a variety of partial functions. Strictly speaking, the two-point discrimination (2-PD) is just an assessment tool for tactile gnosis. Tactile gnosis is the ability to recognize shapes and is a marker of functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An age-related decline was shown in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Based on that fact, nerve regeneration has often been postulated also to decrease with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but this has not yet been proven. More importantly, interfering variables such as the distance from the lesion to the finger pulp exist. This distance was the only interfering variable that was shown in Meeks meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, measuring the two-point discrimination provides a ratio of scaled values, making it particularly suitable for a scientific approach. The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test, in contrast, assesses the ability for the perception of cutaneous pressure and is a marker for re-innervation in a stricter sense but does result in categories and thereby in a minor level of measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study protocol is to evaluate whether the additional use of a chitosan nerve tube in the primary microsurgical repair of traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap has an effect on convalescence and functional results.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypotheses</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Alternative hypothesis (H1)</title><p>The additional use of a chitosan nerve tube in the primary microsurgical repair of traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap will be superior compared with microsurgical repair alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Null hypothesis (H0)</title><p>The additional use of a Chitosan nerve tube in the primary microsurgical repair of traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap will be equal to or inferior to microsurgical repair alone.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design of the study and setting</title><p>To answer the question of whether the additional use of a chitosan nerve tube in primary microsurgical repair of traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap will improve the recovery of sensitivity, a randomized controlled multicenter trial with parallel group design was planned to show superiority for the additional use of a nerve tube. This study will enroll participants with traumatic sensory nerve lesions from three Centers: the BG Trauma Center Ludwigshafen (Ludwigshafen, Germany), BG Trauma Center Frankfurt am Main (Frankfurt am Main, Germany), and BG Bergmannsheil Bochum (Bochum, Germany). Trauma Center Ludwigshafen will be the executive study center.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Screening</title><p>After being informed about the study and its potential risks, all individuals with traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap will be consecutively screened for eligibility until the recruitment period is over. Informed consent comprises a description of the procedures and objectives of the study and the follow-up period. Patients are informed that participation is completely voluntary and does not come with direct benefits and that denial does not come with disadvantages for the participant. The use by the trial of an already accredited and CE-certified product will be explained but in a blinded study setting. Potential adverse events regarding surgery in general and regarding the implant in particular are explained. The participants have to give their assent for blinded therapy and for the follow-ups. Participants are instructed to report any exceptional events immediately to the study center. Screening will be performed by younger physicians in the emergency ward who are not involved in randomization, surgery, or follow-up. A case report form will be prepared that will be used for the whole investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment</title><p>A two-phase recruitment will be conducted with a preoperative and intraoperative survey. After an individual has been found to be eligible by checking the preoperative inclusion and exclusion criteria, immediate operative treatment will follow. In the second phase of recruitment, the surgeon will explore the wounds and check the intraoperative inclusion and exclusion criteria. The surgeons are experienced physicians and are not involved in the screening or follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization</title><p>Finally, the enrolled participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio by alternating lists in the operating room to primary microsurgical repair with the additional use of a chitosan nerve tube or direct tension-free microsurgical repair of the nerve alone. Final enrollment and randomization following a fixed scheme will be performed by experienced surgeons who are not involved in the screening or follow-up. The CRFs will be accomplished for follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blinding</title><p>The kind of intervention is blinded for the participant and for the follow-up investigator, who was not involved in the surgery. In all study centers, medical postgraduates were employed for the follow-up examination. These raters are explicitly excluded from the screening, randomization, and operative procedure. The randomization list is kept locked in the operating room and is only available to the trial leaders and the surgeons for the process of randomization. After enrollment, only a running number on the CRFs will identify the participant&#x02019;s position in the list. The rater only has access to the CRFs and not to the randomization list. Adherence to chronological randomization by the list will be monitored by an executive study center. The operation record will only include information about participation in the trial but will not include information about dedicated group. Unblinding is only permitted after dropout or after completion of the trial and can only be performed by the trial leaders.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the study flowchart.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1148_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants</title><p>All individuals with a fresh traumatic wound of the hand and with the clinical suspicion of traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap will be consecutively screened for eligibility during the preoperative and intraoperative periods.</p><p>Preoperative inclusion criteria are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Clinical suspicion of traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap (lesion from the distal area of the carpal tunnel to the end finger joint with complete loss of a nerve-specific receptive field of the finger).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Age between 18 and 67&#x000a0;years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Trauma occurred in the previous 72&#x000a0;h.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Signed informed consent.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Preoperative exclusion criteria are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Amputated or avascular fingers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Infection of the wound.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Known pre-existing impaired sensibility of the injured finger or the opposite side.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Allergy to chitosan.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pregnancy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Known immunodeficiency.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participation in other trials.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Intraoperative inclusion criteria are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Verification of a traumatic sensory nerve lesion of the hand without a gap.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nerve can be sutured in end-to-end fashion.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Intraoperative exclusion criteria are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Avascular fingers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Multiple nerve lesions, which cannot be randomized uniformly.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nerve injuries with a gap.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary study objective is the recovery of sensitivity. The assessment will follow the guidelines developed by Ros&#x000e9;n [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Recovery of sensibility will be assessed by static two-point discrimination (tactile gnosis) and the Semmes Weinstein method (sensory re-innervation). The static two-point discrimination (2PD) after 6&#x000a0;months will be the primary outcome parameter. The 2PD does characterize the sensory capability of the injured finger and is a standard method used in the past for clinical assessment of a variety of artificial nerve tubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The distance between the lesion and the finger pulp will be attributed in the statistical analysis.</p><p>Sensory re-innervation, DASH-score, grip strength, total active range of motion, pain, cold intolerance and hypersensitivity, and the appearance of neuroma will be secondary outcome parameters.</p><p>All outcome parameters are frequently used in hand surgery research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Interventions</title><p>Surgery will be performed in plexus anesthesia or under general anesthesia, depending on the individual&#x02019;s request and anesthesiologist&#x02019;s decision, with the use of a tourniquet in a bloodless field. The wound first will be cleaned by flushing and surgical debridement and then explored via Brunner&#x02019;s incisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] using loupes. The injured nerve will be inspected and checked for intraoperative eligibility. Final enrollment and randomization is carried out intraoperatively. Further treatment depends on the dedicated group. If more than one nerve is injured, all the nerves of one individual will be treated in the same fashion. The kind of intervention is blinded for the participant.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Experimental group</title><p>Participants who are allocated to the experimental group will be treated with an additional chitosan nerve tube. The injured nerve will be exposed and neurolysed for a distance of 2&#x000a0;cm on each side of the lesion. From this point forward, a microscope will be used. The injured ends of the nerve will be sparingly freshened. The chitosan implant will be pre-soaked for 10&#x000a0;minutes in saline. Afterward, the implant (with a length of 1&#x000a0;cm and an inner diameter of 2.1&#x000a0;mm) will be imposed on the proximal nerve stump.

The questionnaire consists of 30 items regarding the requirements of daily life. Optional sport and music modules also exist that are not part of the scoring system. Individuals will assess each item using a scoring system with a range between 1 (no problem with the activity) and 5 (activity is not possible any more). Which hand is used for the activity is not relevant. The assigned values for all completed responses are simply summed and averaged, producing a score out of five. This value is then transformed to a score out of 100 by subtracting one and multiplying by 25, resulting in a DASH score range of 0 to 100. A higher score indicates greater disability.

We discovered that we could have included at least 50 individuals per year in the last 3&#x000a0;years. With respect to the unequal number of hand surgical cases in the three centers, the intention is to enroll 100 individuals per year: 50 individuals in the BG Trauma Center Ludwigshafen, 25 individuals in the BG Trauma Center Frankfurt am Main, and 25 individuals in the BG Trauma Center Bochum. The study is intended to take place over a period of 36&#x000a0;months: 12&#x000a0;months for recruitment of all individuals, 18&#x000a0;months from the beginning of the trial for completion of the primary outcome parameter, and 36&#x000a0;months from the beginning of the trial to the completion of all follow-ups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary endpoint will be tested in the per-protocol set via an analysis of covariance with center as factor and distance between lesion and finger pulp as covariate.

Alternatively, nerve gaps are increasingly reconstructed using nerve tubes to prevent donor site morbidity. A recent meta-analysis shows good and excellent clinical results for this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, prospective controlled single trials are still lacking, and hardly any systematic comparison of standard treatment and the use of nerve tubes are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The proposed study will compare standard treatment and the use of nerve tubes in a prospective controlled trial setting. Some hand surgery departments also use nerve tubes in addition to a direct nerve suture for lesions without a gap in hopes of improving the results, but such an effect has not yet been proven. Therefore, the major study objective of this trial will be to answer the question of whether the additional use of a chitosan nerve tube in primary microsurgical repair of traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand without a gap will improve the recovery of sensitivity. The results will have a direct implication on this common, but as of yet scientifically unproven, practice. A potential study limitation is an example of risk of selection bias because of the quasi-randomization method of using alternating lists. This limitation is due to the emergency surgery setting of the study. Of course, the determined power of 80&#x000a0;% power does also come along with a risk for type II errors of 20&#x000a0;%, but that is conventional for most medical trials. In addition, there is experimental evidence that the use of a chitosan nerve tube may improve functional outcome and reduce the incidence of a painful neuroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The proposed study will test the chitosan-based implant in a clinical setting. If we obtain promising results, we will expand the use of the chitosan nerve tube to use in further studies for traumatic sensory nerve lesions of the hand with a gap as an alternative to autologous nerve grafting and for traumatic nerve lesions of the forearm that include motor axons and therefore have an even more significant burden of disease.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>CONSORT statement</title><p>The authors hereby declare that final report will follow CONSORT as well as its extension to nonpharmacological interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study is currently enrolling participants.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CE</term><def><p>Mark of conformity of the European Union</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DASH</term><def><p>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DIN</term><def><p>German Institute for Standardization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EN</term><def><p>European Norm</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FESSH</term><def><p>Federation for European Societies for Surgery of the Hand</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISO</term><def><p>International Organization for Standardization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USP</term><def><p>United States Pharmacopoeia-System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>2PD</term><def><p>two-point discrimination.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>None of the authors have any financial ties to Medovent.
