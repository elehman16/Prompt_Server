Use and acceptance of integrative therapies among patients is high, especially in those with chronic conditions, and account for nearly US$34 billion in private and out-of-pocket expenses annually in the US <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. As children and their parents seek non-pharmacological approaches to managing their health, interventions perceived as being effective and safe are increasingly being sought, despite the relative paucity of high quality published medical literature supporting such therapies. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of integrative medicine programs has not been systematically studied in pediatrics. Dozens of North American pediatric hospitals have begun to offer pediatric integrative medicine (PIM) services, and are providing PIM therapies to inpatients <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. PIM may be helpful in treating highly prevalent symptoms for hospitalized children, such as pain, nausea/vomiting, and anxiety (PNVA), for which pharmacotherapy is available, but not always effective.</p><p id="p0015">Pediatric inpatients commonly experience PNVA during their stay in hospital <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Poorly managed PNVA can decrease compliance with conventional care, prolong recovery time, and increase costs to the health care system <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Pain is common in hospitalized children, and despite efforts to improve pain management, under-recognition and under treatment of pain persist <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Nausea and vomiting are also commonly experienced, and occur in up to 80% of post-operative and up to 90% of oncology patients <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Though improvements in chemotherapy and anti-emetics have been achieved, nausea and vomiting still are known predictors of increased length of stay (LOS) in hospital, and severe nausea and vomiting can lead to a postponement or discontinuation of chemotherapy <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Anxiety is not only associated with pain and nausea/vomiting, but also with hospitalization experiences and procedures. Untreated anxiety negatively affects physical and psychological health <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Pharmacotherapy to manage PNVA has varying levels of effectiveness and can be associated with adverse effects, which may be minor (e.g., sedation) or serious (e.g., respiratory depression) <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

The effects on outcomes such as patient symptoms, safety, satisfaction, length of stay and costs will be measured and we will identify which of these key outcomes are most affected, for which children, and why. Through mixed methods research (qualitative, quantitative, and health economics), we will also develop a thorough understanding of why parents choose PIM services and health care providers' experience of the PIM service. Our study is intended to provide the rigorous evidence that health care decision-makers need to determine if and when integrative medicine should be offered to children while they are in hospital, and will help address an important gap in public health policy and practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Design</title><p id="p0030">Complementary therapies are often administered as complex interventions, comprised of a number of separate elements that may interact with each other. A study design suitable for evaluating complex interventions is the pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. As such, we are conducting a 2-arm, cluster controlled, mixed methods pragmatic trial. Each consenting participating Division is assigned to receive PIM services or not in an ABA design, where A is usual care and B is usual care augmented by PIM therapies.</p><p id="p0035">Our design has been informed by two of the largest inpatient integrative medicine programs in the United States. We have chosen target symptoms and complementary therapies based on the successful and long-standing model built by our collaborator, Dr. Tim Culbert, Medical Director, PIM Service, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota. We have chosen cost-effectiveness as our primary outcome based on compelling preliminary data from the adult inpatient setting, suggesting that for every $1 spent on integrative therapies, $1.80 is saved (personal communication, Dr. Jeff Dusek, Research Director, Institute of Health and Healing, Abbott Northwestern Hospital).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Setting</title><p id="p0040">This trial is being conducted at the Stollery Children's Hospital, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We approached many clinical divisions regarding their interest and readiness to participate in our trial. We subsequently partnered with three admitting Divisions: pediatric oncology, general pediatrics and pediatric cardiology.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Participants: eligibility, screening, and enrolment</title><p id="p0045">Inclusion criteria for study enrolment are: (i) admission to a participating Division; (ii) caregiver communication in English; (iii) caregiver is available to participate; (iv) caregiver consent/child assent. Patients are eligible if they arrive in the ward as a new admission during the study, or if they are currently admitted when the study begins collecting data from their Division. Two additional inclusion criteria are applied at the time of data analysis: (v) length of stay in the participating Division is between 2 and 30 days and (vi) age on admission is less than 16 years. If, at admission, patients are expected to be discharged within 2 days or to stay longer than 30, they will not be approached by the research team.</p><p id="p0050">Length of stay is measured from admission to transfer to ICU, discharge, or death. In the event of a transfer to ICU, data collection is to be paused for that case, and resumed when the patient is transferred back to the admitting Division.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>Blinding and bias</title><p id="p0055">Due to the nature of the intervention, and ethical considerations around parental consent for PIM therapies to be delivered, it is impossible to blind participants, providers or data collection researchers to the intervention. However, we are taking extra precautions to minimize bias with the following:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1)</label><p id="p0060">Careful documentation of participant characteristics in order to control for differences between groups, including previous complementary therapy use, as well as beliefs/expectations regarding complementary therapies.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2)</label><p id="p0065">Use of an active control group with similar baseline demographics and disease states, being treated in the same Division as the intervention group.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>3)</label><p id="p0070">Use of cost-effectiveness as an outcome. A conservative assumption is that the patient and provider may be biased towards complementary therapies, leading to their increased use, symptomatic improvement, and satisfaction with care. This will be balanced by measurement of cost-effectiveness, rather than satisfaction or effectiveness alone, as increased use generates increased PIM service related costs.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0025"><label>4)</label><p id="p0075">Use of an ABA design. It is possible that the study may bias providers and patients to have a heightened awareness of patient PNVA.

Patients are eligible if they are symptomatic for PNVA or other distressing symptom; they are referred to the PIM service by the research nurse. Upon referral to the PIM service, patients is assessed by a clinical nurse who is specifically trained for this trial and who has in-depth knowledge of the complementary therapies offered (acupuncture, reiki and massage therapy). The clinical nurse will discuss these three complementary therapies and a decision will be made by consensus among the patient, the family and the research nurse, in consultation with one of our Hospital's pediatric integrative medicine specialists (SV, HJ) as needed. This decision will be based on the child's needs and preferences, and in light of best evidence and therapeutic indications/contra-indications, for one or more complementary therapies. The complementary therapy providers have been credentialed by our Children's Hospital based on their training and expertise. Dose, duration, and frequency of PIM therapies are individualized in accordance with real world practice and offered Monday to Friday, usually in the afternoons/early evening based on the availabilities of the patients, caregivers, and therapists.</p><p id="p0095">In accordance with the pragmatic nature of this trial, children will be permitted to choose more than one PIM therapy during the course of their hospital stay, although they will be encouraged to use them in sequence rather than in parallel; timing depends on the child's condition and the complementary therapy providers' clinical judgement and availability. Each patient will be followed until their symptoms resolve; re-consultation with the PIM service for a new or recurring target symptom is permissible and will be offered on an as-needed basis. If patients are transferred into the pediatric intensive care unit, the PIM service is discontinued, but may be resumed, if appropriate, once the patient is transferred back to the participating pediatric Division.

We hope to enroll 50 children in each arm (control and intervention) of pediatric oncology and cardiology, and 100 in each arm of general pediatric inpatients.</p><p id="p0155">In order to reach saturation of qualitative data, we will conduct approximately 10 one-on-one semi-structured interviews in each division with parents who choose PIM and with parents offered only usual care, for a total of approximately 60 interviews. Approximately 10 interviews will be conducted with health care providers and 10 interviews with CAM providers in the third year of the project.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.10"><label>3.10</label><title>Data management</title><p id="p0160">Raw data forms will be secured and stored in the Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WHCRI) offices at the University of Alberta. Study data are entered and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) hosted at the University of Alberta <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. These data will be accessible only to the authors listed on this protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.11"><label>3.11</label><title>Quantitative data analysis</title><p id="p0165">Since there is such variety between each admitting Division, each will be analyzed separately. The quantitative effectiveness outcomes will be pursued under an intention-to-treat and a per protocol analysis.</p><p id="p0170">Baseline data on all enrolled patients will be summarized using descriptive statistics and will be compared in three ways: those enrolled and those who refused to participate, usual care pre and post intervention (comparing the two &#x02018;A&#x02019; arms of the ABA design) and, treatment and control groups (A vs B). Feasibility will be analyzed to compare all eligible patients with those who were enrolled and those with complete measurements collected.</p><p id="p0175">Comparison tests of two independent means or proportions will be performed on the symptom scores, safety outcomes, quality of life and parental satisfaction outcomes. The comparisons will be made with independent t-tests, analysis of variance or with the non-parametric equivalents as appropriate. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis, with Fisher's exact test as necessary, or logistic regression will be performed on dichotomous outcomes, such as parental satisfaction and patient safety, allowing us to control for confounders identified <italic>a priori</italic>.</p><p id="p0180">The analysis of the cost data will be done using different regression methods estimating the difference in total costs between the two study arms. Decision analysis modeling will be used to estimate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) with 95% confidence interval, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis and treatment acceptability curve analysis will be used to support decision making.</p><p id="p0185">All descriptive and inferential statistics will be two-tailed and reported with 95% confidence intervals and p-values at &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 level of significance.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.12"><label>3.12</label><title>Qualitative data analysis</title><p id="p0190">Analysis of all one-on-one interviews will follow a constant comparison technique that will lead to theory or model development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0195">To our knowledge, this landmark study is the first comparative effectiveness trial to assess the impact of PIM as adjunctive care for pediatric inpatients. We have chosen common symptoms that negatively affect the health of the majority of pediatric inpatients. This study will help describe the complex decision-making associated with use of complementary PIM therapies and will rigourously assess the impact of hospital-based complementary treatments on patient symptoms, safety, quality of life, and parent and health care provider satisfaction. Most importantly, this study will provide valuable evidence to health care administrators and policy makers on the cost-effectiveness of providing pediatric integrative medicine services to inpatients in a North American tertiary care centre.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths</title><p id="p0200">A key strength of this study lies in the pragmatic design of the trial, which will enable us to draw conclusions while accommodating the diversity of the three Divisions studied. Because we are striving to describe the effects of complementary therapies under typical conditions, rather than ideal conditions, the pragmatic design is a suitable method that can inform decision makers on additional options for care <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Close monitoring of baseline patient characteristics as well as daily pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments allows for careful control of patient health outcome predictors, maximizing the accuracy of the treatment effect measures. Lastly, the external validity and generalizability to other children's hospitals is high. We have verified that the patient demographics, illness, types of treatment, and patient outcomes of children seen at our hospital compare to others in North America <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Furthermore, they reflect national averages for reasons for admission and length of stay when compared with Canadian Institute for Health Information database (personal communication, Donna Scheurman, Clinical Information Coordinator, Stollery Children's Hospital).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0205">Measurement bias in symptom scores may occur in our study because patients and researchers are not blinded to the intervention. This may exaggerate symptom improvements when receiving PIM therapies, and likewise underreport improvements in the control groups. Reporting cost-effectiveness as our primary outcome mitigates this bias.</p><p id="p0210">Because it is impossible to blind participants to their allocation group, there is potential for response bias in symptom scores. It is possible that if patients know there are additional therapies being offered, they may be more inclined to report more severe symptoms. Nonetheless, even if a patient's knowledge of their treatment in a pragmatic trial was a part of their therapy, this too would be the case in clinical practice <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Trial status</title><p id="p0215">Participant recruitment commenced in January 2013, and as of March 2016, was ongoing.
