Our study aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of intravenous versus caudal dexamethasone in lumbosacral spine surgeries.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this prospective double-blind study, a total of 96 patients undergoing lumbosacral spine surgery were randomized into three groups to receive 25 ml of preemptive caudal epidural injection of either injection ropivacaine 0.2% (Group A, <italic>n</italic> = 32), a 25 ml of injection ropivacaine 0.2%, and intravenous injection dexamethasone 8 mg (Group B, <italic>n</italic> = 32) or 25 ml mixture of injection ropivacaine 0.2% with injection dexamethasone 8 mg (Group C, <italic>n</italic> = 32) under general anesthesia. Visual analog scale (VAS), heart rate, blood pressures, blood sugar levels, and time to rescue analgesia were recorded at regular intervals for the first 24 h. Time to discharge was noted. Analysis of variance has been used to find the significance of study parameters between the groups of patients. Statistical software, namely, SAS 9.2 and SPSS 15.0, have been used for the analysis of the data.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean VAS was significantly lower in the Group C for up to 24 h following the caudal block.

The conventional parenteral regimen has been the mainstay of analgesic therapy in the postoperative management of spine surgeries.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Probable causes precluding the use of regional techniques could be the site of surgery, apprehension of the surgeon, and need of general anesthesia for the surgery per se.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The fact that regional analgesia causes lower pain scores, reduces narcotic requirement, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is undisputed. Postoperative pain following lumbosacral spine surgeries can be alleviated by caudal analgesia using local anesthetics; duration of analgesia can further be prolonged by adding adjuvants to local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Preventive analgesia, which encompasses multimodal preoperative and postoperative analgesic therapies, should be part of our anesthetic strategy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Evidence by a systematic review of the efficacy of epidural steroids in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgeries shows decreased pain in the short-term and shortens the length of stay with no adverse events.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long-acting glucocorticoid with little mineralocorticoid effect. Used in the perioperative setting, it may prevent PONV, improve analgesia, and decrease opioid consumption, significantly decrease the incidence and severity of sore throat and hoarseness after general anesthesia and antagonize the inflammatory reaction. A meta-analysis by Waldron <italic>et al</italic>., on perioperative single-dose intravenous dexamethasone, was associated with small but statistically significant reductions in postoperative pain, postoperative opioid consumption, need for rescue analgesia, postanesthesia care unit stays, and a longer time to first analgesic dose and no increased risk of infection or delayed wound healing.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thomas and Beevi <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a randomized double-blind study on 94 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and found that preoperative epidural administration of 5 mg of dexamethasone with or without bupivacaine reduced postoperative pain and morphine consumption.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>There is a need for studies of dexamethasone in which pain is the primary outcome as most of the evidence comes from studies without validated outcomes and that selectively report positive results. More research is required before establishing perioperative single dose of caudal steroids versus intravenous dexamethasone as an effective adjunct to surgery for reducing pain in the long term. Both caudal and systemic route have shown favorable results, though both were not compared; hence, this study aims to find the efficiency of two routes of dexamethasone administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>A randomized double-blind prospective study was conducted on 96 patients undergoing lumbosacral spine surgeries (caudal to T12 spine) aged between 18 and 70 years who belonged to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grades 1 and 2 under general anesthesia from December 2015 to May 2016.</p><p>After the Institutional Ethical Committee clearance, informed consent was taken from all the 96 patients and were randomly allocated into three groups (Group A, Group B, and Group C) of 32 each using computer-generated random numbers. Patients with diabetes, coagulopathy, peptic ulcer disease or anomalies of sacrum, and the patients on steroid medications within the past 6 months were excluded from the study. In the operation theater, all essential monitors, electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, were connected and basal parametric readings were recorded. General anesthesia was induced using standard technique using injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, injection propofol 2 mg/kg and tracheal intubation facilitated using injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, air, and isoflurane. Once the endotracheal tube was secured, the patient was turned prone on padded bolsters and the caudal block was performed by senior anesthetist using 20-gauge needle under aseptic precautions and confirmed by loss of resistance technique.</p><p>

</p><p>The demographic data including age, weight, ASA status, type and duration of surgery and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate (HR), systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure were noted at baseline, after induction, after caudal block, 15 min and 30 min intraoperatively; then HR and mean blood pressure immediate postoperatively, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h postoperatively were recorded. Intravenous paracetamol 1 g infusion was given 8<sup>th</sup> hourly for first 24 h.</p><p>Glucometric random blood sugar was recorded at baseline, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h from the caudal block.</p><p>A senior registrar in the Anesthesia Department, blinded to the study, assessed pain using visual analog scale (VAS) which was made familiar to patients preoperatively. This assessment was done immediately after surgery when the patient had completely recovered and regained consciousness from general anesthesia (0 h) and subsequently at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h thereafter. The time at which a patient first demanded supplemental analgesic medication injection tramadol 1 mg/kg was given as rescue analgesia or if VAS &#x0003e;4 and time from the caudal block was noted.</p><p>Then, total length of hospital stay was recorded. Any other adverse event was noted and was managed accordingly.</p><p>Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis has been carried out in the present study. Results on continuous measurements are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (minimum&#x02013;maximum) and results on categorical measurements are presented in number (%). The significance is assessed at 5% level of significance. Analysis of variance has been used to find the significance of study parameters between the groups of patients; Chi-square/Fisher's exact test has been used to find the significance of study parameters on a categorical scale between the groups. The statistical software, namely, SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 15.0 IBM Corp, Armonk, NY), were used for the analysis of the data, and Microsoft Word and Excel have been used to generate graphs, tables, etc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>This study was conducted on 96 patients who underwent lumbosacral spine surgeries.

VAS scores in Group C were significantly lower compared to the other two groups at 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h; however, statistical significance was noted between Group A and Group C.</p><p>Time to mobilization was not one of the end parameters recorded since the protocol of the Neurosurgical Department was to mobilize postsurgical patients at 6 h. There was no delay in the mobilization of patients of all the study groups. Time for rescue analgesia was similar in all three groups. There was no delay or difference in the time to discharge in any of the patients. Patients were followed up at 8 days when they presented for suture removal and no delayed wound healing or surgical site infection was noted. This was concurrent with the findings of Hefni AF <italic>et al</italic>. who used different doses of epidural dexamethasone for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and showed that epidural dexamethasone in a dose of 8 mg was more effective than lower doses with no side effects of dexamethasone usage such as delayed wound healing and wound infection.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Furthered strengthened by Coloma <italic>et al</italic>. who showed that a single intravenous dose dexamethasone (4 mg) reduced the time to home readiness without increasing the incidence of postoperative wound infections in a high-risk outpatient population undergoing anorectal surgery.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Patients of Group B receiving intravenous dexamethasone showed higher blood glucose levels at 24 h (149.50 &#x000b1; 32.19 mg/kg) compared to the other two groups and this was statistically significant.
