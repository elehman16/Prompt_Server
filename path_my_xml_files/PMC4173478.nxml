</p><p>Peribulbar block was performed using 26-G, 13-mm short bevelled needle; the needle was inserted through the conjunctiva as far laterally as possible in the inferotemporal quadrant. Once the needle is under the globe, it was directed along the orbital floor, passing the globe's equator to a depth controlled by observing the needle/hub junction reach the plane of the iris. 3.5 ml of &#x0201c;study drug&#x0201d; was injected slowly; in the same way other 3 ml of &#x0201c;study drug&#x0201d; was injected at 2 mm medial and inferior to supra-orbital notch.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Gentle ocular massage was applied to eyeball to promote the spread of local anesthetic and to decrease the intraocular pressure (IOP), at the same time IOP was measured using indentation tonometry at 5 min before injection and 1, 5 and 10 minutes after injection. Corneal sensation was evaluated using cotton wick at every 30 seconds till the onset of anesthesia and every 15 minutes till recovery. Ocular movement was evaluated at 2-minute interval in all four directions using 3-point scale. 0-complete akinesia, 1-limited movement, 2- normal movement.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Time for adequate conditions to start the surgery was defined as presence of corneal anesthesia together with the total ocular movement score &#x02264;1 and eyelid squeezing score of 0.

At the same time on the first postoperative day, the following variables were also recorded: Degree of pain (by using a 5-points verbal rating score: 0-no pain, 1-mild pain, 2-moderate pain, 3-severe pain, 4-unbearable pain). The pain was assessed at the end of surgery and every 60 mins up to 2 h and then at 6 h and 24 h. A tablet of paracetamol 500 mg was given if a verbal rating scale score was &#x02265;2.
