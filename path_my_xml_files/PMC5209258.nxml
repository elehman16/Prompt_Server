Complex neural regulatory feedback systems monitor available energy stores in the body in order to prompt feeding behaviors to match energy needs.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> While these homeostatic mechanisms play a critical role in maintaining energy balance, non-homeostatic (hedonic) pathways can also drive consumption of highly palatable foods.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Such foods are known to activate the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway that is responsible for detecting rewarding stimuli and motivating behaviors to repeat exposure to those stimuli.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This pathway is also involved in classical conditioning,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> i.e. a learning process where a reward-related stimulus can lead to anticipation and motivation for that reward.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Our current obesogenic environment is replete with food-related stimuli, or food cues, that may activate reward pathways and motivate overconsumption.</p><p id="P6">Food advertising is a highly pervasive source of exposure to food cues. The food industry spends $1.79 billion marketing primarily energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods to U.S. children under 11 years old,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> resulting in an average viewing of 15 TV ads per day or 5,500 over each year.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Given the high prevalence of exposure, it is important to understand whether TV food ads prompt excessive caloric consumption in children.</p><p id="P7">Randomized studies assessing whether TV food advertising affects consumption in children have had mixed results. Some have shown significantly higher consumption when children view food ads compared to non-food ads.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> For example, Harris <italic>et al.</italic> showed 118 children, ages 7&#x02013;11 years, two minutes of food or non-food ads embedded in a 14-minute cartoon and provided crackers to consume while watching the show.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Children who viewed the food ads consumed an average of 28.5 g (133 kCals) more than those shown the non-food ads, even though the crackers were not advertised during the session.

Our results suggest that the <italic>FTO</italic> obesity-risk allele may confer children with a predisposition to heightened consumption in response to food cues. Although we did not find evidence of a generalized effect of food ad exposure on overall cued eating, we did find that exposure to food ads influenced the consumption of a recently advertised food. During just 34 minutes of TV viewing, children who viewed a show with embedded food ads, including one ad for gummy candy, ate an average of 48 more kCals of gummy candy than children who viewed toy ads. Moreover, that consumption occurred immediately after children reported eating lunch to satiety, reflecting excessive intake. The implications of such findings are concerning given the frequent exposure that children have to TV food ads and that the majority of television food advertising is for energy-dense, nutrient poor foods.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p id="P30">Food cues such as those present in food advertising are thought to drive non-homeostatic pathways of food consumption via their incentive-motivational properties acquired via classical conditioning.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The nucleus accumbens, part of the dopaminergic reward pathway of the brain, is the likely functional interface between motivational food cues and consumptive behaviors,<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and functional neuroimaging studies have observed activation of the nucleus accumbens in response to food advertisements.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> In addition, studies also suggest that the neural reward response to food cues is greater for participants with <italic>FTO</italic> rs9939609 obesity risk alleles, independent of adiposity.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>
<italic>FTO</italic> rs9939609 may regulate dopamine (D2)-dependent reward learning,<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> so the increased responsiveness to food cues may be a result of heightened prior conditioning. We hypothesize that genetic differences in the neural reward response to food cues underlies our observed behavioral findings; however, further research is needed to better understand genetic differences in the effect of food cues on overconsumption.</p><p id="P31">Ten studies performed by five unique research groups have explored measured food consumption in children during or after viewing TV food ads (systematically reviewed by Boyland in 2016<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Of these studies, five reported a main effect of food ad exposure.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A series of school-based experiments in the U.K. found that children consumed more after viewing a TV program proceeded by 8&#x02013;10 food ads compared to toy ads.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> While compelling, the non-naturalistic presentation of ads in a single block before the show may have suggested the study goals to participants and thereby influenced behavior.

Only one other study provided participants with the choice between an advertised and non-advertised food; in that study, exposure to an ad for a celebrity-endorsed potato chip increased consumption of that specific chip, but did not impact consumption of chips with a generic label.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Like our study, that study also did not observe a significant difference in consumption of the non-advertised food across study condition. We do not deem our study findings a contradiction of a beyond-brand effect, but consider them evidence of a preference for consuming advertised food when provided, a behavior that was not captured in most previous studies. The specificity of our food ad effect could also relate to the particular characteristics of the gummy candy, such as macronutrient composition, that differ from those of the other provided foods (cookies, chocolate, cheese puffs). In addition, while only one ad for the gummy candy was shown, six of the 20 ads shown were for candy and those ads may have also influenced the consumption of the gummy candy. Future research is necessary to better understand the observed specificity of the advertising effect on consumption.</p><p id="P33">The implications of our findings for weight gain are unclear given that we did not find a significant difference in total caloric consumption related to ad exposure, though we did observe a positive trend for the association. Given the high inter-individual variability in total consumption, our study may have been underpowered to test the effect of food ad exposure on this outcome. Unlike four of the five studies that found a significant main effect, our study did not measure consumption in the same children under both conditions. While a within-participant design may have been more powerful, we chose not to use such a design because of our concerns that participant awareness of study goals could influence their behavior. We posited that children would be more likely to remain na&#x000ef;ve to the study goals when they were randomized to a single experiment condition. A larger study will be necessary to more definitively assess food ad exposure&#x02019;s effect on total consumption.</p><p id="P34">Our finding that parental eating restriction of child eating was positively related to total consumption recapitulate results from other groups.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> It is possible that children develop an increased preference for restricted foods.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Alternatively, parents may impose more restrictive feeding practices in response to a child&#x02019;s tendency to overeat. Longitudinal studies are necessary to clarify the directionality of this relationship.</p><p id="P35">This study has the strength of controlling for initial satiety level, thereby enabling us to measure EAH. Indeed, a surprising finding was that children consumed approximately the same number of calories during the EAH and lunch phases, suggesting the inability of children to regulate caloric intake when presented with highly palatable foods. Through this EAH paradigm, we were able to demonstrate that recent food ad exposure prompted children to consume a recently advertised food even when they were full.</p><p id="P36">Our study was limited in that it measured one instance of cued eating in a laboratory setting, and it is unknown whether children compensate for increased short-term intake by modifying long-term intake, thus mitigating any effects on excess weight gain. Also, the generalizability of our laboratory-based findings to the home environment is unknown. However, studies suggest that children frequently eat snacks while watching TV.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Furthermore, studies also suggests that TV ads prompt children to request the purchase of advertised foods,<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> which may relate to an increased availability of those foods at home. Thus, it is plausible that exposure to TV food ads among children at home may indeed relate to cued eating.</p><p id="P37">While TV is still a primary mechanism for advertising to children,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> food companies are increasingly using other marketing tactics.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> For example, advergames, internet games that promote brand recognition, have been shown to increase short-term caloric consumption in children.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> In addition, the use of celebrity endorsements<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and character tie-ins<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> is concerning and warrants further research.</p><p id="P38">Our study was also limited by its examination of a single genetic obesity risk factor, rs9939609. This polymorphism has shown one of the strongest associations with child obesity, however, so understanding potential mechanisms of its action are of both scientific and public health importance. This is also one of the first studies to examine genetic predisposition to reactivity to food cues and the first examination of this research area in children. Our study cannot rule out the possibility that unmeasured confounders, like other genetic loci related to excess consumption, were unbalanced between study arms and could have contributed to the association we report. Future, larger studies are necessary to study multiple genetic obesity risk factors related to food cue reactivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P39">In this randomized experimental trial, exposure to TV food ads was associated with increased caloric consumption of a recently advertised food in children who had already eaten a meal to satiety, and that association was modified by the <italic>FTO</italic> rs9939609 obesity-risk allele. Future research is needed to understand the neurological mechanism underlying these associations and whether other genetic risk factors also influence reactivity to food cues. Given the high exposure that children have to ads marketing unhealthy foods, the observed cued eating may have a substantial impact on children&#x02019;s dietary choices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S17"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS810264-supplement-1.docx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e674" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><p>Author Contributions: Dr. Gilbert-Diamond had full access to the data and takes full responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.</p><p><italic>Study concept and design:</italic> Gilbert-Diamond, Lansigan, Kelley, Heatherton, Sargent</p><p><italic>Acquisition of data:</italic> Gilbert-Diamond, Lansigan, Rapuano</p><p><italic>Analysis and interpretation of data:</italic> Gilbert-Diamond, Emond, Sargent</p><p><italic>Drafting of the manuscript:</italic> Gilbert-Diamond, Emond</p><p><italic>Critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</italic> All authors</p><p><italic>Statistical Analysis:</italic> Gilbert-Diamond, Emond</p><p><italic>Obtaining Funding:</italic> Gilbert-Diamond, Heatherton, Sargent</p><p><italic>Administrative, technical, or material support:</italic> Lansigan</p><p><italic>Study Supervision:</italic> Gilbert-Diamond</p><p>Funding/Support: This study was supported by grant R21HD076097 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIH) (Dr. Gilbert-Diamond); by grant R01DA022582 from the National Institute of Drug Addiction (NIH) (Heatherton); by grant R01CA077026 from the National Cancer Institute (NIH) (Sargent); by grant R01AA021347 from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIH) (Sargent); by grant NIHGMS P20GM104416 from the NIH (Dr. Karagas); by grant ES022832 from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIH) (Dr. Karagas); and by grant RD83544201 from the Environmental Protection Agency (Dr. Karagas).</p><p>Role of the Sponsor: The funding sources had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.</p><p>Additional Contributions: Participating children and their caregivers enabled this research study to happen.
