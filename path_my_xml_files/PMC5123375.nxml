The Institute of Medicine recommends limited gestational weight gain (GWG) in obese women for optimal maternal and infant outcomes. However, there is a gap regarding an effective and sustainable intervention strategy to achieve this goal. The aim of the healthy mums and babies (HUMBA) demonstration trial is to assess whether a multifaceted nutritional intervention and/or an oral probiotic treatment in obese pregnant women can reduce excessive GWG and optimise pregnancy outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The study is a two by two factorial randomised controlled demonstration trial conducted in Counties Manukau health region, New Zealand, a multi-ethnic region with a high prevalence of obesity. A total of 220 non-diabetic obese women with a singleton pregnancy will be recruited between 12<sup>0</sup> and 17<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;weeks. At recruitment, women are randomised to receive either a culturally tailored multifaceted dietary intervention or routine dietary advice, and either an oral probiotic or placebo capsule. Randomisation is undertaken via a web-based protocol, randomize.net, with a 1:1 ratio using stratification by body mass index (BMI) category (BMI of 30&#x02013;34.9 or BMI &#x02265;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The dietary intervention includes 4 customised nutrition education visits by a trained community health worker combined with motivational text messaging. Probiotic capsules consist of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis BB12</italic> at a dose of 7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units one per day until birth. Probiotic and placebo capsules are identically pre-packed and labelled by a third party, and are prescribed in a double blinded fashion. Research assessments are conducted at enrolment, 28&#x000a0;weeks, 36&#x000a0;weeks, at birth and at 5&#x000a0;months post-delivery. The primary outcomes for the study are proportion of women with excessive GWG and infant birthweight.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The HUMBA demonstration trial will assess the efficacy of a culturally tailored multifaceted dietary intervention and probiotic treatment in limiting excessive GWG and optimising birthweight in a multiethnic sample of obese pregnant women. If successful, either one or both of the interventions may be incorporated into future studies powered to investigate important pregnancy outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12615000400561.aspx">ACTRN12615000400561</ext-link>, Universal Trial Number: U1111-1155-0409.

Data from the United States suggests that without effective interventions, the rise in obesity will soon lead to reduction of life-expectancy in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. New Zealand was rated the third most obese nation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The latest New Zealand national health survey showed that about 30% of women at child-bearing age have a BMI of 30 or more, and the trend is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Of specific concern, the obesity rates are double in M&#x00101;ori and Pacific adults and children compared with those from European/other ethnic backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which highlights ethnic inequalities in the obesity epidemic in New Zealand.</p><p>Obese pregnant women have increased rates of most pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes (GDM), pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, and postpartum haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Their infants are at higher risk of congenital abnormalities, stillbirth, being born large for gestational age (LGA) and consequential traumatic birth and asphyxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They are also at increased risk of a range of neonatal complications, including respiratory problems, sepsis, seizures, hypoglycaemia and feeding difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the long-term, maternal obesity has been associated with lower offspring cognitive function and increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity and other psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, maternal obesity is associated with adverse cardiometabolic health in the offspring. Fetal exposure to excessive nutrients such as maternal hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia, can result in accelerated growth, especially of adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Larger infants with increased fat mass are more likely to become obese children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and are predisposed to high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic dysfunctions in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This creates a vicious intergenerational cycle, termed &#x0201c;developmental overnutrition&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which may have contributed to the increases in obesity and type 2 diabetes observed over the recent decades.</p><p>Based on a number of observational studies, the Institute of Medicine recommends 5&#x02013;9&#x000a0;kg of gestational weight gain (GWG), in obese women, for optimal maternal and infant outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Exceeding recommended GWG is associated with increased risk of GDM, preeclampsia, LGA, and caesarean in labour independent of maternal BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Mothers with excessive weight gain are less likely to lose weight between pregnancies, and may enter further pregnancies even more overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further, excessive GWG compounds the associations between maternal obesity and offspring metabolic dysfunction and cognitive problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, implementation of GWG guidelines in practice is challenging. Studies suggest that obese women are more likely to gain an excessive amount of weight during pregnancy than non-obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and may require more theoretically-designed interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There is also an emerging demand from prenatal care providers for effective and reproducible intervention guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Lifestyle interventions during pregnancy may limit GWG, however, limited data are available to identify the key components of intervention(s) that are responsible for the positive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A systematic review reported that amongst diet, physical activity, and mixed approach interventions, dietary interventions were associated with the largest reduction in GWG (4&#x000a0;kg on average) and also with improved pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A UK pilot trial of intensive behavioural intervention in obese pregnant women suggested that there is greater potential for change in dietary intake than in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, it has been consistently reported from several recent randomised controlled trials (RCT) that lifestyle interventions alone have a limited effect on reducing GWG in obese pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Additional interventions in combination with lifestyle interventions therefore require evaluation in clinical trials to determine whether such combinations can achieve improvements in GWG.</p><p>Mobile phone texting technologies are increasingly being used to assist with weight loss. A systematic review has shown that use of mobile phone technologies in non-pregnant populations can result in successful weight loss with increased physical activity and improved nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. There was a high level of acceptability and user satisfaction rating, with a significant number of participants stating they would recommend text messaging as a primary intervention to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A New Zealand multi-ethnic study, in an obese non-pregnant cohort, confirmed the feasibility of using mobile phone technology together with behaviour change techniques. They reported successful weight loss in participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A recent pilot study of 35 overweight and obese pregnant women reported a 2.7&#x000a0;kg mean GWG reduction with a texting intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Modification of the gut microbiome by ingestion of probiotics is a novel pathway for possible intervention to prevent metabolic disease. The microbiome influences energy extraction from food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and satiety, inflammation, and glucose and lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], with potential to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Probiotics are safe in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and provide a simple intervention in pill form. A randomised controlled trial of probiotics/placebo (<italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> at 10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units/day) and nutritional advice in pregnant women in Finland showed an over 60% reduction in GDM, with a prevalence of 13% in the probiotic/nutrition group compared with 36% in placebo/nutrition group and 34% in controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, a reduction in maternal central adiposity at 6&#x000a0;months postpartum and a 127&#x000a0;g average reduction of birthweight were demonstrated in the probiotic treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Besides the reported efficacy of these probiotic capsule in reducing GDM, daily probiotic yoghurt has been associated with a 40% reduction in preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] which is also a common complication in obese pregnant women. A RCT of probiotics/placebo aimed to prevent GDM in overweight and obese women has started in Brisbane, Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], but no studies have been reported to date, confined to obese pregnant women or in combination with intensive dietary intervention, aimed to prevent excessive GWG.</p><p>Pregnancy is described as a &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; providing a finite window during which women are more likely to undergo behavioural change if there are perceived benefits for their offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Accordingly, we are undertaking an innovative, randomised controlled demonstration trial of probiotics or placebo plus an intensive, culturally tailored multifaceted dietary intervention in obese pregnant women in South Auckland, New Zealand. We hypothesise that in obese pregnant women the interventions will reduce: 1) the incidence of excessive GWG; and/or 2) infant birthweight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and the setting</title><p>The healthy mums and babies (HUMBA) study is a single centre two by two factorial randomised controlled demonstration trial (parallel groups) designed according to CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and the SPIRIT guidelines for preparation of protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. We aim to investigate whether or not an oral probiotic capsule consisting of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis BB12</italic> at a dose of 7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units per day each, or a multifaceted dietary intervention, can reduce excessive GWG and optimise infant birthweight in obese pregnant women.</p><p>The HUMBA study is being conducted in the multi-ethic Counties Manukau Health (CMH) region, South Auckland, New Zealand, where 40% of pregnant women are obese in early pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The ethnic distribution of the birthing population (&#x0003e;7000 per annum) in CMH is 36% Pacific, 24% M&#x00101;ori, 17% Asian, and 23% European/other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. There is high socioeconomic deprivation in the region with 53% of the women who birthed in the area in 2013 categorised as being in the lowest socioeconomic quintile for New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The perinatal mortality is higher in CMH than in any other district health board in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The external review of maternity care in CMH has iterated obesity as a major risk factor for stillbirth in the Pacific community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. There is an urgent need for effective and sustainable interventions in this high-risk population to improve maternal and child health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Women with a singleton pregnancy, BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, between 12<sup>0</sup> and 17<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;weeks of gestation and able to provide informed written consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Pre-existing diabetes or HbA1c at booking&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;mmol/mol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], taking probiotic supplements, known congenital abnormality, medications or medical conditions which alter glucose metabolism, multiple pregnancy, bariatric surgery, and severe hyperemesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation is undertaken using a web-based protocol, randomize.net (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://randomize.net/">http://randomize.net</ext-link>), using random block sizes (minimum 4; maximum 8).
