International treatments vary, with prolonged hospitalizations in Europe and shorter hospitalizations in the USA.

<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Preti <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). AN is the third most common chronic disorder affecting adolescent females, with an average mortality rate of 5% (Steinhausen, <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Treatment costs are among the highest of all psychiatric disorders due to the extensive use of hospitalization (Striegel-Moore <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Agras, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Crow &#x00026; Nyman, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Although hospitalization for the management of acute medical instability (e.g. hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, electrolyte abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias) may be essential in preventing morbidity and mortality (Golden <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Katzman, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), the benefits of further hospitalization for weight normalization are unclear.</p><p>There are few studies on the role of hospitalization in AN and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different in-patient interventions. Results from uncontrolled studies in adolescents are contradictory, with some suggesting that hospitalization to near normal weight improves outcomes and decreases the need for hospitalization over the course of the illness (Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and others suggesting that hospitalization is not better than out-patient treatment (Crisp <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Gowers <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) or is associated with poorer outcomes (Gowers <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Given this lack of evidence, it is therefore not surprising that hospitalization practices vary considerably around the world, with length of stay based on local expert consensus and economic imperatives including treatment costs and insurance coverage. Reported lengths of stay in European studies are considerably longer than in the USA, particularly in adolescents. A 25-year review of eating disorder admissions in Iceland reported an average length of hospital stay of 67.3 days in AN adults and 129.7 days in AN adolescents (Sigurdardottir <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Similarly, in France, a retrospective review of a large, specialist child and adolescent eating disorder unit reported a mean length of stay of 135 days (Stirk Lievers <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), whereas in a multi-center RCT of adolescent AN treatment in the UK, the average length of hospitalization was 106.4 days (Gowers <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In the USA, where hospital admission for AN is often limited to medically unstable patients, lengths of stay tend to be brief. Thus, a review by Chu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) of admissions in medically unstable adolescents and adults in the USA reported an average length of stay of 16 days. However, as a result of shorter hospitalization, there is a growing trend for patients in the USA to move to non-hospital-based residential treatment settings where the average length of stay has been reported to be 83 days (Frisch <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Because of the high financial costs and potentially negative effects of either too much or too little hospitalization on treatment outcomes, in particular the detrimental impact of prolonged hospitalization on adolescent development, it is imperative to understand the impact of different lengths of hospitalization on outcomes in adolescent AN. In a RCT comparing in-patient and out-patient treatments for adolescent AN, Gowers <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) identified the question of optimum length of hospitalization in this group as one of the key research issues for this group of patients.</p><p>Family-based treatment (FBT) is an evidence-based out-patient treatment for adolescent AN with demonstrated efficacy in six RCTs with a 2&#x02013;5-year follow-up, in adolescents aged 12&#x02013;19 years with less than a 3-year history of AN (Russell <italic>et al.</italic>

These studies suggest that FBT is effective in both maintaining weight and improving eating disorder psychopathology following hospital discharge in weight-restored adolescents and in treating medically stable but underweight adolescents with AN as out-patients, including patients at low weights. Furthermore, FBT is reported to reduce hospital readmission rates (Wallis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lock <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of different in-patient treatments in medically unstable adolescents with AN prior to out-patient FBT by conducting an RCT comparing brief hospitalization for medical stabilization (MS) to hospitalization for weight restoration (WR) to 90% expected body weight (EBW) for gender, age and height, both followed by FBT. Our primary outcome was the number of hospital days following initial hospitalization at the 12-month follow-up. We hypothesized that those randomized to WR would require fewer total hospital days post-discharge, fewer readmissions and fewer total hospital days over the course of treatment than those randomized to MS following their initial hospitalization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Method</title><p>This two-site study [the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network, Westmead Campus (SCHN-W) and Westmead Hospital (WH)] randomized 82 participants to either hospitalization for MS or hospitalization for WR to 90% EBW (1:1), both followed by FBT. Following consent (assent for adolescents aged&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;18 years), participants were randomized in clusters of six using a block size of two. Each new cluster was randomized through a blind random binary list created by an external statistician. Although the use of clusters unblinded recruitment staff to the group status of participants, this design was chosen to prevent potential problems of drop-out if participants from different groups were treated alongside one another in hospital and became dissatisfied with their allocation. Patients and families were blind to treatment assignment prior to randomization. A clinical psychologist blind to treatment assignment conducted all baseline interviews and collected questionnaires at assessment time points.</p><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from 266 consecutive eating disorder admissions to two specialist pediatric medical units between June 2007 and February 2010.

The secondary outcome was the total number of hospital days used by the 12-month follow-up and the percentage of patients at full remission as defined by an EBW&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;95% and an Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) global score within 1 standard deviation (<sc>s.d.</sc>) of expected norms (Cooper &#x00026; Fairburn, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Cooper <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Fairburn &#x00026; Beglin, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). EBW was calculated by expressing weight as a percentage of the expected weight corresponding to the 50th percentile for gender, age and height according to the CDC growth charts (Kuczmarski <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). This weight approximates the set point for return of menstruation in most females and is the weight where reversal in bone loss and growth resumption is likely to occur (Golden <italic>et al.</italic>

The EDE is a structured and validated clinical interview assessing eating-related psychopathology and behaviors and is the standard outcome measure used in clinical trials of AN.

The two treatment centers have more than 30 years&#x02019; experience in managing adolescents with AN. Treatment is aimed at medically stabilizing patients and establishing safe eating. Both services are jointly led by an adolescent medicine physician and a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Patients are managed on a specialist program using a lenient behavioral approach. Patients admitted to the program attend a hospital-based school, a daily adolescent group program and a second daily physiotherapy program. Adolescent group activities include art and creative pursuits, psycho-education and psychological skills development. Patients are medically and psychiatrically reviewed on a daily basis with supportive psychotherapy provided by either a child and adolescent psychiatrist or a psychologist three times a week. All families were seen by a multi-disciplinary team for a comprehensive assessment during the admission and weekly family meetings were held with a focus on clinical update, psycho-education, nutritional education by an eating disorder dietician and preparation of families for out-patient FBT.</p><p>All patients were re-fed using a standardized protocol commencing with 24&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h of continuous nasogastric feeds (ceased with daytime medical stability) followed by a combination of nocturnal nasogastric feeds and supported meals aiming for a total caloric intake of between 2400 and 3000 kcal/day. The amount and duration of nasogastric feeding was determined by markers of medical instability for a minimum of 14 days. Total caloric intake was based on a rate of weight gain of 1&#x000a0;kg/week (Kohn <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Participants in the MS arm were subsequently discharged to out-patient FBT if they had no markers of medical instability for 72&#x000a0;h after nasogastric feeds were ceased. Participants in the WR arm continued in hospital on supported meals without nasogastric feeding once they had no markers of medical instability for 72&#x000a0;h, until they reached 90% EBW before discharge to out-patient FBT. Nasogastric feeding has been used routinely in medically unstable adolescents in pediatric treatment centers in Sydney, Australia and has been shown to be well tolerated by patients and their families, medically safe and lead to consistent early weight gain and MS (Halse <italic>et al.</italic>

In phase 2, parents transition eating and weight control to the adolescent in an age-appropriate fashion. Phase 3 focuses on adolescent developmental issues. Treatment began within a week of hospital discharge and involved 20 sessions lasting 1&#x000a0;h each spread over a maximum of 12 months. The FBT protocol was considered complete if the family attended 20 sessions or if the goals of treatment were met prior to this, with treatment ended by mutual consent of the therapist, parents, medical team and investigators. If criteria for recovery were not met at session 20, families were offered further treatment, including FBT, and individual treatment for AN and co-morbid psychiatric conditions if appropriate.</p><p>FBT therapists were three psychologists and a social worker trained in the FBT model. The therapists attended a 2-day workshop, then spent 4 weeks administering FBT with an experienced therapist and had to meet clearly defined competencies (Rhodes <italic>et al.</italic>

Weekly individual and group supervision was provided by two experienced FBT therapists (A.W. and P.R.) with over 5 years of experience in FBT. Where consent was provided (89% of families), treatment sessions were recorded on digital video and a random sample of 5% of these sessions were assessed for treatment fidelity by one of the authors of the FBT manual (D.L.G.).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Participant safety and re-hospitalization criteria</title><p>Participants in out-patient treatment were medically assessed on a weekly basis and if medically unstable (Katzman, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) or at acute psychiatric risk, were readmitted to hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Sample size and power</title><p><italic>A priori</italic> power analysis estimated that a total of 36 patients per group completing the trial would provide 80% power to detect a group difference of 0.75&#x000a0;s<sc>.d.</sc> in the primary outcome (number of hospital days after initial discharge) (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05, two-tailed).

In addition, we examined clinical outcome (full remission) using multivariate logistic regression. Full remission status at session 20, 6- and 12-month follow-ups was used as the multivariate binary outcome without imposing any longitudinal trend (time line varied considerably across treatment groups and across individuals). For partial remission the same approach was used. A linear regression analysis was used to compare weight change (%EBW) between groups at the end of hospitalization. A multivariate regression analysis was used to compare weight change between groups at session 20, 6- and 12-month follow-ups as the multivariate outcome. The same method was used to compare groups on the EDE global score at the three time points.</p><p>Potential moderators and mediators of treatment effects on full remission were examined by incorporating the MacArthur framework for moderator/mediator analysis (Kraemer <italic>et al.</italic>

Ten baseline variables were examined as potential intervention effect moderators: Site, %EBW, the ChOCI-R Obsession subscale, ChOCI-R Obsession Severity subscale, ChOCI-R Compulsion subscale, ChOCI-R Compulsion Severity subscale, RCADS Depression subscale, RCADS Anxiety subscale, RSES, and the EDE global scale). As these analyses were conducted as exploratory without particular <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses, we used a nominal significance level (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05) and did not adjust for multiple candidate moderators. The baseline EDE global score was dichotomized at the median to depict the differential effect of treatment depending on the level of EDE global. The baseline ChOCI-R subscale score was dichotomized at the median to depict the differential effect of treatment depending on the level of compulsiveness. Both findings in moderator effects are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab03">Table 3</xref>. For the mediator analysis, we examined one hypothesized mediator. In addition, the change in %EBW from baseline to end of hospitalization was examined as a potential intervention effect mediator.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Ethical standards</title><p>All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.

There were no statistically significant differences for moderating effects of symptoms of depression, anxiety or self-esteem on full remission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study found that a longer initial hospitalization aimed at WR did not reduce the need for hospitalization, following the initial admission, over the course of care when adolescents with AN of less than 3 years duration were treated with FBT following hospitalization. The average number of hospital days used up to 12-month follow-up, following the initial admission, was 28 days in the WR condition and 23 days in the MS condition, with similar rates of readmission. As a result of the longer initial admission in the WR condition, the average number of hospital days used per participant at the 12-month follow-up was 65 days, 20 days more on average than those randomized to the MS condition. This difference in mean hospital days per participant was statistically significant, with a moderate effect size favoring the MS group.</p><p>As allowed in the protocol, additional FBT sessions were offered to families who had completed 20 sessions of manualized FBT without achieving remission from AN. Of note, participants in the WR group used more post-protocol sessions of FBT than those in the MS group. Why this difference emerges in unclear because those discharged at higher weights would be expected to need fewer sessions to achieve recovery. However, it is possible that parents whose children were discharged at higher weights did not perceive a need to act as definitively and expeditiously as those whose children were still underweight. Appropriate parental anxiety and concern is suggested as a key aspect of treatment engagement in the FBT manual (Lock &#x00026; Le Grange, <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This area deserves greater investigation as these findings may assist in the optimization of FBT and additional cost savings to treatment. As there were no other differences in outcomes at follow-up, these results provide evidence that a brief initial hospitalization aimed at medical stabilization is effective when using FBT after discharge.</p><p>The difference in total hospitalization day use between the study arms has significant implications for the cost of treatment in AN. As out-patient care costs approximately 10% of the cost of in-patient care (Katzman <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), it is reasonable to use the difference in days of hospitalization as a proxy for the difference in costs for the treatment. In Australia, the daily State Price for the in-patient treatment of AN in adolescents is US$1252 (IHPA, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), representing an additional cost of US$25&#x000a0;000 for the WR group. Although variable, costs for pediatric eating disorder patients are considerably higher in the USA, with daily in-patient treatment costs between US$3590 (University Hospitals, <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and US$3979 for a non-monitored pediatric bed (Nationwide Children's, <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This would represent an additional cost of US$72&#x000a0;000 to US$80&#x000a0;000 per patient for the WR group within the first year of treatment. There are other potential negatives of prolonged admission, including reduced contact with family, friends, peers and educational facilities, with disruption of educational attainment, socialization and identity development (Meads <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>Although not different between groups, our rates of full remission at the end of FBT, 6- and 12-month follow-ups were lower than in the one trial (Lock <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) that used the same definition (EBW&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;95% and EDE within 1&#x000a0;s<sc>.d.</sc> of norm), which reported 12-month rates of full remission for FBT of 49.3% compared with 31.25% in the current trial. Rates of partial recovery (EBW&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;85%) were similar (87.5% in the current trial <italic>versus</italic> 77.7% in Lock <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In the other RCT of FBT to use a combination of weight and EDE scores (EBW&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;95% and a global EDE score of within 2&#x000a0;s<sc>.d.</sc> of norm), a full remission rate of 67% was reported (Eisler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Using these criteria, 73.2% of participants in this trial would meet full remission criteria.</p><p>Using the standard of Lock <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), these poorer rates of full remission may be a result of higher levels of symptom severity in the current sample at randomization. Unlike other RCTs using FBT, all participants in this study were medically unstable on admission, an exclusion criterion in out-patient RCTs of FBT. Additionally, EDE scores were higher than those reported in the other similar trials (Eisler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). These indicators of greater severity of illness in this study sample strengthen our findings, as this is the group most likely to require hospitalization during the course of illness.</p><p>There were no moderators or mediators of treatment effect identified for the use of hospitalization in the study. However, those with higher EDE global scores and higher reports of compulsive behaviors did better in the MS group. Although speculative, this moderator effect might be explained if longer hospitalization exacerbates and magnifies the rigidity and inflexibility common in AN (Le Grange <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">2012<italic>b</italic></xref>), as patients accommodate to in-patient routines.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the use of a randomized design, validated assessment and outcome measures, standardized and manualized treatment protocols, blinded assessments and multiple assessment points for follow-up. Additionally, treatment retention and outcome assessment rates were good.</p><p>There are limitations to this study that may affect the generalizability of the findings. The study was not designed as an equivalence trial and was only powered to detect a large difference between groups. It was conducted within an academic medical center that supported efficient referral to collocated FBT services, with FBT providers trained and supervised by experienced practitioners, a level of care that is not universally available. FBT is an empirically supported treatment and although other out-patient therapies might be useful, the relationship between other out-patient treatments and hospitalization was not examined.</p><p>The findings of this study are important for several reasons. This is the first study to apply a randomized protocol to different hospital interventions for adolescent AN. The results support shorter hospitalization for MS when out-patient FBT is available (Lock <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Controversy about the role of in-patient WR in the treatment of AN is long-standing (Silber <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Crisp <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Golden <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Gowers <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and although the current study cannot answer all questions, it provides important data suggesting that prolonged in-patient WR is not systematically beneficial in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-effectiveness for medically unstable adolescents with AN of less than 3 years&#x02019; duration who are receiving out-patient FBT. Although there is a clear need for medical hospitalization to treat medical instability in AN (Gowers <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), prolonged hospitalization is not only expensive but also seems to offer no treatment advantages when effective out-patient treatment is available. Previous studies suggest that psychiatric hospitalization in itself is not more effective than out-patient treatment for adolescent AN (Gowers <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), but none of these studies included medically unstable patients for whom hospitalization is considered essential. The current study describes an approach for the safe and efficient use of hospitalization for potentially life-threatening medical complications arising from extreme weight loss that could be implemented in treatment programs using FBT. Implementing treatment programs that integrate in-patient MS with out-patient FBT for adolescent AN of less than 3 years&#x02019; duration is likely to lead to more cost-effective care.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the family therapy team of SCHN-W involved in this study for provision of outstanding service (C.
