electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback signal in female non-athletes. [Subjects and Methods]
A prospective, non-randomized study of 90 adult females (age &#x02265;18&#x02005;years) divided into three
groups: Intervention (I), which began physical exercise upon study enrollment; Moderate
Exercise (ME), comprising those who already engaged in physical activity; and Sedentary
(S), comprising those who had a sedentary lifestyle. All participants underwent EMG
biofeedback of the pelvic floor muscles upon study enrollment (T1) and at the end of the
third subsequent month (T2). [Results] Mean age was 35.7 (SD: 7.5) years, with no
significant difference between groups. T1 values in groups I and S were significantly
lower than in group ME. There was no statistically significant difference between groups S
and I. On comparison between groups at T2, values were highest in group I (18.5 &#x000b5;V vs.
15.3 &#x000b5;V in group S, vs. 16.1 &#x000b5;V in group ME). There was no significant difference between
groups S and ME. On age-adjusted analysis, group I exhibited the greatest change between
T1 and T2 (I, 4.7 &#x000b5;V; ME, 2.1 &#x000b5;V; S, 1.5 &#x000b5;V). [Conclusion] Females who exercise exhibit
better pelvic floor muscle function than those who do not engage in physical activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pelvic floor</kwd><kwd>Biofeedback</kwd><kwd>Physical exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) provide primary support for the pelvic organs, stabilize
the sacro-iliac joint, and contribute directly to continence, micturition, and defecation
mechanisms<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Changes in PFM function and morphology can trigger signs and symptoms of pelvic floor
dysfunction, such as urinary incontinence (UI), fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse,
and pain during sexual intercourse<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Multiple risk factors for pelvic floor dysfunction have been identified, including
pregnancy, type and mode of delivery, aging, pelvic and gynecological surgery, menopause,
and obesity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent decades, several
investigators have documented the role of high-impact exercise and prolonged, high-intensity
training as an etiological or aggravating factor for pelvic floor dysfunction in female
athletes<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sudden foot-ground contact is an inherent mechanism of several sports. The force resulting
from this impact is transmitted to the pelvic floor. When such contact occurs repeatedly, it
may damage the pelvic floor structures and tissues and lead to anatomic or functional
impairments, such as UI and genitourinary prolapse<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other mechanisms that explain the high prevalence of signs and
symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction in female athletes are related to the chronic nature of
the load borne by muscles in this region, to the marked increase in abdominal pressure, and
to prolonged recruitment of this muscle group<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Contradicting the aforementioned findings, some authors use an event known as
co-contraction to support the hypothesis that athletes cannot experience weakness of the
PFMs due to excess training. Co-contraction refers to a coactivation of the PFMs
concomitantly with increasing abdominal pressure or when muscles agonistic and synergistic
to the PFMs are activated. Therefore, athletes would not have a higher prevalence of UI or
pelvic organ prolapse compared to the non-athlete population, because their pelvic floors
would be stronger and more resistant as a result of this constant recruitment<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have assessed the occurrence of UI in female athletes. However, information on
the effects of moderate physical exercise on the PFMs in non-athletes is lacking. Also, the
behavior of these muscle groups in non-athlete women who engage in moderate physical
activity is still unknown.</p><p>The present study was therefore designed to assess the impact of moderate physical exercise
on the PFMs in female non-athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, non-randomized study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of
Universidade de Bras&#x000ed;lia School of Medicine and was conducted in accordance with the
provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Participation was voluntary, and written informed
consent was obtained from all participants prior to their inclusion in the study.</p><p>Ninety women aged 18&#x02005;years or older were enrolled and allocated to three groups (n=30
each): Intervention (I): consisted of women who had been physically inactive for 6 months or
longer before study enrollment. The participants were invited to start a program of physical
exercise at a health club or gym at the time of study enrollment and asked to remain in the
program for at least 3 months after study enrollment; Moderate Exercise (ME): consisted of
women already engaged in physical exercise at a gym or health club for at least 6 months
before study enrollment who agreed to continue exercising for at least 3 months
subsequently; and Sedentary (S): consisted of women who had been physically inactive for at
least 6 months before study enrollment and agreed to remain sedentary throughout the study
period.</p><p>Pregnant women, women with a history of central or peripheral neurologic injury, and those
who had undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy for pelvic neoplasms were excluded.
Participants in groups I and ME who interrupted training for 3 consecutive weeks or longer
and who had an attendance rate of fewer than two times a week for 3 or more weeks in a month
were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Physical exercise was defined any planned, structured physical activity, moderate to
vigorous in intensity, performed with the purpose of improving or maintaining physical
fitness or achieving aesthetic modifications<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two broad exercise modalities were
considered for this study: aerobic exercise and strength training. None of the gyms or
health clubs where participants exercised provided Pilates or stretching classes. The
participants were not specifically instructed to perform any pelvic floor exercises during
the study period. All participants&#x02019; trainers were qualified physical educators and
instructed them to exercise to a heart rate consistent with moderate-intensity exercise
(70&#x02013;80% of maximum heart rate).</p><p>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-Short Form was used to assess the
level of physical activity and to objectively characterize participants as sedentary<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The questionnaire was administered at the
time of study enrollment and at the end of the study period. For the present study,
participants were considered sedentary if they engaged in (<italic>a</italic>) physical
activity with a frequency and duration less than 30 minutes of vigorous physical activity,
three times a week, (<italic>b</italic>) less than 30 minutes of walking or moderate
physical activity, five times a week, or (<italic>c</italic>) any activity requiring
moderate physical exertion, five times a week.</p><p>All participants completed an interview based on standardized questionnaires and forms
designed to collect the following data: demographic characteristics; obstetric history;
prior gynecological surgery (hysterectomy and perineoplasty); lifestyle factors; and
genitourinary, anorectal, and sexual signs and symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction, such as
urinary or fecal incontinence, disordered or difficult defecation, symptoms of genitourinary
prolapse (sensation of &#x0201c;heaviness&#x0201d; in the vagina or &#x0201c;sitting on a ball&#x0201d;) and sexual
complaints (dyspareunia and vaginismus).</p><p>PFM activity was then measured by electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback in all participants
to quantify the pelvic floor contraction capacity. Assessments were performed at two time
points: T1, upon study inclusion; and T2, at the end of the 3rd month following the first
measurement.</p><p>Biofeedback was performed using a two-channel Miotool Uro USB<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system, with a
sampling frequency of 1,000&#x02005;Hz, gain accuracy of 25%, input impedance of 1,010 &#x003a9;, analog
band-pass filter (20&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz), gain set to 500, and Biotrainer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software (Porto
Alegre, RS, Brazil). Gel-free, rectangular (2 &#x000d7; 4 cm), silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl)
cardiac monitoring electrodes with clear plastic backing were used (3M<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Red Dot&#x02122;
2239T, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil). Measurements were performed with the participant in the
supine position, with knees flexed and legs supported by a foam wedge, so as to keep the hip
joint at 45&#x000b0; and the feet off the bed, thus preventing use of accessory muscles. To capture
the EMG biofeedback signal, electrodes were placed on the skin surrounding the anal margin,
at the 4 o&#x02019;clock and 10 o&#x02019;clock positions. The reference (ground) electrode was placed on
the right knee.</p><p>Then, two printouts of schematic diagrams of the female genitalia were used for a brief
explanation about surface anatomy, which was provided alongside verbal and visual
instructions about the region participants should contract. To check for proper performance,
at the end of the instructions, the investigator elicited a muscle contraction by issuing a
verbal command asking the participant to squeeze her anus and vagina closed.</p><p>For each measurement, three contractions, each lasting 2 seconds and followed by a 5-second
rest, were elicited. The peak muscle contraction value measured by the biofeedback system
for each event (peak contraction) was recorded. Then, the arithmetic mean of these three
measurements was calculated. Finally, T1 and T2 measurements were compared to each other and
between groups.</p><p>EMG measurements of PFM activity assessed by biofeedback upon study inclusion (T1) and at
the end of the 3rd month following the first measurement (T2) were the primary outcomes of
this study. Secondary outcomes were clinical variables collected from an interview based on
standardized questionnaires and forms, including prior gynecological surgery, lifestyle
factors, and genitourinary, anorectal, and sexual signs and symptoms of pelvic floor
dysfunction, disordered or difficult defecation, symptoms of genitourinary prolapsed, and
sexual complaints.</p><p>Groups were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for quantitative variables with a
Gaussian distribution and by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normally
distributed variables. For qualitative variables, comparisons between groups were performed
using the chi-square test. Mean muscle activity values at T2 were compared within groups
using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)&#x02014;the ANCOVA model was constructed with the T2
measurements as the dependent variable, group as the independent variable, and the T1
measurements and age as covariates. Bonferroni correction was applied to the p-values of
comparisons between group means. Student&#x02019;s t-test for paired samples was used for
within-group comparison of means. A multiple linear regression model was used to evaluate
the effect of the following variables: age; body mass index (BMI); number of vaginal and
cesarean deliveries; and history of surgical procedures on EMG biofeedback gain. Statistical
analysis was performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The
significance level was set at p&#x0003c;0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean (SD) age of participants was 35.7 (9.75) years (group I, 34.70&#x02005;years, SD 10.07;

electromyographic measurements of PFM activity in female non-athletes. The objective
assessment of the effects of moderate aerobic exercise and strength training on the PFMs of
non-athlete women represents a novel contribution of this study to the literature. Our
findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that moderate exercise improves PFM
performance.</p><p>The EMG biofeedback measurements obtained during baseline assessment were higher among
women who already engaged in physical exercise (group ME) than in the women who were
initially sedentary (groups I and S). This finding alone already suggests that physical
activity may contribute to improved perineal function in women. Also, mean EMG biofeedback
measurements of pelvic floor activity were significantly higher in T2 than in T1 in all
three groups. Group I, which consisted of initially sedentary women who then began a
physical exercise program, achieved the greatest gain in relation to the other groups. This
can be attributed to the role of exercise as an agent of functional change.</p><p>In a study using subjective measurements, Stach-Lempinen et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> evaluated 82 sedentary and active women with UI. For their
assessment, the authors used the Oxford scale, a subjective measure of perineal contraction
as assessed by digital vaginal examination, and found an association between the level of
physical activity and pelvic muscle contraction; 43.5% of active women achieved good
contraction vs. only 27% of less-active women.</p><p>The hypothesis that physical exercise may improve PFM function is supported by the work of
other authors, including B&#x000f8; et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and
Tajiri<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, who found that,
simultaneously with increased intra-abdominal pressure during physical exercise, a reflex
contraction of the PFMs occurs, which ultimately leads to improved conditioning of this
muscle group. According to Ree et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>,
physical exercise can increase PFM volume, giving these muscles the ability to contract
during increases in intra-abdominal pressure and, consequently, to contribute actively to
continence mechanisms.</p><p>In the present study, improvement in mean EMG biofeedback measurements of pelvic floor
activity were found in all three groups, with the greatest change observed in group I. The
ME group also exhibited greater change in relation to group S. Therefore, both physical
exercise groups achieved greater gains than the sedentary group. Considering that the number
of motor units that are activated as well as the firing frequency of these units increase
with rising force, thus influencing EMG biofeedback signal, and that the electrical activity
of a muscle directly reflects its ability to contract, which is a marker of muscle function,
the findings of our study provide evidence to validate the role of physical exercise in
improving PFM function.</p><p>The change observed in women in group S may be explained by the interactive nature of
biofeedback. Placing electrodes in the perineal region and providing verbal explanations and
commands to elicit PFM contractions can improve perception, which may contribute to better
performance of the requested contractions. However, it should be noted that group S achieved
the least gain in muscle activity.</p><p>The fact that the greatest gain was achieved among initially sedentary women who began an
exercise program (group I), and not in women who already exercised (group ME), is explained
by one of the core tenets of exercise physiology&#x02014;namely, that gains are greatest in the
early stages of training. The functional significance of the morphological changes undergone
by a muscle that is frequently recruited is believed to translate essentially into increased
strength and capacity for power generation. Rapid gains in strength are commonly observed in
the early stages of muscle training, particularly in previously untrained individuals. These
gains may be attributed to improvement in motor unit recruitment as a result of increased
neurological activity<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in
sedentary individuals starting physical activity, strength is gained faster in the early
stages of training. As with other muscle groups, this also happens with the pelvic floor in
sedentary women who begin an exercise program. The PFMs are activated by the co-contraction
mechanism<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Through training, individuals who engage in regular physical
activity acquire the ability to activate and contract a greater number of motor units
simultaneously, both in the main muscle involved in the desired movement and in the agonist
and synergist muscles. Essentially, muscle coordination is improved. Unlike untrained
individuals, who are only able to mobilize a given percentage of their muscle fibers at a
time, trained individuals can contract a markedly greater number of muscle fibers
synchronously and simultaneously; thus, overall muscle strength is much greater than in
sedentary individuals<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to Danforth et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>,
advancing age is a determinant of the natural senescence of muscle fibers, with consequent
hypotrophy or fatty replacement. In the pelvic floor, this can contribute to weakening and
loss of contraction capacity, with consequent impairment of continence mechanisms. As
advancing age can interfere with the rate of muscle response (strength gains and/or
hypertrophy), we adjusted our analysis of the difference between baseline and final EMG
activity levels (T2&#x02013;T1) for age. Furthermore, much has been discussed in the literature
about the impact of route of delivery and parity on the pelvic floor structures. In our
sample, neither of these factors differed significantly between the groups. On multivariate
analysis, neither factor was an independent variable, i.e., neither was associated with
gains.</p><p>We believe that the present study has great relevance, as knowledge of the workings of the
pelvic floor is of paramount importance to clinical practice. Although this is an
increasingly popular research subject, few studies have reported objective assessments of
pelvic floor function in non-athlete women who engage in moderate physical exercise or
strength training. Future studies may exclude confounding factors and limitations of the
present investigation, such as the proprioception of the pelvic floor inherent in
physical-therapeutic evaluation and the therapeutic effects of biofeedback, to further
elucidate this relationship.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the comparative, prospective design, with control for
possible confounding variables such as age, overweight and obesity, pregnancy and parity,
and history of pelvic and perineal surgery. A clear definition of moderate physical activity
was used, engagement was controlled, and effects were measured objectively. Limitations are
mainly due to the small sample size and to the use of a single assessment parameter. We
suggest that future studies enroll larger samples and distinguish between types of physical
activity. Inclusion of other objective methods for the assessment of changes associated with
physical exercise would also be helpful.</p><p>The results of this study support the hypothesis that women who engage in moderate physical
exercise exhibit better PFM function than sedentary women. This provides further evidence
that encouraging the practice of physical activity is essential for population health. In
addition to its wide range of well-known benefits, exercise can improve pelvic floor
function.</p><sec><title>Financial disclosure</title><p>The authors have no financial relationships relevant to this article to disclose.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Haylen</surname><given-names>BT</given-names></name><name><surname>de Ridder</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>An International Urogynecological Association
