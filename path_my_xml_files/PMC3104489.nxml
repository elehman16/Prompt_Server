There is unequivocal evidence that mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients has the potential to aggravate or even initiate lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Patients with acute lung injury (ALI) could benefit from measures that prevent repeated collapse and re-expansion of alveoli, including the so-called open lung mechanical ventilation strategy with the use of higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Meta-analysis suggest this approach can waive the need for rescue therapies due to life-threatening hypoxemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and even reduce mortality in patients with more severe ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Mechanical ventilation is frequently mandatory in patients who undergo surgery. The effects of short-term intra-operative mechanical ventilation on pulmonary integrity are less well defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, it is uncertain whether ventilation strategies that use higher levels of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers during the intra-operative period are beneficial in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, higher levels of PEEP could reduce intra-operative atelectasis, decreasing repetitive collapse and re-expansion of dependent lung parts, and thereby attenuating pulmonary inflammation and coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Use of recruitment maneuvers to open the lungs has been found to improve the effectiveness of PEEP with regard to gas exchange during general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Intra-operative use of PEEP does not represent a common practice. Indeed, an observational study conducted in 28 centers in France revealed that most patients undergoing general surgery were ventilated without PEEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the intra-operative use of PEEP cannot be seen as clinical standard.</p><p>Post-operative pulmonary complications, in particular after general anesthesia &#x0003e;2 hours for abdominal surgery, add to the morbidity and mortality of surgical patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We hypothesize that a lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy with higher levels of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers attenuates post-operative pulmonary complications in patients without lung injury (i.e., patients who do not fulfill the criteria for ALI at the moment of surgery).</p><p>PROVHILO aims at comparing the effects of such protective strategy and conventional mechanical ventilation in biomarkers of lung injury, post-operative pulmonary complications, extra-pulmonary complications and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing general anesthesia for open abdominal surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Objectives and design</title><p>The PROtective Ventilation using HIgh versus LOw positive end-expiratory pressure ("PROVHILO") trial is a worldwide investigator-initiated multicenter randomized controlled two-arm trial.</p><p>The Institutional Review Board of the Academic Medical Center - University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, approved the trial.

Demographic data on screened patients regardless of meeting enrolment criteria are recorded (registry: age, gender, type of surgery). A total of 900 patients are randomized to the 2 different mechanical ventilation strategies. In the participating centers at least 2 investigators are involved with the study. One researcher is involved with mechanical ventilation practice in the operation room, he/she will be blinded for the randomized intervention most closely to the time of tracheal intubation (depending on local situation) - the second investigator, blinded for randomization arm, will score the primary and secondary post-operative endpoints.</p><p>Patients with high or intermediate risk for post-operative pulmonary complications following non-laparoscopic abdominal surgery with general anesthesia are eligible for participation. To identify such patients the ARISCAT risk score (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This predictive risk index is developed by the ARISCAT Group to assess the individual pre-operative risk for post-operative pulmonary complications.

The PEEP level in the protective strategy is chosen to be 12 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, to achieve maximal interventional effect without causing harm to participating patients and to make the intervention acceptable for the participating clinicians. The conventional strategy is chosen based on a national survey in France that showed &#x0003e;90% of responding anesthetists to use levels of PEEP of 0 - 4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O without recruitment maneuvers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Since not all available anesthesia ventilators can apply levels of PEEP &#x0003c;2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, the level of PEEP is set at a maximum of 2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O with the conventional strategy. However the lowest possible level of PEEP is always chosen.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanical ventilation</title><p>Patients are ventilated with a volume-controlled mechanical ventilation strategy. Although it is left to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist to use different fractions of inspired oxygen, it is advised to use at least 0.4, with the lowest oxygen fraction to maintain oxygen saturation &#x02265; 92%. The inspiratory to expiratory time ratio (I:E) is set at 1:2, and the respiratory rate is adjusted to reach normocapnia (end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure between 35 and 45 mmHg). Tidal volumes of &#x0003c;8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) are advised to be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PBW is calculated according to a predefined formula: 50 + 0.91 &#x000d7; (centimeters of height - 152.4) for males and 45.5 + 0.91 &#x000d7; (centimeters of height - 152.4) for females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

A chest X-ray will be taken on the first post-operative day, blood samples for laboratory tests (glycemia, uremia, creatinine, AST, ALT, bilirubin, Hb, WBC count, platelet count, PT, PTT) will be taken on day 1, 3 and 5 and blood samples for biomarkers are collected directly after surgery and on day 5. As mentioned above, one local investigator, blinded for randomization group will score the primary and secondary post-operative endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Study endpoints</title><p>Primary endpoint - is a composed endpoint of all post-operative pulmonary complications with each complication weighing equally; it is presented as a total percentage of post-operative pulmonary complications. The post-operative complications are defined as: (a) mild respiratory failure (PaO<sub>2 </sub>&#x0003c;60 mmHg or SpO<sub>2 </sub>&#x0003c;90% in room air <italic>but responding </italic>to supplemental oxygen, (b) severe respiratory failure (need for non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation <italic>or </italic>a PaO<sub>2 </sub>&#x0003c;60 mmHg <italic>or </italic>SpO<sub>2 </sub>&#x0003c;90% <italic>despite </italic>supplemental oxygen), (c) development of ALI/ARDS (according to consensus guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]), (d) suspected pulmonary infection (patient receives antibiotics and meets at least one of the following criteria: new or changed sputum, new or changed lung opacities on chest X-ray when clinically indicated, tympanic temperature &#x0003e;38.3&#x000b0;C, WBC count &#x0003e;12,000/&#x003bc;l in the absence of other infectious focus), (e) pulmonary infiltrate (chest X-ray demonstrating unilateral or bilateral infiltrates), (f) pleural effusion (chest X-ray demonstrating blunting of the costophrenic angle, loss of the sharp silhouette of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm in upright position, evidence of displacement of adjacent anatomical structures or (in supine position) a hazy opacity in one hemi-thorax with preserved vascular shadows), (g) atelectasis (suggested by lung opacification with shift of the mediastinum, hilum, or hemidiaphragm towards the affected area, and compensatory overinflation in the adjacent non-atelectatic lung), (h) pneumothorax (air in the pleural space with no vascular bed surrounding the visceral pleura), (i) bronchospasm (newly detected expiratory wheezing treated with bronchodilators), (j) aspiration pneumonitis (respiratory failure after the inhalation of regurgitated gastric contents), (k) cardiopulmonary edema (clinical signs of congestion, including dyspnea, edema, rales and jugular venous distention, with the chest X-ray demonstrating increase in vascular markings and diffuse alveolar interstitial infiltrates).</p><p>Secondary clinical endpoints - include (a) intra-operative ventilation strategy related complications (e.g. de-saturation, hypotension during recruitment maneuver, need for vasoactive medication), (b) unexpected need for ICU admission or ICU readmission, (c) hospital-free days at follow-up day 90, (d) post-operative wound healing and (e) post-operative extra-pulmonary complications. Extra-pulmonary complications include SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock (all according to consensus criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]), extra-pulmonary infection (wound infection or any other infection), coma (Glasgow Coma Score &#x0003c;8 in the absence of therapeutic coma or sedation), acute myocardial infarction (according to universal definition of myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]), acute renal failure (according to the RIFLE classification system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]), disseminated intravascular coagulation (according to ISTH diagnostic scoring system for DIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]), gastro-intestinal failure (defined as; gastro-intestinal bleeding or gastro-intestinal failure according to GIF-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]) and hepatic failure (defined as; serum bilirubin level &#x0003e;2 mg/dL with elevation of the transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase levels above twice normal values).</p><p>Other study parameters - Blood samples will be collected and analyzed for systemic markers of lung injury (including but not limited to soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (sRAGE), Clara Cell protein-16 (CC-16), surfactant proteins A and D and levels of proinflammatory and procoagulant/antifibrinolytic mediators (including but not limited to interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), protein C, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1). The abovementioned biomarkers of lung injury, acute inflammation and coagulopathy have been shown to correlate with poor clinical outcome in patients with ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Notably, with short-term mechanical ventilation rises in systemic levels of lung injury biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], acute inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and procoagulant/antifibrinolytic mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have been described. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategies attenuated the rise in levels of some of the abovementioned mediators in patients with ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], as well as patients who underwent short-term mechanical ventilation because of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Most of these trials compared the effect of different tidal volumes.</p><p>The injury induced by mechanical ventilation originates in the lung, but may also affect distal organs by release of mediators from the lung into the systemic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore systemic biomarkers of distant organ injury, in particular the kidney, are determined (including, but not limited to neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>Sample size calculation - the required sample size is calculated from an estimated effect size derived from data collected in the ARISCAT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and previous studies on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A two group &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference (in post-operative pulmonary complications) between conventional mechanical ventilation (24%) and open lung mechanical ventilation (16.5%) (Odds ratio of 0.626) when the sample size in each group is 450.</p><p>Interim analysis - one main concern is not to withhold positive effects of the open lung mechanical ventilation strategy to the control group. Therefore, interim analyses are performed after 300 and 600 patients. The first interim analysis is performed when 300 patients have successfully been included and followed-up. If the intervention has a strong trend for improving post-operative pulmonary complications (as defined above) with a <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.0005 is found at 300 patients or &#x0003c;0.014 at 600 patients, termination of the study is considered. The third and final analysis is performed at 900 patients with a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.045 for significance. When post-operative pulmonary complications occur significantly more frequent in the intervention group, terminating the study due to harm will be considered when <italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.022 for each interim analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Normally distributed variables will be expressed by their mean and standard deviation; not normally distributed variables will be expressed by their medians and interquartile ranges; categorical variables will be expressed as n (%). In test groups of continuous normally distributed variables, Student's <italic>t-</italic>test will be used. Likewise if continuous data are not normally distributed the Mann-Whitney <italic>U </italic>test will be used. Categorical variables will be compared with the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact tests or when appropriate as relative risks. Where appropriate statistical uncertainty will be expressed by 95% confidence levels.</p><p>Primary outcome is the total occurrence of pulmonary complications within the first 5 post-operative days, presented as a percentage. The percentage will be analyzed as continuous data. If the data is normally distributed, Student's <italic>t-</italic>test will be used or when not normally distributed the Mann-Whitney <italic>U </italic>test will be used.</p><p>As this is a randomized controlled trial, we expect that randomization in this large study population will sufficiently balance the baseline characteristics. Baseline balance is tested and imbalance compensated in all pre-operative variables and on ARISCAT scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (as mentioned above). However if imbalance occurs, the confounding factor will be corrected using a multiple logistic regression model. For this we will treat the proportion as a binary response (complications occur during day one to day five post-operative).</p><p>Time to event variables (primary and secondary outcomes) are analyzed using a proportional hazard model adjusted for possible imbalances of patients' baseline characteristics. Time course variables (e.g. repeated measures of vital parameters, blood values, VAS-scores, actual mobility) are analyzed by a linear mixed model. The linear mixed models procedure expands the GLM so that the data are permitted to exhibit correlated and non-constant variability. The model includes two factors: 1) study group (fixed factor, intervention or control group), each level of the study group factor can have a different linear effect on the value of the dependent variable; 2) time as a covariate, time is considered to be a random sample from a larger population of values, the effect is not limited to the chosen times.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study Organization</title><p>The Executive Committee is constituted of the study principal investigator and the principal investigators of the investigating centers that approved the final trial design and protocol issued to the clinical sites and to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).</p><p>The independent DSMB watches over the ethics of conducting the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, monitors patient safety and reviews safety issues as the study progresses. All serious adverse events, and all unexpected and related or possibly-related adverse events will be reported blinded to the appointed international SAE-manager, who assesses the events and reports this information to the DSMB within 24 hours of that event in the case of a serious adverse event or within one week in the case of an adverse event.</p><p>The Steering Committee is composed of the principal investigators of the principle participating centers who contribute to the design and revisions of the study protocol.</p><p>The National Coordinators are responsible for administrative management and communication with the local principle investigator and provide assistance to the participating clinical sites in trial management, record keeping and data management.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It has become clear that mechanical ventilation can attenuate lung damage and may even be the primary factor in lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. ALI/ARDS is characterized by heterogeneous distribution of pulmonary aeration. During ventilation the aerated part of the lung receives the largest part of the tidal volume, potentially causing overdistention with excessive alveolar wall tension and stress. The non-aerated atelectatic lung regions are prone to repeated collapse and re-expansion of alveoli, causing shear stress and diffuse mechanical damage of the alveoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This could trigger local and systemic inflammation, which has been suggested to cause ventilator-associated lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Protective mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes could reduce ventilator-associated lung injury. Indeed, the use of lower tidal volumes has been found beneficial in patients who needed long-term mechanical ventilation for ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Two retrospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and one randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] suggest lower tidal volumes to be beneficial in patients without acute lung injury in long-term ventilation as well. Other trials suggest that ventilation with lower tidal volumes is also beneficial in short-term ventilation for patients without preexisting lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In these trials different levels of PEEP were used, making comparison and interpretation of the additional effect of PEEP difficult.</p><p>During general anesthesia reductions in end-expiratory lung volume and increases in airway closure is commonly seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Both contribute to atelectasis formation. The most important morbid post-operative pulmonary complication is atelectasis formation, which increases the risk for pneumonia and hypoxic acute respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Post-operative pulmonary complications, in particular post-operative respiratory failure, add to the morbidity and mortality of surgical patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. PEEP prevents alveolar collapse and atelectasis formation. Recruitment maneuvers can be used to achieve initial alveolar recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Data suggests that recruitment maneuvers adequately support the beneficial effects of PEEP in short-term ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, PEEP levels should not be too high, to avoid overdistention of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Various studies showed mechanical ventilation according to an open lung concept to improve ventilatory efficacy of the lungs in patients with healthy lungs undergoing general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Studies have shown the open lung concept to attenuate inflammatory responses and to prevent loss of functional residual capacity in cardiac surgery patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Of note, there is some controversy about the clinical importance of the cyclic collapse of alveoli. Indeed, the potential of ventilation strategies with lower tidal volumes and PEEP for protecting the lungs during the intra-operative period in patients without previous lung injury has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The PROVHILO trial is the first randomized controlled study powered to investigate whether protective mechanical ventilation using higher levels of PEEP complemented by recruitment maneuvers attenuates post-operative pulmonary complications. The two ventilation strategies used in the PROVHILO trial are composed to match as many clinically applied anesthesia ventilators as possible. With these standardized ventilation strategies, we aim to minimize variation between ventilation strategies used in the participating centers.</p><p>The primary endpoint of this trial is a composed endpoint (post-operative pulmonary complications). This could be seen as a shortcoming, since the effect of the intervention on one post-operative pulmonary complication could be diluted if other post-operative pulmonary complications are not affected, or affected to a lesser content. However, since we collect and report on all post-operative pulmonary complications, it may still be possible to determine the effects on separate complications.</p><p>The main concern in the statistical interim analysis is not to withhold positive effects of the treatment to the control group. However, to achieve maximal protection for patients and to have a lower chance of achieving positive effects of the intervention on post-operative pulmonary complications if they were not really present, different stopping rules are defined for a strong beneficial effect on post-operative pulmonary complications of the intervention versus a worse effect on post-operative pulmonary complications.</p><p>The spectrum of ventilator-associated lung injury does not only include pulmonary inflammation, but also an increase in systemic inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The lung has been suggested as an important causative part of the inflammation-induced systemic disease state that can evolve to multi-organ failure, rather than merely a pulmonary disease process. Alveolar collapse during mechanical ventilation can lead to activation of inflammatory response both locally and systemically, which can play a role in modulating the individual patient's outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. To determine this possible effect on patients in this trial, secondary endpoints on extra-pulmonary complications are collected and reported, as well as blood samples for the determination of specific markers of distal organ injury.</p><p>Several confounding factors can be suggested. Post-operative pain is a commonly acknowledged contributor to post-operative atelectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Respiratory chest physiotherapy has been shown to decrease postoperative respiratory complications in cardiac surgery, when performed before surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It is still uncertain if post-operative physiotherapeutic procedures are beneficial, although there is some evidence in favor of physiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Excessive intra-operative fluid administration is another possible contributing factor to the development of respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These factors are not protocolized by the PROVHILO trial. The protocol stresses that general anesthesia, post-operative pain management, physiotherapeutic procedures, fluid management and all other peri-operative procedures are to be performed according to the centers' specific expertise and routine clinical use. We aim to minimize interference with the effect of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers on post-operative pulmonary complications. Suggestions on the abovementioned peri-operative procedures are made in the protocol, to keep the variability as small as possible. No suggestions are made on type of anesthesia to use, to make the trial as accessible as possible for anesthesiologists. It is known, however, that several anesthetic drugs affect lung capacity during surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Since we collect and report on all commonly known risk factors for post-operative pulmonary complications and intra-operative administered drugs, it may still be possible to determine the effect on the primary and secondary outcomes.</p><p>In conclusion, the PROVHILO trial is a worldwide investigator-initiated randomized controlled trial powered to test the hypothesis that an open lung mechanical ventilation strategy using higher levels of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers during short-term intra-operative mechanical ventilation prevents against post-operative pulmonary complications. The PROVHILO trial also determines the effect of an open lung approach on post-operative extra-pulmonary complications. Finally, in the PROVHILO trial the effect of lung-protective mechanical ventilation is monitored by highly specific biomarkers of lung injury.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AE: Adverse Event; ALI: Acute Lung Injury; AR: Adverse Reaction; ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; EU: European Union; ICU: Intensive Care Unit; I:E: Inspiratory to Expiratory ratio; PBW: Predicted Body Weight; PEEP: Positive end-expiratory pressure; PPC: Post-operative pulmonary complications; RM: Recruitment maneuver; SpO2: Oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse-oximetry breathing air in supine position; VALI: Ventilator-associated lung injury; WBC: White Blood Cells</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SH: preparation of the initial drafts of the manuscript and preparation of the final version.
