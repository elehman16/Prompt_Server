NAEDI aims to promote early diagnosis of cancer with a view to improving the UK's relatively poor survival rates.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It comprises four work-streams, one of which (research, evaluation and monitoring) has been instrumental in the development of a measure of cancer awareness.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The Cancer Research UK Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM) was developed to provide a standardised and valid measure of public awareness of cancer, either in whole populations or specific subgroups. It is hypothesised that low levels of cancer awareness in the UK population may be partly responsible for delayed presentation with symptoms, leading to later-stage diagnoses. The CAM was developed to enable researchers and campaigning groups to systematically assess this possibility and to measure the impact of their awareness-raising activities.</p><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Key messgae points</title></caption><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x025b6;</label><p>This study demonstrates the psychometric properties of the ovarian and cervical Cancer Awareness Measures (CAMs).</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b6;</label><p>The ovarian and cervical CAMs demonstrated good reliability and validity in a series of development studies.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b6;</label><p>The ovarian and cervical CAMs can be used to assess population levels of awareness, monitor changes in awareness over time and evaluate awareness-raising interventions.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><p>In addition to the generic CAM, there is a need for site-specific versions, particularly for cancers where poor knowledge of risk factors and early warning signs may be associated with delayed presentation and thus have an impact on survival. The aim of the present research was to develop and validate two versions of the CAM that were specific to ovarian and cervical cancer.</p><p>Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women in the UK with around 6800 new cases each year. Survival rates have increased since the 1970s, with the latest figures showing 5-year survival at 40%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Thanks to a successful screening programme, cervical cancer is less common. Around 2800 new cases are diagnosed in the UK each year and 940 women die of the disease, but as with ovarian cancer, survival rates are considerably poorer than in other European countries.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Thomson and Forman's review of EUROCARE (European Cancer Registry-based study on survival and care of cancer patients) data<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> concluded that the survival gap for both ovarian and cervical cancers could be reduced by improvements in early diagnosis.</p><p>Survival rates for both cancers vary by stage at diagnosis with better prognosis among women diagnosed with early-stage disease.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Most cervical cancer deaths (80%) occur in women aged over 45 years and the majority of these deaths are among women who have not attended screening. Attending for screening, and (for young girls) receiving the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, are the most effective ways to prevent cervical cancer. However, if cancer does develop, early detection promotes better survival. Several early warning signs for cervical cancer have been identified, including bleeding between menstrual periods, after sex, or after the menopause, and pain during sex.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Knowledge of these warning signs could improve women's ability to identify the significance of symptoms and may encourage prompt help-seeking.</p><p>There is currently no available screening programme for ovarian cancer and only a fifth of ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an early stage in the UK.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Contrary to previous thinking, recent evidence indicates that there are detectable warning signs and symptoms, which are included in the ovarian cancer &#x02018;Key Messages&#x02019; published by the Department of Health in 2009.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A similar consensus statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was produced in the USA in 2007.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Public awareness of these warning signs, alongside confidence to present at primary care, could reduce patient-attributable delay and ensure earlier stage at diagnosis.</p><p>Smoking and being overweight are potentially modifiable risk factors for cervical and ovarian cancers, respectively. Raising awareness of these risk factors would be a step towards promoting behaviour change and risk reduction.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Other risk factors are not amenable to change (e.g. family history of breast or ovarian cancer as a risk factor for ovarian cancer, or having a weakened immune system for cervical cancer), but public awareness could facilitate appropriate personal risk perceptions and prompt help-seeking.</p><p>The aim of this study was to develop and validate comprehensive measures of ovarian and cervical cancer awareness that would be suitable for identifying gaps in public awareness, monitoring the impact of awareness-raising initiatives, and identifying population subgroups that might benefit from targeted information about these cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4"><title>Generation of items</title><p>The ovarian CAM and the cervical CAM follow the format of the generic CAM.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Awareness of warning signs and risk factors is assessed first with an open-ended question and then with a prompted checklist. The list includes all the established warning signs and risk factors, without any distracter items. We identified risk factors and warning signs for ovarian and cervical cancer using the scientific literature as well as cancer information materials and websites. In addition, the Department of Health's &#x02018;Key Messages&#x02019; on ovarian and cervical cancer were used to identify the accepted warning signs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Anticipated time to seeking help for a possible warning sign is assessed on a scale from &#x02018;1&#x02013;3 days&#x02019; to &#x02018;never&#x02019;. Perceived lifetime risk of cancer is assessed in the generic CAM by asking how many people out of 100 will develop cancer at some point in their lives. Because the lifetime risk of cervical cancer is less than 1 per 100 women this item was adapted for the cervical CAM so that risk was estimated per 1000 women.</p><p>Knowledge of the cancer screening programmes is measured in the generic CAM. The cervical CAM assessed awareness of the NHS cervical screening and HPV vaccination programmes and the age of invitation for each. The ovarian CAM used questions from the generic CAM assessing knowledge of all three NHS cancer screening programmes and also asked participants whether there is an ovarian cancer screening programme.</p><p>The cervical and ovarian CAMs included an item on awareness of the peak age of incidence of each cancer (now part of the generic CAM) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tinyurl.com/CAMdownloads">http://tinyurl.com/CAMdownloads</ext-link>), and the cervical CAM asked about women's confidence about noticing a cervical cancer symptom.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Expert review</title><p>First drafts of the ovarian and cervical CAMs were circulated to a panel of experts (<italic>n</italic>=5 and 7, respectively), including academic researchers and clinical specialists, to ensure content validity. The panels were asked to comment on the content and comprehensiveness of the questionnaire as well as item terminology and wording. A number of minor changes were made to the draft questionnaires following this review. The majority of comments on the ovarian CAM related to the risk factor section. There was discussion of what the most relevant items were and the state of the current evidence. Specifically, the wording and items that were modified related to going through the menopause, a diagnosis of endometriosis or ovarian cysts, and being childless. There was discussion about the inclusion of &#x02018;using talcum powder in the genital area&#x02019; as it was felt that this would not apply to many women. However, because the aim was to maintain a comprehensive list of risk factors, this item was retained because it has been widely publicised as a risk factor and the evidence has not yet ruled it out. However, future users of the ovarian CAM may wish to omit this item if more conclusive evidence becomes available.</p><p>In the cervical CAM, &#x02018;infection with herpes&#x02019; was removed from the risk factor checklist as experts commented that the evidence for this as a risk factor was inconclusive and &#x02018;taking the contraceptive pill&#x02019; was changed to &#x02018;long-term use of the contraceptive pill&#x02019;. The item &#x02018;not having regular baths or showers&#x02019; was removed because experts thought that it was a myth and &#x02018;having a poor diet&#x02019; was removed as likely to be a marker of socioeconomic status. The experts also changed the warning sign &#x02018;vaginal discharge&#x02019; to &#x02018;persistent vaginal discharge&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Validating the ovarian and cervical CAMs</title><p>The psychometric properties of the measures were assessed in terms of internal reliability, test-retest reliability, item analyses, construct validity and sensitivity to changes in levels of awareness. Parametric statistics (e.g. Pearson's correlation, <italic>t</italic>-tests) were used to analyse reliability and validity. The open-ended warning sign and risk factor questions were not suitable for use in the reliability and test-retest analyses. However these questions were used in the analyses for construct validity (experts vs control) and sensitivity to change. Data were analysed using SPSS 18.0&#x000ae; (IBM SPSS, Amronk, NY, USA).</p><p>The versions of the ovarian and cervical CAMs used in the validation process are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. They consisted of 11 items on awareness of warning signs for the ovarian CAM and 12 items for the cervical CAM, 11 on anticipated time to seek medical advice in the ovarian CAM and one in the cervical CAM [NB. The ovarian CAM asked about anticipated delay for each symptom as well as a generic item, whereas the cervical CAM used only the generic item &#x0201c;If you had a symptom that you thought might be a sign of cervical cancer how soon would you contact your doctor to make an appointment to discuss it?&#x0201d;], 13 items on risk factors for ovarian cancer and 12 items on risk factors for cervical cancer, one item on age of peak ovarian/cervical cancer incidence, eight items on awareness of NHS screening programmes in the ovarian CAM, and four items on the NHS cervical screening and vaccination programmes in the cervical CAM. The cervical CAM also included an item on confidence in detecting a cervical cancer symptom. The module on &#x02018;barriers to seeking medical advice&#x02019;, already developed for the generic CAM, was included and can be used as an optional scale in the ovarian and cervical CAMs but is not included in the validation analyses (10 items).

Participants took part in telephone interviews for the ovarian CAM and an online version of the cervical CAM. The expert groups were compared with a control group who had equivalent educational qualifications from Sample 2 using the &#x02018;known-groups&#x02019; method to establish construct validity.

While the true answer could be considered to be 70 years, messaging from ovarian cancer charities often focuses on women who are 50 years and older, so both responses were considered valid in this instance.

measures of awareness of ovarian and cervical cancer. Reliability of both measures was good, with Cronbach's &#x003b1; of &#x0003e;0.8 and good test-retest reliability for most sections. The only item that performed poorly across the validation studies was the lifetime risk question. Cervical cancer risk was greatly overestimated by both lay and expert groups, with only 21% of experts answering it correctly. It had poor test-retest reliability in the cervical CAM and showed poor sensitivity to change in the ovarian CAM. The item was removed from both measures.</p><p>In the ovarian CAM, awareness of screening programmes did not reach the conventional test-retest reliability threshold, but this was not due to major change between the two administrations, but a change from &#x02018;no&#x02019; to &#x02018;don&#x02019;t know' or vice versa. In fact, none of the participants responded &#x02018;yes&#x02019; at either time point and therefore this result is relatively unimportant in terms of questionnaire consistency. It does indicate that most women are aware that no ovarian screening programme exists. Responses to the risk factor items also showed only moderate reliability, which may have been a learning effect between the two administrations, because overall risk factor scores were higher in the second round. However, there was still a relatively high correlation, and it is likely that with a longer interval between administrations any learning effect would be diminished if there was not an additional systematic intervention to support it. Future intervention studies using the ovarian and cervical CAMs may wish to explore this further.</p><p>Construct validity was established: people with expertise in ovarian/cervical cancer achieved higher scores than an equally-educated control group. This was reinforced by the results from the intervention studies, which showed that both measures were sensitive to increases in awareness following a brief educational intervention.</p><p>There were some limitations to this study. The mode of administration varied across stages of piloting, and included face-to-face, telephone, computer-based and paper-and-pencil versions, although all were done under controlled conditions. The exception was the expert panel in the cervical CAM who completed an online version in non-controlled conditions, but it was designed so that participants could not return to previous answers. Experts were also reminded that they should not consult colleagues or search the Internet if they did not know the answer. In addition, the non-expert study participants were better educated than the population as a whole, which limits generalisation to other populations. Future users of the cervical CAM should also be aware of items that are answered correctly by a particularly high or low proportion of respondents. At present, we recommend retaining these items because omitting well-known risk factors would compromise the face and content validity of the measure, and it is important to examine change in the lesser-known items.</p><p>Testing of both the ovarian and cervical CAMs was thorough in terms of the types and variety of reliability and validity studies carried out, but further testing in community samples will also be needed to demonstrate utility. Finally, since the development of the ovarian CAM, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has published draft clinical guidelines for the recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These state that clinicians should &#x0201c;consider carrying out tests in primary care if a woman reports having abnormal vaginal bleeding&#x0201d; (page 39). Abnormal vaginal bleeding was not included as a warning sign in the ovarian CAM because item choice was driven primarily by the Department of Health's &#x02018;Key Messages&#x02019; which, at the time of development, did not include this symptom. However recent evidence has demonstrated that abnormal vaginal bleeding, particularly postmenopausal bleeding, has positive predictive value in relation to ovarian as well as endometrial cancer.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore future users of the ovarian CAM may wish to consider inclusion of the &#x02018;bleeding after the menopause&#x02019; item as used in the cervical CAM. Future users may also wish to add an item measuring confidence in detecting an ovarian cancer symptom which, although not part of the original generic CAM, has been validated in several of the site-specific versions, including the cervical CAM, and has now been included in the generic CAM too (readers are referred to the cervical CAM for the wording of this item).</p><p>The ovarian and cervical CAMs are reliable and valid measures of awareness of risk factors and early symptoms of these two cancers. Further tests using community samples are required, but these results indicate that they could be useful tools to provide a comprehensive assessment of ovarian and cervical cancer awareness or to assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to target gaps in awareness of these cancers either in whole populations or specific subgroups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The Ovarian CAM was developed with funding from Ovarian Cancer Action, The Eve Appeal, Ovacome and Target Ovarian Cancer.
