To support the program we investigated safety, efficacy and cost of Durable Wall Lining to control sand fly.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This multicentre randomized controlled study in Bangladesh, India and Nepal included randomized two intervention clusters and one control cluster. Each cluster had 50 households except full wall surface coverage (DWL-FWSC) cluster in Nepal which had 46 households. Ten of 50 households were randomly selected for entomological activities &#x0feff;except India where it was 6 households. Interventions were DWL-FWSC and reduced wall surface coverage (DWL-RWSC) with DWL which covers 1.8&#x000a0;m and 1.5&#x000a0;m height from floor respectively. Efficacy was measured by reduction in sand fly density by intervention and sand fly mortality assessment by the WHO cone bioassay test at 1&#x000a0;month after intervention. Trained field research assistants interviewed household heads for socio-demographic information, knowledge and practice about VL, vector control, and for their experience following the intervention. Cost data was collected using cost data collection tool which was designed for this study. Statistical analysis included difference-in-differences estimate, bivariate analysis, Poisson regression model and incremental cost-efficacy ratio calculation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean sand fly density reduction by DWL-FWSC and DWL-RWSC was respectively &#x02212;4.96 (95&#x000a0;% CI, &#x02212;4.54, &#x02212;5.38) and &#x02212;5.38 (95&#x000a0;% CI, &#x02212;4.89, &#x02212;5.88). The sand fly density reduction attributed by both the interventions were statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (IRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.277, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for DWL-RWSC and IRR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.371, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for DWL-FWSC). The efficacy of DWL-RWSC and DWL-FWSC on sand fly density reduction was statistically comparable (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.214). The acceptability of both interventions was high. Transient burning sensations, flash on face and itching were most common adverse events and were observed mostly in Indian site. There was no serious adverse event. DWL-RWSC is cost-saving compared to DWL-FWSC. The incremental cost-efficacy ratio was &#x02212;6.36, where DWL-RWSC dominates DWL-FWSC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>DWL-RWSC intervention is safe, efficacious, cost-saving and cost-effective in reducing indoor sand fly density.

VL is known as kala-azar in the Indian sub-continent. The estimated annual incidence of VL in India, Bangladesh and Nepal is about 314,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. VL affects poor people in the rural areas of these countries causing substantial economic loss in these countries as well affected individual families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> is the only parasite causing VL in the sub-continent and it is transmitted by the infected sand fly <italic>Phlebotomus argentipes</italic>. The first reported outbreak of VL was in 1824 in a territory of Bangladesh when 75,000 people died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Fortunately the burden of VL is now going down in the Indian sub-continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In 2005 the Governments of India, Bangladesh and Nepal committed to a VL elimination program to sustainably bring down the number of cases to less that 1 per 10,000 people at the district/upazila (sub-district) level by 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nepal achieved the elimination target and Bangladesh is very close to the achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Early case detection and proper management and indoor residual spraying with insecticides (IRS) for sand fly control were the pillars of success in the attack phase of the elimination program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the subsequent consolidation and maintenance phases of the program the Government of these countries may be reluctant to use IRS for controlling sand fly because of its cost and in a situation when VL burden has substantially went down to few hundreds. So, new cost-effective and durable vector control methods are needed.</p><p>Other than IRS currently available methods for vector control are Long Lasting Insecticide Treated bed-net (either commercial or conversion of existing household bed-net into LLIN by their impregnation with slow release insecticide tablets), and durable wall lining (DWL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Durable Wall Lining (DWL, ZeroVectorTM, Vestergaard, Switzerland) contains a thin polyethylene material impregnated with deltamethrin in a concentration of Deltamethrin 170&#x000a0;mg a.i./m<sup>2</sup>. In our previous study we showed that among these methods the DWL was the most effective but costly intervention to control sand fly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In that study the intervened indoor household walls were covered by DWL up to 1.8&#x000a0;m in height from the floor (refer to as full wall surface coverage, DWL-FWSC) and 72&#x000a0;% reduction of sand fly density at month after intervention was achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is believed that sand fly usually rests in the lower part of indoor walls. So installation DWL in 1.5&#x000a0;m in height from floor (refer to as DWL-RWSC) should be sufficient to obtain the same entomological efficacy against sand fly as with full wall surface coverage with 1.8&#x000a0;m DWL.</p><p>In this study we aimed to compare the entomological efficacy of reduced wall surface coverage with 1.5&#x000a0;m DWL (DWL-RWSC) versus full wall surface coverage with 1.8&#x000a0;m DWL (DWL-FWSC) against sand fly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study sites, design and population</title><p>This multi-center study was a cluster randomized controlled design and was conducted in Bangladesh, India and Nepal from March 2014 to December 2014.

To calculate sample size, we expected 60&#x000a0;% reduction of mean sand fly (female <italic>P. argentipes</italic>) count per household [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] by the DWL intervention following our previous study results of 56&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI, 47&#x000a0;%&#x02013;70&#x000a0;%) reduction of female <italic>P. argentipes</italic> sand fly count at 1-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our previous study also showed that pooled mean density of female <italic>P. argentipes</italic> sand fly was 5.35 count per household [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We observed that the variation in sand fly count data at house level was also high. Therefore, considering mean female <italic>P. argentipes</italic> sand fly count per household about 5.35 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.0) and 3.21 before and after intervention respectively, a study power of 80&#x000a0;% and 5&#x000a0;% level of significance, the minimum pooled number of household for entomological measurements was 23 per arm. So in total the required minimum number was 23 &#x000d7; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;69. We had 30 households in each study site (10 households per arm) except I&#x0feff;ndia where it was 18 households&#x0feff; (6 households per arm)&#x0feff;&#x000a0;and in total (30 &#x000d7; 2) +18 = 78 households.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measurement of efficacy of intervention</title><p>Efficacy of the intervention was defined by the reduction of mean female <italic>P. argentipes</italic> sand fly count after intervention in intervention clusters compare to control cluster.

Sand fly collection had been done in March&#x02013;May in Bangladesh and April&#x02013;June in India and Nepal which complied with peak sand fly seasonality.

It was found that the Poisson distribution fitted the data and all analyses were performed under that assumption. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling was used to adjust the correlation in data due to longitudinal/repeated measurements in cluster sampling. In the model, an interaction term of being in the intervention arm at follow-up was included in order to estimate the effect of the intervention. Technically the regression model has the following structure: Count&#x02009;=&#x02009;Intercept&#x02009;+&#x02009;a*Treatment (1 for intervention and 0 for control)&#x02009;+&#x02009;b*Time (1 for follow up and 0 for baseline)&#x02009;+&#x02009;c*Interaction (1 for intervention group at follow up and 0 for otherwise)&#x02009;+&#x02009;error. The c-coefficient assesses intervention effect.</p><p>Two types of model were fitted, one for DWL-RWSC vs Control group and another for DWL-FWSC vs Control group. Finally these two types of models were compared using the Chow test to determine differences between efficacies of DWL-RWSC and DWL-FWSC interventions. In the tables, only the IRR (Incidence Rate Ratio) corresponding to c-coefficient and its <italic>p</italic>-value are given. Significances are given at the 5&#x000a0;% level and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals. In this report, we will focus on the pooled analysis of the three study sites in order to draw general conclusions but will also present site-specific results. The main outcome variable was 'Female <italic>P. argentipes</italic> sand flies count' per household before and 1&#x000a0;month after intervention. The variables which varied between intervention and control areas with <italic>p</italic>-values less than or equal 0.20 are considered as covariates for the full model to identify the adjusted effect of the interventions. All the analysis was perform by using STATA 10.1. Cost data were collected using cost data collection tool which was designed for this study. Average intervention cost per household was calculated. Cost of the both interventions was compared using incremental cost efficacy ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted assuming a normal distribution, using mean and standard deviation of the efficacy estimates and the cost per household and 15&#x000a0;% coefficient of variation for costs estimates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study clusters&#x02019; characteristics</title><p>Households in the study clusters (pooled) in the three countries did not differ regarding household head education, profession, family size and asset scores (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Previously, VL disappeared due to the collateral benefit of the mosquito control program from 1960 to 1970 in the Indian sub-continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, after ceasing IRS for mosquitoes, VL remerged to very high levels. This historical experience informs us that it is necessary to maintain sands fly densities under control to eventually succeed in the VL elimination program in the Indian sub-continent. The experience also informs us that when the disease burden goes down, the Government(s) becomes less inclined to maintain vector control due to its cost and organizational demands. When the VL case load goes down to a several hundred, the Government reallocates scarce resources to other health areas with more public health importance. This is why researchers and experts are desperately looking for safe, affordable and cost-effective methods for sand fly control, particularly for maintaining the success of the VL elimination program.</p><p>The DWL could be such a tool for long term control of the sand fly. In our previous study, we demonstrated its safety and efficacy for controlling sand fly in the Indian sub-continent through a randomized control trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In our earlier study we found 72&#x000a0;% reduction of sand fly density at 1&#x000a0;month follow up after intervention with DWL-FWSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the current study, we determined that the similar efficacy regarding sand fly control can be achieved by reduced coverage of household wall surface with the DWL. DWL-RWSC contributed to 73&#x000a0;% reduction in sand fly density at 1&#x000a0;month. Sand fly density reduction by IRS and by commercial LLINs was 73 and 42&#x000a0;% at 5&#x000a0;months respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another study reported a reduction of sand fly density of 25&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The impregnated existing bed nets with slow release insecticide tablets reduced sand fly density by about 65&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These studies differ regarding study design, follow up time, methods for sand fly collection and analysis making those incomparable. But none of those investigated efficacy of DWL for sand fly control which we did in our previous study and in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In this study the efficacy of DWL-RWSC did not varied while analysis was done by crude and adjusted regression model expressing that the efficacy of the DWL-RWSC was independent of house type, deployed IRS and baseline sand fly density within clusters. The incremental cost-efficacy ratio of DWL-RWSC dominated over that of DWL-FWSC indication that DWL-RWSC substantially will reduce the DWL material cost and make installation easier.</p><p>We cannot compare the study results with others simply because studies with DWL for controlling sand fly do not exist except for our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. When compared with our previous study, we did not find substantial difference in efficacy for sand fly control by reducing wall coverage with DWL at 1&#x000a0;month after intervention. The acceptability of reduced coverage with DWL was as high as with full coverage; however the adverse events were comparatively more common with DWL-RWSC. We cannot explain this. Fortunately all of those were transient and no serious adverse event was observed.</p><p>There are several limitations of the study. We could not explore the long term efficacy of the DWL-RWSC intervention. Future studies are needed to assess the longevity of efficacy by DWL-RWSC intervention. Another limitation is that we did not have an epidemiological end point which was due to the low incidence of VL in all three countries making this not feasible. It is important that a vector control method result in a reduction of the vector if it is to have an impact on the vector borne disease. The study did not include parasite infection in sand fly as an alternative way for impact evaluation. This was not possible due to lack of laboratory infrastructure, needed for this purpose. Nevertheless the achieved sand fly reduction of about 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;% by DWL-RWSC should contribute to VL elimination. For VL elimination in the Indian sub-continent the model-based estimated required <italic>P. argentipes</italic> sand fly density reduction was 67&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our study demonstrated that DWL-RWSC was capable to reduce <italic>P. argentipes</italic> sand fly density with similar strength.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that the evidence for controlling sand fly with DWL-RWSC is strong and should be considered by the VL elimination program in the Indian sub-continent.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional file</title><p>
