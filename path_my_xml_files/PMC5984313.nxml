However, many women in low- and middle-income countries who become pregnant have poor nutrition, and this can affect the outcome of their pregnancies and the health of their infants. If a well-nourished woman becomes pregnant, she is more likely to be healthy, have a healthy pregnancy, and give birth to a healthy infant. In this study, we aim to improve the nutrition and health of adolescent and young women (15&#x02013;24&#x000a0;years) in rural Pakistan before they become pregnant, and so that they might be better nourished before becoming pregnant. To improve participants&#x02019; nutrition and health, we will provide life skills building education and multiple micronutrient supplements before they become pregnant and until 6&#x000a0;months after they give birth if they become pregnant. Because adolescent and young women in rural Pakistan are known to be undernourished and have babies early in life, they could benefit from this intervention. To determine the effect of the intervention, we will compare it to the care that women normally receive within the existing public health system. The main measurement that we will compare is how many infants are born with a birth weight that is low (&#x0003c;&#x02009;2500&#x000a0;g), which suggests that the infants did not grow well during the pregnancy. Ultimately, we hope that the findings from this study will help us to understand what care should be given to women in places with poor nutrition before they become pregnant so that they have healthier pregnancies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par25">While the focus of global public health experts has been on the first 1000&#x000a0;days of life as the most developmentally critical period, risk factors known to impact maternal and newborn health can exist from adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. If an adolescent girl becomes pregnant, her pregnancy is at an increased risk for adverse outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, births to adolescent mothers can negatively affect both the mother and infant&#x02019;s health in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As approximately 11% of all births are to adolescents 15&#x02013;19&#x000a0;years of age, and more than 90% of these occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), providing appropriate interventions prior to and during pregnancy will be crucial to reducing the burden of adverse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Antenatal care (ANC) services offer an opportunity for maternal screening and intervention during pregnancy. However, in LMICs women tend not to report for care until the second trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], thus the initial 100&#x02013;150 of the first 1000&#x000a0;days are frequently missed. This presents a major limitation to ensuring adequate uptake of interventions for a reasonable duration, even though factors like nutritional status are crucial from the time of conception for placentation, organogenesis, prevention of congenital birth defects, and fetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given the risks associated with anemia during pregnancy, iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation is the standard of care during ANC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many experts have come to suggest that multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation should replace IFA given the prevalence of MMN deficiencies in LMICs, multiple causes of anemia, and synergistic interactions between micronutrients within biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MMN supplementation during pregnancy can significantly decrease the risk of LBW births (relative risk: 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.85 to 0.91; high-quality evidence) compared to IFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and among undernourished and anemic pregnant women MMN supplements could further improve infant survival and birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. At this time, MMN supplementation has been neither accepted nor recommended by the World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Offering preconception care from adolescence could provide an opportunity for health and nutrition promotion to improve one&#x02019;s own well-being, as well as future pregnancy outcomes and the health of the next generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

There are several secondary objectives for participants enrolled in the trial and the infants born to them to further determine the effect of LSBE and MMN supplementation compared to the standard of care. Among participants, these relate to nutrition (anthropometry [height, weight, middle upper arm circumference (MUAC)], nutritional status [iron, vitamin A, vitamin D]) and general health (e.g., morbidity, mortality).

Including 1418 villages and a population of about 776,000, around 78,000 residents are adolescent and young women 15&#x02013;24&#x000a0;years (based on regular surveillance data).</p><p id="Par33">The nutritional status of Pakistani women is suggested to be suboptimal, and often attributed to that dietary staples are micronutrient poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A comparable number of non-pregnant and pregnant women are anemic (51%) and experience iron deficiency anemia (20 and 26% among non-pregnant and pregnant women, respectively); deficiencies in other micronutrients are also common (e.g., vitamin A [43 and 49%] and vitamin D [85 and 86%]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Infants born to Pakistani women are consequently at an increased risk of poor growth and development.

In this trial, we aim to assess the effectiveness of providing LSBE and MMN supplements to adolescent and young women in rural Pakistan from preconception, and compare this intervention with the standard of care on the prevalence of LBW births. Including a culturally-tailored educational piece aimed at empowering participants to make informed decisions about their health and well-being will be key to sustained behavioural change throughout the life-course. By implementing the intervention within the LHW Programme, we aim to gather important insight around how to achieve coverage within the existing programmatic context. This trial is distinctive in that it recruits both married and unmarried adolescent and young women. Consequently, we will be better able to ascertain the effect of the intervention on in the context of pregnancy, as well as investigate the effect on several domains of health and nutrition in the absence of pregnancy, as detailed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par71">The WHO has not recommended antenatal MMN supplementation at this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). The standard of care remains IFA supplementation, in spite of several large trials that show that MMN supplementation is efficacious in improving diverse health outcomes and meta-analyses that have found that MMN supplementation could be more effective than IFA in preventing adverse pregnancy-related health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given that only around 50% of anemia is suggested to be caused by low iron stores, MMN supplementation could provide further benefit than IFA alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, improving stores from preconception could be of added benefit because adolescent and young women would enter pregnancy with sufficient pregnancy stores.</p><p id="Par72">Overall, the MaPPS Trial is expected to offer insight into providing an intervention that includes both LSBE and MMN supplementation to adolescent and young women from preconception and for a sufficient duration of time, and on the impact on their infants. So as to better understand the long-term effect of the intervention on development (e.g., growth and neurodevelopment) and diseases outcomes among infants born to study participants, we anticipate conducting further follow up studies in the future.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par73">As of May 2018, participants are still being enrolled in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec32"><p>
