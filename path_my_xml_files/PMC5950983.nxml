However, we are unaware of any studies in the literature that have robustly assessed whether this would lead to a higher proportion of healing in similarly treated people without oxygen. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess this in people being treated for chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).</p></sec><sec id="section2-1932296817695574"><title>Methods:</title><p>We enrolled and randomized 100 subjects with DFUs (79% male, aged 58.3 &#x000b1; 12.1 years) to receive either active continuous diffusion of oxygen (CDO) therapy using an active CDO device, or an otherwise fully operational sham device that provided moist wound therapy (MWT) without delivering oxygen. Patients were followed until closure or 12 weeks, whichever was sooner. Patients, treating physicians and independent evaluators were blinded to the study arm. All patients received identical offloading, dressings and follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1932296817695574"><title>Results:</title><p>There were no significant differences in assessed descriptive characteristics between the treatment arms (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; .05 for all). A significantly higher proportion of people healed in the active arm compared to sham (46% vs 22%, <italic>P</italic> = .02).

This is compounded for patients with chronic wounds who often have compromised blood flow to the wound, thus further limiting tissue oxygenation and impairing healing.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Enhancing tissue oxygenation can be achieved using different therapies. Traditionally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been used to achieve supersaturated levels of oxygen in the blood stream and tissues through high pressures and concentrations of inspired oxygen. However, this therapy is intermittent (90 minute exposures, 3-5 times per week), relies on circulation (which may be impaired) to bring the oxygen to the damaged tissue, and requires substantial time for the patient in terms of travel and preparation time. Topical oxygen therapy is a newer modality in which the affected tissue is placed within a chamber or bag and exposed to high concentrations of oxygen. However, this therapy is also intermittent (typically 90 minute exposures once a day) and the subject must remain immobile during the treatment. Yet topical oxygen can be applied in a wider variety of settings, including the patient&#x02019;s home. The newest therapy, continuous diffusion of oxygen or continuously diffused oxygen (CDO) removes the above-mentioned limitations of being intermittent and immobilizing the patient during treatment. CDO uses pure, humidified oxygen to continuously treat a wound by supplying oxygen directly to the affected tissue within a MWT dressing. This allows for sustained delivery of oxygen to the tissue (24 hours a day, 7 days a week), full patient mobility during treatment, and application of the therapy in virtually any setting. Devices that supply CDO therapy are lightweight, silent, solid-state, and come in rechargeable or disposable versions.</p><p>This study focuses on an FDA cleared device which supplies CDO therapy, the TransCu O2&#x000ae; System (EO2 Concepts, San Antonio, TX). The device uses fuel cell technology to continuously generate pure, humidified oxygen at flow rates of 3-15 ml/hr and deliver it directly to the wound bed environment within the MWT dressing system via tubing. CDO therapy can be simply described as MWT plus oxygen. This CDO device differentiates itself from other continuous oxygen delivery devices by being the only system to employ sensors which monitor and control not only the amount of oxygen being delivered, yet also monitor and control the pressure within the wound bed. The oxygen control system compensates for environmental fluctuations that can affect oxygen output, thus ensuring consistent oxygen delivery. The pressure control system ensures that there is no blockage of oxygen flow and that the oxygen pressure in the wound bed does not exceed capillary collapse pressure. Excessive localized pressures could collapse capillaries and impair delivery of blood and nutrients to the affected tissues during wound repair. The unit continuously monitors and controls for these variables, and warns the patient/physician if the flow of oxygen is impaired or if the pressure in the wound bed is too high. The TransCu O2 System is intended to treat various ulcers, including DFUs, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and other skin wounds.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of CDO using various devices that provide CDO therapy. A retrospective analysis on the impact of CDO in chronic toe ulcer healing for 20 patients showed an overall success rate (full closure) of 74% on wounds that were unresponsive to other therapies.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The author highlighted a chief benefit being that of high patient compliance (95%), which he attributed to the device&#x02019;s ease of use, the noticeability of improvement within a short period of time, and the reduction of pain, which has also been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Another retrospective analysis of 25 patients in a Veteran&#x02019;s Healthcare Administration environment showed 68% full closure, both as a stand-alone and adjunctive therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The author found that CDO improves wound healing potential, including in wounds receiving advanced tissue/skin substitute applications. A prospective, randomized clinical trial of CDO versus MWT followed 17 patients (9 CDO, 8 MWT) for 4 weeks and found significant differences in wound volume reduction.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The CDO group had an average volume reduction of 87%, whereas the MWT group had an average volume reduction of 46% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). Significant differences in the healing rate of CDO as compared to MWT were recently demonstrated in a prospective, randomized pilot clinical trial with 9 patients receiving MWT and 9 receiving CDO.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The study focused on smaller DFUs (approx. 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), UT Grade I-III, over an 8-week period. CDO was shown to close 90% of the wounds by the end of the study, whereas the MWT group experienced 30% closure. The authors also noted significantly faster wound closure rates in the CDO arm and more noticeable differences from CDO in the more advanced ulcers (Grades II and III).</p><p>In a double-blind preclinical study using a sham as the control arm, similar to the design discussed herein, wherein all wounds received MWT dressings and a CDO device, significant results were found for both the rate of reepithelialization and amount of full closure achieved.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Full closure was 57% in the active CDO arm and 25% in the sham arm (<italic>P</italic> = .008). The rate of reepithelialization was increased in the active CDO arm by 130% relative to the sham arm (<italic>P</italic> = .006) and full closure was achieved. The authors also noted that histologically the repair tissue showed more advanced wound remodeling and organized collagen in the active CDO arm. Similarly, a nonsham blinded preclinical trial showed significant results with each animal as its own control. The rate of reepithelialization was increased in the CDO arm by 156% relative to the control arm (<italic>P</italic> = .01).<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Pain reduction associated with CDO therapy has also been reported. For a patient who served as her own control during CDO therapy treatment, her pain levels were reported as high as 8/10 on a visual analogue score (VAS), with pain medications taken as needed, during the 5-month duration of the ulcer prior to CDO therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> After 20 days of CDO therapy, the patient reported a pain level of 2/10 and was no longer taking pain medications. At this time, CDO therapy was temporarily discontinued since the patient was leaving town for a holiday. Six days later the patient returned to the clinic with a pain level of 10/10 and reported difficulty sleeping. CDO therapy was reapplied and, within three days, the patient&#x02019;s pain level was controlled (VAS 2/10) and she ceased taking narcotics. In an uncontrolled, nonrandomized study of 10 patients with venous ulcers, CDO therapy was reported to significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .009) reduce pain in a six-week period.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The corresponding mean reduction in wound size was 58.9%.

Both arms received identical treatment (device, dressings, etc) and the devices were functional in both arms with the exception that the oxygen did not flow to the wound in the sham arm. Prior to assignment of a device, all patients were subjected to a run-in period during which they received MWT and were evaluated for wound size and rate of wound closure to ensure that the wounds were indeed chronic in nature. Patients, treating physicians and independent analysts were blinded to the treatment arm, thereby eliminating the placebo effect. The total sample size was 100. The primary efficacy outcome was complete wound closure (yes, no), defined as complete reepithelialization with no drainage as assessed by the treating clinician and confirmed by a blinded observer. Eligible subjects were those who were confirmed to meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Full criteria and details on participating sites are available on ClinicalTrials.gov under the Identifier NCT01645891.</p><p>As published previously,<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> the effects of initial or baseline wound size and initial or run-in rate of wound closure were investigated. These were defined as:<disp-quote><p>Baseline wound size: the wound area as determined by digital planimetric analysis at the randomization visit.</p><p>Run-in wound closure rate: the percentage of wound closure (percentage wound area reduction, or PWAR) during the run-in period prior to the placement of the device. All subjects received MWT during this period.</p></disp-quote></p><p>The basis for assessing effect of wound size is that smaller wounds are more likely to heal within the 12-week study timeframe. In theory, if the Active arm enhances healing rates, the relative effect between the Active and Sham arms should be similar or greater in larger wounds than in smaller wounds. With regard to the run-in wound closure rate, it has been shown that wounds related to DFUs which exhibit a relatively high rate of closure early in a treatment regimen, measured as PWAR, are significantly more likely to close without intervention of advanced therapies.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Sheehan et al found that wounds experiencing less than 50% PWAR in 4 weeks were significantly less likely to close than those experiencing greater than or equal to 50% PWAR.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Similarly, Lavery et al found that wounds experiencing less than 60% PWAR in 4 weeks were significantly less likely to close than those experiencing greater than or equal to 60% PWAR.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In other words, a high PWAR indicates wounds that are easy to close, whereas a lower PWAR is indicative of wounds that are harder to close. Therefore, wounds that exhibit lower run-in rates of closure (indicating that they are more chronic) should be more responsive to the use of advanced modalities such as CDO.</p><p>On the basis of early results from this study (published in <italic>Wound Medicine</italic>),<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> the protocol was amended to change the minimum baseline wound size and run-in rate of wound closure inclusion/exclusion criteria mentioned above.

Ages were limited to between 30 and 90 years with wound sizes ranging from 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> to 10 cm<sup>2</sup>, as measured by planimetric analysis from photos taken after wound debridement. Subjects were recruited from a total of 34 sites in the continental United States. All enrolled subjects received a standard MWT regimen consisting of wound cleansing, moist wound care, off-loading and, as appropriate, aggressive debridement. After initial screening for eligibility and obtaining informed consent, a patient history and baseline assessment were obtained by the study clinician. Variables assessed included ankle-brachial index, wound duration, location and size, patient age, race, gender, and HbA1c. All wounds were classified according to the University of Texas classification for diabetic wounds by a wound specialist based on clinical and laboratory data.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> All wounds were surgically debrided to a bleeding base as necessary; the number of debridements was not limited but usually debridements were performed once a week before treatment commenced.</p><p>Prior to enrollment, subjects went through a run-in period to screen out nonchronic wounds that would be easy to close without advanced intervention. The study inclusion/exclusion criteria required wounds experiencing high run-in wound closure rates, measured as PWAR, during the run-in period to be excluded from the study. The intent was to find a balance between a short run-in period and robust screening criteria to help ensure that nonchronic wounds were not included in the study. As detailed in an interim analysis of the data,<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> the closure rate during the run-in period had an effect on the sensitivity of the analysis.

All CDO devices were set to the minimum flow rate of 3 ml/hr, which is the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommended oxygen flow rate for the wound sizes in this study.</p><p>All patients were followed for the Treatment Period of 12 weeks, or until the wound closed, whichever event occurred first. During the Treatment Period, weekly assessments were made of wound size (width, height, and depth) via planimetric analysis, degree of reepithelialization of the wound, pain, quality of life, and the development of granulation tissue. Between visits, dressings were changed as needed by the subjects themselves or a relative/friend for the vast majority of subjects (&#x0003e;99%).</p><p>To evaluate whether there was an effect of wound size on the primary outcome of wound closure, the effect on the primary outcome was reported by wound size in 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> segments from all wounds greater than 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> up to a minimum wound size of 4.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. Higher minimum wound sizes were not reported since the sample sizes became too small (n &#x0003c; 30). To evaluate whether there was an effect of run-in wound closure rate on the primary outcome of wound closure, results were reported by excluding subjects at two lower rates of PWAR, each corresponding to more chronic wounds. The lowest rate analyzed was chosen to match that established by Lavery et al as defining a chronic wound which would benefit from advanced intervention: less than 60% in 4 weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1932296817695574" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> This in turn corresponds to less than 30% in 2 weeks, the run-in period used in this study. The intermediate rate of 40% in 2 weeks was also analyzed. Since each 2-week period analyzed had a 10% change from the original 50%, the corresponding 1-week period rate of change was 5%.

The statistical significance of the relation between binary outcomes and treatment arm (Active, Sham) were assessed with Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test. Treatments were contrasted with regard to continuously distributed outcomes with a t-test. In an analysis of days to closure versus wound closure we used a repeated measures linear model with an autoregressive order one autocorrelation assumption. We used R and SAS for all analyses and graphics. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level of 5%.

The study also revealed that CDO therapy appears to have a similar or greater effect as the wound size increases. Furthermore, the relative effect of CDO therapy on more chronic wounds appears to be more pronounced as the wounds become more chronic. These results appear to indicate that the more a wound needs CDO therapy, the greater the apparent effect. We look forward to further works that may confirm or build on these data.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> CDO, continuous diffusion of oxygen; CI, confidence interval; DFU, diabetic foot ulcer; MWT, moist wound therapy; PWAR, percentage wound area reduction; RR, relative risk.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: MQN is a full-time employee of EO2 Concepts.
