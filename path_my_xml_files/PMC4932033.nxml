exercise using the PNF technique on standing balance in one-leg and double-leg stances.
[Subjects and Methods] The present study recruited 34 healthy participants from a local
university. The Participants performed four balance tests (double-leg stance with and
without vision, one-leg stance with and without vision), before and after exercise. The
exercise consisted of exercises performed using PNF techniques (stabilizing reversal and
rhythmic stabilization), which were applied to facilitate trunk musculature. To examine
balance ability, total displacement of the center of pressure was measured during balance
tests. [Results] The total anterior&#x02013;posterior center of pressure displacement was
significantly reduced after applying rhythmic stabilization compared before exercise
regardless of the balance test conditions. [Conclusion] The present results suggest that
trunk stability exercise using rhythmic stabilization could effectively enhance balance
ability under one-leg and double-leg conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance exercise</kwd><kwd>COP</kwd><kwd>PNF technique</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Regaining balance ability is a fundamental component of the clinician&#x02019;s goals for patients

abdominal and paraspinal muscles also contributes to maintaining the center of mass within
the base of support<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, facilitating trunk musculature is one of the exercise
assessments for enhancing balance ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous findings have suggested that impairments in postural control during walking are a

protocols could be helpful for improving overall postural stability in a standing
posture<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although various trunk
stabilization exercises have been suggested in the clinical literature and studies, however,
there still remains a question regarding which exercise form is effective for enhancing
balance ability through trunk exercises<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) interventions classically suggest two
stabilizing exercise techniques, which are referred to as stabilizing reversal (SR) and
rhythmic stabilization (RS)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. SR is
characterized by alternating isotonic contractions opposed by resistance to prevent motion,
which allowing small movements. RS is characterized by isometric contractions against the
resistance provided by the therapist, with the subject trying to maintain their position as
the therapist changes the direction of resistance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the SR and RS
techniques are effective for enhancing balance ability. The secondary purpose was to
determine which exercise is effective for improving trunk stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-four asymptomatic subjects were recruited from a local university. They were 20 to
26 (21.9 &#x000b1; 2.8) years old, their mean height and weight were 174.9 &#x000b1; 5.6 and 66.5 &#x000b1; 5.3&#x02005;kg
respectively. Participants were excluded if they had any history of musculoskeletal problems
within the last 6 months. Each subject provided informed consent before participating in the
study. This study was approved by the Choonhae University Faculty of Health Sciences Human
Ethics Committee. The center of pressure (COP) data for under the feet were collected by
using a pedoscan (International GmbH, Schlangenbad, Germany). For the pre-exercise balance
test, each subject stood on the pedoscan plate under the following conditions: double-leg
stance with the eyes open (DLS-O), double-leg stance with the eyes closed (DLS-C), one-leg
stance with the eyes open (SLS-O), and one-leg stance with the eyes closed (SLS-C).
Measurement was performed under each balance test condition during an 11&#x02005;s period, and the
data for the first and last three second seconds of the period were eliminated. The primary
researcher performed stabilizing reversal and rhythmic stabilization for each subject to
facilitate trunk musculature in a randomized order. The period was 3&#x02005;min for each exercise,
and the period between exercise conditions was one day. Immediately after the SR and RS
exercise, the COP was measured again under the during four balance test conditions using the
pedoscan. The data were expressed as total and mean COP movement during balance tests<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two-way repeated ANOVA was conducted to
examine differences. Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05, and PASW Statistics
18.0 was used for statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Descriptive statics of the balance test and total COP movement are represented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The average and standard deviation (SD) of total anterior-posterior center of

to both exercise and balance test conditions (p&#x0003c;0.05). Subsequent post hoc testing
revealed that RS significantly reduced total COP movement compared with the pre-exercise
values (p&#x0003c;0.05). In factor of the balance test, the total COP displacements were
gradually altered in serial conditions of double leg stance with eyes-open, double-leg
stance of eyes-closed, one-leg stance with eyes-open, one-leg stance with eyes-closed
(p&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Evaluation of balance ability in a standing posture is clinically well evidenced, and this
includes evaluation under one-leg and double-leg stance and presence of vision<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our data suggested that the double-leg
stance with eyes open and double-leg stance with eyes closed, one-leg stance with eyes open
and one-leg stance with eyes closed were well differentiated between conditions according to
difficulty of conditions. Mitchell et al. reported that the presence of vision critically
affects standing balance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, but the
present results indicated that a narrow base of support has a major effect on the balance
ability of young subjects.</p><p>RS significantly reduced anterior-posterior COP displacement, compared with the values
after SR and those before exercise. Some previous studies have reported that RS increased
co-contraction, which is necessary for enhancing upright trunk posture<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Theoretically, balance is defined as the ability to
maintain the center of mass (COM) within the base of support<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the COM is positioned approximately anterior to the
sacrum in a standing position<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, co-contraction of the trunk muscle could reduce COM displacement through the RS
technique.</p><p>Although the results of the present study showed significant decreases in COP displacement
with the RS technique, the present study could not affirm that SR is less useful than RS. In
elderly subjects or patients with insufficient muscle strength, SR, which induces
alternating contractions might be easier to perform than RS for enhancing stability. The
present study suggests that standing balance could be improved with the rhythmic
stabilization technique in asymptomatic subjects. And balance tests with variations of
vision and support surface could be well differentiated and could be applied for stepwise
assessment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Busan division of the Korea Proprioceptive Neuromuscular
