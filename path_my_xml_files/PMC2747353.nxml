Following screening, subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of MA-ES 625 mg/5 mL after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, or immediately after eating a standard, high-calorie, high-fat meal of 800 to 1000 calories consisting of 2 eggs fried in butter, 2 slices of toast with butter, 2 strips of bacon, 4 oz of hash brown potatoes, and 8 oz of whole milk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijn-4-185">8</xref> The study drug was administered orally with the standard 8 oz of water.

In the fasting state, MAOS demonstrates poor bioavailability, probably due to its poor water solubility, which contributes to reduced dissolution. The change in the absorption profile of MAOS between fed and fasting states had not been characterized when the drug was initially approved for marketing in 1993.</p><p>Solubility, and thus absorption and bioavailability, of lipophilic drug molecules can be improved with a reduction in particle size to submicron levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijn-4-185">12</xref> To improve the solubility of megestrol acetate, nanocrystal technology was applied to the original formulation to reduce the drug particle size to 80 to 400 nm in diameter (up to 50 times smaller than the micronized particles in MAOS), thus increasing the total surface area of drug particles and improving dissolution of MA-ES. When the PK data for MA-ES was compared to that of MAOS, the difference between drug absorption of the two formulations under fasting conditions became apparent.</p><p>Results from the current studies demonstrate that C<sub>max</sub> and total absorption (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>) of MAOS are markedly reduced (by 86% and 52%, respectively) in fasting versus fed subjects. Since cachectic patients can have minimal appetite, and are often in the fasted state, the poor bioavailability of MAOS in this state may be a significant impediment. Graham et al report in their 21-day study of AIDS patients with cachexia that there is a significant correlation between sustained plasma concentrations of MAOS above a threshold of 300 ng/mL and weight gain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijn-4-185">13</xref> Patients in the study were administered MAOS 800 mg/20 mL, once daily, prior to breakfast. We report a C<sub>max</sub> value of 187 ng/mL for MAOS in the fasting state, which is below the 300 ng/mL threshold suggested for weight gain to occur.</p><p>C<sub>max</sub> and total absorption of MA-ES in fasting versus fed subjects are reduced by much smaller margins (30% and 26%, respectively). Since absorption of MA-ES is less profoundly affected by the presence or absence of food, this formulation may offer potential clinical benefit for cachectic patients with impaired appetite and low caloric intake. HIV-positive patients (n = 63) with &#x02265;10% unintended weight loss were randomized to once daily treatment with MA-ES 575 mg/5 mL or MAOS 800 mg/20 mL for 12 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijn-4-185">14</xref> Although MA-ES 575 mg/5 mL is not an FDA-approved dose, it is formulated using nanocrystal technology. Patients receiving MA-ES 575 mg/5 mL showed statistically significant weight gain from baseline as early as week 1. At the end of 12 weeks patients gained an average of 10% (11.9 lbs; 5.4 kg) of their baseline weight, which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In addition, weight gain from baseline during the study was statistically significant at several time points. Patients receiving MAOS did not show weight gain until week 2. At the end of 12 weeks, patients gained an average of 6% (7.7 lbs; 3.5 kg) of their baseline weight, but weight gain was not statistically significant at any time point from baseline.</p><p>At study end, MA-ES 575 mg/5 mL patients did gain the 10% weight they had lost at baseline, and weight gain occurred more rapidly at each time point than for MA-OS. The difference in weight gain results between MA-ES 575 mg/5 mL and MA-OS may be due to the improved absorption of the MA-ES formulation in people who have not eaten, although this study was not controlled for food or caloric intake. Most studies evaluating orexigenic agents for treatment of unintended weight loss are 12 weeks in duration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijn-4-185">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijn-4-185">18</xref> The improved bioavailability of MA-ES may facilitate earlier weight gain, and potentially shorten treatment duration.</p><p>The MA-ES formulation is associated with other properties that may be important to patients or caregivers. Since the MA-ES formulation is more concentrated at 125 mg/mL than MAOS, which is 40 mg/mL, the recommended dose of MA-ES is delivered in a smaller volume of 5 mL (1 teaspoonful), once daily; whereas, the recommended dose of MAOS is 20 mL (4 teaspoonsful), once daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijn-4-185">19</xref> The reduction in megestrol acetate particle size in the MA-ES formulation also resulted in a suspension that is much less viscous than MAOS (10 centipoise versus 163 centipoise, respectively [data on file, Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Spring Valley, New York, USA]). These factors may make MA-ES more palatable for patients who lack appetite and/or may have difficulty swallowing.</p><p>Although MAOS and MA-ES contain the same active ingredient, they are not considered therapeutic equivalents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijn-4-185">20</xref> because of the differences in concentration and fasting bioavailability between each drug.</p><p>The PK profile for MAOS under fed and fasted conditions (Study 2 and Study 3) was needed for the MA-ES New Drug Application submitted to the FDA. FDA approval was based on bioequivalence of MA-ES to MAOS under fed conditions. Subsequently, Study 1 was conducted to further characterize the food-effect bioavailability of MA-ES. Since the PK profile for MAOS was already established, the results were evaluated relative to the PK profile of MA-ES from Study 1. Although these 3 PK studies described in the current report were conducted in a similar manner among healthy male subjects, the potential for differences between the study populations, assays, and sampling techniques cannot be discounted. Thus, any comparison of data across studies should be undertaken carefully. These studies are also limited by the absence of female subjects from the study populations.</p><p>A further limitation of these studies is that PK parameters in healthy volunteers may not be generalizable to cachectic patients, who suffer from underlying disease, take concomitant medications, and may be elderly. Studies evaluating food effects and the effect of variable caloric intake on the bioavailability of MA-ES and MAOS, and correlation with clinical improvement in patients with cachexia would be of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Food intake has the potential to affect drug absorption and bioavailability. This is a particularly important consideration when treating patients with cachexia or UWL because they often have low caloric intake. MA-ES is an improved formulation that is more readily absorbed and has improved bioavailability in the fasting state as compared to the original megestrol acetate oral suspension.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments and disclosures</title><p>Editorial assistance was provided by BioScience Communications and Prescott Medical Communications Group.</p><p>These studies were conducted by qualified investigators at SFBC Anapharm, Montr&#x000e9;al, Canada, under the sponsorship of PAR Pharmaceutical, Inc., Woodcliff Lake, NJ.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ijn-4-185"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><name><surname>Ashmen</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Morley</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nutritional management in long-term care: development of a clinical guideline.
