Generally, it starts two days before the operation and reaches its peak just prior to induction of anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Anxiety is more common among younger patients, women, and people with negative experience of anesthesia or fear of death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Anxiety, stress, and fear that arise just before the operation and anesthesia may lead to psychological trauma and increase the levels of stress hormones, resulting in undesirable metabolic responses before anesthesia. High catecholamine levels increase arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen consumption.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Controlling these metabolic reactions is a necessity for modern anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Comfortable anesthesia induction and maintenance can be achieved by controlling anxiety.</p><p>Various agents such as phenothiazines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, and antihistamines are used to relieve anxiety and provide sedation. Today, the most frequently used drugs are benzodiazepines.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Midazolam is a medication from this group with rapid onset and short lasting effect. Its sedative effect has been shown in many studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a selective, specific, and highly potent alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The affinity of alpha-2/alpha-1 is 1620/1. While both alpha-1 and alpha-2 effects are present in higher doses and rapid administrations, only alpha-2 effects are observed in low-moderate doses and slow administrations. It has anxiolytic, hypnotic, sedative, and analgesic effects. It affects alpha-2 receptors in the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, and autonomic ganglions. It is widely used in intensive care units due to these characteristics.</p><p>In this study, our primary objective was to compare the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine vis-a-vis midazolam in preoperative sedation prior to minor surgical procedures. And our secondary goal was to find out the equivalent dose of midazolam to a dose of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg dexmedetomidine infusion used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Appropriate approval of the ethics committee of the hospital was obtained prior to the study. A total of 125 patients, aged 20-60 years, in American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) groups I-II, and to undergo a minor or moderate in-hospital surgical procedure under general anesthesia were included in the study. During a preanesthetic visit, the patients were informed about the procedure and written informed consents of all participants were obtained, a day before surgery. Patients using alpha- and beta-blockers as antihypertensive agents or hypertensive patients without any treatment, patients on concurrent sedative medications, patients with psychiatric disease and those with body weight not within 20% of the ideal weight were excluded from the study.</p><p>The participants were randomized into three groups. Group I was control, Group II was dexmedetomidine, and Group III was the midazolam group. Group III was further divided into three subgroups: IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC. Group I received 100 ml of physiological saline. Group II received 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg dexmedetomidine (Precedex 200 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml, Hospira Inc., Rocky Mount, USA) in 100 ml physiological saline. Group IIIA received 0.02 mg/kg, Group IIIB received 0.04 mg/kg, and Group IIIC received 0.06 mg/kg midazolam (Dormicum 15 mg/ml, F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) in 100 ml physiological saline. The agents used in sedation were administered by an intravenous slow infusion in the preparation room in order to provide better control and stop them in case of any complication.</p><p>The patients were transferred to preparation room 40 minutes prior to anesthesia induction. They were reminded about the procedure and on how to use the visual analog score (VAS). Non-invasive blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography, and peripheral oxygen saturation monitoring was performed (Nihon-Kohden BSM 4113 K, Nihon-Kohden Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Peripheral venous routes were accessed via 20-G catheters. The infusions of the medications were started 30 minutes before anesthesia induction and infusions were completed in 10 minutes. Balanced electrolyte solution with an infusion rate of 100 ml/h was started simultaneously using another IV route. The onset time of sedative agent infusion was taken as minute zero and the following parameters were measured and recorded with intervals of 5 minutes: Ramsay sedation scores (1 = agitated, restless; 2 = cooperative, tranquil; 3 = responds to verbal commands while sleeping; 4 = brisk response to glabellar tap or loud voice while sleeping; 5 = sluggish response to glabellar tap or loud voice; 6 = no response to glabellar tap or loud voice), VAS (patients were asked to self-evaluate their feelings of anxiety with scores of 0-10, with 0 = absent and 10 = very much), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and respiratory rate (RR).</p><p>It was planned to intervene the patients with atropine sulfate 0.5 mg in case of bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;50 bpm) and with ephedrine HCl 5 mg incremental doses in case of hypotension (MAP &#x0003c;60 mm Hg). If respiratory rates &#x0003c;8 and hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%) were observed, the depth and rate of respiration were planned to be increased with verbal or painful stimuli and oxygen support with mask.</p><p>Power analysis done before the study showed that: Taken as &#x00394;:2,5 SD:2, for power of 0.80, &#x003b2;:0.20 and &#x003b1;:0.05; the subject number of groups was to be 11. Statistical analysis was performed by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows 15.0 software. In addition to descriptive statistical methods (mean, Standard Deviation), One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare parameters with normal distribution between groups. Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test was used to determine the group that caused the difference. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis and Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests were used to compare the parameters without normal distribution. Intra-group comparisons were performed with repeated-measures ANOVA and paired <italic>t</italic> test for parameters having normal distribution; and with Friedman test and Wilcoxon index test for parameters without normal distribution. Comparison of qualitative data was performed with Chi-square test.

This sedative effect was observed in group IIIC (0.06 mg/kg midazolam group). The sedative effect of midazolam decreased at the 25<sup>th</sup> minute according to Ramsay and VAS, and MAP levels slightly increased at the 25<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> minutes. However, the sedative effect of dexmedetomidine continued at the 25<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> minutes, but MAP and HR measurements did not increase. The decrease in MAP measurements was not to a level that could compromise hemodynamics of the patients in both groups. These effects were present in both groups with similar sedative characteristics but were more evident in the dexmedetomidine group. In two patients who received dexmedetomidine, HR decreased below 50 bpm, and 0.5 mg of atropine was administered since HR decreased to below 40 bpm (during laryngoscopy in one). No medication was administered, as HR increased spontaneously in the other patient and in one patient from the control group. When compared with controls, dexmedetomidine-induced bradycardia was not statistically significant and was not found to be clinically challenging. Similar observations were reported by Dyck and colleagues who compared intravenous and intramuscular administration of dexmedetomidine and by Erkola and colleagues who compared the effects of dexmedetomidine and midazolam in elective abdominal hysterectomy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>When RR and SpO<sub>2</sub> values were evaluated, dexmedetomidine and all doses of midazolam caused significant decreases in RR compared to the controls and the levels at the onset of administration. This decrease was less evident in 0.02 mg/ kg midazolam group and lasted shorter in this group as compared to the other groups. There was no difference between dexmedetomidine and 0.06 mg/kg midazolam groups that were equally sedative. The decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub> levels was more evident and resultant hypoxemia was more frequent in 0.06 mg/kg midazolam group. The effects of dexmedetomidine on respiratory parameters were reported to be minimal in a number of studies performed with similar doses. Hall and colleagues studied the effects of low-dose dexmedetomidine on amnesia, analgesia, and sedation, while Venn and colleagues investigated respiratory effects of dexmedetomidine in postoperative intensive care unit patients and found similar results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] On the other hand, Bhana <italic>et al</italic>., Belleville <italic>et al</italic>., and Venn <italic>et al</italic>. reported that higher doses and rapid infusion rates might suppress respiration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>]</p><p>We enrolled ASA I-II patients for the study, as they are not much compromised. The average age of the patients in the study groups was approximately 37 years. This can be considered as a limitation of the study, as geriatric and more compromised patients may possibly develop respiratory depression and altered hemodynamics.</p><p>When sedative effects were compared, dexmedetomidine and midazolam at the dosage of 0.04 mg/kg and 0.06 mg/ kg caused an evident sedative effect beginning at the 10<sup>th</sup> minute according to Ramsay and VAS. The sedative effect of midazolam at the dose of 0.02 mg/kg was not adequate, started later, and lasted shorter. Sedative effects of dexmedetomidine and 0.06 mg/kg midazolam were similar until the 30<sup>th</sup> minute and significantly more evident than other groups according to Ramsay and VAS. While the efficacy of dexmedetomidine persisted in the 30<sup>th</sup> minute, the sedative effect of 0.06 mg/kg midazolam decreased. This decrease was suggested to be due to shorter half-life of midazolam. Rosen and colleagues had previously reported similar results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Dexmedetomidine and midazolam at the doses of 0.04 mg/kg and 0.06 mg/kg caused statistically significant differences in Ramsay scores and VAS when compared with baseline values, but the effect was more pronounced in the dexmedetomidine group as compared to midazolam groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p>The limitation of the study is that the number of patients is too small for broad generalizations. Sample size limits the power for subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that dexmedetomidine is an effective agent for preoperative sedation and its administration results with equal or even longer sedation compared to high doses (0.06 mg/kg) of midazolam. It leads to depressive effects on hemodynamic parameters at the dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg, but this effect does not reach the level of severe impairment. It may be suggested that its use normalizes increased blood pressure and HR due to preoperative anxiety. Its effects on respiratory parameters are definitely less than midazolam. We suggest that dexmedetomidine is a safe agent for premedication of non-compromised patients and may also be used outside of the intensive care units.
