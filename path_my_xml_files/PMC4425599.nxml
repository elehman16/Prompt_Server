However, strict blood pressure control may have other beneficial effects beyond reducing risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), such as lowering mortality after ESRD onset. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) trial randomized 840 patients with CKD to strict (mean arterial pressure under 92 mm Hg) versus usual (mean arterial pressure under 107 mm Hg) blood pressure control between 1989&#x02013;1993. Here we extended follow-up of study enrollees by linkage with United States Renal Data System and National Death Index to ascertain ESRD and vital status through 2010. Overall, 627 patients developed ESRD through 2010 with median follow-up of 19.3 years. After ESRD onset, there were 142 deaths in the strict blood pressure arm and 182 deaths in the usual blood pressure arm (significant unadjusted hazard ratio for death 0.72 (95% CI 0.58&#x02013;0.89)). Overall, there were 212 deaths in the strict blood pressure control arm and 233 deaths in the usual arm (significant unadjusted hazard ratio for death 0.82 (95% CI 0.68&#x02013;0.98)). Thus, although strict blood pressure control did not delay progression of CKD to ESRD, this strategy was associated with a lower risk of death after ESRD. Hence, long-term post-ESRD outcomes should be considered when formulating blood pressure targets for CKD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The tremendous morbidity and mortality suffered by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is well known, and the prevalence of ESRD is increasing worldwide.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Given the high mortality rate of patients with ESRD, it is disappointing that numerous interventions--such as normalization of hematocrit,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> delivery of higher doses of dialysis,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> use of high flux hemodialysis membranes,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> or use of calcimimetics<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>--have not improved mortality in this population. The lack of demonstrated benefit from these interventions could be because the underlying disease contributing to high mortality is already established by the time patients reach ESRD.

Given the chronic and progressive nature of kidney disease, early interventions could conceivably improve the overall health status and survival of patients with ESRD, even if such early interventions fail to mitigate progression to ESRD.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we hypothesized that there would be lower risk of mortality after ESRD onset among patients whose blood pressure (BP) was more strictly controlled during the CKD phase of disease. To test this hypothesis, we extended follow-up of participants previously enrolled in Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), the first large randomized trial of strict BP control in CKD, and focused on the effect of strict BP control on risk of death after the onset of ESRD.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">Long-term outcomes of study participants are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.

There were 319 cases of ESRD in the usual BP target arm (incidence 9.9 per 100 person-years) and 308 cases of ESRD in the strict BP target arm (incidence 8.5 per 100 person-years). There was a tendency for patients in the strict BP arm to have lower hazard of ESRD, but this was not statistically significant (unadjusted Cox model hazard ratio [HR] of 0.86 [95% CI 0.73&#x02013;1.001], p = 0.053).</p><p id="P6">Median follow-up time post-ESRD was 10.0 years.

In our primary analysis, the patients randomized to strict BP during CKD had a lower risk of death after onset of ESRD with unadjusted HR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.58&#x02013;0.89, p = 0.003). Similar results were seen in our confirmatory analysis starting the survival analysis at the time of ESRD onset (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.59&#x02013;0.92], p=0.008), adjusting for gender, race, baseline polycystic kidney disease, baseline diabetes, and age at ESRD onset. The risk of death prior to ESRD onset was not statistically significantly different comparing strict to usual BP arms (HR 1.21 [95% CI 0.85&#x02013;1.74], p = 0.29).</p><p id="P7">When deaths were analyzed regardless of ESRD status, risk of death was lower among participants randomized to strict BP control (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.68&#x02013;0.98], p=0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Similar trends were observed for all pre-specified subgroup analyses (data not shown). Tests for interaction between BP arm and proteinuria (p = 0.57) or for interaction between BP arm and GFR by study group (p = 0.60) failed to achieve statistical significance. We also tested for interaction between low protein diet and strict BP interventions (given 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design in MDRD) and found no evidence of interaction in either Study A (p=0.47) or Study B (p=0.12), which is consistent with results of the parent MDRD trial.</p><p id="P8">In exploratory analysis, our results were not affected by controlling for baseline ACE inhibitor use (adjusted HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.59&#x02013;0.91], p = 0.005).

After correcting for potential lead-time differences in ESRD onset, the HR of death post-ESRD remained lower in the strict BP arm (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.60&#x02013;0.95], p = 0.02).</p><p id="P9">In the subset of patients who developed ESRD after 1995 with available data (N = 324, 52%), more patients assigned to the usual BP arm had heart failure (13.1% versus 5.3%, p = 0.02) and coronary artery disease (19.0% versus 8.2%, p=0.004) as registered on the CMS-2728 form at the time of ESRD than patients in the strict BP arm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

To our knowledge, few studies have examined the impact of CKD interventions (including BP control) on post-ESRD outcomes. Virtually all studies of incident ESRD patients to date--such as Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) or Comprehensive Dialysis Study -- begin data collection at or after initiation of dialysis and do not examine what transpired in the years prior to dialysis initiation.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Conversely, studies enrolling patients with CKD (such as the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension [AASK] or the original MDRD study) have generally ended follow-up when ESRD develops, which precludes examination of post-ESRD outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To our knowledge, relating post-ESRD outcomes to interventions received during CKD is a relatively novel paradigm in the study of kidney disease that may shed new light on disease pathogenesis.</p><p id="P11">Our long-term follow-up results regarding reno-protection are consistent with the results of the original MDRD trial and other randomized controlled trials of strict BP control in CKD, including AASK and REIN-2, all of which showed no benefit of strict BP control in retarding progression towards ESRD.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> We also found no difference in deaths prior to ESRD onset, which is in agreement with the results of previous studies.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Our results differ from those of a previous analysis of risk of ESRD and death (prior to ESRD) among MDRD participants during extended follow-up through the end of 2000, but our current study incorporates significantly more follow-up time.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The main feature that distinguishes the current analysis from prior literature is the innovative focus on risk of death post-ESRD.</p><p id="P12">Based largely on the results of trials such as MDRD, AASK, and REIN-2, the Joint National Committee (JNC) guideline panel recently concluded that there is &#x0201c;no benefit in slowing the progression of kidney disease from treatment with antihypertensive drug therapy to a lower BP goal (below 130/80)&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;the evidence is insufficient to determine if there is a benefit in mortality, or cardiovascular or cerebro-vascular health outcomes &#x02026; to a lower BP goal.&#x0201d; <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>16</sup> Accordingly, the updated guidelines liberalized the BP target from 130/80 mm Hg to 140/90 mmHg among patients with CKD.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, perhaps end-points other than retarding CKD progression should be taken into account when formulating guidelines for BP targets for patients with CKD. Other outcomes such as post-ESRD mortality should be considered, as strict BP control may offer a mortality benefit after ESRD onset, even if it does not delay CKD progression.</p><p id="P13">The strength of our study lies in the large number of &#x0201c;hard outcomes,&#x0201d; including both ESRD and deaths during our extended follow-up period. We believe that our approach to studying the long-term impact of an intervention delivered during the CKD phase of disease is relatively novel. Prior studies that have extended follow-up of CKD patients enrolled in interventional trials have not focused on post-ESRD outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Another strength of this study is the use of a randomized controlled trial cohort to study the effect of strict BP control, which reduces bias from unmeasured confounders. Demonstrating a similar association between strict BP control during the CKD phase of disease and reduced mortality post-ESRD in the context of observational studies would be less powerful, given the potential for confounding by imbalances in factors such as differential access to health care, health literacy, and adherence.</p><p id="P14">A limitation in our study is the lack of data on BP control post-trial closure. However, BP separation between the two arms would likely have diminished after the trial ended, which would have biased our results towards the null. The duration of active intervention was relatively short in the parent MDRD trial compared with the duration of our extended follow-up period. However, the long-term impact of trial interventions has been demonstrated in other contexts.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P15">We explored whether the benefit of strict BP control during CKD may be mediated by a reduction in cardiovascular disease at the time of ESRD onset. We found a significantly higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) reported at the time of ESRD onset among patients randomized to the usual BP arm as compared to the strict BP arm. The lower rate of reported CAD and CHF in the subset of patients with available data who were previously exposed to strict BP control suggests that reduction in clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease may be a potential mediator of the lower mortality rates seen post-ESRD. In the subset of patients with available co-morbidities, adjustment for CAD and CHF at the time of ESRD onset appeared to attenuate the association between strict BP control and risk of death post-ESRD, although our ability to evaluate mediation was limited by wide confidence intervals. We were underpowered due to missing data prior to 1995. The CMS-2728 form has been shown to have variable sensitivity but good specificity for the identification of co-morbidities,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> but this lack of sensitivity should be non-differential with respect to previous MDRD BP arm assignment.</p><p id="P16">In conclusion, we found a long-term post-ESRD mortality benefit to a strict (&#x02264;130/80 mm Hg) BP target in patients with CKD during extended follow up of previous MDRD enrollees. This finding, and whether lower post-ESRD mortality stems from improved overall cardiovascular health at incident ESRD, will require further study and confirmation in other settings such as AASK. Our results may not generalize to the entire CKD population, given the unique characteristics of the MDRD cohort, which included primarily Caucasian patients with a high prevalence of polycystic kidney disease and glomerulonephritis as the cause of kidney disease and high rates of transplant and survival post-ESRD. Nevertheless, these data suggest that trials with longer follow-up are needed to understand and assess the potential impact and benefit of interventions implemented during CKD phase of disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Blood pressure intervention in MDRD</title><p id="P17">MDRD was a large 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design randomized controlled trial of the effect of strict BP control and dietary protein restriction on the progression of CKD.
