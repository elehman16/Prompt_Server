Hence, this study was carried out in Indian patients to compare gefitinib with the above-mentioned chemotherapy regimen.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was an open-labelled, randomised, parallel group study comparing gefitinib (250 mg orally daily) with pemetrexed (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and carboplatin (area under the curve 5) doublet intravenous induction chemotherapy regimen followed by maintenance pemetrexed (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in patients with EGFR-activating mutation-positive stage IIIB or stage IV adenocarcinoma lung in the first-line setting. The primary endpoint for the study was PFS. 260 patients were required to demonstrate a 50% improvement in PFS of gefitinib over chemotherapy, with 80% power and 5% type 1 error. With an expected 5% dropout rate, the sample size was 290 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median PFS in gefitinib arm was 8.4 months (95% CI 6.3 to 10.5 months) compared with 5.6 months (95% CI 4.2 to 7.0 months) in pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin arm (HR: 95% CI 0.513 to 0.851; p &#x02212;0.001). The impact of gefitinib on PFS was seen across all subgroups. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two arms. Haematologicalgrade3&#x02013;4toxicities likeanaemia,neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia were common in the pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin arm while grade3&#x02013;4 acneiform rash and diarrhoeawere common in the gefitinib arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study confirms the superiority of gefitinib in prolonging PFS against the most active chemotherapy regimen of pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin followed by maintenance pemetrexed in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma.

Pemetrexed with carboplatin is one of the most active chemotherapy combination regimens for patients with adenocarcinoma histology. The pemetrexed&#x02013;cisplatin regimen prolonged OS as compared with gemcitabine&#x02013;cisplatin in patients with adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Most of the trials that compared TKI with chemotherapy in EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma used a regimen that included either gemcitabine or docetaxel with cisplatin or carboplatin.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;7</xref> LUX-Lung 3 was the only study to compare TKI with the most effective pemetrexed&#x02013;cisplatin combination regimen in patients with EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The patients who were randomised to the chemotherapy arm in the LUX-Lung 3 study received up to six cycles of pemetrexed&#x02013;cisplatin induction chemotherapy (maintenance was not permitted), while the patients randomised to TKI could receive afatinib until progression.</p><p>The PARAMOUNT study demonstrated that in patients with non-squamous NSCLC who have non-progressive disease after induction chemotherapy, maintenance pemetrexed significantly prolongs PFS and OS (median PFS almost doubled from 2.6 to 4.3 months).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Thus, the current standard first-line chemotherapy regimen for a patient with non-squamous NSCLC consists of pemetrexed&#x02013;platinum induction followed by maintenance pemetrexed in patients with no evidence of disease progression (PD). As these results were not available when initial studies with oral TKI were carried out, the comparator arm in these studies would be considered as suboptimal in present era. To the best of our knowledge, no trial has compared the efficacy of an oral TKI with this current standard of pemetrexed&#x02013;platinum induction followed by maintenance pemetrexed in EGFR-mutation-positive adenocarcinoma.</p><p>The Indian subcontinent contributes 23.6% of the world&#x02019;s population and a significant number of patients with lung cancer. Although the initial trials in EGFR-mutation-positive lung cancer were done in the Asian population, patients from the Indian subcontinent were not represented in these studies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 10</xref> Hence, we planned this study to confirm the efficacy and safety of gefitinib in Indian patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-squamous lung cancer compared with pemetrexed with carboplatin induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance pemetrexed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single-centre, phase III, double-arm, parallel-group, open-labelled&#x000a0;exploratory randomised study.

The initial visits at day 7 and day 15 were planned for evaluation of adverse events in pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin in accordance with institutional policy. To have similarity between the two arms and avoid bias even in arm A, patients were seen on same days. At each visit,&#x000a0;the patient&#x02019;s history, physical examination, concurrent medications, adverse events and subjective response were documented. Adverse events were graded according to the common toxicity criteria for adverse events&#x000a0;(CTCAE) V.4.02. Response assessment scans (axial imaging with contrast enhanced CT scans of the thorax and upper abdomen) were performed every 6 weeks for first 12 weeks and then every 8 weeks until objective PD was documented. Additional imaging was performed at the physician&#x02019;s discretion based on the patient&#x02019;s symptomatology or an abnormality in the blood test results. If a lesion was documented beyond thorax and abdomen in the baseline scan, then the body part harbouring the lesion was also included in the subsequent restaging scans except in the case of brain metastasis. In patients with stable brain metastasis at baseline who had received either surgical or radiation treatment for the brain metastasis, routine follow-up MRI of the brain was not performed.

In general, patients who progressed on gefitinib were offered pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin chemotherapy, and patients who progressed on the pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin arm were offered gefitinib, as long as this therapy was deemed appropriate by the treating physician. After the documentation of PD, patients were followed up once every 8 weeks either by direct contact with the patient, the patient&#x02019;s family, the patient&#x02019;s family physician or via telephonic contact.

This included patients who&#x000a0;lost to follow-up or who had withdrawn consent. The PFS for patients who did not undergo any repeat scans after their baseline scan were censored on day 0. Secondary end&#x000a0;points included overall survival (OS) (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause), overall response rate (calculated as per RECIST), adverse events (graded as per CTCAE) and quality of life (scored on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer general and lung specific quality of life forms).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Sample size</title><p>We estimated that to demonstrate a 50% improvement in PFS for gefitinib as compared with pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin, for an HR for progression of 0.48, with 80% power and 5% type 1 error, we needed to enrol 260 patients. With an expected dropout rate of 5%, we planned to enrol 290 patients.

Survival analysis, both PFS and OS, were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The PFS between the two arms was compared using the log rank test. The COX regression analysis was used to estimate the HR with its 95% CI. As an unplanned post hoc exploratory analysis, we tested other factors for their impact on PFS, including age (below 65&#x000a0;years vs 65 years and over), gender (male vs female), smoking status (absent vs present), tobacco use (absent vs present), stage (3B vs 4), presence of brain metastasis, presence of liver metastasis, type of EGFR mutation (exon 19 vs exon 21) and ECOG PS (0&#x02013;1 vs 2). These factors were then tested along with the study arm in a multivariate analysis. A p&#x000a0;value of below 0.05 was considered significant. Forest plot was generated to depict the impact of gefitinib on PFS in the important subgroups. A similar analysis was done for OS. The ORR and toxicities were calculated by simple percentages and the difference in ORR and toxicities between the two arms was compared by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. In addition, descriptive statistics were performed. Continuous variables were expressed in terms of the median along with either range or IQR. Nominal or ordinal variables were expressed in terms of proportion with their respective 95% CI. Data cut-off was on 14 July 2016.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Study oversight</title><p>This was an investigator-initiated study and was approved by the institutional ethics committee.

The median number of interruptions was 1 (IQR 1&#x02013;3). The median time for which gefitinib was on hold during a single interruption was 11 days (IQR 7&#x02013;24 days). The median cumulative length of drug interruption considering all periods of interruption was 14 days (IQR 7&#x02013;27 days).&#x000a0;The reasons for drug interruption included toxicity in 22 patients (81.5%) and non-compliance in 5 patients (18.5%). Toxicities that led to drug interruptions were skin (nine patients), liver (nine patients), diarrhoea (three patients) and myelosuppression (one patient). One patient developed grade 4 thrombocytopaenia from gefitinib; the patient was then treated with off-trial dose reductions. However, grade 4&#x000a0;thrombocytopaenia persisted even after dose reduction to 250 mg once a week, and hence the gefitinib was discontinued. Nine patients (6.2%) required a change in therapy due to intolerable toxicity.</p><p>Patients randomised to arm B received a median of six cycles of pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin (range 0&#x02013;6 cycles). Following the completion of six cycles of induction pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin chemotherapy, 64 patients (44.1%) were eligible for maintenance pemetrexed. Six patients refused maintenance. A median of six cycles of maintenance pemetrexed was delivered (range 1&#x02013;26 cycles). Forty patients (27.6%) had a delay in chemotherapy. The reasons for delay were toxicity in 30 patients and logistic difficulties in 10 patients. Dose reductions were required in pemetrexed alone in five patients and in both pemetrexed and carboplatin in seven patients. The median reduction in the doses of both pemetrexed and carboplatin was 20%. In three patients, following the initial dose reduction, subsequent chemotherapy cycles could be delivered at the reduced dose. In 12 patients (8.3%), treatment had to be changed due to toxicity.</p><p>The worse grade 3&#x02013;4 toxicities are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>. The cumulative incidence of adverse events of any grade in arm A and arm B was 88.3% and 91.7%, respectively (p value 0.434). The pattern of toxicity differed between the two treatment arms. Acneiform rash and diarrhoea were common in arm A while haematological toxicities like anaemia, neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia predominated in arm B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>).

administered for a fixed number of cycles rather than treatment until PD.&#x000a0;The results of our study disproves this hypothesis. In prior studies reported with reversible or irreversible TKIs, the comparator chemotherapy arms were restricted to a maximum of four to six cycles of platinum doublet chemotherapy; maintenance therapy was not permitted.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;7</xref> However, in our study, the comparator arm consisted of induction chemotherapy with six cycles of pemetrexed and carboplatin, followed by continuation maintenance pemetrexed in patients with non-PD. Forty-four per cent of the patients in arm B received continuous treatment. This proportion is lower than that reposted in prior studies of continuous pemetrexed maintenance (57.4%&#x02013;67.3%)) (PARAMOUNT trial- AVAPERL trial).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 14</xref> However, an important difference between our trial and prior maintenance trials was that in our trial, patients were considered for maintenance pemetrexed after six cycles, while in prior studies, induction chemotherapy consisted of four cycles of doublet chemotherapy. In our study, at completion of four cycles of pemetrexed and carboplatin, 70.1% of patients would have been eligible for maintenance pemetrexed. This figure is similar to that reported in other maintenance studies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 14</xref> In keeping with the results reported by Park <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, who reported that six cycles of chemotherapy improved time to progression as compared with four cycles, we planned the comparator arm to consist of six cycles of chemotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy, since PFS was the primary end&#x000a0;point of our study.</p><p>Afatinib has been compared with six&#x000a0;cycles of pemetrexed cisplatin in the LUX-Lung 3 study, and the study yielded similar results to our current study, that is, afatinib led to a longer PFS than pemetrexed&#x02013;platinum.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Afatinib is an irreversible TKI and by virtue of its mechanism of action should have a better efficacy than reversible TKIs like gefitinib. The evidence of such improved efficacy is seen in the LUX-Lung s7 study.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Patients treated with gefitinib had a numerically inferior median OS than patients in the pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin arm, which was opposite to the findings of PFS. Similar findings have been reported in prior studies like the OPTIMAL study in which patients treated with erlotinib had a significantly longer PFS (median 13.1 months) as compared with gemcitabine&#x02013;carboplatin (4.6 months); however, the OS was not statistically different-median OS of 22.8 months for the patients treated with erlotinib versus 27.2 months for the chemotherapy-treated patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is no study that has shown that oral TKI prolongs OS as compared with chemotherapy in EGFR mutation positive patients. The reasons for the apparent lack of effect of TKI on OS may be due to patient crossover and differential treatment received following disease progression in both arms. In our study, a significant proportion of patients in the gefitinib arm did not receive second-line treatment due to various reasons including poor general condition at progression, asymptomatic progression or brain metastasis as the sole site of progression. Our study also highlights the importance of close follow-up in these patients. Patients on treatment in the gefitinib arm were followed up post day 105, every 2 months while patients on pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin arm were followed up at 3 weekly intervals. This close follow-up may have enabled timely interventions in the patients on the pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin arm. Even asymptomatic progression needs intervention in these patients. Both physicians and patients need to be sensitised to the fact that these patients can deteriorate rapidly and if therapy is not started at the time of asymptomatic PD, they may not be fit for further treatment by the time of the next follow-up. This contradicts the current literature which is largely based on retrospective evidence that suggests that asymptomatic progression or progression in sanctuary sites like brain which can be treated with radiation may not necessitate a change in treatment.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref></p><p>The interesting and peculiar finding is the PFS and OS in tobacco chewers versus non-tobacco chewers. Though the relationship of EGFR mutation with smoking status is well known, the impact of tobacco chewing in non-smokers on EGFR mutation status is unknown. In our study though, oral tobacco use was neither an independent prognostic factor affecting PFS or OS.</p><p>Our trial was not without drawbacks.&#x000a0;Our study was performed at a single institution. Patients in the chemotherapy arm did not receive bevacizumab. However,&#x000a0;the use of bevacizumab with chemotherapy in adenocarcinoma is not accepted worldwide as the treatment of choice and a similar practice is followed at our institution. Gefitinib was chosen as the oral TKI rather than erlotinib or afatinib. Theoretically,&#x000a0;erlotinib and afatinib may be more effective than gefitinib in the first-line setting, although evidence is still unclear on the same.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study confirms that gefitinib prolongs PFS compared with the most active chemotherapy regimen of pemetrexed&#x02013;carboplatin in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients.
