upper limb disability of two exercise types performed by patients in the post-
immobilization period of rotator cuff repair. [Subjects and Methods] The intervention
program was performed by 20 patients from 6 weeks after rotator cuff repair. Ten subjects
each were randomly allocated to a group performing open kinetic chain exercise and a group
preforming closed kinetic chain exercise. Muscle activity and median frequency were
measured by using sEMG and the Upper Extremity Function Assessment before and after
conducting the intervention and changes in the results were compared. [Results] There was
a significant within group increases in the activities of the shoulder muscles, except for
the posterior deltoid. The median power frequencies (MFD) of the supraspinatus,
infraspinatus and anterior deltoid significantly increased in the open kinetic chain
exercise group, but that of the posterior deltoid decreased. There were significant
differences in the changes in the upper limb disability scores of the two groups, in the
shoulder muscle activities, except for that of the posterior deltoid, in the comparison of
the change in the muscle activities of the two groups, and in the MDFs of all shoulder
muscles. [Conclusion] The Median power frequencies of all these muscles after closed
kinetic chain exercise increased indicating that muscle fatigue decreased. Therefore,
research into exercise programs using closed kinetic chain exercises will be needed to
establish exercise methods for reducing muscle fatigue.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Closed kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Open kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Rotator cuff</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The shoulder joint has the widest range of motion among joints of the body, and has an
unstable anatomic structure. Also, it has both stability and mobility<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rotator cuff muscles facilitate smooth motions, performing
abduction, and rotation, and generates compressive force in the glenohumeral joint<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, Mechanical damage of the rotator cuff
muscles can be shown by characteristics such as displacement of the shoulder joint,
rotation, formation, tendon sprain, tendon movement, fluid outflow, and failure of energy
conservation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is reported that
tendon rupture of the supraspinatus has the highest incidence among rotator cuff muscle
injuries<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The supraspinatus is
recognized as an important muscle because it provides stability and mobility to the
shoulder, and it is exposed to potential stresses during doing various sports activities or
tasks<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abnormality of kinematic
function is accompanied by shoulder pain, atrophy of the muscles around the shoulder and
severe muscle weakness when such symptoms last<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Arthroscopic repair is often conducted as a
therapeutic method for the rupture of rotator cuff muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and full passive range of motion is regained six weeks after
rotator cuff repair during which the involved part should be fixed and active movement
should be limited to prevent re-injury<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
After rotator cuff repair, fixation of the surgical site changes of contractile forces the
muscles, reducing the muscle activity on the affected side limb<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and fatigue of the surrounding muscles may become more
severe due to traction of the tendon and muscle atrophy with time<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are limits to performing activities of daily living
and keeping maximum contraction of the muscles, and inputs such as proprioception and visual
feedback become damaged<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. When rotator
cuff injury patients perform humeral external rotation, their movement differs from a normal
person&#x02019;s external rotation, and special measures are needed for this<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
this study prescribed open kinetic chain exercise (OKCE) and closed kinetic chain exercise
(CKCE) for humeral external rotation, to recover muscle endurance and weak muscle strength,
at six weeks after rotator cuff repair. Open kinetic chain exercise is an exercise method in
which the proximal part of the joint is fixed and movement of the distal part of the joint
occurs. OKCE plays an important role in strengthening muscles of patients with limitation of
the range of motion<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has the
advantages that movements of the joints are independent and it generates more traction power
and torque than CKCE<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Closed kinetic
chain exercise is an exercise method in which the distal part of the joint is fixed and
movement in only one joint occurs. It provides joint stability by reducing shear force on
the joint. Mechanical receptors react to changes in pressure of the articular capsule,
sensitively, and OKCE helps to facilitate proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have discussed the advantages of open
kinetic chain exercise and closed kinetic chain exercise. However, studies of the muscle
activities after the performance of open kinetic chain exercise have been secondary to
general research on exercises used in the period of protection after rotator cuff repair.
Therefore, this study investigated the effects of open kinetic chain exercise and closed
kinetic chain exercise performed by patients at six weeks after rotator cuff repair. It
investigated the effects on muscle fatigue, upper limb disability, and the muscle activities
of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and anterior deltoid and posterior deltoid muscles that
surround the shoulder. This study was conducted to provide baseline data for the study of
effective exercise methods for rotator cuff repair patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 20 male patients at 6 weeks after receiving rotator cuff repair for
right supraspinatus tendon rupture (grade 2). The subjects were between the ages of 40 and
55, who were treated at M medical institution, located in Jeollanamdo, South Korea, between
January 2016 to March 2016. They had no neurological symptoms or musculoskeletal
disabilities except for the site of the lesion and abnormality. They had no pain in the
right upper limb and hand and no limits on doing exercise, and were able to go to hospital
regularly after hospital discharge. All subjects understood the purpose of this study very
well and agreed to participate in this study voluntarily. This study was approved by
Bioethics Committee of Sehan University Center (IRB) (Approval number: 2015-12).</p><p>Ten subjects each were randomly allocated to a group performing open kinetic chain exercise
(experimental group I) and a group performing closed kinetic chain exercise (experimental
group II). Upper limb disability was evaluated and the muscle activities of the
supraspinatus, infraspinatus, anterior deltoid, and the posterior deltoid and median
frequency (MDF) of the muscles activities were measured using sEMG at pretest and posttest.
The intervention program consisted of 10 exercise performances per set, 3 sets a session,
once a day, four times a week and lasted for three weeks. The changes in upper limb
disability, muscle acitivities, and MDFs were compared between pre- and post-test (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristic of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Items</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group I (n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group II (n=10)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1; SD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.4 &#x000b1; 4.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.8 &#x000b1; 3.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.5 &#x000b1; 7.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.5 &#x000b1; 5.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.3 &#x000b1; 6.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.5 &#x000b1; 7.3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Shapiro-wilk</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).</p><p>Muscle activity and MDF were measured using a 4-channel surface EMG MP 100 system (Biopac,
USA) to measure muscle activity and muscle fatigue. To minimize skin resistance to the EMG
signal, subjects&#x02019; hair was removed from their skin, and dead skin cells were removed using
fine sandpaper. Then, the subjects&#x02019; skin was rubbed with alcohol-soaked cotton and kept in a
clean condition. Two Ag/AgCl surface electrodes were attached to the supraspinatus,
infraspinatus, and the anterior and posterior deltoid muscles<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The values of %RVC and MDF were measured with subjects standing
comfortably with the shoulder flexed at 90 degrees, elbow extension, the lower arm in the
neutral position, and the hand gripping a dynamometer for ten seconds. The data of the six
seconds excluding the first and last two second were used to calculate the mean RMS value
without contraction; then, the mean RMS was were evaluated again, in the same manner but
with maximum voluntary contraction of the hand gripping the dynamometer, to obtain a value
for calculating %RVC. The average MDF was calculated through power spectrum analysis of the
EMG during the maximum voluntary contraction task. Upper limb disability was evaluated using
the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire, which was jointly
developed by The American Orthopedic Association and the Institute for Work &#x00026; Health. It
considers the upper limb as a functional unit, and subjectively judge&#x02019;s the condition of the
upper limb. The DASH questionnaire is composed of 30 questions evaluating movement ability
and higher scores indicate severer disability. This tool has high validity and reliability
and Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of the DASH questionnaire has been reported as 0.94<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All subjects performed stretching of shoulder joint on the affected side before doing
exercise. The open kinetic chain exercise group subjects didn&#x02019;t fix the distal part of the
arm on a supporting surface. They flexed the shoulder at 90 degrees in the standing position
and performed maximum contraction in humeral external rotation. The closed kinetic chain
exercise group subjects performed the exercise in the same position, but with the distal
part of the arm attached to a pressure biofeedback unit, to prevent compensation, with the
intial pressure set to 20 mmHg. After setting the pressure, the subjects fixed the distal
part of arm performed the exercise without exceeding 40 mmHg with all the fingers facing
outward<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise was performed
without inducing pain. After doing exercise, universal physical therapy, icing and TENS were
performed for 15 minutes each.</p><p>SPSS 17.0 for Windows was used for data processing. The Shapiro-Wilk&#x02019;s test was used to
test the normality of the data of the general characteristics of the subjects. The paired
t-test was used to analyze the significance of changes in muscle activity, muscle fatigue
and upper limb disability within the groups, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to
compare the changes in muscle activity, muscle fatigue and upper limb disability between
groups. The significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the intervention, there were significant increases in the muscle activities of the

increase range of motion<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the
protection period continues for a long time, muscle atrophy and muscle fatigue will increase
due to muscle weakness. So, after the protection period, proper exercise is a very important
factor in the improvement of shoulder function of rotator cuff repair patients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study investigated the
changes in the activities of shoulder muscle, fatigue, and upper limb disability of rotator
cuff repair patients after open kinetic chain exercise or closed kinetic chain exercise
performed at the end of the protection period. Jang<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effects of open kinetic chain exercise and closed
kinetic chain exercise at different shoulder angles on 15 normal persons. The infraspinatus
muscle had higher muscle activity than the other muscles in the closed kinetic chain
exercise at 45 degrees group. Tucker et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effects of open kinetic chain exercise and closed
kinetic chain exercise on 15 patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. They measured the
muscle activities of the upper trapezius, middle trapezius, lower trapezius and serratus
anterior muscles. The activity of the upper trapezius was higher than that of the other
muscles in the open kinetic chain exercise group, and the activity of the serratus anterior
muscle was lower in this group. However, all of these muscles showed increased muscle
activities in the closed kinetic chain exercise group. Thus, according to the literature
closed kinetic chain exercise is more effective for patients with diseases related to the
shoulder. This study showed that there were significant increases in the muscle activities
of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and anterior deltoid muscles in the CKCE and OKCE
groups, but there was no significant increase in the activity of the posterior deltoid
muscle. The intervention method in this study was humeral external rotation at shoulder
flexion of 90 degrees significant improvement. This exercise method does not elicit large
activation of the posterior deltoid muscle<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this would explain the lack of significant improvement seen in
this muscle. There were significant increases in the activities of the supraspinatus,
infraspinatus and anterior deltoid muscles, but the activity of the anterior deltoid muscle
in the open kinetic chain exercise group was higher than in the closed kinetic chain
exercise group. This is because the muscle activity would have been higher in OKCE, because
the load on the anterior deltoid muscle is greater as the arm in the open kinetic chain
exercise is not placed against the wall. Gondin et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, reported that the activities of muscles around the surgical site
decrease due to fixation of about six weeks after rotator cuff repair, and change in the
contractile force of the muscles happens. Muscle fatigue increases due to decrease of muscle
strength, and the EMG spectrum and amplitude changes result in a shift in MDF<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. After rotator cuff repair, fatigue
influences the performance of exercise in rehabilitation. This has an important bearing on
the rehabilitation process or clinical course<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. MDF was used as analytic variable in this study.</p><p>When muscle fatigue occurs, H<sup>+</sup> generally accumulates on the muscle fascia due to
a decrease in the conduction velocity of the action potential of muscle fibers and an
increase in lactic acid. The MDF shifts from high frequency to low frequency due to a
decrease in motor neuron excitability, change in the depolarization region, and change in
the Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> ion balance of the muscle fascia<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kang and Moon<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> measured MDF of patients with rotator cuff tear three weeks after
rotator cuff repair. It is said that muscle fatigue is indicated by a shift in MDF from high
frequency to low frequency in muscles around the shoulder. Nevertheless, Portero et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that MDF moving from a high
frequency region to a higher frequency region is closely connected with change in the fast
muscle fibers due to training, and MDF is increased by increase of the intramuscular
conduction velocity, selective recruitment of fast muscle fibers, and increase in the
diameter of muscle fibers resistance to muscle fatigue increases<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shin<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>
studied the effects of 12 weeks of muscle strengthening exercise on 10 healthy men. Five
subjects performed isometric exercise and 5 subjects performed isotonic exercise. She
investigated muscle fatigue after the intervention. MDF increased in both groups and
implying that resistance to muscle fatigue is increased by hypertrophy and steady increases
in recruitment of fast muscle fibers. In the present study, the MDFs of the supraspinatus,
infraspinatus and anterior deltoid muscles increased in both the groups, as well as
resistance to muscle fatigue after the intervention in this study. Muscle fatigue, as
measured by MDF, improved in the posterior deltoid muscle in the open kinetic chain exercise
group, and also improved in the closed kinetic chain exercise group, because of the internal
load on the shoulder joint, but the increase was not statistically significant. Therefore,
it is possible that there would be a significant increase in MDF, if the intervention period
were extended, because the intervention period of 3 weeks was very short in this study.
There were significant differences between the groups in the changes in muscle fatigue of
all the muscles. Especially, resistance to muscle fatigue increased with increase of MDF.
Closed kinetic chain exercise improves the functional ability of the joint through
improvement of muscle function and kinetic change<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that closed kinetic chain exercise is more
effective at improving of muscle endurance because the muscles around the joint cocontract
simultaneously<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the
present study suggest that closed kinetic chain exercise is more effective at decreasing
muscle fatigue than open kinetic chain exercise in patients with shoulder joint disease. It
has been reported that the shoulder function of patients is closely connected with muscle
strength, and increase of muscle strength improves the function of shoulder<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies of muscle strengths
exercise for rotator cuff repair patients have reported improvements in upper limb
disability after conducting various exercise methods, such as a preoperative exercise
program<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, accelerated rehabilitation
exercise<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, and scapular stabilization
exercise<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study both
the CKCE and OKCE groups showed significant decreases in upper limb disability and increase
in upper limb functional activity of the rotator cuff repair patients, but no significant
differences were found between the groups. After surgery, pain decreases and active movement
of the shoulder joint is possible. Therefore, it is possible that the absence of significant
differences was due to the fact that patients&#x02019; activities of daily living couldn&#x02019;t be
controlled. Future research should investigate the effects of exercise performed at various
angles of the shoulder joint, since it is possible that a significant difference in the
function of the upper limb might be found between the CKCE and OKCE groups. In the present
study, both types of exercise were effective at increasing the activities of the muscles
around the shoulder as well as muscle endurance to fatigue increased, as evidenced by an
increase in MDF in all the muscles, after conducting closed kinetic chain exercise.
Therefore, closed kinetic chain exercise as intervention for muscle fatigue due to muscle
atrophy should be used more than open kinetic chain exercise. On the basis of the present
result, further studies of exercise programs using closed kinetic chain exercise will be
needed to find exercise methods which decrease muscle fatigue after rotator cuff repair.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Sehan University Research Fund in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name><name><surname>Warner</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group>: Review of sports medicine and arthroscopy.
