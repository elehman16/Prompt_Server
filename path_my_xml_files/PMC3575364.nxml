Up to now, there is no generally accepted view how these phantom sounds come about, and also no efficient treatment. Patients are turning to complementary or alternative medical therapies, such as acupuncture. Based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, acupoints located on both the adjacent and distal area of the disease can be needled to treat disease. Furthermore, the way of combining acupoints is for strengthening the curative effect. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture at local points in combination with distal points in subjective tinnitus patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>This trial is a randomized, single-blind, controlled study. A total of 112 participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups receiving acupuncture treatment for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure is subjective tinnitus loudness and annoyance perception, which is graded using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The assessment is at baseline (before treatment initiation), 4 weeks after the first acupuncture session, and 8 weeks after the first acupuncture session.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Completion of this trial will help to identify whether acupuncture at local acupoints in combination with distal acupoints may be more effective than needling points separately.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register: ISRCTN29230777</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Tinnitus</title><p>Subjective tinnitus is a frequent auditory sensation (for example, a tone, hissing, or buzzing sound, and sometimes combinations of such perceptions) experienced in the absence of an external or internal acoustic stimulus. An estimated prevalence in the adult population across studies is about 10% to 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], where 1% to 3% of the population has severe, distressing tinnitus. Among severe sufferers, tinnitus causes disability associated with concentration deficits, hypersensitivity to sounds, anxiety, depression, irritability, agitation, and insomnia. Often a combination of several complaints could disrupt daily activities and has a negative impact on quality of life. It represents a worldwide major healthcare problem with an enormous social and economic demand for therapeutic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Pharmacotherapy (antidepressants, benzodiazepines), cognitive therapies, or electronic devices that try to cancel the tinnitus have all been tried either separately or in combination but the success rate is not high. Attempts to develop evidence-based therapies have been thwarted by a poor understanding of the pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Increasingly, patients are turning to complementary and alternative medical therapies. Acupuncture is among the most popular.</p></sec><sec><title>Acupuncture</title><p>Acupuncture has been used to treat tinnitus for a long time. Neuroscience studies related the effects of acupuncture to neuronal stimulus, activation of endogenous opioid mechanisms and neuropeptides which stimulate specific brain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It has been reported that acupuncture can yield immediate relief, both from the loudness and the disturbing quality of tinnitus, significant improvement in quality of life, less tension, and better sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, an analysis of six randomized clinical trials of acupuncture for tinnitus failed to demonstrate any efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), acupoints located on both the adjacent and distal area of the disease can be needled to treat disease. Furthermore, the way of combining these acupoints is often used for strengthening the curative effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture at local points in combination with distal points in subjective tinnitus patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We perform the study according to common guidelines for clinical trials (Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)/WHO Good Clinical Practice standards (GCP) including certification by an external audit).

Completion of this trial will help to identify whether acupuncture at local acupoints in combination with distal acupoints may be more effective than needling points separately.</p><p>It is hoped that this study will encourage renewed interest in acupuncture&#x02019;s potential for treating people with tinnitus. Recent researches have created a climate where acupuncture might be assumed to be ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, there is as yet inadequate evidence on which to base a judgment on acupuncture&#x02019;s effectiveness for tinnitus. Well-designed randomized controlled trials where patients are representative of people with tinnitus in the general population are needed.</p><p>In this study, the side-effects of acupuncture will be reported by patients. Several large surveys have also provided evidence that acupuncture is a relatively safe treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The results could also provide consumers with information about viable choices. If acupuncture is demonstrated to be effective and safety in tinnitus, there may be a number of patients with these conditions who seek out acupuncture rather than pharmacotherapy.</p><p>Patients are informed in a manner suggesting that two different types of acupuncture treatment were compared. One type is traditional, another is new, and the effect of both is uncertain, not mentioning terms such as &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; or &#x02018;sham&#x02019;. Similar strategies of informed consent have been used in most previous acupuncture trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>However, our study has several limitations. Deciding on an appropriate control procedure for clinical studies on acupuncture is a particular challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Previous randomized, controlled trials of acupuncture suggest that needling of acupoints is as effective as non-points, in particular for pain releif, although both interventions were more effective than a waiting list control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Few guidelines exist, however, for identifying appropriate sham point locations; the depth, direction, and duration of needle insertion; or the need for needle stimulation. In the present study, physicians were instructed to avoid manual stimulation of the needles and provocation of Deqi at non-acupuncture points. However, we cannot rule out that this intervention may have some physiological effects.</p><p>One limitation concerns the fact that this is a single-center study. It does not lend the results to great generalizability to more diverse sets of patients in more diverse settings. Our directed acupuncture treatment is uniformly applied, and adjunctive therapies are not used. In addition, acupuncturists in diverse settings with different philosophies, backgrounds, training, and clinical experiences might have chosen different technique for the directed acupuncture intervention. Therefore, the external validity can be somewhat hard to achieve. But we ensure that the risk of contamination between groups will be minimized, while maintaining the integrity of the experimental group comparison. As a result, whether the findings can be generalized to the clinical setting is unclear and more work is needed.</p><p>Another limitation is that the therapist is not blinded in the present trial. A blinded study of acupuncture is challenging to conduct because it is almost impossible to blind acupuncturists to the treatments they are delivering. This study does not allow us to determine whether the observed effectiveness is due to placebo effects, intensity of provider contact, or a physiologic effect of needling. Therefore, a bias due to unblinding cannot be ruled out. In addition, the sample size in the present study is relatively small.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently in recruitment phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CZL conceived of the study and prepared the initial protocol.
