Household air pollution (HAP) resultant from cooking indoors with biomass fuels on traditional stoves is a significant risk factor for pneumonia, while consumption of contaminated drinking water is a primary cause of diarrheal disease. To date, there have been no large-scale effectiveness trials of programmatic efforts to provide either improved cookstoves or household water filters at scale in a low-income country. In this paper we describe the design of a cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the impact of a national-level program to distribute and promote the use of improved cookstoves and advanced water filters to the poorest quarter of households in Rwanda.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We randomly allocated 72 sectors (administratively defined units) in Western Province to the intervention, with the remaining 24 sectors in the province serving as controls. In the intervention sectors, roughly 100,000 households received improved cookstoves and household water filters through a government-sponsored program targeting the poorest quarter of households nationally. The primary outcome measures are the incidence of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea among children under five years of age. Over a one-year surveillance period, all cases of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea identified by health workers in the study area will be extracted from records maintained at health facilities and by community health workers (CHW). In addition, we are conducting intensive, longitudinal data collection among a random sample of households in the study area for in-depth assessment of coverage, use, environmental exposures, and additional health measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although previous research has examined the impact of providing household water treatment and improved cookstoves on child health, there have been no studies of national-level programs to deliver these interventions at scale in a developing country. The results of this study, the first RCT of a large-scale programmatic cookstove or household water filter intervention, will inform global efforts to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality from diarrheal disease and pneumonia.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Clinicaltrials.gov" id="intref0010">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02239250).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cluster randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Rwanda</kwd><kwd>Improved stoves</kwd><kwd>Acute respiratory infection</kwd><kwd>Household water treatment</kwd><kwd>Diarrhea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwrds0015"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>ARI, acute respiratory infection</kwd><kwd>CHW, community health worker</kwd><kwd>DBSS, dried blood spot samples</kwd><kwd>HAP, household air pollution</kwd><kwd>H-PEM, Harvard Personal Exposure Monitor</kwd><kwd>ICCM, Integrated Community Case Management of Childhood Illness</kwd><kwd>IMCI, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness</kwd><kwd>MFI, mean fluorescence intensity</kwd><kwd>MOH, Rwanda Ministry of Health</kwd><kwd>MOLG, Rwandan Ministry of Local Government</kwd><kwd>RCT, randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Environmental contamination at the household level is a major cause of death and disease among rural populations in low-income countries. Household air pollution (HAP) contributes to acute lower respiratory infection in children under five, and among adults is a significant risk factor for hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Unsafe drinking water is the leading cause of diarrheal disease <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. HAP and unsafe drinking water rank 7th and 8th among risk factors for the global burden of disease <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Collectively, pneumonia and diarrhea are responsible for an estimated 6.9 million deaths annually <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">These environmental hazards are common among impoverished rural inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa, the vast majority of whom cook with biomass fuels on traditional stoves and rely on unsafe water supplies <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In Rwanda, where more than half the population is living below the poverty line and more than a third in extreme poverty, 98.1% of rural householders cook with biomass, mainly on open three-stone fires; and only 7.6% have water on their premises <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. After HIV/AIDS, the leading causes of death in Rwanda are ALRI (20%) and diarrhea (12%) <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Despite clear evidence that HAP is an important risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular disease, evidence for the health impact of improved cookstoves that can be deployed at scale among vulnerable populations is limited <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Although trials are currently underway to explore the effectiveness of various improved cookstove types, these are all limited scale efficacy trials <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Further, doubts about the potential of any biomass stove to achieve WHO indoor air quality targets have shifted much of the focus to clean cooking fuels such as LPG, ethanol and electricity, although supply chain limitations currently render these options impractical in most rural settings <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">There is strong evidence that household-based water filters are effective in preventing diarrhea <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The actual protective effect, however, is likely to vary by setting, season, and the extent to which water is a dominant transmission pathway. As evidence also suggests that even occasional consumption of untreated water vitiates the potential health impact, correct and consistent use is essential <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The up-front cost of household filters, together with the need to establish supply chains for consumables, has limited the extent to which they have been scaled up among vulnerable populations, particularly in rural settings. Like improved cookstoves, there has been no large-scale effectiveness trial to assess the impact of household water filters promoted programmatically.</p><p id="p0030">In an effort to reduce the disease burden in rural Rwanda, the Rwanda Ministry of Health (MOH) partnered with the social enterprise DelAgua Health to distribute and promote the use of improved cookstoves and advanced water filters to the poorest 25% of households nationally, beginning in Rwanda's Western Province. The project, know as &#x0201c;<italic>Tubeho Neza</italic>&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Live Well&#x0201d;, earns revenue through carbon credits under the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a program authorized by the Kyoto Protocol that provides credits to the implementer based on a formula that includes population coverage and use <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p id="p0035">Prior to initiation of the <italic>Tubeho Neza</italic> program, the implementer first undertook a pilot intervention to all 1943 households in 15 rural villages <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. At this time we conducted a five-month RCT among 566 households in three of these pilot villages to assess the impact of the water filter on fecal indicator bacteria in household drinking water and the impact of the stove on fine particulate mater (PM2.5) in reported cooking areas <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Overall, the intervention was associated with a 97.5% reduction in mean fecal indicator bacteria (Williams means 0.5 vs. 20.2 TTC/100&#x000a0;mL, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;. .001) and a 48% reduction of 24-h PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in the cooking area (0.485 mg/m3 and 0.267 mg/m3, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005). The reduction was 37% for those cooking indoors (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.08) and 73% for those cooking outdoors (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p id="p0040">Based on the results from the pilot study, the Rwanda MOH and the implementer elected to proceed with the roll out of the intervention throughout Western Province. However, due to funding constraints, only approximately 100,000 of the 140,000 eligible households in Western Province could be included in the initial implementation. Consequently, it was decided that receipt of the program would initially be limited to households within randomly allocated sectors (groups of villages that generally correspond with catchment areas for primary-care clinics) within Western Province, with the remainder of households scheduled to receive the program the following year. This provided us the unique opportunity to conduct a population-level RCT to assess the impact of the program on health outcomes using records maintained at health facilities and by community health workers (CHW). In addition, we randomly selected a representative sample of households (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1580) in the control and intervention areas to conduct intensive data collection in order to assess coverage, use, environmental exposures, and additional health outcome measures.

The Western Province is 87.8% rural, and the main source of energy for cooking is firewood (88.6%), followed by charcoal (8.3%). Most households in Western Province report their main source of water is from protected sources (26.8% public tap, 39.8% protected spring/well, 4.5% piped water on premises), although 16.3% of households obtain from an unprotected spring/well and 9.4% from surface water <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Map of the study area.

This nested design permits examination of outcomes in addition to those maintained in health records, such as intervention uptake and use and the effect of the intervention on exposure to HAP and fecally contaminated drinking water. It also permits us to collect self-reported information on respiratory disease and diarrhea (to learn about cases that may not be reported to CHWs and clinics) and to assess a variety of objective measures related to health status (e.g. blood pressure, oximetry, inflammatory biomarkers, enteric pathogen antibodies) among household members. We refer to this intensive data collection in a sample of the larger RCT population as the &#x0201c;village-level&#x0201d; study in sections to follow in order to differentiate these efforts from the primary assessment of outcomes across the entire study population.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="p0060">All households in Western Province designated as <italic>Ubudehe</italic> category 1 or 2 were eligible to receive the intervention from the implementer. <italic>Ubudehe</italic> category is a government-defined household economic status classification and <italic>Ubudehe</italic> categories 1 and 2 roughly constitute the poorest 25% of the country. <italic>Ubudehe</italic> category is determined by community members based on classifications outlined by the Rwandan Ministry of Local Government (MOLG), and households categorized as <italic>Ubudehe</italic> 1 and 2 receive free medical and other assistance through government programs <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

Prior to sampling for the village-level study, we estimated the number of eligible households in each village in Western Province using data provided by the Rwandan government and other sources. To ensure that a sufficient number of eligible households were present in each primary sampling unit (PSU), each village in the study area containing fewer than 12 eligible households was randomly paired with a geographically contiguous village in an iterative process using geographic information system software. This yielded 2715 PSUs, of which 2080 consisted of single villages and the remaining 635 were composed of groups of two or more geographically adjacent villages. We then conducted probability proportional to size random sampling of PSUs, stratified by treatment allocation.

Baseline data analysis will be conducted to characterize the study population and examine imbalances between treatment arms. The incidence of health center/CHW reported diarrhea and ARI in the control and intervention sectors will be compared using random-effects Poisson regression to account for the sector-level clustering and models will be adjusted for stratified randomization by district <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The effect of the intervention on the prevalence of caregiver-reported diarrhea and ARI in the village-level cohort will be assessed with mixed-effects log-binomial regression. Secondary outcomes from the village-level study will analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with the appropriate link function and distribution family (e.g. negative binomial for TTC counts). Analyses of the village-level sample will be adjusted for the multiple levels of clustering resulting from the study design. Analysis of secondary outcomes from the intensive data collection households will be conducted on an intention to treat basis, with per protocol sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.11"><label>2.11</label><title>Ethics and trial registration</title><p id="p0230">The study has been reviewed by the Ethics Committee of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Institutional Review Board of Emory University, and the Rwanda National Ethics Committee. This trial is registered with Clinical <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Trials.gov" id="intref0015">Trials.gov</ext-link> (Registration No. NCT02239250).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0235">This research seeks to build on prior and existing research in multiple ways. First, previous and ongoing trials of HAP are smaller-scale, research-driven efficacy studies designed to assess the impact of improved cook stoves under controlled conditions. Our study is an effectiveness trial&#x02014;a health impact evaluation of an intervention as actually delivered at scale. Though our results should be limited to the setting in which it is being delivered, they should be representative of what can be expected when the intervention is delivered programmatically.</p><p id="p0240">Second, because <italic>Tubeho Neza</italic> program is funded through revenue earned through the generation and sale of carbon credits, it creates a mechanism for the free distribution of improved stoves and advanced water filters on a large scale. While both stoves and filters have at least a 3-year useful life, they have a comparatively high up-front cost (estimated $35 for stoves and $40 for filters by the time they reach households) that has limited the potential for governments and others to distribute them without charge to remote populations. High levels of coverage in a given population may increase the protective effect of the intervention by reducing the overall exposure of air pollution and fecal contamination in the community. This may also translate into a protective effect on non-adopters&#x02014;a type of &#x0201c;herd immunity&#x0201d; that has been postulated but not shown by these environmental interventions.</p><p id="p0245">Third, because carbon credits are awarded on the basis of intervention use and not just coverage, the implementer has a strong incentive to optimize use. Such pay-for-performance programs may address stove &#x0201c;stacking&#x0201d;&#x02014;the continued use of traditional stoves together with the intervention stove&#x02014;a well-known problem with improved stove interventions <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. They may also increase adherence of household water treatment that is necessary to achieve health benefits <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Careful monitoring of actual use in the village-level sub-study, using self-reports as well as remotely monitored sensors, should provide strong evidence of patterns of use over the one-year follow up period.</p><p id="p0250">Fourth, this is the first study evaluating the health effects of a large-scale intervention that combines improved cook stoves and household water treatment. In this way, the intervention is addressing pneumonia and diarrhea, the two major killers of young children both in Rwanda and many other low-income countries.</p><p id="p0255">Fifth, while the LifeStraw 2.0 water filter used in this program meets the WHO's &#x0201c;most protective&#x0201d; standards <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, the EcoZoom stove falls below the Tier 3 performance level recommended by the Global Alliance for Clean Cooking and others. In fact, very few biomass stoves meet this standard; what is required is the use of clean fuels such as LPG or electricity <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Evidence on the performance level of stoves that is necessary to achieve any health gains is still somewhat limited, however, and modeling does suggest that biomass stoves&#x02014;especially those that are portable and can be used out-of-doors&#x02014;are capable of reducing exposure to levels associated with improvements in health <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. By assessing personal level exposure and health outcomes in the village-level sub-study, we hope to add additional data points on the dose-response curve and help determine whether biomass stoves&#x02014;the only choice that is available to remote populations that are beyond the supply chain for clean fuels&#x02014;can not only reduce expenditures for fuel and green house gas emissions, but also prevent disease.</p><p id="p0260">Finally, our study methods combine a large-scale trial at the clinical catchment level with a nested trial at the village level. This allows us to use clinic-based diagnoses of primary and secondary outcomes, avoiding some of the bias associated with self-reported conditions and focusing on the more serious cases that present at clinics. At the same time, the village-level sub-study allows us to carefully document coverage and use of the intervention, as well as their impact on exposure to HAP and fecally contaminated drinking water.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0265">This study is funded by DelAgua Health, a for-profit company that implements the intervention in Rwanda in conjunction with the Rwanda Ministry of Health.
