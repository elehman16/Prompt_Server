A sulfonylurea or insulin is commonly added to metformin as a second step (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although initially effective, sulfonylurea treatment is associated with poor glycemic durability (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), weight gain, and hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Dapagliflozin is the first in a novel class of glucose-lowering medications, the selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These agents reduce glucose reabsorption from the proximal tubule of the kidney, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion with resulting net caloric loss (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This effect depends on baseline glycemic control and the renal filtration rate but is independent of insulin. Consequently, reduction in plasma glucose with dapagliflozin reduces the glucose load filtered by the kidney and limits further glucose excretion, suggesting that dapagliflozin may possess a low intrinsic propensity for hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Dapagliflozin might thus provide an alternative to existing add-on therapies by improving glycemic control without associated weight gain or hypoglycemic risk.</p><p>Recent placebo-controlled clinical trials of 24-weeks&#x02019; duration have shown promise for dapagliflozin as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and as add-on therapy in patients inadequately controlled with metformin (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), but longer-term head-to-head trials comparing dapagliflozin with established therapies are required. The current study directly tested the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dapagliflozin against glipizide during a treatment period of 52 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a 52-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, phase III, noninferiority trial with a 156-week extension period conducted from 31 March 2008 and ongoing at 95 sites in 10 countries: Argentina, 17 centers; France, 7; Germany, 16; U.K., 12; Italy, 3; Mexico, 4; the Netherlands, 10; South Africa, 10; Spain, 6; and Sweden, 10.

Once patients were stabilized, no further changes in the metformin dose were allowed. All patients received dietary and lifestyle advice commencing from the start of the dose-stabilization period.</p><p>After a 2-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive double-blind treatment with dapagliflozin or glipizide. All patients commenced treatment at dosage level 1, which was dapagliflozin at 2.5 mg or glipizide at 5 mg. During an 18-week period and at 21-day intervals, patients were up-titrated to the next dosage level if FPG was &#x02265;6.1 mmol/L. Level 2 was dapagliflozin at 5 mg or glipizide at 10 mg, and level 3 was dapagliflozin at 10 mg or glipizide at 20 mg. Up-titration continued until the maximum tolerable dose level was reached.

Major hypoglycemia was defined as a symptomatic episode requiring external assistance due to severely impaired consciousness or behavior, with capillary or plasma glucose levels of 54 mg/dL (&#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L) and recovery after glucose or glucagon administration. Minor hypoglycemia was defined as a symptomatic episode with capillary or plasma glucose levels of 63 mg/dL (&#x0003c;3.5 mmol/L), irrespective of the need for external assistance, or an asymptomatic episode with capillary or plasma glucose levels of 63 mg/dL (&#x0003c;3.5 mmol/L) that did not qualify as a major episode.

Absolute changes from baseline to week 52 for seated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and percent changes from baseline to week 52 for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were assessed.</p><p>Safety and tolerability was assessed by collating data on adverse events (AEs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 12.1), hypoglycemic events, laboratory tests, calculated creatinine clearance, urinary glucose/creatinine ratio, electrocardiographic and physical examinations, and vital signs. In addition, patients were actively questioned at each study visit to assess signs, symptoms, and reports suggestive of genital infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs). These responses, and those obtained spontaneously, were categorized in the database using a predefined list of MedDRA terms suggestive of genital infections and UTIs.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A hierarchic closed-testing procedure was used to control the type I error rate across the primary and key secondary end points at the 0.05 level (two-sided). Thus, if noninferiority was established for the primary end point at a one-sided 0.025 significance level, then key secondary end point testing for superiority could proceed in the sequence described previously. If the first key secondary end point was significant at a two-sided 0.05 significance level, then the second secondary end point could be evaluated, and so forth.</p><p>The primary and continuous key secondary and exploratory end points were evaluated using ANCOVA, with treatment as the fixed effect and baseline value as the covariate, to derive a least squares estimate of the treatment difference in mean change with corresponding two-sided 95% CI. Proportions were analyzed using logistic regression with adjustment for baseline values as described by Zhang et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Statistical noninferiority of dapagliflozin versus glipizide was established if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline to week 52 was &#x0003c;0.35% (noninferiority margin). For graphic presentation of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and TBW over the 52-week treatment period, the change from baseline (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) was analyzed at each interval using ANCOVA with treatment as the fixed effect and baseline value as the covariate. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze time to onset of patient discontinuation because of poor glycemic control.</p><p>Two analysis sets were defined: the safety analysis set, consisting of all patients who received one or more doses of the investigational product, and the full analysis set, consisting of all randomized patients who received one or more doses of the investigational product and who had a nonmissing baseline and one or more postbaseline efficacy value for one or more efficacy variable. Primary, key secondary, and exploratory end points were analyzed using the full analysis set. Missing values at week 52 were replaced using the LOCF method.</p><p>Prespecified safety analyses, including events suggestive of genital infection and UTI, were performed using descriptive statistics for the safety analysis set. A post hoc exploratory analysis of risk differences for the proportions of patients reporting events suggestive of genital infections and of UTIs were performed using Fisher exact tests.

About half of the genital events were recurrent, whereas most of the lower UTIs were single episodes. Except for three patients, all events were reported as mild or moderate in intensity.

Dapagliflozin-induced glucose excretion remained elevated and constant from week 12 to 52, showing no sign of diminished activity during this period (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0606/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. A3</ext-link>).

No changes in bilirubin, heart rate, or in the proportions of patients experiencing orthostatic hypotension were noted (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0606/-/DC1">Supplementary Table A5</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s21"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In the context of a dose-titration scheme designed to optimize efficacy and minimize hypoglycemic episodes with glipizide, this head-to-head comparison study demonstrated that the novel SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin produced a long-term HbA<sub>1c</sub> mean reduction at 52 weeks that was numerically identical and statistically noninferior to the sulfonylurea glipizide in patients poorly controlled with metformin monotherapy. This comparable long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin with a sulfonylurea, considered potent glucose-lowering agents (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), was achieved with &#x0003e;10-fold fewer hypoglycemic episodes along with sustained weight loss. In contrast, weight increased and hypoglycemic episodes were more frequent with glipizide.</p><p>The pattern of HbA<sub>1c</sub> change over time was substantially different between dapagliflozin and glipizide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). The pattern with glipizide&#x02014;rapid initial response, followed by gradual increase&#x02014;is typical of that observed with sulfonylureas (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In contrast, dapagliflozin response was initially smaller during titration but thereafter was sustained during the maintenance period such that it was identical to glipizide response at 52 weeks. It is interesting to speculate whether the durability of HbA<sub>1c</sub> control with dapagliflozin will outlast that of glipizide during longer-term follow-up of these patients. In this population with a relatively low baseline mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0223c;7.7%), clinically meaningful reductions of &#x0003e;0.5% were achieved by both agents. A higher baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>, as observed in other clinical efficacy studies of antidiabetic agents, generally predicts larger drops in response to treatment, whichever agent is tested (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Weight loss with dapagliflozin was progressive during the first 6 months and stabilized during the latter half of the study. This may have resulted from glucosuria-induced fat loss, fluid loss associated with osmotic diuresis, or a combination of both. Studies of body composition are underway to assess the relative contributions of fat and fluid loss to the changes in TBW observed with dapagliflozin.</p><p>Dapagliflozin reduced blood pressure. The mechanism for this effect is unclear but may involve osmotic diuresis or sodium loss. Although modest rises in hematocrit and blood urea nitrogen occurred, no meaningful changes were noted in electrolytes, serum creatinine, heart rate, or proportions of patients experiencing orthostatic hypotension to indicate dehydration. The estimated glomerular filtration rate and concentrations of cystatin-C did not show meaningful changes. In addition, AEs of renal impairment or failure&#x02014;excluding those of decrease in creatinine clearance calculated using current body weight values at each study visit&#x02014;were not over-represented with dapagliflozin. Taken together, these data suggest that dapagliflozin treatment was not associated with clinically relevant dehydration or impairment in kidney function.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk of fungal genital infections and UTIs compared with the general population (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Dapagliflozin-treated patients, especially women, reported an increase in events suggestive of genital infections and lower UTIs compared with glipizide-treated patients. For conservative pharmacovigilance purposes with this first-in-class agent, events suggestive of genital infection and UTI were reported spontaneously and in response to questions proactively posed to patients that were related to the signs and symptoms of these infections. Not all of these suggestive events could be confirmed as infections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Variable reports of these events have been noted in previous studies with dapagliflozin (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); hence, further analyses using pooled data are required to better evaluate potential risk factors for genital and UTIs with SGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin.</p><p>In conclusion, this head-to-head comparison of dapagliflozin versus glipizide added to metformin in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy demonstrated similar glycemic efficacy at 52 weeks but markedly divergent effects on weight and hypoglycemia. Whereas glipizide treatment led to weight gain and more hypoglycemic episodes, dapagliflozin produced significant weight loss and significantly fewer hypoglycemic episodes. Dapagliflozin treatment was generally safe and well tolerated, but events suggestive of genital and lower UTIs were observed more frequently in this study. Dapagliflozin is a potential valuable alternative to sulfonylureas as add-on therapy when metformin monotherapy fails to maintain adequate glycemic control.</p></sec>
