for long periods and the risk of physical therapy (PT) for such patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Participants were selected from patients who were hospitalized at a designated
medical long-term care sanatorium. The participants were divided into 5 groups (A&#x02013;E)
depending on their mode of energy intake and ambulatory ability during PT. The serum
albumin level, energy intake, total daily energy expenditure, and total daily energy
expenditure per session of PT (EEPT) were evaluated for each group. [Results]
Protein-energy malnutrition was observed in 69.6% of the participants. No significant
association was identified between the serum albumin level and body mass index. Energy
intake was significantly higher in Groups D and E, whose energy intake was via ingestion,
than in Groups A and B, whose intake was via tube feeding. EEPT was highest in patients of
Group E who had gait independence different from the ability of those in groups A&#x02013;D.
[Conclusion] The actual energy intake is lower with tube feeding than with ingestion. Risk
management and energy intake should be revisited in elderly patients who have been
hospitalized for long periods and subsequently obtain gait independence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Malnutrition</kwd><kwd>Long hospitalization period</kwd><kwd>Energy balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During 2005&#x02013;2006, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare declared that all
designated medical long-term care sanatoriums be abolished by March 2011. However, in 2011,
the ministry postponed the term until March 2017 because it was difficult to transfer
elderly patients and those whose conditions were severe to long-term care health facilities
in order to obtain medical treatment. This suggests that there is an increasing number of
elderly patients in Japan, a nation with an aging population, who require long-term
hospitalization. This in turn results in increasing demands for physical therapy (PT) and
medical care in the chronic phase to treat underlying diseases and complications<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The type of PT required in the chronic phase differs from that required during other
disease phases considering the nutritional status of the patient. However, limited attention
has been given to nutritional assessment, including blood tests, during the chronic phase,
which warrants consideration when elderly patients who are hospitalized for long periods are
prescribed PT. A recent study reported that 40&#x02013;50% of community-dwelling elderly patients
who qualified for long-term care insurance in Japan were malnourished<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>; additionally, almost 60% of elderly patients in hospitals
may be malnourished<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a previous study, protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) was observed in 20&#x02013;70% of patients
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 50% of post-stroke patients, and 12&#x02013;50% of
patients with dementia<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Malnutrition is
known to greatly influence patient prognosis, development of pressure ulcers, and
rehabilitation outcomes<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, for elderly patients in the chronic phase of a disease,
PT should be indicated in consideration of the patient&#x02019;s nutritional status. However,
limited knowledge is available regarding the relationship between nutritional status and PT
during the chronic phase of a disease.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to understand what nutritional status-related factors should
be considered when elderly patients who are hospitalized for long periods are treated with
PT. We evaluated the serum albumin level, energy intake, total daily energy expenditure
(TEE), and energy expenditure per session of PT (EEPT), which reflects ambulatory ability
during PT and the mode of nutrient intake, such as ingestion or tube feeding, which is a
factor associated with inadequate nutrition intake<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Participants (34 female and 11 male; age: 80.0 &#x000b1; 9.1 and 83.0 &#x000b1; 7.3&#x02005;years, respectively)
were selected from among patients who were hospitalized at the Mizuho-kai Ogawa Hospital (a
designated medical long-term care sanatorium) and were treated with PT during August
2012.</p><p>The participants were divided into 5 groups. Group A consisted of 8 patients (80.9 &#x000b1;
8.1&#x02005;years) whose nutrition intake was via tube feeding and who underwent PT while they were
bed-ridden. Group B consisted of 11 patients (78.0 &#x000b1; 8.9&#x02005;years) whose nutrition intake was
via tube feeding and who underwent PT in the sitting position. Group C consisted of 11
patients (85.4 &#x000b1; 7.9&#x02005;years) whose nutrition intake was via ingestion and who underwent PT in
the sitting position. Group D consisted of 9 patients (80.2 &#x000b1; 9.6&#x02005;years) whose nutrition
intake was via ingestion and who underwent PT in the form of gait exercise but did not have
gait independence. Group E consisted of 6 patients (78.3 &#x000b1; 9.0&#x02005;years) whose nutrition intake
was via ingestion and who underwent PT in the form of gait exercise and had gait
independence.</p><p>This study was cross-sectional in nature, approved by the human research ethics committee
of the Mizuho-kai Ogawa hospital, and conducted in accordance with the guidelines proposed
in the Declaration of Helsinki. This investigation was performed in cooperation with a
dietitian in the hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>Malnutrition, energy intake, TEE, and EEPT were evaluated using the following method. The
body mass index (BMI) and serum albumin levels were used as indices of malnutrition. For the
purpose of this study, a serum albumin level below 3.5&#x02005;g/dl or BMI below
18.5&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> was considered to indicate malnutrition. Energy intake was estimated
using medical records compiled by a dietitian in the hospital every day. TEE was evaluated
by using the Harris Benedict equation for a single day. EEPT was estimated using the
following formula: energy expenditure value (kcal/kg/min) &#x000d7; body weight (kg) &#x000d7; duration of
activity during PT (20 or 40 minutes) &#x000d7; correction factor. We presumed that the energy
expenditure value in the Japanese would be lower than that in Caucasians owing to
differences in height and weight; therefore, the energy expenditure value reported in the
Omori study was used as a reference to calculate energy expenditure during activities of
daily living among the Japanese patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the &#x0201c;energy balance without PT-associated energy load&#x0201d;
was calculated by subtracting the TEE from the energy intake, and the &#x0201c;energy balance with
PT-associated energy load&#x0201d; was calculated by subtracting the EEPT from the &#x0201c;energy balance
without PT-associated energy load.&#x0201d;</p><p>Differences between groups in terms of TEE, energy intake, EEPT, and energy balance with
and without PT-associated energy load were analyzed based on the one-way analysis of
variance using the SPSS ver. 23 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A post hoc test (Bonferroni
correction) was applied to identify differences between groups. Differences in TEE and
energy intake between groups were analyzed using the t-test. The results of statistical
tests were considered significant when p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Results are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) or percentage. The levels of
long-term care required by participants in the Mizuho-kai Ogawa Hospital were as follows:
care level 5, 58.4%; care level 4, 30.0%; care level 3, 7.6%; care level 2, 2.7%; care level
1, 1.1%. The required rate of the level of long-term care (care level &#x0003e;3) was almost the
same between the Mizuho-kai Ogawa Hospital and the designated medical long-term care
sanatoriums in Japan, as reported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in
2012.</p><p>The mean serum albumin level was 3.21&#x02005;g/dl (SD=0.50) and the mean BMI was
17.8&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD=2.9). A total of 69.6% participants showed PEM. No significant

were hospitalized for long periods and the risk of PT for such patients. Herein, 69.6% of
our study participants demonstrated PEM on the basis of their serum albumin level and 65.2%
on the basis of their BMI, similar to previous studies that also reported that &#x0003e;60% of
elderly patients in hospitals were at risk for malnutrition<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have
also found that serum albumin level and BMI were not always equally associated with
malnutrition in patients<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, we
found no association between the serum albumin level and BMI; however, the relationships
between the serum albumin level and BMI within groups were not the same. Thus, it is likely
that the relationship between the serum albumin level and BMI could change according to the
patient&#x02019;s ambulatory ability during PT and the mode of nutrient intake.</p><p>Our results showed that, in Group A and B, the energy intake was lower than the TEE.
Moreover, regardless of the patient&#x02019;s ambulatory ability, the average energy balance without
PT-associated energy load was negative in patients whose energy intake was via tube feeding
(Groups A and B). Thus, the insufficient energy intake in these patients might be promoted
by PT. In Group C, the average of energy balance between with and without PT-associated
energy load was negative. Therefore, the energy intake via ingestion might be insufficient.
In Group D, wherein the serum albumin levels were almost the same as the threshold level,
increasing physical activity would likely result in insufficient intake of protein, even
though the average energy balance with PT-associated energy load was positive. Moreover, in
group E, the average energy balance with PT-associated energy load was negative. This
indicated that energy expenditure is increased by improvement in gait ability, which would
promote malnutrition in patients treated with PT. Additionally, the EEPT in Group E was
higher than that in the other groups, including Group D. If patients, such as those in Group
D whose energy balance with PT-associated energy load was positive, obtain gait
independence, then the physical therapist should reconsider their risk management and energy
intake by consulting a dietitian in the hospital. Furthermore, PT-associated energy load
might negatively affect the energy balance of all groups.</p><p>There are several limitations of this study. First, only a small number of patients
obtained gait independence. Second, the TEE calculated using the Harris Benedict equation
does not reflect the total energy expenditure. Third, the EEPT was estimated on the basis of
the energy expenditure value for healthy Japanese individuals in the Omori study.
Accordingly, the TEE and EEPT may be lower than the actual energy expenditure because the
participants had several underlying diseases and complications, which would result in
increased activity and stress. If the TEE and EEPT calculated in this study are lower than
the actual energy expenditure, then the risk of PT will be higher.</p><p>In conclusion, this study is important because the results indicate that malnutrition in
patients hospitalized for long periods occurred owing to changes in their ambulatory ability
during PT and the mode of nutrient intake. Such patients would benefit from closer
examination of this critically important but typically understudied topic.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was performed in the Mizuho-kai Ogawa Hospital that closed in March 2014. We are
