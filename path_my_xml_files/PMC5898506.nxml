High intensity interval training (HIIT) is now recognized in CR exercise guidelines as an appropriate and efficient modality for improving cardiorespiratory fitness, a strong predictor of mortality. However, the clinical application of HIIT in a real world CR setting, in terms of feasibility, safety, and long-term adherence, needs further investigation to address ongoing reservations. Furthermore, studies using objective measures of exercise intensity (such as heart rate; HR) have produced variable outcomes.

Exercise training forms an integral part of lifestyle modification to improve health outcomes, and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) has been the cornerstone of exercise prescription for CR. There is substantial evidence from several meta-analyses <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> that CR services involving exercise can significantly reduce cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality by 20&#x02013;35% and 20&#x02013;40% respectively. Exercise capacity, measured directly as peak oxygen uptake (peak VO<sub>2</sub>), has been shown to exert the largest influence on cardiovascular disease prognosis in this population <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. High intensity interval training (HIIT), which involves alternating periods of high intensity exercise with light recovery exercise, has been shown to elicit greater improvements in peak VO<sub>2</sub> than moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) in people with coronary artery disease (CAD) <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and remarkably in those with heart failure <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While HIIT is now recognized internationally in CR exercise guidelines as an appropriate and efficient modality for improving cardiovascular health in patients with CAD <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, a recent survey of CR centres by our team found safety concerns to be the leading barrier for implementing HIIT as standard care <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although it has been demonstrated that higher exercise intensities elicit greater cardioprotective effects than MICT <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, there are still concerns that high intensity exercise may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction in susceptible persons <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">The interest in use of HIIT for CR has resulted in large randomized controlled trials, such as the Saintex CAD study (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;200) <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the Smartex HF study (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;220) <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and studies by Aamot and colleagues (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;83) <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and Moholdt et al. (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;59) <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These studies showed variable results, likely due to differing levels of adherence to prescribed exercise intensities of the HIIT and MICT protocols. To date, most studies utilize objective measures of exercise intensity (such as heart rate (HR)) rather than subjective measures (such as rating of perceived exertion (RPE)). RPE is more commonly used in Australian CR as few patients undertake a maximal exercise test to determine their true maximal HR <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Additionally, using a % of a measured &#x02018;maximal&#x02019; HR may not be an accurate measure of intensity if maximal HR is not achieved during the graded exercise test, or beta blockade dose/timing is different between testing and training. Major limitations reported by the Saintex CAD study <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> was the lower average training HR of HIIT (88%HR<sub>peak</sub>) and higher average training HR of MICT (80%HR<sub>peak</sub>). Although training intensity was not determined by RPE in this study, the average reported RPE was 13.5 for HIIT and 12.5 for MICT. Additionally, while the Smartex HF study reported an average training HR of 90%HR<sub>peak</sub> for HIIT, 51% of HIIT participants were training below their target HR. Both the Saintex CAD study <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and Smartex HF study <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> highlighted the necessity in clinical practice to adjust objectively defined HR targets and workloads according to a patient's subjective feelings. Another limitation of the current literature is many studies also use only one exercise modality <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which is not reflective of a real world setting where various exercise modalities are used.</p><p id="p0020">Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is also considered an important contributor to a lifetime risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (cardiometabolic risk), in conjunction with traditional cardiovascular risk factors <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We have recently shown that exercise training can reduce both VAT and intra-hepatic lipid <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and interval training protocols, of varying nature, have shown significant reductions in VAT of up to 48% in 8 weeks <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Both groups will be provided with a HR range to guide exercise intensity and provide a means of education for RPE. The HIIT group will be given a HR guide of 85&#x02013;95% HR<sub>peak</sub> and the MICT group a HR guide of 65&#x02013;75% HR<sub>peak</sub>. Therefore participants taking beta-blocker medications are likely to be guided with lower HR ranges, reflective of their lower HR<sub>peak</sub> during maximal exercise testing. Although HR<sub>peak</sub> will be provided as a guide for exercising intensity, participants will be encouraged to use RPE when there is discordance between RPE and HR targets. Using RPE is more commonly used to prescribe exercise intensity in a real world setting, particularly if maximal exercise testing has not been conducted or if dose/timing of beta-blockade medication is different between testing and exercise training. The HIIT group will also be required to monitor and record HR during home-based sessions throughout Stages 1&#x02013;2 with devices provided (Polar, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland).

A seated blood pressure will be measured manually on each arm. When there is a difference &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;mmHg between arms, a third measure will be taken on the arm with the highest reading. After 15&#x000a0;min of supine rest, heart rate variability will be measured using continuous electrocardiogram recorded for 5&#x000a0;min. Pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity will then be measured using automated technology (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical Pty Ltd., West Ryde, Australia). For pulse wave analysis, a cuff will be placed around the arm, between the elbow and shoulder, and will be partially inflated to obtain the augmentation index. For pulse wave velocity, a cuff will be placed around the femoral artery to capture the femoral waveform, and a tonometer pressure sensor on the carotid artery to capture carotid waveform. The velocity of pulse transfer from the carotid artery to the femoral artery will be measured. Pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity will be each assessed three times. Endothelial function will be assessed as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) using high-resolution vascular ultrasound (Usmart 3300, Teratech Corporation, Burlington, USA) in accordance with guidelines for an nitric oxide dependent approach <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. A 7.5&#x000a0;Hz probe will be used to capture B-mode images of the brachial artery in the right arm. The probe will be placed on the distal third of the upper arm (proximal to the antecubital fossa) and orientated to the longitudinal plane. Following image optimization, continuous images will be recorded to measure vessel diameter and blood velocity, using the lowest possible insonation angle (&#x02264;60&#x000b0;). Baseline images will be continuously recorded for 1&#x000a0;min to capture diameter and velocity. A sphygmomanometer cuff, placed directly distal to the olecranon, will be subsequently inflated to 220&#x000a0;mmHg (or 50&#x000a0;mmHg above systolic blood pressure). The cuff will remain inflated for 5&#x000a0;min, with continuous recordings of the brachial artery commencing 30&#x000a0;s before deflation, and for 3&#x000a0;min thereafter. Hyperemic velocity will be assessed via mid-artery pulsed Doppler signal obtained upon immediate release of the cuff. All recordings will be analyzed offline by specialized, automated edge detection and wall tracking software to provide an objective measure of peak diameter and calculation of shear rate as previously described <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Arterial diameter, flow and shear rate will be analyzed using the 1-min baseline recording prior to cuff inflation and 3-min recording following cuff deflation. FMD response will be reported as absolute (in millimeters) and relative (in %) change in post-stimulus brachial artery diameter from baseline diameter. Shear rate stimulus (area under the curve until peak diameter) will also be reported. Clinical significance has been reported to be as small as 1%, with a meta-analysis reporting 8% increased cardiovascular event risk for 1% decrease in FMD, after adjusting for traditional risk factors <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.13.8"><label>2.13.8</label><title>Intrahepatic lipid</title><p id="p0250">Intrahepatic lipid will be measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) during the MRI procedure previously mentioned.

This protocol describes a study investigating the clinical application of HIIT compared to MICT in a hospital-based CR program relating to safety, feasibility, exercise adherence, and efficacy for improving cardiorespiratory fitness and other cardiometabolic outcomes. We expect HIIT will be feasible and safe to incorporate into a hospital-based CR program and will improve patient's exercise adherence long-term.
