Persons born in Cuba made up approximately 38% of our sample and the rest came from a large variety of regions of Latin America, including at least 10 persons born in Nicaragua, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Peru, and the mainland United States. The others were from a large variety of countries, including Puerto Rico, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Columbia, Guatemala, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and Honduras. Most participants (80%) had been living in the US for more than 10 years. With respect to race, four-fifths self-identified themselves as White (81%); 16% indicated their race was either &#x02018;moreno&#x02019;, &#x02018;mixto&#x02019;, &#x02018;indigeno&#x02019;, or another variation; and 3% identified their race as Black (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">Table 2</xref>). Acculturation level, the process of adapting to a new culture, was assessed using the Marin Short Acculturation Scale (MSAS) (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), which primarily focuses on the linguistic components of acculturation. The MSAS has six questions using a Likert scale and respondents can have a total acculturation score ranging from 6 to 30. The total acculturation score was calculated for each participant. Then, based on frequency distributions, we grouped respondents into acculturation tertiles to indicate minimal acculturation, low acculturation, or moderate acculturation. The lowest possible score was 6, and participants who met that criteria were categorized as minimally acculturated. Acculturation status among those who scored between 7 and 10 was categorized as low, and those who scored between 11 and 30 met the criteria for moderate. Most of the sample scored minimal on acculturation with 48% achieving the lowest score possible and less than a quarter meeting the criteria for moderate acculturation. However, nearly 60% had completed at least 12 years of schooling (usually in their home country). Health literacy, which was measured using the Spanish version of the Short Assessment of Health Literacy Spanish and English (SAHL S&#x00026;E), was relatively high with 85% having adequate health literacy, an understanding of common medical terminology.</p><table-wrap id="T0002" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Demographics and health outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographics</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

During our review of the electronic medical record, which was completed when identifying potential participants for study inclusion, the mean HbA1c among the sample was 9.31. However, at the time participants had their initial measurement for MHHI, usually done a few months after the initial HbA1c, the mean A1C had dropped to 9.13.</p><p>With respect to blood pressure, the mean SBP was 133 mmHg&#x000b1;19.

Using the newer criteria of SBP&#x0003c;140 (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), almost a third of participants were not at goal.

Using the EURO-D cut-off of 3 or greater, 80% of participants screened positive for depression and more than half had scores of five or greater indicating high levels of mental health impairment. Other behavioral measures were also notable including 55% of the patients being sedentary and on average consuming only two servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Though this is well below national recommendations, these rates mirror the national rates of fruit and vegetable consumption (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Some findings were encouraging. For example, most participants ate breakfast more than 5 days per week. In addition, hazardous alcohol use was less than 190 3% versus the national rate of 7% (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

Using the Morisky Medication Adherence (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) scale, a score of &#x0003c;6 was classified as low adherence, a score of 6 to 7 was considered medium adherence, and a score of 8 was considered high adherence. In our population, only 16% had high adherence to their medications. Self-efficacy scores, as measured by the brief diabetes distress scale (DDS 2), also indicated another problem area. The DDS 2 is a diabetes distress screening instrument asking respondents to rate on a 6-point scale, the degree to which the following items caused distress: 1) feeling overwhelmed by the demands of living with diabetes and 2) feeling that, &#x02018;I am often failing with my diabetes regimen&#x02019;. A DDS 2 score of &#x02265;3 indicates a moderate or more severe problem. DDS 2 scores are tabulated by adding the numbers (1 through 6) assigned to each response category in the Likert scale and then dividing the sum by 2 (i.e., 8/2=4). Nearly 80% of our sample met the criteria for moderate to serious distress, as indicated by the sample&#x02019;s mean score of 4.06 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0003">Table 3</xref>).

More than a quarter of these patients with poorly controlled diabetes indicated that they &#x02018;never&#x02019; or &#x02018;almost never&#x02019; communicated with their provider about health issues and just 10% communicated with their provider &#x02018;very often&#x02019; or &#x02018;always&#x02019; regarding their health concerns. Lastly, we examined whether any of these characteristics, including depression, self-efficacy, readiness to change (stages of change), and medication adherence, were correlated with A1c. However, in bivariate analysis we did not find any significant correlations with A1c. Though, a major limitation of this approach is that all participants had poorly controlled diabetes, a more appropriate strategy would have been to compare the distribution of characteristics among MHHI participants with another sample of people with well-controlled diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S0005"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this manuscript, we describe a heterogeneous population of Latinos from various countries of origin in Miami with poorly controlled diabetes. We found that despite having poor diabetes control and being predominantly obese, two-thirds of our sample had their blood pressure controlled as per the revised ADA guidelines, and half were at the existing target for LDL control. Although there is still considerable room for improvement, these metrics from a public hospital low income population are similar to NHANES data among a nationally representative sample, which shows that 53% of a nationally representative sample had poor blood pressure in New York City (&#x02265;130/80) and 41% had poor total cholesterol (&#x02265;200) (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). When these findings were discussed with several of our providers, they were also surprised, as they expected a higher proportion of participants to have poorly controlled blood pressure and cholesterol. Though our findings on fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity are not different from the general population, these areas warrant improvement and demonstrate specific opportunities for behavioral intervention.</p><p>The most concerning findings were with respect to depression. Several other studies (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), including our own prior research of Latinos in the northeast (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), have also found high rates of depression among those with diabetes. However, in our study, 80% of the population screened positive for depression, which is much higher than the 52% we previously reported (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and the 30% cited in other studies. Previous research has shown that depressed individuals with diabetes have medical costs nearly five times greater than those without depression and that co-treating both conditions can decrease healthcare costs (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Several approaches, such as the collaborative care model, have been shown to successfully treat both depression and glucose management (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Our data again reiterate the importance of assessing depression among patients with diabetes and linking depressed patients with effective treatments.</p><p>We also found that 83% of our patients did not have appropriate medication adherence. In addition, self-efficacy scores suggested that many participants felt overwhelmed or that they were failing in diabetes management. Prior studies have shown that improving self-efficacy may lead to better glycemic control (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). One strategy to address these barriers is the use of motivational interviewing, which has been shown as an effective tool, to improve medication adherence among people with diabetes and other chronic conditions (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Because most patients also reported difficulties with provider communication, this is an additional area warranting attention. However, we also found that, with respect to stages of change, 40% of our sample met the criteria to be in the action or maintenance phase. This finding is supported by the fact that even prior to enrollment in the study, the mean HbA1c of our patients improved, suggesting that many participants were at least taking some action to control their diabetes. Voluntarily enrolling into a clinical trial focused on improving diabetes management may also indicate progression along the stages of change continuum and readiness to change their diabetes self-care behaviors.</p><p>Among the strengths of our study was a highly diverse Latinos population. However, our sample was from South Florida and may not be generalized to Latino populations in other geographic regions of the country, which tend to be more homogenous in ethnicity. Second, as only poorly controlled diabetics were enrolled into our study, the findings reported here are not representative of the national population of patients with diabetes, or all Latinos with diabetes. Estimates are that about half the patients with diabetes have HbA1c&#x0003c;7.0 (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Lastly, there are numerous planned future manuscripts based on our data, including the impact of the intervention on diabetes, blood pressure, and LDL. Other manuscripts will examine data on acculturation on outcomes and health care utilization.</p><p>
In summary, we found that in a large sample of heterogeneous Latinos with poorly controlled diabetes and obesity in Miami, levels of blood pressure and cholesterol control were similar to other studies of less impaired patients with diabetes. Many behavioral measures such as diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol also mirrored data from non-diabetics. However, there were several areas that warrant attention, including high rates of depression, medication non-adherence, and provider communication. These are all important domains to consider in improving care delivery to this vulnerable population with poorly controlled diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by an award from NIH/NHLBI R01 HL083857.</p></ack><sec id="S0006"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>The authors have not received any funding or benefits from industry or elsewhere to conduct this study.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>Centers for Disease Control</collab><article-title>Hispanic or Latino populations</article-title><comment>Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/populations/REMP/hispanic.html">http://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/populations/REMP/hispanic.html</ext-link> [cited 19 August 2014].</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pleis</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucas</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Summary health statistics for U.S. adults: National Health Interview Survey, 2007.
