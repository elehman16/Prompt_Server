Fifty-seven adolescents (31 males, age = 15&#x02013;19 years) were randomly assigned to nap or no nap groups.

Daytime napping and weekend sleep extension are often adopted to remedy the negative effects of reduced nocturnal sleep. Two nights of 9-hour recovery sleep during simulated weekend nights were insufficient to return sleep architecture to baseline levels following an intense 5-hour time-in-bed school week. Residual effects of sleep loss were carried over to a second cycle of sleep restriction. A long 1-hour afternoon nap alleviated but did not eliminate sleep debt. These findings underscore the importance of adequate nocturnal sleep on adolescent sleep physiology.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Adolescents undergo a period of rapid physical and psychological change, often accompanied by intense pressure to excel academically and keep up-to-date with their peers on social media. The resulting delay in bedtimes,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> together with early school start times, jointly lead to recurrent sleep loss during the school term. To combat the daytime sleepiness and cognitive deficits induced by sleep curtailment, many resort to napping. The National Sleep Foundation 2011 Sleep in America poll observed that approximately 61% of adolescents aged 13&#x02013;18 years reported sleeping less than the recommended 8 hours of sleep,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> while 53% reported napping on school days.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> To catch up on lost sleep, many adolescents extend sleep on weekends.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Existing research on sleep restriction has focused on acute and short-term changes in sleep and its architecture across a single cycle of multi-night sleep restriction. These studies have shown increases in homeostatic sleep drive following chronic sleep loss,<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> together with increased sleep duration and intensity (measured by slow wave energy [SWE]) during recovery sleep.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>In contrast, little is known about the effects of recurrent sleep restriction and recovery commonly experienced by adolescents. There has been a steady decline in the number of adolescents reporting &#x02265;7 hours sleep a night from 1991 to 2012 in the United States,<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and a quarter of adolescents sleep &#x0003c;6 hours.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Elsewhere in the world, 54% of Taiwanese middle school adolescents sleep &#x0003c;6 hours on school nights,<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and 18.1% of South Korean adolescents sleep &#x0003c;5 hours.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> A separate Korean survey showed a mean sleep duration of just 4.86 hours in South Korean 12<sup>th</sup> graders.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> It may only be a matter of time before hitherto rare sleep restriction of &#x0003c;5 hours time in bed (TIB) becomes more pervasive. Only one study to-date has investigated the physiological effects of <italic>repeated</italic> cycles of sleep restriction and recovery in healthy adults.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> It found that stress responses were continually elevated throughout the sleep restriction cycles. It is still unclear how sleep architecture responds to repeated cycles of sleep restriction in adolescents.</p><p>Naps have been shown to benefit alertness and cognitive performance in adults following normal sleep,<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> sleep deprivation,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and one night of sleep restriction.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, naps can adversely affect nocturnal sleep if their timing and length are unfavorable.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> For example, a survey of 231 adolescents who habitually napped at least twice a week found that they went to bed later, woke up later, and obtained less nocturnal sleep on school nights than those who did not nap at all.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In an earlier study on adolescents, we found that after seven nights of sleep restricted to 5 hours, the first recovery sleep episode had longer total sleep time (TST; consisting of increased N2 and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) and reduced wake after sleep onset (WASO) relative to baseline. Incomplete recovery of neurobehavioral performance was still observed after the second recovery night (9-hour TIB per recovery night).<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Similar findings were also observed in a recent study on adolescents exposed to five nights of 5-hour sleep restriction followed by two recovery nights of 10-hour TIB.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> We recently demonstrated in this age group that these residual effects of sleep loss in the first sleep cycle would carry over and be aggravated in a second cycle of sleep restriction in the form of compounded neurobehavioral impairments.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>In the present work, we examined (1) how sleep architecture responds to repeated cycles of sleep restriction and recovery simulating an intense school week, (2) if a 1-hour afternoon nap could alleviate some of these changes, and (3) if napping in the afternoon would adversely affect nocturnal sleep in this setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-seven adolescents took part in the Need for Sleep Study 2.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> They met the following screening criteria: (1) between 15 and 19 years of age, (2) no history of chronic medical conditions, psychiatric illness, or sleep disorders, (3) a body mass index (BMI) of &#x02264;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, (4) daily consumption of fewer than five cups of caffeinated beverages, (5) no history of travel across more than two time zones 1 month prior to the experiment, and (6) not habitual short sleepers (i.e., those who had an average actigraphically-estimated TIB of &#x0003c;6 hours and showed no sign of sleep extension for &#x0003e;1 hour on weekend compared to weekday nights).

Our findings reveal that multiple nights of sleep restriction bring about cumulative changes in sleep architecture indicative of a buildup in sleep debt that are aggravated early in a second cycle of sleep restriction. A 1-hour afternoon nap each day resulted in reduced homeostatic sleep pressure. However, two nights of 9-hour TIB recovery sleep simulating a weekend were insufficient to restore sleep EEG to baseline levels even in the nap group. Finally, we demonstrated that having a 1-hour mid-afternoon nap following each night of 5-hour TIB did not perturb nocturnal sleep and may have instead contributed to stabilizing sleep debt accrued across days.</p><sec id="s16"><title>Sleep Debt Accumulated Across Sleep Restriction Nights in Both Nap and No Nap Groups, but Was Greater in the No Nap Group</title><p>Sleep macrostructure differences in the recovery nights compared to baseline (B2) in both groups were observed in the form of increased N2 sleep, REM sleep, and SE and reduced WASO. Additionally, the no nap group displayed increased TST, NREM sleep, and reduced N2 latency and N1 sleep. These transitions to deeper and longer sleep in the recovery nights are indicative of compensatory responses activated to overcome elevated sleep pressure accumulated over multiple nights of sleep restriction. Even across nap episodes within the nap group, increases in TST, N3 sleep, SE, and SWE and decreases in WASO were observed, still rising at the end of the second sleep restriction period.</p><p>There was greater accumulation of sleep debt in the no nap group as evidenced by more pronounced changes in NREM sleep, WASO, SE, N2 latency, and SWE in the first recovery night, and onward into the second sleep restriction period. A 1-hour mid-afternoon nap appears to have stabilized EEG features of sleep debt accumulated across multiple nights.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Two Nights of 9-Hour Recovery Sleep may be Insufficient to Reverse the Electrophysiological Effects of 5 Nights of 5-Hour Sleep Restriction</title><p>This study was designed to simulate a typical school week&#x02014;with five nights of 5-hour sleep restriction on school nights followed by two nights of 9-hour recovery sleep during a weekend&#x02014;and investigate the EEG dynamics when school starts again in the ensuing week. When nocturnal sleep in the second sleep restriction cycle was compared with the first, there were indications that recovery was not complete and residual effects of sleep loss carried over to the second cycle. In our prior work investigating the effects of seven nights of sleep restriction, recovery was also shown to be incomplete by the third night,<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> in contrast to adults who show full recovery in terms of restitution to baseline sleep stage durations by the first or third recovery night,<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> even with seven nights of 3-hour TIB.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> While no direct comparison can be made with adults here, these findings reinforce the notion that adolescents may not habituate to recurrent episodes of partial sleep loss and that lost sleep may not be adequately compensated by two nights of 9-hour TIB (akin to a weekend), even with a 1-hour afternoon nap following each sleep-restricted night.</p><p>The accentuation of EEG changes in the second sleep restriction cycle ought to serve as a wake-up-call to adolescents who subject themselves to draconian sleep schedules for an entire school term involving many more cycles of sleep restriction and potentially incomplete recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>A 1-Hour Afternoon Nap Does Not Alter Nocturnal Sleep Architecture in These Sleep-Restricted Participants</title><p>Long naps that contain slow wave sleep or naps taken late in the day can lead to increased alertness in the evening due to reduced homeostatic sleep pressure, leading to decreased nocturnal sleep later that night.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In turn, this could increase the likelihood of napping the following day, leading to a vicious cycle of short sleep and increased daytime napping.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> However, in this study, we showed that there was comparable nocturnal NREM sleep, REM sleep, and WASO between the nap and the no nap groups on sleep restriction nights. When differences were observed between groups (eg, TST and N2 latency on M<sub>2</sub>3, and SE on most sleep restriction nights), these were due to changes across nights in the no nap group rather than in the nap group, suggesting that this was due to greater sleep debt in the no nap group rather than reduced sleep capacity in the nap group.</p><p>Prior work<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> has advocated shorter duration naps (e.g., 10-minute), out of concern that of sleep inertia would impair performance and alertness soon after awakening if those naps were to contain a greater amount of slow wave sleep. Although we did not compare effects of differing nap durations, it seems reasonable to state that if performance immediately after napping is not crucial, a 1-hour afternoon nap may be preferable to shorter naps given that reduction in sleep debt and sleepiness, and gains in neurobehavioral functions<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> may be accrued without interference with nocturnal sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>In this study, sleep restriction and recovery nights were experimentally set at 5 and 9 hours, respectively. This level of sleep restriction may seem severe to some, but is commonly observed in Asian adolescents.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Adolescents in our sample had actigraphically estimated habitual TIBs of 6.32 &#x000b1; 1.02 hours (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) on weekdays and 8.17 &#x000b1; 0.76 hours on weekends during term time. Habitual TST was 5.56 &#x000b1; 0.92 hours on weekdays and 7.27 &#x000b1; 0.76 hours on weekends. These levels of weekday sleep are far below the recommended 8 hours of sleep prescribed for this age group<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and less than the sleep duration reported in other North American, European, and Asian countries.<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Whether our findings can be generalized to adolescents from other countries who habitually sleep longer remain to be addressed.</p><p>In addition, our findings could differ for less severe levels of nightly sleep restriction, or greater weekend recovery durations&#x02014;an issue future studies should investigate. Adolescents may also choose to take additional naps on weekends, which could allow for complete recovery before the next cycle of sleep restriction. A 2 pm nap time might also be unrealistic for students who would be in class at this time. Future work could look into the effect of later nap times.</p><p>We were also only able to track EEG changes across two sleep restriction and recovery cycles. As sleep debt appeared to be cumulating in both nap and no nap groups in the second cycle of sleep restriction, future studies should investigate if these changes continue to accrue over more cycles of sleep restriction and recovery or if an allostatic change in sleep homeostasis would instead be observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s20"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study underscores the importance of adequate nocturnal sleep in adolescents. Sleep debt accumulated during an intense school week may not be fully compensated by extending sleep on weekend nights and may intensify upon re-exposure to sleep restriction. Afternoon naps can be taken to alleviate sleep debt under conditions of severe sleep restriction without compromising nocturnal sleep architecture but these do not restore sleep to baseline, especially if sleep restriction is repeated the following week.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>SLEEP</italic> online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This was not an industry supported study.
