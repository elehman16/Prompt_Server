Introduction</title><p>A characteristic of ageing is an increase in adiposity and loss of muscle mass [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since the increase in adiposity is related to general poor health factors such as an increase in type II diabetes and increased incidence of coronary heart disease, exercise to reduce adiposity is recommended for the ageing population. A further consequence of the ageing process is that elderly individuals have an impaired ability to oxidise fatty acids [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], particularly after a meal [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since most individuals eat a meal prior to exercise in order to provide some form of sustenance, what should the meal contain if the exercise priority is to &#x0201c;burn fat&#x0201d;?</p><p>Generally, a high-fat, low-CHO meal increases fat oxidation during subsequent exercise [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], whereas the ingestion of CHO before exercise depresses the rate of fat oxidation due to hyperinsulinemia in the postprandial period [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Altering the type of CHO consumed has been shown to have an effect on the magnitude of hyperinsulinemia and depression of fat oxidation [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Postprandial increases in glucose and insulin concentration promote CHO oxidation, resulting in decreased fatty acid oxidation [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Wu et al. [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found that the amount of fat oxidised was significantly higher during exercise commencing 3&#x02009;h after consuming a low glycemic index (LGI) meal compared with a high glycemic index (HGI) meal. They also demonstrated that the HGI meal resulted in a greater glycemic and insulinemic response during the postprandial period compared with LGI meal. This is supported by Stevenson et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who investigated the metabolic responses to HGI and LGI mixed meals after 60-minute exercise at 70% <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x002d9;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>max</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02009;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and found that significant differences in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia can be achieved repeatedly by changing the Glycemic Index (GI) of the CHO in a mixed meal. They observed that the amount of fat oxidised during the postprandial period following lunch was significantly higher in the LGI than the HGI trial. Thus, at least for several hours postprandial, both at rest and during exercise, fat utilisation is depressed after HGI compared with LGI meals.</p><p>The effects of different meals (high fat, HGI, and LGI) on fat and CHO metabolism at rest and during exercise in young subjects have been extensively studied, although this is not the case for elderly individuals. As mentioned previously, it is an important health benefit for the elderly to engage in some form of aerobic exercise for improvements in the cardiovascular system and to reduce body fat. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of four different types of meals (normal, high-fat, HGI, and LGI) on fat and CHO metabolism during exercise in elderly male subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

The four meals were given to subjects in a counterbalanced design and sessions were separated by at least 3 days. To avoid circadian variation, experiments were always performed at the same time of day (08:00 am) after an overnight fast. Participants completed a 2-day food diary on the day before their first test and were asked to repeat this diet before all subsequent trials. In addition, subjects were requested to refrain from drinking alcohol, nor to engage in any kind of strenuous exercise 24 hours before trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3.

Discussion</title><p>The present study is the first study designed to investigate the effects of pre-exercise mixed meals on fat and carbohydrate metabolism during exercise in elderly individuals, and its principle finding was that in spite of some changes in fat metabolites, the composition of the meal did not result in differences in CHO and fat oxidation. These results are in contrast to the data reported by previous studies in young subjects that observed a rise in fat oxidation after HF due to increases in fatty acid (FA) availability and mobilization [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, a depression in the rate of fat oxidation following CHO ingestion, attributed to hyperinsulinaemia, has also been observed in the postprandial period [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. </p><p>Availability and utilisation of plasma FA decreases after a CHO meal partly because the CHO-induced rise in insulin inhibits the mobilisation and availability of circulating FA, which reduces fat oxidation possibly by inhibiting the rate of long-chain fatty acids entry into the mitochondria for <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-oxidation [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite CHO-induced hyperinsulinemia and suppression of FA after CHO ingestion, our results show that the CHO oxidation was resistant to alteration during exercise in elderly males. Several mechanisms, including impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, may have contributed to these results. Having said that, it should be noted that the HOMA scores indicate normal insulin resistance and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cell function for these elderly participants.</p><p>The increased release of FAs in older individuals, in excess of the energy needs and/or oxidative capacity of respiring tissues, increases the amount of non-oxidised FAs. Excess non-oxidised FAs with age may have several adverse metabolic effects including increased glucose production [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. FAs exert their effects through inhibition of PDH with subsequent increased intracellular concentration of glucose-6-phosphate and inhibition of hexokinase, which decreases glucose uptake [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Another factor that may contribute to impaired glucose uptake with ageing is inhibition of glucose transport either due to less availability of the GLUT-4 transporters or, to the signalling processes for GLUT-4 vesicle translocation to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These considerations need further exploration.</p><p>Although after the HF meal, NEFA, and glycerol concentrations were higher than for the other meals, the fat oxidation rates during exercise were not different. This contradicts the findings in young participants [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Evaluation of skeletal muscle samples has revealed that maximal mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activity is lower in older than in young subjects because of both decreased mitochondrial volume density [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and mitochondrial function [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Lower activity of enzymes such as AMPK, cAMP, and protein kinase C in elderly individuals results in activation of ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase). Activation of ACC leads to an increase in concentration of malonyl-CoA which has an inhibitory effect on CPT-I, thereby inhibiting the entry of long chain fatty acids into mitochondria and resulting in lower FA oxidation [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We did not examine activities of such enzymes and so can only speculate.</p><p>Lack of changes in fat oxidation after HF was found in spite of increased lipolysis. It has been demonstrated that relative to the energy needs of the body, FA release is not impaired in the elderly [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In fact, FAs are released in excess of energy needs in older individuals when compared to younger controls. Thus, when considered relative to the energy demands of the body or the metabolically active tissue mass, ageing is not associated with impaired FA release which supports our findings for lipolysis. </p><p>A higher rate of fat oxidation during submaximal exercise after ingesting LGI foods has been reported in young healthy males when compared to HGI [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In terms of the effect of GI, the results of the present study were somewhat unexpected since the calculated amount of fat oxidation during 30&#x02009;minutes of cycling commencing 3 hour after consuming HGI and LGI meals was not significantly different. One possible explanation for this discrepancy might be the impaired glucose uptake associated with ageing as previously discussed.</p><p>In the present study, postprandial NEFA concentration was increased after HF, which is in agreement with previous studies on young participants [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The increase in plasma NEFA concentration which occurred might be a result of TAG hydrolysis by endothelial lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Both HGI and LGI resulted in suppression of NEFA concentrations 3 hours after the meal consumption. However, NEFA concentrations at the end of 30-minutes cycling in both HGI and LGI trials were raised to pre-meal levels. Higher post-exercise NEFA is typical response to exercise-induced decrease in insulin and increase in catecholamines. </p><p>Postprandial glycerol concentration increased significantly after all meals except for HGI. The lack of a significant increase in glycerol after HGI might be due to the enhanced secretion of insulin following the HGI meal which would activate the enzyme LPL in adipose tissue [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The insulin activation of LPL serves to increase TAG uptake and storage after a single meal which eventually results in lower glycerol concentration. Studies in young subjects during low and moderate intensity exercise have demonstrated that increased blood glucose availability suppresses fat utilisation by inhibition of both fat mobilisation and fat oxidation within muscle [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Postprandial glycerol concentration was significantly higher after HF than HGI and LGI in elderly subjects which reflects the lack of insulin response to HF in comparison to the other meals. These findings are in agreement with those of Whitley et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Murphy et al. [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] who reported increases in glycerol after HF in young participants.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that in elderly individuals feeding isoenergetic meals containing different proportions of carbohydrate and fat alters the metabolic variables at rest and during subsequent exercise. Energy regulation during 30&#x02009;min of cycling in elderly individuals following isoenergetic meals is associated with a relative increase in fat oxidation and a decrease in carbohydrate oxidation following HF and a corresponding increase in CHO oxidation and a decrease following high carbohydrate (low fat) meals. Therefore, based on these finding, it could be concluded that fat and carbohydrate metabolism in elderly individuals in response to different meals at rest and during subsequent exercise are to some extent different from those of young individuals and further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanism/s responsible especially in relation to insulin action and sensitivity. What we can state is that, on balance, eating any type of meal 3 hours prior to a 30-minutes bout of exercise is unlikely to significantly impact on so-called &#x0201c;fat burning&#x0201d; in healthy elderly males.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank volunteers for their enthusiastic participation in this study.
