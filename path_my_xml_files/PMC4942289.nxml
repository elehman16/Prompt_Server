&#x02003;Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a leading cause of hearing impairment in children. Therefore, early and proper management is essential.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>
&#x02003;The objective of this research is to assess the efficacy of intratympanic (IT) steroids injection for management of otitis media with effusion (OME).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>
&#x02003;This study involved 42 children (84 ears) with bilateral OME. We used tympanometry to confirm the childre&#x00144;s middle ear effusion and pure tone audiometry to determine hearing threshold. We performed myringotomy and inserted ventilation tubes (VTs) bilaterally, followed by a steroid injection of 0.4&#x02013;0.6 mL methylprednisolone (40 mg/mL) into one randomly selected middle ear. This procedure was followed by once-weekly administration of steroids (0.5 mL methylprednisolone at a concentration of 40 mg/mL) into the middle ear for three consecutive weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>
&#x02003;We found recurrent OME after VT alone in nine (21.4%) ears; whereas, after VT combined with steroid administration, we found two (4.76%), with statistically significant difference. We noted tympanosclerosis postoperatively in six (12.9%) ears and in one of the injected ears (2.3%) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0484). Otorrhea occurred in eight (19%) ears with VT alone and in three (7.1%) injected ears, with non-significant difference. The duration between VT insertion and its extrusion was 6.6&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1 months for ears with VT alone and 6.95 =1.12 months in injected ears (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1541 NS).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>
&#x02003;IT Steroids injection for treatment of OME is a safe and simple intervention with lower incidence of symptoms recurrence and postoperative complications. Thus, its use in management of OME is recommended.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>middle ear effusion</kwd><kwd>steroid</kwd><kwd>tympanometry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a leading cause of hearing impairment in children.

</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of IT steroids for management of OME.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient and Methods</title><p>This study was performed between February 2013 and August 2014 and included 42 patients aged 3 to 11 years, with persistent bilateral OME and scheduled for surgery. The patients included necessarily had complaints of hearing loss and persistent bilateral OME after medical treatment lasting at least three months.</p><p>The patient&#x0015b; relatives provided written informed consent to share the results from this study, approved by the ethics committee. For recurrent cases after previous management by VT (grommet) insertion, the patients received radiotherapy. We excluded patients with mucocilliary or chronic medical disorders (such as diabetes mellitus).</p><p>We relied on tympanometry to confirm OME and on pure tone audiometry to determine hearing threshold. The children underwent this procedure over one to four days, preoperatively.</p><p>The patients underwent all surgeries under general anesthesia. The surgeon performed myringotomy using a sickle knife at the anteroinferior quadrant of the tympanic membrane (TM). Next, we aspirated the middle ear fluid.</p><p>A single surgeon performed the myringotomy and VT insertion bilaterally on each patient. Then, the surgeon prepared steroids for administration into one blindly selected middle ear. When necessary, the patient underwent adenotonsilectomy or adenoidectomy.</p><p>The patients were placed in a supine position with their heads turned &#x0223c;30 degrees away from the surgeon. Using a syringe connected with a 22 (3.5 IN; 0.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;90 mm) or 25-gauge spinal needle, the surgeon injected 0.4&#x02013;0.6 ml methylprednisolone (Depo-medrol&#x000ae; 40 mg/mL, EPICO, Egypt and Pharmacia &#x00026; Upjohn, Belgium) into one tympanic cavity through the grommet tube under direct visualization through an operating microscope (<xref rid="FI0296or-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The solution was not brought to body temperature before injection, given that the patient was under general anesthesia and, therefore, did not raise concerns of vertigo. The patient remained in the described position for &#x0223c;30 minutes after injection to allow contact of steroid with the middle ear mucosa. Subsequently, patients received postoperative oral prophylactic antibiotic and were discharged from the hospital on the same day of surgery.</p><fig id="FI0296or-1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

OME can occur as a primary disorder or as a sequel of acute otitis media.<xref rid="JR0296or-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><p>OME is a multifunctional disease. It has long been recognized that Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction or obstruction predisposes to OME. Adenoids play an important role in its etiology. Cleft palate, Down's syndrome, Kartagner's syndrome, and OME associated with nasopharyngeal neoplasm, all direct to the role of ET dysfunction in OME. Immunologic and infectious factors are also included in its pathogenesis.<xref rid="JR0296or-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<xref rid="JR0296or-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Thus, the effectiveness of conventional methods for OME treatment remains questionable, presenting high recurrence rates that point to an unsolved issue.</p><p>Intratympanic delivery of medication has been making progress as a treatment method for various otologic disorders. In 1935, Barany used IT lidocaine for tinnitus. Schuknecht was among the first to use IT streptomycin for Meniere's disease. More recently, IT steroid delivery has been investigated in treating SSNHL. While IT steroid therapy has little systemic absorption, it provides a high local concentration of steroid.<xref rid="JR0296or-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>In our current study, we assessed the efficacy of IT steroids for management of OME in children (the main target in OME). It is nearly impossible to tolerate or accept local anesthesia or maintain IT position and most cases require adenoidectomy with or without tonsillectomy. Therefore, we used general anesthesia in this study, which allowed us to keep the patient in the needed position after IT steroid injection.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of VT in this study allowed drops to be applied weekly, since IT administration without need for transtympanic injection in a child is not possible without general anesthesia.</p><p>Adenoidectomy was needed in most (33) cases (78.6%), as previously concluded.<xref rid="JR0296or-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Nonetheless, we found that the most common predisposing factor for recurrence of OME was enlarged adenoid.<xref rid="JR0296or-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="JR0296or-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This factor was neglected in this study, as we compare results between both sides of the same patient.</p><p>By reviewing the results of this study, it was clear that hearing improved significantly postoperatively in both groups. The mean postoperative hearing level was significantly higher after IT steroid application compared to VT, taking into consideration that preoperative mean of hearing level of both groups showed non-significant differences.</p><p>The results also clearly identified that IT steroid administration following VT insertion had significantly reduced the incidence of OME recurrence compared to VT insertion alone.</p><p>In this study, tympanosclerosis was significantly less in injected ears (2.3%). This supports the autoimmune theory of OME and also explains this significant reduction of tympanosclerosis with steroid injection, despite the short follow-up period in this study. Although incidence of post-VT otorrhea in the current study was less with IT steroid use, this was statistically non-significant, indicating that otorrhea related only to patient and VT factors. Thus, IT steroid did not increase infection rates as occurred with systemic steroid.</p><p>Among the studied ears, the mean VT extrusion time in injected was 10 days longer than non-injected ears, with no significant difference. This reflects that IT steroid does not have an important role in increased tube duration.</p><p>Further studies are needed to evaluate the histopathological changes of middle ear mucosa after IT steroid injection in children with OME. More studies are also needed to find a method to reduce duration of the position maintained after IT injection, which prolongs general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intratympanic steroids injection for treatment of OME is a safe and simple intervention that leads to less recurrence and postoperative complications. For this reason, the authors recommend its use for the management of OME.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="d31e121" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest and Financial
