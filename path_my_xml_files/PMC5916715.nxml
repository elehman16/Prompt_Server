Whether knowledge transfer from research to practice is more successful when specific implementation approaches are used remains unclear. A model to assist engagement of allied health managers and clinicians with research implementation could involve disseminating evidence-based policy recommendations, along with the use of knowledge brokers. We developed such a model to aid decision-making for the provision of weekend allied health services. This protocol outlines the design and methods for a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the success of research implementation strategies to promote evidence-informed weekend allied health resource allocation decisions, especially in hospital managers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This multi-centre study will be a three-group parallel cluster randomised controlled trial. Allied health managers from Australian and New Zealand hospitals will be randomised to receive either (1) an evidence-based policy recommendation document to guide weekend allied health resource allocation decisions, (2) the same policy recommendation document with support from a knowledge broker to help implement weekend allied health policy recommendations, or (3) a usual practice control group. The primary outcome will be alignment of weekend allied health service provision with policy recommendations. This will be measured by the number of allied health service events (occasions of service) occurring on weekends as a proportion of total allied health service events for the relevant hospital wards at baseline and 12-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Evidence-based policy recommendation documents communicate key research findings in an accessible format. This comparatively low-cost research implementation strategy could be combined with using a knowledge broker to work collaboratively with decision-makers to promote knowledge transfer. The results will assist managers to make decisions on resource allocation, based on evidence. More generally, the findings will inform the development of an allied health model for translating research into practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=372575">ACTRN12618000029291</ext-link>).

Patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and quality outcomes benefit from evidence-informed decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Local healthcare policies that foster the timely translation of research findings to behaviour change can facilitate evidence-based practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In some cases, allied health policy and practice do not directly reflect current research evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The delay in the translation of research into practice has also been documented for the medical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and nursing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] professions, where it can take over 10&#x000a0;years for new scientific discoveries to enter day to day clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Allied health professionals generally have positive attitudes towards evidence-informed decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Research receptivity and capability among allied health professionals are also influenced by organisational characteristics such as team dynamics, a culture of acceptance or resistance to change, and managerial support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Allied health policy-makers and managers can influence these organisational factors and facilitate the translation of research into policy and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, they do not always have the training or access to knowledge transfer resources to assist them to engage effectively with research implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Implementation research has sought to develop strategies to reduce the gap between scientific evidence and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A recently published systematic review identified 32 studies examining a number of different research implementation strategies for allied health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Education as a single strategy was most frequently evaluated, yet was not always successful in facilitating desired behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Isolated educational strategies targeting individual professionals may not always meet the needs of complex organisational structures and multiple levels of decision-making involved in adopting an innovation. Providing resources to assist evidence-informed healthcare policy and management decisions may also facilitate behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Slade et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] highlighted the importance of allied health managers in fostering a research culture to embed evidence-based practice.</p><p id="Par18">Developing evidence-based policy recommendations for allied health decision-makers has the potential to increase engagement with research implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Short documents, which communicate key research findings in an accessible format, are one of the few research implementation strategies evaluated for use by resource allocation decision-makers, such as allied health managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Single research implementation strategies have been reported as less successful than multifaceted approaches in some settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">More interactive strategies may complement the provision of evidence-based policy recommendations, particularly in health services without a strong research culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. One such interactive strategy is the use of knowledge brokers to work collaboratively with stakeholders, promoting the transfer and exchange of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Indeed, in Canada, many public health organisations have adopted knowledge broker roles as linking agents and capacity builders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This is despite limited evidence to support their benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Further high quality empirical research is needed to evaluate this particular implementation resource that could be provided to allied health policy-makers and managers to support the translation of research into practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Implementation context</title><p id="Par20">One area of allied health policy and practice that could better align with the current research evidence is the provision of allied health services to hospital wards during weekends. Routinely throughout the world, allied health services including physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, social work, nutrition and dietetics, and podiatry, are delivered Monday to Friday. In some parts of the world, allied health services are also provided on Saturdays and Sundays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Saturday physiotherapy services are the most common form of allied health provided outside business hours internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Only 30% of sub-acute hospitals provide weekend physiotherapy, despite evidence suggesting the provision of after-hours or weekend rehabilitation improves outcomes in the sub-acute rehabilitation setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Research implementation strategies could inform weekend allied health resource allocation decisions to better align policy and practice with contemporary research evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par21">This protocol outlines the design and methods for a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the success of select research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed weekend allied health resource allocation decisions by hospital managers. The implementation strategies will guide allied health managers in deciding how resources for provision of allied health services on weekends can be allocated between general medical and surgical, and sub-acute rehabilitation wards.</p><p id="Par22">The resource allocation decision will be based on the following question: &#x0201c;How should resources for the provision of allied health services on weekends be allocated between general acute medical/surgical and sub-acute rehabilitation wards?&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par23">This multi-centre study will be evaluated using a three-group matched (based on health service regional status) parallel cluster randomised controlled trial. A three-group design will allow the comparison of two different research implementation strategies with a control. Stratification will be based on self-reported health service geographical classification as metropolitan or regional (including rural and remote), and clustering will occur at the level of weekend allied health resource allocation decision-making within each health service (e.g. health service level or hospital level).</p><p id="Par24">This evaluation will be based on the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model Hierarchy framework, which has four outcome levels that are designed as a sequence of ways to evaluate training programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This study will focus on behaviour change outcomes in the third category.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par25">The study sample will be drawn from Australian and New Zealand hospitals. Public or private, acute and sub-acute hospitals providing inpatient allied health services will be eligible for inclusion, with a representation of hospitals from both metropolitan and regional geographic classifications sought. Specialist hospitals such as maternity hospitals, paediatric hospitals, cancer centres, mental health and palliative care hospitals will be excluded. These hospitals will be excluded as no research regarding weekend allied health provision has been identified in these settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par26">Allied health managers responsible for weekend allied health resource allocation decisions will be eligible for inclusion. All allied health professions currently providing an inpatient service to acute general medical and surgical wards, and sub-acute rehabilitation wards are eligible.
