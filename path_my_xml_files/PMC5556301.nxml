Among the various dietary approaches, the low-carbohydrate diet (&#x0003c;20 g/day of carbohydrates), low-fat diet (&#x0003c;20% of total calories from fat), vegetarian diet, and Mediterranean diet have been associated with significant weight loss.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In a 2014 meta-analysis of 48 clinical trials, low-carbohydrate diets were found to provide the greatest weight loss after 6 months of follow-up (versus low-fat diets).<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Based on that finding, the authors concluded that adherence to the diet was the key factor in achieving successful weight loss, regardless of the diet&#x02019;s food composition. A 2008 meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials reported that the attrition rates were higher for low-fat diets than for low-carbohydrate diets, which suggests that patients prefer a low-carbohydrate approach.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This preference may be explained by the spontaneous reduction in calorie intake that is caused by carbohydrate restriction, compared with the calorie counting technique.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In addition, the effects of low-carbohydrate diets on the hunger sensation may play an important role in patient adherence, as a low-carbohydrate diet can lead to hunger levels similar to those of a low-fat diet (even with 1,000 fewer kcal of daily caloric intake).<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In Saudi Arabia, healthcare-related efforts to reduce the prevalence of obesity have not been successful. Therefore, to successfully control obesity on a national scale, it is critical to identify the most appropriate and cost-effective obesity management techniques for Saudi and Arab patients, which can enable policymakers to make evidence-based decisions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) to achieve weight loss in Saudi Arabian adults with obesity.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted at Al-Safa 1, a primary health care center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between December 2014 and June 2015. It was a 12-week interventional randomized controlled trial with open-label parallel assignment. The aim was to evaluate the effect of an ILI compared with an education-only active comparator (AC) to achieve a 5% reduction in weight for Arab men and women with obesity. The intervention was mainly administered with minimal help from the center&#x02019;s staff. Ethical approval was obtained from the Scientific Committee and the Scientific Research Ethics Committee of Ministry of Health, Jeddah, before starting the data collection. The protocol has been registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov with registration identifier: NCT02464566. This study follows the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p><p>Participants were recruited through the study&#x02019;s obesity clinic using a convenience sampling technique. Once a prospective participant was confirmed to be eligible for this study through a verbal medical interview, they received a detailed description of the study objectives, design, randomization process, and timetable. If the participant agreed to be included in the study, they were asked to provide informed consent and to sign a consent form. A copy of the consent form was given to them. The participants&#x02019; confidentiality was protected throughout the study, and participants were free to exit from the study at any time. Once the participant&#x02019;s informed consent was received, he/she was randomized to either the ILI or the AC group, as described below.

However, the sample size (n=126 individuals [63 in each group]) was needed to be able to detect a 5% inter-group difference in weight loss at 0.05 significant level, a power of 80% and 10% standard deviation. This sample size was then adjusted to account for an anticipated drop-out rate of approximately 10%, increasing the requirement to 140 individuals, with 70 individuals per group.

Within each stratum, the block randomization method ensured that equal numbers of participants were enrolled in the ILI and AC groups. For this randomization, 10 identical non-transparent envelops, with 5 envelopes containing a slip of paper indicating the ILI group and 5 envelopes containing a slip of paper indicating the AC group, were utilized. These envelopes were shuffled to ensure that the investigator was blinded to the contents of each envelope. After receiving the first participant&#x02019;s informed consent, all 10 envelopes were presented to the participant, who was instructed to select a single envelope. This envelope was then removed from the block, and the next participant was presented with the remaining 9 envelopes. This process was repeated until a block of 10 participants had received their assignments, with 5 participants randomized to each study arm. Each subsequent block was randomized by re-sealing the slips in the envelopes, re-shuffling the envelopes to ensure random and blinded distribution, and presenting the envelopes to the next 10 participants. This process was continued until the required sample size was reached. No blinding was attempted, because it was impossible to blind the participants and investigator to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intensive lifestyle intervention program</title><p>Each participant in the ILI group received a modified form (namely, shorter duration and different dietary approach) of the recommended lifestyle intervention (diet, exercise, and behavioral techniques to facilitate adherence) based on the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the USPSTF&#x02019;s 5-A framework,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> outlined as follows:</p><p><italic>Assess:</italic> the behavioral factors and risks that contribute to progress in behavioral change.</p><p><italic>Advise:</italic> the participant regarding the behavioral change process, with clear, specific, and personalized information regarding the benefits of weight control and the harmful effects of obesity.</p><p><italic>Agree:</italic> on treatments to achieve behavior change that is tailored to the patient&#x02019;s personal interests and treatment goals.</p><p><italic>Assist:</italic> with behavior change techniques that help the patient to achieve the previously planned goals.</p><p>This behavioral approach is based on the 3 main components of lifestyle interventions, for example, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) methods; these components are goal setting, self-monitoring, and stimulus control.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Goal setting</title><p>The weight loss goals were 0.5-1.0 kg/week, with an ultimate goal of a &#x02265;5% reduction in their body weight at the end of the 12-week period.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Self-monitoring: Daily food and exercise records were given to the ILI participants to self-monitor their behavior change progress.

To measure this weight loss, we used a validated weigh scale (Cardinal Detecto, model No. 6129, Aloyayna Medical, KSA, Jeddah). Each participant&#x02019;s height was measured by the physician at the initial session to calculate his/her body mass index (BMI). The secondary study outcomes were changes in weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 weeks. These parameters were measured at the initial session and at week 12 for participants in both groups.

A test for normal distribution was performed for all data, and inter-group differences in normally distributed data were evaluated using the independent sample t-test. The paired t-test was used to evaluate intra-group differences over the study period.

Participants in the ILI program were also significantly more likely to achieve the desired 5% weight loss.

Although this program was only 12 weeks long and was administered in a primary care center, 33 (47.1%) participants from the ILI group achieved the 5% weight loss target, compared with only 18 (25.7%) participants from the AC group (<italic>p</italic>=0.008). The 47.1% success rate in the ILI group is comparable to results from other studies, such as the DPP study, in which 50% of the participants in the lifestyle intervention group achieved &#x02265;7% weight loss within 24 weeks.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In the 2011 ShapeUp Rhode Island program, which lasted for 12 weeks, 42% of the individuals who received an internet-based behavioral program achieved 5% weight loss, and optional group sessions increased the success rate to 54%.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A Japanese study by Nakata et al<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> found that 5% weight loss was achieved by 89% of participants who received 6 months of intensive intervention, compared with only 29% in a health education group. Thus, our findings indicate that a relatively short intervention (12 weeks versus 6 months) may not preclude achieving good success rates if the other supportive factors are addressed. The mean weight reduction in the present study was similar to those reported in previous studies. For example, the ILI program provided an additional weight loss of 2.77 kg, compared with the education-only group (ILI: 5.58 kg and 5.37% versus AC: 2.8 kg and 2.62%; <italic>p</italic>=0.002). In the ShapeUp Rhode Island study, a 3-month internet-based behavioral program and group session provided greater weight reduction (6.1%, standard error [SE] = 0.6) to participants than did an internet-only intervention (4.2%, SE = 0.6) or the standard intervention (1.1%; SE = 0.9).<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Furthermore, Nakata et al<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> found that a 3-month intervention program provided 6.0 &#x000b1; 3.0 kg of weight loss, compared with 2.4 &#x000b1; 2.9 kg in the control group.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It is well known that the group therapy in weight loss trials and the lifestyle intervention programs in academic or research centers have favorable effects on patient outcomes, which may partially explain the superior results of the Japanese study.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The present study demonstrated that an effective ILI program can be administered in the primary care setting, despite previous studies frequently indicating that primary care programs are ineffective.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Nevertheless, our findings may also emphasize the importance of establishing specialized obesity clinics or specialized obesity sessions, using a program similar to the one used in the present study, to overcome obstacles such as lack of physician time and training that impede these programs. The present study&#x02019;s ILI program used several behavioral approaches, including goal setting, self-monitoring, and stimulus control, as these approaches are the main components of lifestyle interventions.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In this program, the participants maintained daily records of their meals, sport activities, psychological status, and repeated weight measurements, which in turn allowed them to understand how eating and physical activity behaviors were related to weight loss or gain. It is likely that this knowledge helped the ILI group to achieve better outcomes, compared to the AC group. Moreover, the present study demonstrated that ILI programs can be effective among Arab patients, and that appropriate resource allocation can facilitate the successful large-scale execution of ILI programs in the primary care setting. The high prevalence of obesity among Saudis<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> further emphasizes the need to implement similar programs, and to perform further research to evaluate their success.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Study limitations</title><p>First, despite significant inter-group differences in weight loss and waist and hip circumference measurements, the improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not statistically significant. This phenomenon is not exclusive to our study: the study by Nakata et al<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and the Arab women study<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> found that the improvements in most secondary outcomes were not statistically significant. However, the baseline blood pressures of our participants were mostly within the normal range, which may have precluded observation of any significant intervention-related improvements. Furthermore, the present study may not have had sufficient statistical power to evaluate differences in blood pressure. Second, 36% of the participants dropped out of this study (similar proportions dropped out of the ILI and AC groups). High attrition rates are common in obesity studies, especially those that involve lifestyle interventions. For example, one systematic review found that attrition rates range from 10-80%, depending on the setting and the type of program,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and an intervention trial of different diets found a mean attrition rate of &#x0003e;40% within the first 12 months.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Because the present study was performed in a primary care setting, where the effectiveness of such interventions has often been shown to be poor duet to the lack of physician time and training<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and was mainly administered by the first author (with minimal help from the center&#x02019;s staff), an attrition rate of 36% is understandable. In future studies or programs, better trial adherence may be achieved with the assistance of a specialized administrative team and electronic systems, which have been proven to enhance adherence and decrease the no-show of patients.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Third, communication with the prospective participants was hampered by the absence of an official communication system with the primary care center&#x02019;s patients. Thus, advertising the program and recruitment required an excessive amount of time and effort. Lastly, this trial lacked sufficient funding to evaluate more invasive secondary outcomes (namely, blood sugar levels and lipid profiles) and to follow-up the participants for a longer period (one year or more). Thus, future studies should incorporate these tests and plan for long-term follow-up to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of ILI programs on these important cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p>In conclusion, this study found that participants in a primary care-based ILI program were significantly more likely to achieve a 5% weight reduction, and exhibited significantly greater weight loss at 3 months than the AC group. Thus, this ILI program was effective in promoting weight loss among Arab adults with obesity in the primary care setting and is a practical option for policy makers to implement in primary care centers. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of ILI in this population, and to identify effective methods for long-term weight loss maintenance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Dr. Rajaa Alraddadi for her supervision and continuous encouragement during this project.
