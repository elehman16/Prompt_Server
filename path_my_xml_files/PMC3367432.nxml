Measurements were obtained in two sessions, one week apart, by two examiners with three devices in a randomized order. Nine measurements were taken (three with each device) on one randomly selected eye of each patient in each measurement session. The coefficient of repeatability and interobserver reproducibility for the values of each method were calculated. The limits of agreement between techniques were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences in CCT values between sessions for each of the three devices (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The repeatability coefficients for the Artemis-2 (&#x000b1;8 &#x003bc;m/&#x000b1;9 &#x003bc;m) were superior to those of the SP-3000P (&#x000b1;9 &#x003bc;m/&#x000b1;11 &#x003bc;m) and DGH 500 (&#x000b1;12 &#x003bc;m/&#x000b1;12 &#x003bc;m) in session 1/session 2 respectively, while the interobserver reproducibility index (differences between session 1 and session 2) was superior for the SP-3000P (&#x000b1;17 &#x003bc;m) with respect to DHG-500 (&#x000b1;29 &#x003bc;m) and the Artemis-2 (&#x000b1;31 &#x003bc;m). In session 1 and session 2, the limits of agreement between the techniques were 35 &#x003bc;m to &#x02212;31 &#x003bc;m and 34 to &#x02212;20 &#x003bc;m, respectively, for DGH-500 versus Artemis-2, 73 &#x003bc;m to 3 &#x003bc;m and 60 &#x003bc;m to 9 &#x003bc;m for Artemis-2 versus SP-3000P, and 58 &#x003bc;m to 22 &#x003bc;m and 72 &#x003bc;m to 10 &#x003bc;m for DGH-500 versus SP-3000P comparisons. The DGH-500 and Artemis-2 gave similar values (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) in both sessions, but both (Artemis-2 and DGH-500) values were significantly greater than that of the SP-3000P (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in both sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Repeatability was comparably good for the three techniques. However, interobserver reproducibility was approximately twice as good with the SP-3000P compared with the other two devices. The Artemis-2 CCT values consistently agreed with the DGH-500 and less so with the SP-3000P. The Artemis-2 provided CCT values that were, on average, 38 &#x003bc;m and 34 &#x003bc;m greater than that of the SP-3000P in session 1 and session 2, respectively.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cornea thickness</kwd><kwd>Artemis-2 ultrasound</kwd><kwd>hand-held ultrasound</kwd><kwd>SP-3000P noncontact specular microscopy</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Assessment of central corneal thickness (CCT) has assumed considerable clinical importance in relation to the planning of corneal refractive surgery,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-6-761">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-6-761">2</xref> management after refractive surgery,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-6-761">3</xref> diagnosis and monitoring of corneal ectasia such as keratoconus and Fuchs&#x02019; dystrophy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-opth-6-761">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-6-761">5</xref> and in the evaluation of corneal health in patients with contact lenses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-6-761">6</xref> It has also been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of primary open angle glaucoma,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-6-761">7</xref> and to have an influence on intraocular pressure measurements obtained by Goldmann applanation tonometry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-6-761">8</xref> Variations in CCT change the resistance of the cornea to indentation. Whereas a thinner cornea may require less force to flex, leading to underestimation of the true intraocular pressure, a thicker cornea may require a greater force to bend it, thus giving an artifactually high intraocular pressure reading.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-6-761">9</xref> This could lead to a misclassification in the diagnosis of patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma. Accurate determination of corneal thickness is also essential in selection of the right candidates for cornea refractive surgery, because its value helps to determine the feasibility of surgery, the best type of surgery, and the surgical plan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-6-761">10</xref> The most commonly used technique for measuring corneal thickness is hand-held ultrasound pachymetry, a technique that has long been considered the traditional &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of measurement but which is currently being challenged, as newer, more precise devices are introduced. Inherent disadvantages of ultrasound pachymetry include the fact that the eye under evaluation must be anesthetized, a probe must contact the corneal surface directly, and the results obtained may be adversely affected by fluctuations in tissue hydration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-6-761">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-6-761">12</xref> Accurate measurement of CCT with the hand-held ultrasound pachymeter relies on placement of the probe as close as possible to the central cornea. Higher values will be obtained if the probe is not placed at 90 degrees to the corneal surface or if placed slightly off center.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-6-761">3</xref> With hand-held ultrasound pachymetry, the same place on the cornea is not measured on every occasion, and because the cornea varies in thickness according to location, this adds to some error. Recently, various methods have been used to measure CCT, including ultrasound biomicroscopy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-6-761">13</xref> noncontact specular microscopy (SP-3000P),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-6-761">14</xref> slit scanning (Orbscan),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-6-761">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-6-761">15</xref> optical pachymetry,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-6-761">11</xref> coherence interferometry,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-6-761">16</xref> high-frequency ultrasound (Artemis-2),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-6-761">17</xref> Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-6-761">18</xref> and optical coherence tomography (Visante).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-6-761">19</xref> The basic operational theory of these instruments is the same, ie, the reflection of light or ultrasound from the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces allows the instrument to assess the thickness of the cornea at that location. The Topcon SP-3000P noncontact specular microscope (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) is an upgraded version of the SP-2000P which includes a function to evaluate the endothelial layer simultaneous with assessment of corneal thickness. Focusing on the endothelium, this instrument provides specular images and measures focal distance, from which the corneal thickness can be calculated. With an enhanced image memory, five images for each eye can be taken simultaneously, in contrast with three using the older version.</p><p>The hand-held ultrasound pachymeter DGH-500 (DGH Technology Inc, Exon, PA), operating at a frequency of 50 mHz, emits short acoustic pulses and detects reflections from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea. Corneal thickness is then calculated from the measured time-of-flight between these reflections using the accepted speed of sound in the cornea of 1636&#x02013;1640 m/sec.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-6-761">3</xref> Variability in ultrasound pachymetry measurements is largely dependent on decentration, the oblique incidence of light, and compression of the cornea by the probe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-6-761">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-6-761">14</xref></p><p>The Artemis-2 (Artemis Medical Technologies Inc, BC, Canada) as described by the manufacturer is a high-frequency precision ultrasound device that uses a 20&#x02013;60 mHz transducer to scan the eye in an arc, the curvature of which approximates that of the anterior ocular surface. It enables wide angle pachymetry of the individual layers of the cornea continuously over the central 10 mm diameter of the cornea,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-opth-6-761">20</xref> with a central frequency of 38 &#x000b1; 2 mHz and a scan repetition frequency of 2 Hz. Measurements can also be made of the anatomic structures, including the anterior chamber depth, angle-to-angle width, and sulcus to-sulcus width. The instrument has an axial and lateral resolution of 35 &#x003bc;m, and 65 &#x003bc;m, respectively. In Artemis-2, the cornea is offset from the probe by being immersed in a normal saline medium. The probe is moved in an arc-shaped trajectory that is matched approximately to the corneal curvature, enabling near normal incidence at all positions during scanning. The device incorporates a fixation light for the patient and an optical camera for visualization of the patient&#x02019;s eye for the examiner to assure centration.</p><p>As reported by Bland and Altman,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-opth-6-761">21</xref> comparison of new measurement techniques with established ones in clinical measurement is often needed to assess whether the results of the two methods agree sufficiently for the new technique to replace the old. If the new method agrees sufficiently well with the old, then the two methods may be used interchangeably and the old may be replaced. In order to know the extent of agreement between the techniques, assessing their repeatabilities is important, because repeatability limits the amount of agreement between techniques.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-opth-6-761">21</xref></p><p>This study was undertaken to assess the repeatability and interobserver reproducibility of CCT measurements obtained using the high-frequency ultrasound system (Artemis-2), and also to compare the results with those of established CCT measurement techniques, ultrasound pachymetry, and noncontact specular microscope.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the college institutional review board of the university. Verbal informed consent was obtained from each participant after the study protocol had been clearly explained, and the study was carried out between October 2011 and February 2012. Thirty-two subjects (14 women and 18 men) of mean age 24 &#x000b1; 5 (range 21&#x02013;42) years, were randomly selected from students of different colleges of the university for a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. This prospective study was conducted at the Department of Optometry outpatient clinic. Subjects had to be oculovisually healthy, with no history or observable signs of ocular surgery, corneal opacities, corneal edemas, corneal dystrophies, or active ocular surface disease. Subjects who had difficulty sitting through the measurements with any one of the pieces of equipment (usually with the Artemis-2) were also excluded. Contact lens wearers were required to discontinue lens wear 24 hours before the day of examination. Three subjects were lost to follow-up and one was excluded because of a corneal scar.</p><sec><title>Measurement techniques</title><p>All measurements were taken between 11 am and 2 pm in order to minimize the effects of diurnal variation in CCT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-opth-6-761">22</xref> CCT measurements were first obtained with the SP-3000P, and subsequent measurements were randomized between the Artemis-2 and the DGH-500. This was due to the fact that the Artemis-2 scanner and DGH-500 measure CCT invasively, while the SP-3000P is noninvasive in its assessment. Randomization for both the selected eye of each patient and for the order of measurement with the ultrasound devices were carried out using a table of random numbers generated from an Microsoft Excel spread sheet. CCT measurements were repeated on a second visit approximately one week later to assess repeatability. There was no randomization during the second visit. The eye assessed for CCT was the same eye that was measured during the first visit and the order of measurement with the ultrasound devices was reversed from the order in session 1. During the first visit, the same examiner obtained CCT readings with the SP-3000P and the DGH-500, while the other examiner obtained the measurement with the Artemis-2. In session 2, the examiners were rotated. With all techniques, three average CCT measurements were recorded and used for further comparative analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Topcon SP-3000P noncontact specular microscopy</title><p>For CCT measurements using the specular microscope, corneal images were captured with the chin on the chin rest, the head on the forehead rest, and the subject fixating the central target. The automatic image capture low intensity mode of the specular microscope was employed in this study to minimize examiner-dependent bias. Three average CCT measurements were recorded for each eye in each session, with each average comprising five CCT readings. A total of 15 CCT readings were taken for each eye per session using the automatic image capture mode.</p></sec><sec><title>Artemis-2 high-frequency ultrasound</title><p>The Artemis-2 system measurement was carried out as directed by the manufacturers, and also as described by Paul et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-6-761">3</xref> With the subject seated, the chin and forehead appropriately positioned, the eye to be assessed was placed in a soft-rimmed eyecup. The subject fixated on a narrowly focused aiming beam, which was coaxial with the corneal apex through an aperture surrounded by a disposable viscoelastic transparent membrane. Subjects were then advised to position themselves so that they could achieve a good seal all around the eye. This prevented any leakage of saline. Normal sterile saline was then filled into the eyepiece to form an acoustic coupling medium between the eye and the transparent membrane. In this manner, the position of each scan plane was maintained about a single point on the cornea, and cornea mapping was therefore centered on the cornea vertex. The ultrasound transducer and scan mechanism were submerged in degassed water within the body of the scanner and separated from the eye by the transparent membrane. Behind the transducer was an optical system including a beam-splitter, a blinking fixation light, and a digital infrared camera. With the subject directing his or her gaze at the fixation light, the scan axis was centered by moving the scan mechanism with a joystick until the crosshair representing the ultrasound axis was centered within the pupil. When proper alignment was achieved, the range of the transducer to the cornea was adjusted to place the cornea in the acoustic focal plane. When alignments were complete, continuous B scans were acquired by the operator (measurements are valid in any direction). About ten B scans were obtained for each subject, while only three valid Artemis-2 scan images which conformed to the corneal arc shape in all directions were then analyzed with the Artemis-2 software. The software of the instrument was used to correct these images geometrically (measurements conforming to corneal arc shape in all directions) for each eye.</p><p>To obtain the cornea thickness values, a live measuring tool is displayed, in which the yellow line indicates the thickness of the position of interest (the thickness value is displayed in green color). CCT was then determined by placing the measuring tool on the central cornea. The value displayed was then recorded for each of the three selected scans and used for statistical analysis. The corneal sound velocity setting used for analysis of Artemis-2 data was 1636 m/sec.</p></sec><sec><title>DGH-500 hand-held ultrasound pachymeter</title><p>For ultrasound pachymetry measurements, the cornea was anesthetized with one drop of 1% tetracaine hydrochloride, while the ultrasound probe was disinfected with an alcohol swab before each subject. Subjects were seated while looking straight ahead and the probe was lightly placed perpendicularly to the central corneal surface taking care to avoid excessive compression of the probe tip against the cornea. The pupil center was used as reference for probe placement. The ultrasound velocity was set to 1640 m/sec for all measurements, in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendation for calibration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Graphpad Instat version 3.00 (Graphpad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) was used for the statistical analysis.

The results of this study are consistent with these findings. In both sessions, both ultrasound devices (Artemis-2 and DGH-500) caused overestimation of corneal thickness values and therefore a relative underestimation for SP-3000P. The difference between the SP-3000P pachymetry values and the two ultrasound devices used in our study is most likely the result of different operating principles. The noncontact specular microscopy is dependent on the reflection of light, and the DGH-500 depends on the reflection of ultrasonic waves from the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces. The exact posterior reflection point is not known in DGH-500, but it may be located between the Descement membrane and the anterior chamber. If the reflection point is located at the anterior chamber, this will cause overestimation of the corneal thickness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-6-761">14</xref></p><p>Measurements of CCT taken with the DGH-500 and the Artemis-2 were in agreement because no significant difference was returned for both these ultrasonic devices. In an earlier study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-6-761">3</xref> comparing Artemis-2 CCT measurements with those of a hand-held ultrasound pachymeter, the Artemis-2 measured significant thinner (11 &#x003bc;m) CCT values when compared with ultrasound pachymetry in normal subjects. This could be due to the fact that our sample was more homogeneous considering the ages of the subjects and, as such, less prone to variations. With the exception of the DGH-500, the within-subject repeatability of CCT measurements found in the present study in both sessions (3.7 &#x003bc;m and 3.4 &#x003bc;m for the Artemis-2; 5.1 &#x003bc;m and 5.0 &#x003bc;m for the SP- 3000P) was within the range of 3&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;m repeatability reported for CCT measurements obtained in a standard clinical setting with the patient in a sitting position.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-opth-6-761">32</xref> This suggests that within-subject repeatability was best with the Artemis-2 and worst with the DGH-500. The main sources of error affecting the repeatability of ultrasound pachymetry include placement of the probe, maintaining its perpendicularity on the cornea, and compression of the cornea by the probe. The Artemis-2 is largely unaffected by these factors because the cornea is offset from the probe by a normal saline immersion medium while the scanning is done.</p><p>The interobserver coefficient of reproducibility (between sessions) with the two ultrasonic devices was almost twice that with the SP-3000P, showing that CCT measurements obtained by the SP-3000P were the most interobserver-reproducible, possibly because of smaller operator-dependent biases with the positioning of the patient and/or the device. In a comparative study by Modis et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-opth-6-761">27</xref> assessing the CCT of normal white adults, a slightly inferior repeatability coefficient of 12.6 &#x003bc;m and 17.9 &#x003bc;m (first and second investigator, respectively) with respect to our observation (12.4 &#x003bc;m and 12.1 &#x003bc;m, for the first and second session, respectively) was reported for ultrasound pachymetry. In the present study, the second examiner obtained higher thickness values using ultrasound pachymetry, which further reaffirms that CCT measurements obtained using ultrasound pachymetry are observer-dependent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-6-761">11</xref> Its accuracy is dependent on placement of the probe perpendicular to the cornea, in the same spot from one measurement to the next. A few authors have also reported similar variability in CCT values obtained between observers with ultrasound pachymetry in healthy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-opth-6-761">33</xref> and keratoconic eyes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-opth-6-761">34</xref></p><p>Although excellent repeatability was established for the three tested devices, there were significant differences between the SP-3000P and the two ultrasonic devices in determination of CCT in young normal subjects. Further studies are needed to verify this relationship in larger samples of normal subjects and in subjects with raised intraocular pressure, and also to establish a possible correction factor for SP-3000P because it consistently measures CCT values lower than the popularly used measurement techniques. Increasing the number of subjects will enhance the statistical power of the present study.</p><p>Generally, SP-3000P may be preferred for routine measurement and monitoring of CCT in older patients and children because obtaining CCT measurement by SP-3000P is rapid, easy, requires no expertise or topical anesthetic, and is noninvasive. However, in comparison with the Artemis-2, the DGH-500 is less invasive, easy to use, requires little space, and measurements are obtained in a shorter time. In contrast, it is unlikely that the Artemis will be commonly used in routine CCT measurements because it is more invasive, takes a longer time to obtain CCT measurements in a patient, it is difficult to have patients immerse their eye in the eye cup filled with saline and maintain fixation, is more expensive, is bulky, and requires a much larger space, and most importantly needs constant maintenance and calibration. Also, using the Artemis-2 requires adequate training and expertise and, as such, CCT measurements by Artemis-2 cannot be delegated to nonprofessionals. Measurements in children may be very difficult or impossible. However, the Artemis-2 may play an important role in research laboratories for the purposes of collecting data and comparison, and also during planning and monitoring of refractive surgeries.</p><p>In conclusion, CCT measurements with the Artemis-2 high-frequency ultrasound device are comparable with those measured with DGH-500, but neither ultrasonic device gave CCT readings comparable with those measured with the SP-3000P. Repeatability was good for the three techniques, but best with the Artemis-2. However, interobserver reproducibility was best for the SP-3000P, with each of the reproducibility coefficients for the DGH-500 and Artemis-2 almost double that of the SP-3000P. Therefore, when recording CCT for the purpose of planning a surgery (or for post-surgical CCT monitoring), the CCT readings from the ultrasound devices assessed here may be used interchangeably, but neither can be used interchangeably with the SP-3000P noncontact specular microscope.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-opth-6-761"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors do not have
