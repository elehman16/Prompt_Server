When circulating levels are high, insulin promotes deposition of glucose and fatty acids into muscle, liver and adipose and suppresses their production and release from storage sites. Conversely, when circulating metabolic fuels are low, counter-regulatory hormones (especially glucagon, and also cortisol, epinephrine and growth hormone) stimulate lipolysis, glycogenolysis, gluconeogensis, and ketone formation <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ludwig1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Many studies have shown that circulating levels of the individual fuels affect appetite <xref rid="pone.0058172-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Scharrer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ludwig2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Chearskul1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In both rodent <xref rid="pone.0058172-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Scharrer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and human <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ludwig2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> models, hypoglycemia and decreased FFA levels lead to increased food intake. Limited data also suggest that ketones, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), decrease appetite <xref rid="pone.0058172-Chearskul1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, these studies of individual fuels may not provide a comprehensive view of the metabolic regulation of hunger, because the body can utilize a varying mix of fuels under varying dietary conditions. Indeed, numerous popular weight loss diets have advocated specific macronutrient prescriptions, in part because of their intrinsic effects on metabolism and hunger <xref rid="pone.0058172-National1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-United1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Agatston1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Atkins1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>We previously proposed that high glycemic load diets reduce availability of metabolic fuels in the postprandial period by eliciting a high insulin to glucagon ratio, leading to excessive hunger and overeating <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ludwig2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. (Whereas glycemic index measures how a food or meal affects postprandial blood glucose, controlling for carbohydrate amount, glycemic load is the multiplicative product of glycemic index and carbohydrate amount <xref rid="pone.0058172-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.) The purpose of this study is to examine a novel measure of total circulating energy availability (EA), defined as the combined relative energy density (circulating level&#x000d7;relative energy content) of each of the major metabolic fuels, in overweight and obese young adults consuming diets ranging widely in macronutrients. Specifically, we propose that EA will be lower after a high glycemic load (low-fat, LF) diet in the postprandial period, compared to diets with a moderate glycemic load (moderate fat, low-glycemic index, LGI) or low glycemic load (very low-carbohydrate, VLC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview</title><p>This postprandial study was conducted in the setting of a larger clinical trial, comprising run-in and test phases <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ebbeling1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. During the run-in phase, we collected baseline data, restricted energy intake using a balanced hypocaloric diet <xref rid="pone.0058172-Appel1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> to achieve a 10&#x02013;15% loss in body weight, and determined energy requirements for maintaining weight loss. During the test phase, we conducted a three-way crossover study to evaluate isocaloric diets (LF, LGI, and VLC) in random order, under conditions of weight-loss maintenance. Postprandial outcomes were assessed following test meals, reflecting respective diets, during an inpatient hospital admission at the end of each 4-week diet. Data for this substudy were collected at Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital and Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2006 and November 2008.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from the greater Boston area using flyers, newspaper advertisements, and Internet postings that described the study as an opportunity for weight loss with provision of meals.

</p><p>Several assumptions were made in the calculation of EA. Consistent with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0058172-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Fuehrlein1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, BHB was used as a proxy for total ketone levels because acetoacetate, the other bioavailable ketone, is unstable and must be measured immediately after sample collection <xref rid="pone.0058172-Carmant1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. There are many different forms of FFA with different chain lengths and molecular weights; our conversion of FFA from mol/L to kcal/L was based on an estimated average chain length of 17 in light of prior studies indicating a range of 16.0&#x02013;17.7 (32&#x02013;36). Substituting estimated average chain lengths of 16 and 18 did not materially change the results. Additionally, the FFA calculation assumes the same energy density as triglycerides, thus ignoring the relatively minor contribution of the glycerol moiety. In calculating EA, we included only substrates that are readily available for cellular metabolism.

REE was measured while the subject was lying awake and still in a temperature-regulated room with minimal light and noise. During the postprandial period, a DVD with calm programming (i.e., travelogue) was shown to prevent boredom and sleep. At rest and following the test meal, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured for 30 minutes of every hour. Using data averaged over the last 20 minutes of each measurement interval, energy expenditure was calculated using the Weir equation <xref rid="pone.0058172-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and respiratory quotient was estimated as the ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption. We assumed no change in body composition during weight stability for 1 month on each of the three diets, an assumption supported by a 6-month weight loss study showing similar loss of lean relative to fat tissue with a LF or VLC diet <xref rid="pone.0058172-Brehm1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were glucose, FFA, BHB, glucagon, insulin, cortisol, epinephrine, metabolic rate, and hunger ratings.

We modeled EA as a function of diet and time, with an interaction term to allow the time course to vary by diet, using repeated-measures analysis of variance with an autoregressive covariance structure to account for within-subject correlation. For each period, using parameters of the fitted model, we estimated mean EA for each diet; constructed pairwise differences among diets; and tested the hypothesis that mean EA was equal in all 3 diets. When that hypothesis was rejected at p&#x0003c;0.05, we performed additional pairwise comparisons with a Bonferroni-adjusted critical p-value of 0.05/3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.017. Secondary outcomes, including areas under the curve, were analyzed similarly. We did not adjust for diet order, given that this 6-level covariate would consume most of our inter-subject degrees of freedom, making inferences impossible.

We proposed a novel outcome measure, EA, which combines the relative energy available from three major metabolic fuels (glucose, FFA, and BHB) and hypothesized that an LF meal would lower total metabolic fuel availability and energy expenditure in the late postprandial period by causing a high insulin to glucagon ratio secondary to a high dietary glycemic load.</p><p>As hypothesized, the LF meal led to lower EA in the late postprandial period compared with the LGI and VLC meals. Consistent with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ludwig2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Freinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Owens1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the early postprandial period after an LF meal was characterized by a high glucose level and concomitant exaggerated insulin response. Despite the high glucose peak 30 minutes after the LF meal, EA did not differ in the early postprandial period due to suppression of FFA and BHB after this meal. In the late postprandial period, the expected reactive hypoglycemia <xref rid="pone.0058172-Freinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Owens1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> did not occur; differences in late postprandial EA were instead due to significantly lower levels of FFA after the LF meal as compared with the LGI and VLC meals, and lower levels of BHB after the LF meal as compared with the VLC meal. These patterns are similar to those observed with testing after a single meal, suggesting that the difference in EA is likely not due to habituation to a given dietary pattern <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ludwig2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Similarly to EA, metabolic rate did not differ after the three test meals in the early postprandial period but differed significantly in the late postprandial period, with higher metabolic rate after a VLC meal than an LF or LGI meal. This sustained high postprandial metabolic rate after the VLC meal may contribute to the findings that total energy expenditure decreases less after weight loss on a VLC diet than on an LF or LGI diet <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ebbeling1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, with potential implications for risk of weight regain.</p><p>There was no significant effect of diet on hunger ratings. Unlike prior work examining the effect of similar test meals on postprandial hunger <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ludwig2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, this study relied on hunger ratings and did not measure <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake elicited by hunger, a potentially more valid assessment. Several studies have shown that hunger ratings do not necessarily predict equal weight regain on the three diets <xref rid="pone.0058172-Mattes1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Moreover, our methods may not adequately distinguish between homeostatic hunger, which develops over hours in the absence of caloric intake, and hedonic hunger, which relates to the presence of palatable food and environmental eating cues <xref rid="pone.0058172-Lowe1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>A strength of the current study is the novelty of the primary outcome, a composite measure of EA comprising the relative availability of energy from glucose, FFA, and ketones. In addition, the protocol was conducted in a highly controlled setting allowing for accurate formulation of the test diets and collection of outcome data. Furthermore, the significant separation of respiratory quotient values, and the differences in glucose and insulin as expected based on calculated dietary glycemic load, show that we achieved the desired physiologic differentiation between diets. For these reasons, we can confidently assume that the data reflect the physiologic effect of the planned dietary interventions. Other strengths include the use of a crossover design in which each participant served as his or her own control, thereby limiting variability and mitigating the effect of the small sample size, and the selection of diets that span the full range of prevailing macronutrient compositions.</p><p>This study also has several limitations. Despite the strength of crossover design and the high power, the sample size was small, limiting generalizability. Several assumptions were made in calculating EA, though these assumptions rest upon physiological principles and withstand sensitivity analysis (in the case of FFA). The analysis did not include lactate, a labile metabolite that may be higher after an LF meal than a VLC meal <xref rid="pone.0058172-Koutsari1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. For this reason, failure to account for lactate may produce bias favoring the study hypothesis. However, the difference in lactate concentration between LF and VLC meals in a previous study was only about 0.2 mmol/L throughout the late postprandial period <xref rid="pone.0058172-Koutsari1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Using a molecular weight of 90 and an energy content of 3.6 kcal/g, a 0.2 mmol/L difference in lactate concentration would equal 0.06 kcal/L, a relatively small effect compared with the observed difference of 0.62 kcal/L between the LF and VLC diets in the late postprandial period in our study. Moreover, the use of BHB as a proxy for total ketones, without also taking acetoacetate into account, would underestimate EA in dietary conditions with higher total ketone concentration, such as the VLC diet, thereby producing bias toward the null hypothesis. Because the normal ratio of BHB to acetoacetate is 1&#x02236;1 <xref rid="pone.0058172-Laffel1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, we would expect a mean difference in acetoacetate concentration between the LF and VLC meals in the late postprandial period to equal about 0.1 mmol/L, adding 0.05 kcal/L to the difference between these two meals during that time period (using a molecular weight of 102, and an energy content of 5 kcal/g). Therefore, the unaccounted EA related to acetoacetate essentially counterbalances any bias related to lactate. Another concern is that our measure of EA is based upon absolute concentrations of metabolic fuels, rather than flux into and out of cells. Additional research will be needed to determine how dietary composition may affect these fluxes. Nevertheless, the absolute concentration of nutrients has inherent relevance, as implicitly recognized by the concept of hypoglycemia <xref rid="pone.0058172-Ludwig2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Moreover, we cannot ascribe findings from this study to the effects of any specific macronutrient, as the diets differed in many ways from one another. However, the similarity in protein content between the LF and LGI diets rules out a primary role of this key macronutrient. A final limitation arises from the lack of data on <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake in the postprandial period.</p><p>In conclusion, this study finds that EA in the postprandial state differs among diets, and may have implications for weight maintenance after weight loss. This finding does not support the use of LF diets, as presently endorsed by many organizations <xref rid="pone.0058172-National1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-United1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Franz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058172-Lichtenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, for weight-loss maintenance. Additional research in this area appears to be warranted, including more careful assessment of homeostatic and hedonic hunger and comparison of EA and rates of weight regain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the study staff Hope Forbes, Sarah Kalil, and Erica Garcia-Lago for assistance with data collection and management; Karen Yee, Rachel Froelich, and Lisa Bielak for implementation of the dietary interventions; and Meredith Beard for administrative support.
