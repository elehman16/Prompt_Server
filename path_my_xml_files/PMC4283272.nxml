Findings from preclinical studies suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and proton-pump inhibitors might enhance &#x003b2;-cell survival and regeneration. We postulated that sitagliptin and lansoprazole would preserve &#x003b2;-cell function in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial (REPAIR-T1D). Participants aged 11&#x02013;36 years, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within the past 6 months were recruited from Sanford Health Systems (Sioux Falls, SD, USA; Fargo, ND, USA), Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota (St Paul, MN, USA), and Rady Children's Hospital (San Diego, CA, USA). Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral sitagliptin (100 mg for participants &#x02265;18 years, 50 mg for those &#x0003c;18 years) and lansoprazole (60 mg for participants &#x02265;18 years, 30 mg for those &#x0003c;18 years) or matched placebo for 12 months. Randomisation was done by a blocked randomisation process (blocks of three and six), with separate streams for younger (&#x0003c;18 years) and older (&#x02265;18 years) participants, and males and females. All participants and personnel remained masked until after the completion of the final 12 month visit, at which time data were unmasked to the analysis team. The primary endpoint was C-peptide response to a mixed meal challenge at 12 months measured as 2 h area under curve. Analysis was by intention to treat.

At 12 months, the mean change in C-peptide area under curve was &#x02212;229 pmol/L (95% CI &#x02212;316 to &#x02212;142) for the treatment group and &#x02212;253 pmol/L (&#x02212;383 to &#x02212;123) for the placebo group; this difference was not significant (p=0&#x000b7;77). No adverse or serious adverse events were probably or definitely related to the study treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Although the expected change in the primary endpoint was not achieved, not all participants had increases in glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastrin concentrations that were expected with treatment. Although participants did not have adverse events related to study drugs, the study is not powered to address safety definitively. Further trials including these drugs might be warranted, but should be designed to ensure appropriate selection of participants and increases in these intermediary hormones.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Sanford Research and JDRF.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder targeting pancreatic &#x003b2; cells that secrete insulin.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> It is one of the most common chronic diseases of children, and the incidence is increasing worldwide.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> For a time after diagnosis, some &#x003b2;-cell function remains, although not enough to maintain euglycaemia.

Participants in the treatment group who were 18 years or older received 100 mg sitagliptin and 60 mg lansoprazole, whereas participants younger than 18 years received half of that dose (50 mg sitagliptin and 30 mg lansoprazole). Participants in the placebo group received capsules with identical appearances to the active drugs. Throughout the study, participants continued under the care of their usual provider for routine diabetes management.</p><p>Participants returned to clinic at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 after randomisation. Residual &#x003b2;-cell function was assessed at baseline, and 6 and 12 months with a 2-h mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT). Fasting GLP-1 and gastrin concentrations were measured at these three visits. HbA<sub>1c</sub>, insulin use, and safety monitoring laboratory values were measured every 3 months. Routine laboratory measurements were done at Sanford Health (Sioux Falls, SD, USA). GLP-1 measurements were done at Pacific Biomarkers (Seattle, WA, USA). Autoantibody concentrations were assayed by immunopreciptiation at Esoterix (Calabasas Hills, CA, USA). HLA typing was done at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN, USA). C-peptide and gastrin measurements were done at Quest Diagnostics (Chantilly, VA, USA); the C-peptide chemiluminescence assay has a lower limit of detection of 0&#x000b7;03 nmol/L and a coefficient of variation of 2&#x000b7;9&#x02013;4&#x000b7;8%.

Hypoglycaemic events (blood glucose concentration &#x0003c;3&#x000b7;33 mmol/L) were solicited at every visit by recall and review of meter data.

After initial assessment, 79 participants qualified to give written informed consent and were screened across four sites; 70 were randomly assigned to study groups. After randomisation, two participants withdrew (one was from treatment group and one from placebo group) before taking any drugs, leaving 46 participants in the active treatment group (sitagliptin and lansoprazole) and 22 in the placebo group; 40 participants in the treatment group and 18 in the placebo group completed the 12-month treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).

Blood glucose AUC rose by 2&#x000b7;04 mmol/L (95% CI 1&#x000b7;09&#x02013;2&#x000b7;99) in the treatment group and 3&#x000b7;05 mmol/L (95% CI 1&#x000b7;17&#x02013;4&#x000b7;92) in the placebo group, and was not significantly different between groups (p=0&#x000b7;23; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>).

The mean rates of decline in both groups were similar to that described previously in new-onset type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>).<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The trend towards increased insulin use in both groups to maintain similar HbA<sub>1c</sub> to maintain glycaemic control is also consistent with the expected natural history of type 1 diabetes. The subgroup analyses (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>) raise the possibility of a differential effect correlating with the extent to which GLP-1 and gastrin were raised by active treatment. The REPAIR-T1D study is ongoing, with reassessments at 18 and 24 months that should help to clarify the size and duration of any benefits from this therapy. With these overall negative results, we are presenting our results in the context of a pilot to inform the design of future studies.</p><p>With few participants followed for 1 year, we cannot make a thorough assessment of the safety profile of these drugs in type 1 diabetes. Our data show no difference between groups for gastrointestinal events, which are frequent with incretin-based drugs and can restrict treatment. Although nausea and abdominal pain have also been reported with DPP-4 inhibitors, they tend to be milder than for GLP-1 receptor agonists.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The numbers of specific events (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>) are insufficient to establish whether there might be an excess of abdominal pain. The subgroup analyses (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>) raise the possibility that, in participants who did not increase either GLP-1 or gastrin concentrations, treatment with sitagliptin and lansoprazole might have had a detrimental effect. Although these data are based on a very small subgroup, they are concerning.</p><p>As with other intervention studies for type 1 diabetes, the rationale for this trial was based on promising data from rodents and explanted human cells, and an appealing mechanism. Unfortunately, the findings from this study accord with those of many of its predecessors, showing that another approach that reversed diabetes in mice has only a small effect in human beings. Recognition has been growing that traditional animal models of type 1 diabetes are unlikely to provide accurate predictions of clinical success, and that research should shift towards an emphasis on studies in human beings. Human studies, however, are complicated by increased costs, ethics considerations, and substantial variation in genetics and the environment that are not present with laboratory rodents. Recognition is also increasing that type 1 diabetes is not a homogeneous disease. The present challenges&#x02014;identifying early mechanistic markers that predict success of an intervention and participants who might benefit from different combinations of approaches&#x02014;are daunting, but urgent.</p><p>The inclusion criteria that we used are broader than is typical for similar studies. On the basis of NOD mouse data that showed regeneration of &#x003b2; cells with these drugs after diabetes onset, we chose not to exclude patients with low C-peptide at baseline and to extend eligibility to 6 months after diagnosis. After reviewing the C-peptide responses, we noted that no participants with low C-peptide at entry had recovery. Baseline C-peptide AUC values were not used to stratify randomisation; the active treatment group had a lower baseline value by 0&#x000b7;24 SD (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Although some participants (eight of 29) who had been diagnosed with diabetes for between 3&#x02013;6 months had C-peptide less than 200 pmol/L, the rest had C-peptide responses that were not distinguishable from those of participants who were enrolled up to 3 months from diagnosis. These data confirm the importance of enrolling only participants who still have sufficient C-peptide production. It is less clear whether the length of time after diagnosis is as important. In this study, those participants entering more than 3 months after diagnosis but who still maintained C-peptide production did not seem to have a worse course than those entering within the first 3 months after diagnosis.</p><p>Previous studies have used an entry criterion of peak C-peptide greater than 200 pmol/mL; our data confirm the necessity of a C-peptide response at entry, but are not sufficient to refine this threshold. Although a short duration of disease is often regarded as important to maximise C-peptide at entry, this duration might not be as important by itself. Participants recruited more than 100 days after diagnosis, but who still had C-peptide production, were indistinguishable from those enrolled sooner after diagnosis. Persistent C-peptide production months after diagnosis could reflect a milder underlying disease state and have a lower threshold for a drug to achieve the desired effect. Our results do not show differential effects based on sex. In the present regulatory environment, most drugs will need to be studied in adults. Participants older than 21 years at diagnosis might have a slower rate of C-peptide loss without intervention than those younger than 21 years.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> At a minimum, randomisation must be stratified to ensure even distribution of these adult participants, and interpretation of results should be in the context of this underlying heterogeneity. Detailed, mechanistic examination of the effects on immunophenotype are increasingly crucial in the study of this autoimmune disease and should be included in all future studies. Studies should also include additional samples to be saved to test new hypotheses.</p><p>This study has several limitations. In retrospect, this study was underpowered to detect the size of changes given the amount of variability in measurements. The power of the study falls still further when the number of participants is limited to those who had raised GLP-1 and gastrin concentrations, and who had substantial C-peptide production at baseline. This study also did not examine potential immunological effects. Despite these limitations, these results are important pilot data to inform future studies.</p><p>Palmer and colleagues<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> presented a detailed analysis and discussion of power for similar studies. Based on TrialNet natural history data, they calculated that for a power of 0&#x000b7;85 to detect a 50% difference in C-peptide with an &#x003b1; of 0&#x000b7;05, 172 participants would be required to complete the study; this number is far larger than any type 1 diabetes intervention study so far. Lachin and colleagues<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> presented similar discussion based on data from TrialNet intervention studies: with similar assumptions, their calculated sample sizes that are somewhat smaller (as small as 60) at 12 months, but similar to those from Palmer and colleagues<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> when including various age strata. Our study is not alone in being underpowered. Other studies have shown non-significant trends in several outcome variables with effect sizes of 25&#x02013;35%.<xref rid="bib5 bib7 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,7,27,28</sup></xref> To detect a smaller effect size in this range would require an even larger study. Resources for such trials, including available participants, are insufficient. As biomarkers become available for early assessment of an individual's response to intervention, adaptive trial designs will be more feasible. Until then, we must choose between doing fewer, large, well-powered studies or more smaller studies that are unlikely to give definitive answers, but which might provide preliminary information about several different approaches.</p><p>Specific to future studies with drugs acting though GLP-1 and gastrin, we recommend testing participants to ensure that GLP-1 and gastrin concentrations are maintained at concentrations greater than those of untreated individuals (eg, GLP-1 &#x0003e;11 pmol/L and gastrin &#x0003e;16&#x000b7;7 pmol/L) in this study. The slight advantages of using a GLP-1 receptor agonist instead of a DPP-4 inhibitor are shown in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>. Drugs that decrease gastric emptying or increase insulin sensitivity might reduce stimulation of &#x003b2; cells and suppress C-peptide production. For these drugs, specification of additional measures of &#x003b2;-cell preservation and function will be important.</p><p>Overall, this study did not show an effect of combination therapy with sitagliptin and lansoprazol on C-peptide AUC in patients with new-onset type 1 disease. We noted a slight trend towards preservation of &#x003b2;-cell function in a subgroup who produced increased concentrations of GLP-1 and gastrin while taking the study drug (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Although the size of this effect is slight and necessarily tentative, a future trial might investigate treatment with PPI combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist in type 1 diabetes. There is growing consensus that the immune attack on &#x003b2; cells is unlikely to be responsive to any approach involving one drug, and that combination therapy is probably necessary.<xref rid="bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29,30</sup></xref> Because GLP-1 and gastrin are postulated to help &#x003b2; cells to regenerate, they are attractive targets to combine with one or more immunomodulatory drug. A recent review<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> concurs with this notion, and also emphasises the extent to which intervention studies for type 1 diabetes have shown heterogeneity in responses, a pattern seen again in our study. To the extent that increased insulin production might stimulate autoimmunity, there is at least a risk that combined DPP-4 inhibitor and PPI therapy might worsen rather than protect against &#x003b2;-cell damage. A possible approach to ameliorate this risk might be to begin therapy with an immunomodulatory drug to decrease the intensity of autoimmunity, followed, after an appropriate interval, with the initiation of combination treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonist and PPI drugs.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><p>For the <bold>protocol</bold> see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
