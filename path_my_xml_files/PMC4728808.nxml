of choice for acute vivax malaria for more than 60&#x000a0;years. Malaria caused by <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> has recently shown resistance to chloroquine in some places. This study compared the efficacy and safety of fixed dose combination (FDC) of arterolane maleate and piperaquine phosphate (PQP) with chloroquine in the treatment of uncomplicated vivax malaria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients aged 13&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years with confirmed mono-infection of <italic>P. vivax</italic> along with fever or fever in the previous 48&#x000a0;h were included. The 317 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;159) or chloroquine (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;158) for 3&#x000a0;days. Primaquine was given as an anti-relapse measure on day 3 and continued for 14 consecutive days. Primary efficacy analysis included assessment of the proportion of aparasitaemic and afebrile patients at 72&#x000a0;h. Safety endpoints were analysis of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory data, and abnormalities on electrocardiograph. Patients participated in the study for at least 42&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In per protocol population, the proportion of aparasitaemic and afebrile patients at 72&#x000a0;h was 100&#x000a0;% (140/140) in the FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP group, and 99.3&#x000a0;% (145/146) in the chloroquine group (Fisher, p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.9999). In intent to treat population, the corresponding value was reported to be 96.9&#x000a0;% (154/159) in the FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP group and 98.7&#x000a0;% (156/158) in the chloroquine group (Fisher, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.4479). The median parasite clearance time was 24&#x000a0;h in FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP group and 26&#x000a0;h in chloroquine group (Log-rank, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.2264). Similarly, median fever clearance time was 24&#x000a0;h in both the groups (Log-rank, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.7750). In PP population, day 28 cure rates were 100&#x000a0;% in both the groups (95&#x000a0;% CI (96.52, 100.0 for FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP and 96.73, 100.0 in chloroquine group)). Incidence of adverse events was 82.4&#x000a0;% in the FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP group and 85.4&#x000a0;% in the chloroquine group. Most of the adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. The commonly reported clinical adverse events in the FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP versus chloroquine group were vomiting (5.0 vs 5.1&#x000a0;%), headache (1.3 vs 3.2&#x000a0;%) and prolonged QT (1.9 vs 3.2&#x000a0;%). No deaths were reported. The pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that arterolane maleate is well absorbed and has a relatively short t<sub>1/2</sub> of 3.2&#x000a0;h. Piperaquine is also well absorbed after oral administration with a t<sub>1/2</sub> of about 228.33&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study showed that FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP effectively cured vivax malaria and attained acceptable level of cure up to day 28.

It is prevalent in endemic areas in the Middle East, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America. In most areas where <italic>P. vivax</italic> is prevalent, malaria transmission rates are low, and the affected populations, therefore, achieve little immunity to this parasite. Consequently, people of all ages are at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>In India, chloroquine at a total dose of 25&#x000a0;mg base/kg body weight is the treatment of choice for vivax malaria, since <italic>P. vivax</italic> remains sensitive to chloroquine as shown by the therapeutic efficacy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, sporadic cases of resistance to chloroquine have been reported from India and other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In some countries, alternative regimen have been recommended for treatment of vivax malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In case there is an emergence of chloroquine resistance in vivax malaria, second-line, alternative anti-malarials should be available.</p><p>In some patients, <italic>P. vivax</italic> may cause relapse within a few weeks to a few months after initial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For its prevention, primaquine should be given at a dose of 0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight daily for 14&#x000a0;days under supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Primaquine is contra-indicated in known G6PD-deficient patients, infants and pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Caution should be exercised before administering primaquine in areas known to have high prevalence of G6PD deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although chloroquine plus primaquine is the first-line treatment for confirmed vivax malaria in most countries, emergence of chloroquine resistance has been reported from various parts of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is therefore becoming apparent that alternative treatment strategies should be investigated.</p><p>It is recommended by the WHO that in areas where artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), except artesunate plus sulfadoxine&#x02013;pyrimethamine, has been adopted as the first-line treatment for falciparum malaria, it may also be used for vivax malaria. Also, in areas with chloroquine-resistant <italic>P. vivax</italic>, ACT (particularly those whose partner medicines have long half-lives) are recommended for the treatment of vivax malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Different artemisinin-based combinations (artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine, pyronaridine artesunate, artesunate mefloquine) have been evaluated for the treatment of vivax malaria. A Cochrane review showed that dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine (RR 0.32, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.24&#x02013;0.43; four trials, 1442 participants) and artesunate plus mefloquine (RR 0.30, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.21&#x02013;0.41; four trials, 1003 participants) were more effective than artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine at reducing the incidence of <italic>P. vivax</italic> over 42&#x000a0;days&#x02019; follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A study conducted in Papua, Indonesia demonstrated that both dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine phosphate (DHA&#x02013;PQP) and artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine were tolerated and produced rapid clinical response in vivax malaria patients. However, DHA&#x02013;PQP combination provided better post-treatment prophylaxis than artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine, reducing <italic>P. vivax</italic> recurrences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The efficacy of PQP has been evaluated in the treatment of vivax malaria. In a study of 280 patients, a total dose of 1.5&#x000a0;g of PQP given over two days was compared with a combination of chloroquine base (1.2&#x000a0;g) and primaquine (30&#x000a0;mg). Both the regimens had equal efficacy in vivax malaria patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A completely synthetic ozonide anti-malarial based upon the 1,2,4-trioxolane pharmacophore was designed, optimized, developed, and named arterolane. Arterolane exhibits a rapid onset of action, potent activity against all erythrocytic stages of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Arterolane maleate is well absorbed with a t<sub>max</sub> of 4.5&#x02013;5.25&#x000a0;h. and has a relatively short t<sub>1/2</sub> of 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h. The plasma protein binding of arterolane is ~93&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A 33&#x000a0;% increase in systemic exposure to arterolane has been observed with food. Piperaquine is well absorbed following oral administration with maximum plasma piperaquine concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) attained at 2.5&#x02013;4.5&#x000a0;h (T<sub>max</sub>) post dose. The mean half-life ranged from 11 to 18&#x000a0;days&#x000a0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is highly bound to plasma proteins (&#x0003e;99&#x000a0;%). Realizing the advantages, arterolane maleate and PQP are combined in a fixed-dose combination (FDC). The tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of piperaquine makes it a promising partner drug for use with short and rapidly acting anti-malarial agents.</p><p>In a phase III study conducted with FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP in an adult population, the efficacy of the combination has already been demonstrated against falciparum malaria regardless of geographic region, patient age, gender, or degree of parasitaemia and has been found safe and well tolerated. The drug has already been used for the treatment of patients with falciparum malaria across the wider population in India for more than a year. This phase III study was designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of FDC of arterolane maleate 150&#x000a0;mg and PQP 750&#x000a0;mg in comparison to chloroquine in patients with acute uncomplicated vivax malaria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study site and enrolment</title><p>This phase III, open-label, multicentric study was conducted from November 2011 to January 2013 at nine clinical trial centres in India.

Time to event was summarized by number of events, median time and quartiles.</p><p>Primary efficacy analysis, i.e., proportion of aparasitaemic and afebrile patients at 72&#x000a0;h was performed for all evaluable (i.e., per protocol population (PP)) and all enrolled (i.e., intent to treat population (ITT)] patients. Secondary efficacy endpoint analysis [PCT, FCT and cure rate at day 28) was performed for all enrolled patients. Cure rate at day 28 was also computed on all evaluable patients. The PP population included all patients who completed a full course of study medication with a known efficacy endpoint and who did not violate the protocol in a way that could affect the efficacy analysis, i.e., the use of prohibited concomitant medication, the presence of significant disease or co-morbid illness, or major protocol violation.</p><p>Efficacy proportions were estimated along with their 95&#x000a0;% exact binomial confidence interval for each treatment group and compared between the groups using Fisher exact test and two-sided 95&#x000a0;% Wilson&#x02019;s confidence interval.

The efficacy rate of more than 95&#x000a0;% was reported at 72&#x000a0;h in the both treatment groups.</p><p>It is recommended by WHO that in areas where ACT, except artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine which is not effective against <italic>P. vivax</italic> in many places, has been adopted as the first-line treatment for falciparum malaria, may also be used for vivax malaria. Also, in areas with chloroquine-resistant <italic>P. vivax</italic>, ACT (particularly the combination having partner medicines with long-half-lives) is recommended for the treatment of vivax malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The artemisinin derivatives are the most rapidly acting and potent among anti-malarial medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Arterolane maleate is the short-acting component in the FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP, which contributes significantly in achieving early parasite clearance. The time to parasite clearance and fever clearance seen with FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP in this study are on expected lines since the clinical efficacy of the artemisinin derivatives is characterized by an almost immediate onset of activity and rapid reduction of parasitaemia, with complete clearance in most cases within 48&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Median time to parasite clearance was 24.0&#x000a0;h in FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP group and 26.0&#x000a0;h in chloroquine group. Median FCT was 24.0&#x000a0;h in both the treatment groups.</p><p>Day 28 cure rates were 100&#x000a0;% in PP population in both the treatment groups. In ITT population analysis cure rates were reported to be close to 70&#x000a0;% because most of the patients were lost to follow-up, which was considered as failure in the statistical analysis. The possible reason for loss of patients to follow up was migration as the study was conducted in urban settings.</p><p>Effectiveness of FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP for <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections would establish a common treatment for both circulating <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>. FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP is highly effective against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> based on previously conducted studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Reports from Thailand and Indonesia detected up to 23&#x000a0;% of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections being wrongly diagnosed as <italic>P. vivax</italic>, leading to inappropriate treatment with chloroquine.

As these patients were hospitalized, the adverse events were considered to be serious in nature. Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar to incidence reported in patients treated with PQP combinations with DHA in various other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The proportion of patients with QTc prolongation of &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms from baseline in patients treated with FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP were 1.9&#x000a0;% compared to 3.2&#x000a0;% in chloroquine group. Evaluation of QT interval changes is problematic in malaria because of systematic differences between the acute febrile admission before anti-malarial drugs are given and early convalescence. At presentation, patients are usually anxious, fasting and febrile with increased autonomic tone and a raised heart rate. This is in contrast to the relaxed, fed, supine, afebrile state 3&#x000a0;days later when most anti-malarial treatments finish and anti-malarial concentrations are at the highest. It has been argued that this systematic reduction in sympathetic activity with recovery leads to a consistent increase in the QT interval which has been mistakenly ascribed to anti-malarial drug effects. It has been reported in literature that QTc prolongation of &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms is within the bounds of normal daily variation in the QTc (up to 75&#x02013;100&#x000a0;ms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Amongst the laboratory parameters, concentration of haemoglobin, platelet count, reticulocyte count, eosinophil count, serum potassium and sodium, ALT and blood glucose were evaluated. Mean concentration/counts reported during laboratory assessments were similar after treatment with FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP or chloroquine. By proportion, the incidence of increased transaminase (ALT and AST) was similar in both the treatment groups. This observation combined with the fact that the FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP is only administered once daily for 3&#x000a0;days suggests that there is a very low risk of liver injury with FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic results through non-compartmental analysis indicate that the mean rate and extent of absorption for arterolane maleate and PQP were apparently similar to those observed in patients treated for falciparum malaria. Similarly, the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC for chloroquine and desethylchloroquine corroborated well with literature-based information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. PCT for patients treated with the FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP seems numerically lower than that for the chloroquine. Exposures for chloroquine were higher as compared to piperaquine exposures.</p><p>Arterolane (a completely synthetic, ozonide anti-malarial based upon the 1,2,4-trioxolane pharmacophore) in combination with PQP exhibits a rapid onset of action, potent activity against all erythrocytic stages of <italic>P. vivax</italic>. Once-a-day treatment with three doses of FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP efficacy and safety profile similar to chloroquine and no reappearance of vivax malaria noted until day 42 makes this combination a promising candidate, which could lead to better treatment compliance and patient adherence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings from this study show that FDC of arterolane maleate and PQP effectively cure vivax malaria and attain acceptable level of cure up to day 28.
