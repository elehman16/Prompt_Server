The patients attending the O. P. D of Department of Kaya Chikitsa and Panchakarma, Government Ayurveda College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram were enrolled and subjected to the treatment schedule. Total duration of treatment was 21days. The schedule for the first 14 days was similar in both the groups. It included <italic>Rooksha Sveda</italic> for 7days followed by <italic>Patra Pottali Sveda</italic> for 7days. During this period, 90 ml <italic>Gandharvahastadi Kashaya</italic> twice and <italic>Guggulu Tiktaka Kashaya</italic> once were given internally. After this, in the <italic>Nasya</italic> group <italic>Nasya</italic> was done for 7days with <italic>Dhanwantaram Tailam</italic> (21times <italic>Aavartita</italic>), <italic>Mridu</italic>
<italic>Paka</italic> in <italic>Madhyama Matra</italic> (<italic>8Bindu</italic>). Along with this <italic>Guggulu Tiktaka Kashaya</italic> was given thrice. In the control group, <italic>Guggulu Tiktaka kashaya</italic> alone was given thrice daily. Assessments were done with regard to pain, tenderness, radiation of pain, numbness, range of movements and hand grip strength. These were done before treatment, before nasya, after treatment and after 1month follow-up. The statistical hypothesis was tested using paired &#x02018;t&#x02019; test and &#x02018;Z&#x02019; test for proportion.

Still a humble attempt to analyse the possible modes of action is made. Considering pain relief, patients in the study group had considerable relief of pain compared to that of control group. Analysis of the values on pain scale before and after <italic>Nasya</italic> proved specific efficacy of <italic>Nasya</italic> in reducing pain. <italic>Brimhana Nasya</italic> is <italic>Vatahara</italic> so as to reduce pain. On the other hand, <italic>Nasya</italic> gives stimulation to the brain through the olfactory pathway thus inducing the production of Neuro peptides which act as pain relievers. The <italic>Paka</italic> of the <italic>Taila</italic> used for <italic>Nasya</italic> is <italic>Mridu</italic>, which retains the water-soluble principles along with lipid soluble particles at an optimum level. Moreover <italic>Avartana</italic> increases the concentration of fat soluble phytoconstituents. The peripheral processes of the olfactory cells respond to volatile, water soluble and lipid soluble odorless chemical substances. The drug used for <italic>Nasya</italic> is of <italic>Mridu Paka</italic> which maintains the water solubility for diffusing through the olfactory epithelium and lipid solubility for interacting with the lipids of the membranes of olfactory receptors. All these factors contribute well for the specific ability of <italic>Sneha Nasya</italic> in stimulating the brain through olfactory pathway. In fact, structures of the Limbic system including Thalamus, Hypothalamus, Hippocampus, Amygdala and parts of the Basal ganglia are concentration areas for neuropeptides called nodal points. <italic>Nasya</italic> can stimulate areas like Amygdala in Limbic system, thus activating neuropeptide pathway.</p><p>In case of neck stiffness, <italic>Nasya</italic> relieved it considerably. The cause for neck stiffness is dehydration of intervertebral discs. <italic>Nasya</italic> with a nourishing drug can induce some nourishment to tissues by impregnating <italic>Kapha Bhavas</italic> and may reduce degeneration.</p><p>Most of the drugs in <italic>Dhanvantaram Tailam</italic> have <italic>Vatahara</italic> property and it contains groups of drugs like <italic>Dashamoola</italic> which have specific effect in <italic>Shopha</italic> and <italic>Shoola</italic>. This may be the reason for reduction in tenderness.</p><p>In cervical spondylosis, degenerative changes and osteophytosis occur which compress the nerve roots. This leads to radiculopathy and resultant radiation of pain. It is difficult to reverse these structural changes. So, complete relief cannot be expected in radiation of pain. Still, better results were obtained by <italic>Nasya</italic>. The exact mechanism is obscure but it is assumed that <italic>Nasya</italic> improves circulation and prevents degeneration up to some extent.</p><p><italic>Brimhana Nasya</italic> alleviates vitiated <italic>Vata</italic> which is responsible for stiffness and movement restriction. This may be the reason for improvement of range of movements.</p><p>As far as vertigo is concerned, there was a mean decrease of 0.6, which was statistically insignificant but patients got satisfactory relief. In Ayurvedic terms <italic>Brimhana</italic> effect of the Nasya done may be responsible for reducing vertigo. <italic>Brimhana</italic> is <italic>Vata-Pitta</italic> Shamaka. Vitiation of <italic>Vata-Pitta</italic> with <italic>Rajas</italic> cause <italic>Bhrama</italic>. The nourishing and strengthening effect of <italic>Nasya</italic> is evident from the improvement of hand grip strength.</p><p>When the <italic>Snigdha Bhavas</italic> exhaust from the body as a part of natural wear and tear, the most vulnerable regions start showing symptoms, the cervical spine is one such.</p><p>Based on the theory of <italic>Svaabhavoparama</italic>, there is an inherent tendency for natural self cure. The body heals by itself and a natural cure is endowed after every injury and insult. The role of medicine is only to assist the nature.</p><p>Here the major processes in pathology are disc dehydration and bone degeneration &#x02013; vividly showing a reduction in <italic>Kapha Bhavas</italic> and increase of <italic>Vata</italic>. At the level of <italic>Mahabhootas</italic> the <italic>Prithvi</italic> and <italic>Jala</italic>
<italic>Mahaabhootas</italic> exhaust gradually with a subsequent increase of <italic>Vayu</italic> and <italic>Aakaasha Bhootas</italic>. Hence body needs to acquire more <italic>Snigdha Bhavas</italic> to resist the process of degeneration.</p><p>Here the facts to be considered are</p><p>

</p><p>By giving <italic>Brimhana Nasya</italic> with <italic>Avartita Taila</italic> which has increased amount of fat-soluble principles, we are giving a stimulus to the body with those <italic>Gunas</italic> which are necessary to induce natural <italic>Kapha Bhaavas</italic>.</p><p>The mode of action of <italic>Nasya</italic> is explained in Ayurveda as follows. The instilled medicine moves up the channels to the <italic>Shringaataka</italic>, spreads all over the head, channels of eyes, ears, and throat there by removing <italic>Doshas</italic>. Thus cures the diseases affecting the <italic>Urdhva Jatru</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The position specifically advised for performing <italic>Nasya</italic> is such that the head is kept a little down and the feet a little high from the plane.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] This can increase the pressure of CSF due to gravitational back flow from the pressure of CSF due to gravitational back flow from the spinal cord. When the CSF pressure rises and equals the arterial pressure, it compresses the whole brain as well as arteries in the brain and cuts off the blood supply to the brain. This initiates a CNS ischemic response that causes the arterial pressure to rise as a part of natural homeostatic mechanism. When the arterial pressure rises to a level higher than the CSF pressure, blood flows once again into the vessels of the brain to relieve ischemia. This mechanism is known as cushing reaction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] and potentially deserves mention in this context. Probably it plays a crucial role in spread of active principles of the medicine used for Nasya through circulatory channels at the earliest.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
