nonspecific low back pain (LBP) in elderly males. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-two
elderly men aged 65 or older were recruited and randomly allocated to two groups: aquatic
training (3 d/wk for 12 wk) or a control group. Body mass index (BMI), percentage of body
fat (PBF), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and trunk muscle mass were measured before and after
training. [Results] The results suggested that all obesity variables including BMI, WHR,
and PBF of the aquatic training group were decreased significantly, while the trunk muscle
mass of the aquatic training group was increased significantly. Furthermore, low back pain
was decreased in the subjects after the intervention. [Conclusion] The water-based program
improved LBP and body composition in the elderly men.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Body composition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The aging process is marked by the diminishing physiological and functional capabilities in
older adults. This decline in function result from the loss of muscular strength and related
impaired functional mobility<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, which often
leads to falls, low back pain, reduced independence, and increased health-care costs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the loss of muscle mass with aging
(Sarcopenia) leads to muscular dysfunction<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, obesity also contributes substantially to chronic medical
conditions such as low back pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
notable changes in body composition from maturity to senescence are well proven, even in
healthy subjects. It has been well established that obesity/overweight has side effects on
low back pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. So an exercise therapy
consisting of individually designed programs, including stretching or strengthening, may
improve pain and function in chronic nonspecific low back pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Numerous exercise approaches have been designed with the intention
of controlling weight, improving strength, and increasing flexibility for treating low back
pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. If these exercises are done in
water, the properties of water that cause resistance result in relaxation, reduce the
pressure on the affected joint, and induce a feeling of exhilaration. Moreover, the
combination of the buoyancy and resistance properties allow for exercise modalities in an
aquatic environment that are generally too stressful on land for older populations<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although it appears that water-based
exercise may be a suitable exercise modality for elderly individuals, little is known about
its ability to improve body composition. The interesting and distinguishing point of
differences between previous studies and the presented study is the sort of exercise
therapy. It was hypothesized that water-based exercises would significantly decrease
abdominal and overall obesity, increase muscular strength, and consequently decrease low
back symptoms in the elderly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the present study were 32 elderly men from Qazvin, Iran, who met the
following selection criteria: over 65&#x02005;years old, no experience of a fall in the 1&#x02005;year
period prior to the study, no specific disease that might influence task performance, no
visual or hearing impairment, and no vestibular organ problem. All subjects agreed to
actively participate in the exercises once they had been given a sufficient explanation of
the tasks. Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups: aquatic training, with a mean age
of 68.4&#x000b1;2.9 yr (3 d/wk for 12 wk), and a control group (67.6&#x000b1;3.1 yr). The aquatic program
was conducted in a heated pool (depth 1.20 m) at water temperatures between 28&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and 30&#x02005;&#x000b0;C
and consisted of 2 aerobic sessions and 1 session of resistance training. All sessions
lasted 60&#x02005;min and included a warm-up period (10 min), the main program (40 min), and a
cooldown period (10 min). The aerobic regimen included exercises such as water walking,
jogging, walking and jogging in combination with various arm movements, sidestepping, water
cycling, and adapted water games (volley and basket). During resistance training, the
following 8 exercises were performed: chest/upper back glide, chest back press,
behind-the-back press, pivoted shoulder press (upper body) and calf lifts, supported squats,
outer/inner thigh scissors, and forward and backward leg glide (lower body). Each movement
during resistance training was conducted using specialized equipment to increase the water
resistance and the stimulus offered by the water. Before planning the exercise therapy in
water, a pulse meter was used to control the heart rates of the subjects (50&#x02013;70% of maximal
heart rate reserve) during the time of exercise. The subjects in the control group did not
participate in any kind of exercise program. They were asked to carry out their usual daily
activities throughout the study. Body mass index (BMI), percentage of body fat (PBF),
waist-hip ratio (WHR), and trunk muscle mass were measured with a body composition analyzer
(InBody 230, Biospace, Seoul, South Korea) before and after training. The segmental lean
mass such as the trunk muscle mass can be measured with this apparatus. A simple 9-item
patient questionnaire (the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool), was used to categorize back
pain patients in terms of the complexity of their problem. The tool evaluates not only
physical factors, such as pain radiation, severity, and related dysfunction, but also
psychosocial factors that can influence outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, and
pessimism. All the subjects gave written informed consent before starting the study
protocol, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. SPSS for Windows (version 18) was
used to analyze the data. The Independent Student&#x02019;s t-tests was used to examine differences
between the groups, with a statistical significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the intervention, BMI, WHR, PBF, and trunk muscle mass improved significantly in the

and nonspecific low back pain in elderly males. Based on our findings, WHR, PBF, BMI, trunk
muscle mass, and low back pain (both physical and psychological symptoms) were significantly
improved after the intervention. Since; it has been well established that obesity/overweight
has side effects on low back pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, one
reason for low back pain improvement may be related to the change in body composition change
in the subjects<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consistent with
findings from other studies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, we found an
improvement in low back pain after aquatic exercises. Low abdominal muscular strength is
considered to be a reason for low back pain; thus, increasing the muscular volume and
strength may be an effective treatment strategy<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results indicated that the
trunk muscle was improved by up to 4.1% after 12 weeks aquatic training. An advantage of
aquatic exercise is that it can involve the upper and lower extremities through optimal
ranges of motion while minimizing joint stress. Thus, aquatic exercise can result in optimal
improvement in body composition and low back pain. The present study demonstrated that an
improved body composition as a result of aquatic exercise had a positive effect on
nonspecific low back pain. One limitation of this study was the small number of subjects,
limiting the extent to which the results can be applied to elderly men in general.
Additional studies involving more subjects, a more controlled environment, and/or a
different variety of psychological and physical tests are required in order to make
conclusive assumptions about a larger population. The results obtained suggested that
exercises in water may be one of the most useful modes of exercise for elderly individuals
with low back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cavani</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Mier</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Muston</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of a 6-week resistance training program on
