Nocturia is the symptom of needing to wake up to pass urine. It is caused by increased bladder excitability, impaired salt/fluid handling and endocrine causes.</p><p>Nocturia is common; overall prevalence of nocturia is substantial, and progresses in severity with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Nocturia is highly prevalent in neurological disease. Mild nocturia (1 episode per night) may be regarded as a &#x0201c;nuisance&#x0201d; symptom, of minor importance. However, if there are other reasons for sleep disturbance, as is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the additional episode of sleep disturbance from nocturia becomes more important for the person affected.</p><p>Moderate-to-severe nocturia profoundly affects quality of life as a consequence of fatigue, which results from the shortening of overall sleep duration and disruption of the phases of sleep (loss of the restorative phase). More importantly, severe nocturia is associated with major health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The condition is thus important personally (impaired quality of life from fatigue), economically (impaired function affecting employment; for disabled or elderly people, need for additional care and reduced ability to maintain independent living at home) and clinically (association with major health issues).</p><p>Standard treatment comprises controlling fluid intake, timed diuretics, desmopressin, antimuscarinic drugs or bedtime sedatives/miscellaneous compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nocturia can be multifactorial, and a range of interventions is needed to individualise treatment selection and have the best chance of ameliorating symptoms. Current options can have side effects- which are common with antimuscarinics (dry mouth, constipation, swallowing difficulty, cognitive impairment), and sedatives (confusion, sedation hangover). Serious complications include; hyponatraemia (salt depletion/dilution) with diuretics/desmopressin, and acute retention of urine with antimuscarinics. Perceived poor efficacy and the safety concerns mean that clinicians may fail to evaluate fully or feel reluctant to instigate treatment; as a consequence, even severe nocturia symptoms may be left untreated.</p><p>Our conjecture is that nocturia signifies impaired circadian regulation, potentially mediated at 3 levels; (i) bladder muscle excitability, (ii) renal urine output, (iii) conscious response to bladder sensation. The concept that nocturia represents a disruption of circadian control of various body processes (bladder urine storage, kidney urine production and brain response to urinary sensation) is evident. It shifts emphasis from organs to the individual person; thereby the treatment basis moves from suppressing organ activity (antimuscarinics, antidiuretics, sedatives), towards restoration of deficient circadian activity. This shift takes a holistic approach aiming to restore normal function in the organism, rather than suppressing abnormal function in individual organs; improved function by restoration of the native hormone. Melatonin is a natural hormone regulating circadian cycles, released by the brain&#x02019;s pineal gland at night-time, and varying with sleep state. It reduces smooth muscle activity including in the bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Melatonin levels can be supplemented by administration in tablet form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; given at bedtime, it improves sleep quality. Literature review shows melatonin has been used for nocturia in two small studies. In men with benign prostate enlargements, a subgroup of patients who benefitted from exogenous melatonin treatment (&#x0201c;nocturia responders&#x0201d;) has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Melatonin has also been used for nocturia in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], for whom it was found to have significant benefit in ameliorating symptom severity and improving quality of life.</p><p>MS is the commonest cause of acquired neurological disability in young adults and is characterised by the progressive inflammatory loss of myelin and neuronal tissue in the central nervous system. In both the initial Relapsing-Remitting Phase and subsequent Progressive Phase of MS urinary symptoms are common, including nocturia, along with sleep disturbance from other causes (e.g. restless legs syndrome, anxiety). The impact upon quality of life is substantial; fatigue leads to reduced capacity to carry out daily activities, which is a particular problem in a disabled patient group. Fatigue itself is the most common symptom of Multiple Sclerosis and the main disabling feature for many patients. There is an absolute paucity of effective therapies for this severe symptom which is considered to be multifactorial and greatly exacerbated by all forms of sleep deprivation and disturbance. Fatigue is well recognised as a key determinant in a patient&#x02019;s capacity to maintain occupation, independence and social participation.</p><p>Impaired melatonin secretion occurs in multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Melatonin may have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which are potentially relevant when considering its use in MS. We propose that exogenous administration of melatonin may counteract symptom severity in nocturia, with lower risk of adverse effects than current available agents. Accordingly, the main hypothesis is that bedtime administration of a 2&#x000a0;mg melatonin sustained-release tablet will improve clinical nocturia with consequent benefit for sleep quality and quality of life, in patients with progressive MS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aims</title><p>The primary aim is to evaluate effect of melatonin on mean number of nocturia episodes per night.</p><p>Secondary aims are to evaluate; 1) Improvement in quality of life, 2) safety, 3) lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), 4) total voided (urinated) volume and mean volume per void, 5) sleep quality and 6) sleep disturbance of partners.

A systematic review in 2006 looked at safety with melatonin usage for secondary sleep disturbances and sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The study concluded that melatonin is safe with short term use.</p><p>Unwanted effects in some people, especially at high doses (3&#x000a0;mg/day or more) may include: headaches, nausea, next-day grogginess or irritability, hormone fluctuations, vivid dreams or nightmares, gastrointestinal irritation, reduced blood flow and hypothermia. While no large, long-term studies that might reveal side-effects have been conducted, there do exist case reports about patients having taken melatonin for months. Melatonin can cause somnolence (drowsiness), and, therefore, caution should be shown when driving, operating machinery, etc.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Definitions</title><p>Adverse Event (AE): any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP.</p><p>Adverse Reaction (AR): all untoward and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose administered. All AEs judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor as having reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression &#x0201c;reasonable causal relationship&#x0201d; means to convey in general that there is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship.</p><p>Unexpected Adverse Reaction: an AR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., investigator&#x02019;s brochure for an unapproved investigational product or summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for an authorised product). When the outcome of the adverse reaction is not consistent with the applicable product information this adverse reaction should be considered as unexpected. Side effects documented in the SmPC which occur in a more severe form than anticipated are also considered to be unexpected.</p><p>Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Adverse Reaction: any untoward medical occurrence or effect that;<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Results in death</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is life-threatening &#x02013; refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe</p></list-item><list-item><p>Requires hospitalization, or prolongation of existing inpatients&#x02019; hospitalization</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect</p></list-item></list>

The experimental structure therefore has a two by two fully repeated measures structure. The design has been structured with a large washout period and it is anticipated that there will be no carryover effects on physiological and psychological outcomes. This assumption will be tested. Period effects should also be absent and this supposition will also be tested and analysis will proceed to estimate treatment effects robust to any period effect (CROS analysis). It is recognised that outcome data may be skewed for this population and nonparametric or bootstrapped inference will be used as appropriate. Analyses will proceed on an Intent-to-Treat basis.</p><p>A missing data analysis will also be performed and sensitivity of statistical conclusions to missingness will be undertaken using standard imputation techniques. Data integrity checks will be undertaken prior to inferential analysis including a detailed graphical and summary statistics descriptive analysis.

Nocturia and sleep disturbance are prevalent and bothersome aspects of MS, and a safe and effective therapy would be a valuable development. Melatonin may improve either or both aspects, and has a good safety profile. It is unlikely to affect necessary physiological function of the lower urinary tract or the gut. Thus, it does not carry the same concerns about side effects of drugs used to treat overactive bladder syndrome, such as constipation or impaired bladder emptying.</p><p>The trial includes a wide range of outcome measures, since the effect on nocturia and sleep quality may lead to additional effects on cognitive function. Since this is a clinical trial of an investigational medical product (using an established drug but outside its licensed indication), the measures also emphasises safety assessments, including detailed assessment of MS severity.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CaMBS</term><def><p>Cambridge Multiple Sclerosis Basic Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDSS</term><def><p>Expanded Disability Status Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>F-LUTS</term><def><p>Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FVC</term><def><p>Frequency volume chart</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIQ</term><def><p>International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaires</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIQ-FLUTS</term><def><p>Female- specific tool for assessing severity and bother of all LUTS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIQ-MLUTS</term><def><p>Male-specific tool for assessing severity and bother of all LUTS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIQ-N</term><def><p>International Consultation on Incontinence-Nocturia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIQ-NQoL</term><def><p>A nocturia-specific quality of life tool which will be used throughout the study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LUTS</term><def><p>Lower urinary tract symptoms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MACFIMS</term><def><p>Minimal assessment of cognitive function in MS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MeNiMS</term><def><p>Study Acronym: Melatonin for Nocturia in Multiple Sclerosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M-LUTS</term><def><p>Male lower urinary tract symptoms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MS</term><def><p>Multiple sclerosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSQLI</term><def><p>Multiple sclerosis quality of life index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSQI</term><def><p>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of all current (and prospective subjects) who have generously agreed to give up their time and made the sometimes strenuous journey in order to attend study visits.</p><p>The authors would also like to acknowledge the ancillary staff within the &#x02018;Brain centre&#x02019; and the &#x02018;Clinical Research Centre&#x02019; at Southmead Hospital who has made a considerable contribution towards the smooth coordination of this study to date.</p><sec id="FPar3"><title>Funding</title><p>We are grateful to the MS Society, a charity in the AMRC, for funding this trial (award Reference No: 959/11).
