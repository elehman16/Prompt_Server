A single center, paired design, randomized, controlled trial was conducted between Jan 2011 and July 2014. Preterm twins with RDS were included. One of a pair was randomized to NIPPV, while another to NCPAP. Surfactant was administrated as rescue treatment. The primary outcome was the need for endotracheal ventilation. The secondary outcomes were the complications. 143 pairs were randomized and 129 pairs finished the trial. The rates of endotracheal ventilation did not differ significantly between NIPPV and NCPAP groups (11.9% vs 19.6%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.080). This difference was not observed in the subgroup of infants who received surfactant therapy (11.1% vs 19.7%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.087). No secondary outcomes also differed significantly between the two groups. NIPPV did not result in a significantly lower incidence of intubation as compared with NCPAP in preterm twins with RDS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In preterm infant with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), endotracheal ventilation and exogenous surfactant replacement therapy are two important cornerstones to reduce neonatal mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Although improving the survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, endotracheal ventilation is actually related to increasing risks of infection and ventilation-associated lung injury. Importantly, prolonged duration of endotracheal ventilation induces more death, neurologic impairment, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the post-neonatal period<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. These complications and sequelea induce increased medical burden<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. How to reduce the need for endotracheal ventilation and subsequent complications constitutes a challenge for neonatologists<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>To this day, early use of noninvasive respiratory support strategies has been suggested to be the most effective pathway to reduce those risks. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are two widely used ways of noninvasive ventilation strategies in preterm infant. As compared with invasive ventilation, NCPAP reduces the risks of BPD and abnormal neurodevelopment. However, there is only 60% success rate of avoiding intubation in the preterm neonate supported with NCPAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Supplying with an intermittent peak pressure on NCPAP, NIPPV is considered as a strengthened version of NCPAP with increased flow delivery in the upper airway, increased minute volume and functional residual capacity and recruitment of collapsed alveoli, improved stability of the chest wall and reduced asynchrony of thoraco-abdominal movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, which have been proven to be crucial to decrease the incidences of invasive ventilation, BPD and death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Several studies have compared NIPPV with NCPAP in non-twin neonates with RDS, which were mainly conducted in very preterm infants (less than 32 weeks&#x02019; gestational age). There was a rarity of similar study in moderate and late preterm infants (between 32 and 36 weeks&#x02019; gestational age)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Actually, moderate and late infants accounted for more than 80% of preterm births<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Studies are needed to determine the impact of respiratory distress coupled with mild-moderate prematurity on short-term and long-term outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to compare NIPPV with NCPAP on the need for endotracheal ventilation and subsequent complications in preterm twins, especially in moderate and late preterm twins.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study neonates</title><p>234 pairs were screened, of which 143 pairs underwent randomization and 14 parents of twins did not continue the interventions in the follow-up, and 129 pairs were ultimately enrolled and finished the trials, (129 in NIPPV group with 60 first born and 69&#x02009;second born; 129 in NCPAP group with 69 first born and 60&#x02009;second born) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). All preterm twins undergoing randomization, including those who lose to follow-up, were included in the final analysis. The number of involved twins reached the calculated needed sample size. Analysis according to the intention to treat principle was considered to be the most proper way of analyzing randomized controlled trial results. Data analyses followed the intention to treat principle. Intention to treat principle analysis required all randomized participants to be included and analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were originally assigned<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>All the neonates arrived at the NICU within six hours.

Meneses J <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> indicated that NIPPV did not significantly reduce the intubation rate in the first 72&#x02009;hours comparing with NCPAP, of which mean gestational ages were about 30 weeks. The largest multi-centered study on the comparison of NIPPV and NCPAP also showed that, in very preterm infant, there was no significant difference on the rate of intubation and survival to 36 weeks of post-menstrual age without BPD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In 2014, Kugelman A <italic>et al</italic>. reported a randomized pilot study comparing heated humidified high-flow nasal cannulae with NIPPV for RDS, which showed similar effect on preventing endotracheal ventilation in premature infants suffering from RDS with mean gestational age of 32 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In the present study, our data did not also showed difference in intubation rates, which was consistent with the newly up-to-date meta-analysis of Wang L <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> In contrast, a few previous meta-analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> gave preference to the use of NIPPV. Our previous study including both preterm and term infants with RDS also suggested that NIPPV might have better effects as compared with NCPAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>One cause to explain the inconsistence among different studies might be gestational age. Previous studies were mainly enforced in very preterm infants. Nowadays, newborn infants were actually divided into post-term (&#x0003e;42 weeks), full term (39&#x02013;41 weeks), early term (37&#x02013;38 weeks), late preterm (34&#x02013;36 weeks), moderate preterm (32&#x02013;33 weeks), and very preterm (&#x0003c;32 weeks). In the very preterm infants, the incidence rate of RDS gradually has been confirmed to be increased with decreasing gestational age. EuroNeoStat figures for 2006 showed an incidence of 92% at 24&#x02013;25 weeks&#x02019;, 88% at 26&#x02013;27 weeks&#x02019;, 76% at 28&#x02013;29 weeks&#x02019;, and 57% at 30&#x02013;31 weeks at gestational age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In the infants with gestational age less than 30 weeks, an obviously increase was observed in the incidence rate of RDS. It might therefore be improper to conduct the trials in very preterm infants with long time span, and the gestational age below 32 weeks should be divided into more subgroups, such as 30&#x02013;32 weeks, 28&#x02013;32 weeks and 26&#x02013;28 weeks and so on. Similarities also appeared in other stages of the preterm. In the present study, three subgroups related to gestational age were divided and the results did not reveal difference between NIPPV and NCPAP groups.</p><p>Another important cause might be the baseline differences of pregnant women. As is known, several diseases of pregnant women can obviously influence the severities of RDS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Different levels of gestational diabetes mellitus, administration of dexamethasone, premature of rupture of fetal membranes, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can affect the lung maturation of newborn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Previous studies only showed simple homogeneities of &#x0201c;absent&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; in pregnancy-associated diseases of mother between the two groups, and these homogeneities might be not true conditions of homogeneity. In the present paired design study, these differences could be the best homogeneity in preterm twins, thus, the results should be the higher reliability. Our results were consistent with the studies of Kirpalani, H. <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and Kugelman, A. <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, the sample sizes were very different among the three studies (258&#x02009;vs 1009&#x02009;vs 76). It was easy to understand the better homogeneities of pregnant women with larger sample size. As far as the smaller sample size was concerned in the study of Kugelman, A. <italic>et al</italic>., a reasonable speculation was that the study might show the similar homogeneity with us.</p><p>The last but not least, the cause might be surfactant administration. Generally, RDS may gradually aggravate in 72&#x02009;hours with the consumption of replacement surfactant. Therefore, prophylactic, early and enough surfactant replacement therapy can effectively reduce the incidence of intubation and complications in preterm infants with RDS as compared with later selective surfactant administration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, which was consistent with the report by Duman N <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> The updated meta-analysis showed that, compared with NCPAP group, there was a significant decrease in the need for invasive ventilation in NIPPV group in the preterm infants who received surfactant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In the present study, surfactant administration was enforced in 85.3% (122/143) twin neonates with mean 1.5&#x02013;1.6 times in early stage, and the overall rates of intubation were similar between the two groups. Although in subgroup analysis of 32&#x02013;33 weeks&#x02019; gestational age, statistically significant lower rate of intubation was found in NIPPV group as compared with that in NCPAP group, the 95% confidence interval covering 1. Our result was inconsistent with the updated meta-analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the present study was only concerned with non-synchronized NIPPV. Several studies have reported the advantages of synchronized NIPPV. Compared to NCPAP, the use of synchronized NIPPV was related to reduced intubation rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, thoracoabdominal motion asynchrony<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and the work of breathing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, as well as increased tidal volume and minute volume<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Gizzi C revealed that synchronized NIPPV seemed more effective in reducing the incidence of desaturations, bradycardias and central apnoea episodes in preterm infants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Nevertheless, retrospective data indicated that use of synchronized NIPPV was associated with similar impact on clinical outcomes as compared with non-synchronized NIPPV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Moreover, Owen LS <italic>et al</italic>. reported that NIPPV delivered fewer pressure peaks at lower pressures when the respiratory rate was &#x0003e;55/min<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Those trials were mainly conducted in very preterm infants. Further trials were needed in moderate and late preterm infants.</p><p>Only few studies reported the risks of noninvasive ventilation, such as gastrointestinal perforation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and nasal trauma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. And these studies were mainly performed in the pre-surfactanct era. Morley CJ <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated more incidences of pneumothorax in CPAP group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and the air leak was related to epinephrine and surfactant use, and prenatal steroids were protective factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Other than, Sai Sunil Kishore M <italic>et al</italic>. also reported a slight increase in abdominal distension in the NIPPV group. In the present study, we did not found any significant differences in related to complications between NIPPV and NCPAP groups, which was consistent with the meta-analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>The major limitations of the study: 1) no preterm twins below 28 weeks&#x02019; gestational age; 2) relatively small sample size in the subgroups. They might induce potential bias, including restricted application scope and size effect. These problems could be overcome in additional studies. Given the potential limitations, more trials are needed in the future.</p><p>In summary, among preterm twins with RDS, including the infants administrated with surfactant, NIPPV might be not prior to NCPAP with respect to avoiding intubation and reducing subsequent complications as the primary respiratory support in the early life.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>This was a single-center, paired design, randomized controlled trial conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from Jan 2011 to July 2014 at Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, China.

Therefore, the actual sample size was more than theoretical need.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Continuous variables, expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation, were compared using paired samples t test. Categorical variables were compared using the McNemar&#x02019;s test. Predefined three subgroups were &#x0003c;32 weeks, 32&#x02013;33 weeks and 34&#x02013;36 weeks, and subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary outcome in the preterm infants administrated with surfactant. Other than, to further justify the effect of surfactant on intubation within subgroup, the test of treatment-by-gestational age subgroup interaction was also conducted using the paired binary logistic regression. For the preterm infant loss to follow-up, the missing values of the primary and secondary outcomes were replaced using multiple imputation. All analyses were carried out using computer software (SPSS 16.0 for windows). <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Chen, L. <italic>et al.</italic> Noninvasive Ventilation for Preterm Twin Neonates with Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial. <italic>Sci.
