Azithromycin is an antibiotic used for trachoma control, and hence, may have an unintended benefit of improving child growth. Niger is a trachoma-endemic country where mass antibiotic distributions for trachoma take place and where malnutrition is widespread among children. In addition, azithromycin may have an effect on common childhood diseases associated with malnutrition, such as diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria. In a community-randomized trachoma trial in Matameye, Niger, we assessed child growth by measuring height, weight, and mid-upper arm circumference of pre-school children who have received 3 years of annual or biannual mass azithromycin treatment. While these measures were better in the biannually treated communities, the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, further research will help determine the impact of antibiotics on child growth and nutrition.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant 48027) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH/NEI K23 EYO19881-01 and NIH/NCRR/OD UCSF-CTSI Grant Number KL2 RR024130), support was also provided by: Research to Prevent Blindness That Man May See, and the Harper Inglis Trust.

These studies have identified benefits of using antimicrobials to improve animal growth, prevent and treat infections, and enhance feed efficiency <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Tollefson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In Africa, studies have investigated the effect of antibiotics to prevent and treat disease outbreaks among animals <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Anti-parasitic agents have been shown to increase weight in humans, presumably due to their effect on soil-transmitted helminthes <xref rid="pntd.0003128-TaylorRobinson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Childhood illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria have been linked to malnutrition <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Caulfield1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends repeated community-wide oral azithromycin distribution for the control of blinding trachoma. Azithromycin is effective against the ocular strains of chlamydia that cause trachoma but may also have an effect on common childhood diseases associated with malnutrition, such as diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria. Undernutrition is typical in the trachoma-endemic areas where these antibiotic distributions take place. For example, approximately half of Nigerien children under-5 years of age live with chronic malnutrition and one in 10 face severe acute malnutrition <xref rid="pntd.0003128-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Mdecins1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Here, we collect anthropometric measurements from pre-school children in a community-randomized trial of mass oral azithromycin distributions for trachoma in Matameye, Niger. We compare height, weight, and MUAC in communities that have received 3 years of mass azithromycin treatments: annual <italic>versu</italic>s biannual (twice-yearly). We hypothesize that anthropometric indices are improved in children who are randomized to receive more treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study obtained ethical approval from the University of California, San Francisco Committee for Human Research and the Comit&#x000e9; d'Ethique du Niger (the Ethical Committee of Niger).

From the PRET study census in May 2013, individuals were randomly selected for anthropometry using the statistical package R prior to field data collection <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Team1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> by TCP <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Amza1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Annually treated communities received three rounds of mass azithromycin treatment. Biannually treated communities received six rounds of mass azithromycin treatment. In annually treated communities, participants aged 6 months and older received a directly observed dose of oral azithromycin (1 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 1 gm). Study participants in biannually treated communities aged 6 months to 12 years were offered oral azithromycin. In both study arms, those less than 6 months of age were offered topical tetracycline ointment (1%) applied to both eyes twice a day for 6 weeks.</p><p>Our goal was to collect anthropometric measurements of 50 children in each community. To that end, 62 children, aged 6&#x02013;60 months at the time of this sub-study, were randomly selected from the randomized registration lists generated from the follow-up PRET study census. Thus, these children were under 30 months of age at the PRET baseline census. Anthropometric measurements were collected at a centralized exam station in each community. If there were less than 50 children in the community, then anthropometric measurements were collected for all children.</p><p>Prior to the 36-month study visit, four individuals from the Niger Ministry of Health participated in a 1-day interactive WHO anthropometry training <xref rid="pntd.0003128-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> in Niamey, Niger led by the F.I. Proctor Foundation team (University of California at San Francisco). In a previous study in Ethiopia, we demonstrated reproducibility of anthropometric measurements among team members who participated in our training <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Ayele1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Two of the four trainees had previous experience in anthropometry. The training curriculum included measuring recumbent length, standing height, weight, and MUAC.</p><p>For children younger than 2 years of age, we measured recumbent length; standing height was measured for children older than 2 years (Schorrboard; Schorr Productions, LLC, Olney, MD). Height and length were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm. For children who were unable to stand on their own due to sickness or weakness, we measured recumbent length and subtracted 0.7 cm for an estimated height per the WHO conversion formula <xref rid="pntd.0003128-WHO3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Children were weighed individually with little or no clothing; if necessary, children were weighed while being held by a parent or guardian using the taring function (seca 874 flat floor scale; seca GMBH &#x00026; Co. Kg, Hamburg, Germany). Trained anthropometrists ensured the scale was on a flat surface. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg. MUAC was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with non-stretchable measuring tape developed by Johns Hopkins University <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Labrique1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Measurements were collected in triplicate. Children with severe malnutrition or illness were referred to local health posts for treatment. Anthropometrists recorded data on paper forms and sent to San Francisco for data entry. They were masked to treatment allocation and antibiotic coverage data. Community members were not masked to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome Variables</title><p>For our outcome measurements to assess the difference in anthropometric measurements of pre-school children in communities randomized to annual or biannual mass azithromycin treatment, we used the WHO Anthro R macros <xref rid="pntd.0003128-WHO4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> based on the 2006 WHO child growth standards <xref rid="pntd.0003128-WHO5" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and converted anthropometric measurements: age- and sex-adjusted community-level nutritional Z scores for wasting (weight-for-height Z score [WHZ]), low MUAC (MUAC Z score [MUACZ]), stunting (height-for-age Z score [HAZ]), and underweight (weight-for-age Z score [WAZ]). We defined low anthropometric scores as Z&#x0003c;&#x02212;2.0 (based on the WHO reference population) <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For each of the following variables, we used the indicated cutoffs to produce a binary outcome variable: wasting, stunting, underweight, severe underweight (Z&#x0003c;&#x02212;3), and low MUAC.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Analytic Approach</title><p>For the binary variables, we used clustered logistic regression with CSI and community as random effects, and treatment arm as a fixed effect predictor. We used the log-link to yield estimates for the odds ratios. We also analyzed anthropometric measurements as continuous outcomes using the Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare community means. In addition, we report the pseudomedian (Hodges-Lehmann estimator) for these means by arm. In all communities, inclusion was restricted to participants who took their assigned treatment. Overall, 1,034 individuals were included in this analysis.</p><p>As a secondary analysis, for WHZ scores, we only included child participants in this sub-study who received their assigned study treatment: annual (three times) or biannual (six times).

In the PRET study, the 12 annually treated communities received treatment three times (June/July 2010, June/July 2011, and June/July 2012). The 12 biannually treated communities were treated six times (June/July 2010, December 2010/January 2011, June/July 2011, December 2011/January 2012, June/July 2012, and December 2012/January 2013). We collected anthropometric measurements from a total of 1,034 children in 24 communities (486 annual treatment arm; 548 biannual treatment arm). The confidence intervals (CI) for antibiotic coverages among children in the 12 annual communities are 93.8&#x02013;96.5, 88.4&#x02013;94.6, and 87.5&#x02013;94.1. In the 12 biannual communities, the CI for antibiotic coverages among children were 92.4&#x02013;95.9, 90.8&#x02013;96.5, 91.9&#x02013;95.6, 87.1&#x02013;96.3, 87.3&#x02013;91.3, and 87.5&#x02013;94.1. We collected anthropometric measurements in August and September 2013, which was more than 1 year after the last treatment for the annually treated communities and about 8 months after the last treatment for the biannually treated communities.

Therefore, not only was the frequency of mass treatments different between the study arms, but so were the populations treated. While pre-school children in annually treated communities had a higher prevalence of wasting, stunting, low MUAC, and underweight in comparison to biannually treated communities, these differences were not statistically significant.</p><p>Our study has some important limitations worthy of discussion. First, we examined the effects of mass azithromycin distributions on children who received annual treatment and biannual treatment. However, if we examined children from communities who received no antibiotics and children from communities who received many treatments, differences in child growth and nutrition might have been more apparent. In addition, any effect on wasting, if present at all, might be more likely to be observed closer to the time of the antibiotic distribution. Second, this study was a subset of communities from a larger trial; perhaps a larger study could detect a significant difference. Future studies could be powered to detect a smaller effect on height and weight. Third, the study design was post-test only (no baseline data were collected) and we did not collect longitudinal data. The inclusion of baseline data can sometimes improve power, if using a change score or using baseline as a covariate predicting final outcome. Note however that the majority of 0&#x02013;5 year-olds at the end of the study had not been born at the start of the study. The randomized post-test design does permit valid inference, since the treatment assignments are stochastically independent of any other explanatory covariate (including baseline anthropometry) <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition, this was in an area meso-endemic for trachoma, which may be a sign of poor socioeconomic conditions. It is unclear what, if any, effect would have been seen in poorer or wealthier areas.</p><p>Finally, it may be difficult to assess the true effect of antibiotics on anthropometry due to a possible seasonal effect in this local context. These measurements were collected towards the end of August and September, near the end of the rainy season and before the harvest, coinciding with Niger's season of rains, hunger, and malaria (June to October). During this time, the rate of acute malnutrition in children under 5 years of age is high, surpassing the global emergency threshold for malnutrition <xref rid="pntd.0003128-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Antibiotics might not be expected to affect acute malnutrition&#x02013;indeed we find no significant difference in wasting between the two arms. Children also become more susceptible to other infectious diseases such as malaria, acute respiratory diseases, and diarrheal diseases among other infections <xref rid="pntd.0003128-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The burden of malnutrition and malaria is detrimental to child health. In Niger, malaria is the leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age and pregnant women <xref rid="pntd.0003128-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These factors may make it more challenging to detect an effect of azithromycin on child growth and nutrition.</p><p>A recent cluster-randomized trial in the same study area of Niger, but in different communities, did not find significant difference in anthropometric measurements due to mass antibiotic treatments at 1 year <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Amza2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Children from communities randomized to two azithromycin treatments had higher anthropometry indices compared to children from communities randomized to only one, although differences were not statistically significant.</p><p>There are positive and negative effects of the mass oral azithromycin distributions. Mass antibiotic distributions have been successful for trachoma control and azithromycin is well tolerated <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Ayele2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Studies demonstrate that azithromycin may be beneficial for infectious diseases such as pneumonia <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Lode1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, diarrhea <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Sadiq1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and malaria <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Whitty1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In addition, previous case-control <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Keenan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and cluster-randomized <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Porco1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> trials in Ethiopia found significant reductions in childhood mortality with mass azithromycin distributions. Mass antibiotic distribution programs also have the potential to select for antibiotic resistance. Distributions have been proven to select for nasophargyngeal pneumococcus <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Skalet1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, although resistance decreased when mass treatments were discontinued <xref rid="pntd.0003128-Haug1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, there is potential for azithromycin to affect the proposed pathway from small intestinal mucosal damage to growth faltering in two ways: (<italic>i</italic>) it may reduce or modulate the intestinal microbial load, thereby reducing microbial translocation and/or (<italic>ii</italic>) as a macrolide, it may directly reduce systemic immune activation via its well-recognized immunomodulatory effects <xref rid="pntd.0003128-GiamarellosBourboulis1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we did not find a significant difference in height, weight, and MUAC of pre-school children in communities randomized to annual mass azithromycin treatment <italic>versus</italic> biannual mass azithromycin treatment, and cannot support a role of antibiotics on child growth and nutrition. Additional studies are needed to further explore the potential impact of antibiotics on child growth. If antibiotics do enhance child growth and nutrition, this could significantly reduce infant and child mortality worldwide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003128.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003128.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003128.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>Consort checklist.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003128.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the data and safety monitoring committee, including Douglas Jabs (chair); Antoinette Darville Maureen Maguire, and Grace Saguti, who were generous with their time and advice and met before and during the study.
