CYP3A4 is the pre-dominant isoform responsible for selumetinib oxidative metabolism with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A5 that is also involved to a smaller extent. CYP3A4, in particular, is involved in the metabolism of a wide range of compounds, including various drugs and toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Exposure of selumetinib may be influenced by CYP inhibitors or inducers, in particular by inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19, potentially affecting the safety profile or efficacy of selumetinib. Potent CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 modulators include itraconazole and fluconazole (antifungal agents) and rifampicin (an antibiotic agent); these agents can be used as representative inhibitors or inducers of these CYP enzymes. Itraconazole and fluconazole are not totally selective towards CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, respectively, but demonstrate the most potent inhibition of these CYPs. Rifampicin induces many CYPs but exerts its most potent induction on CYP3A4. Since selumetinib will be given to patients who are potentially taking concurrent therapies, which could potentially modify the activity of these enzymes, assessing the exposure of selumetinib when taken together with such agents is extremely important for evaluating the effects on the safety profile and/or efficacy of selumetinib.</p><p>Here, we report two clinical trials in healthy subjects assessing the exposure of selumetinib and its metabolite: <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib when co-administered with the CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors, itraconazole or fluconazole, respectively, or the CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>Both phase I open-label, single-center trials in healthy subjects were performed by Quintiles Phase I Services (Overland Park, KS, USA).

Such drug interactions may influence treatment safety and efficacy of the primary agent due to altered drug exposure and may provide important treatment considerations in the label.</p><p>In vitro data showed selumetinib to be mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19; hence, it is important to understand whether the inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes influences selumetinib exposure in the clinic. With this in mind, a key objective for the phase I drug-drug interaction studies described was to assess the effect on the exposure of selumetinib following co-administration with either the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole, the CYP2C19 inhibitor fluconazole, or the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin, in healthy subjects. All of these agents have known potent enzyme modifying activities against these CYPs but can also modulate other CYPs. Results showed that selumetinib AUC increased by ~50% when co-administered with either itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) or fluconazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor), and that selumetinib AUC was decreased by ~50% by the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. These findings are in agreement with the in vitro data suggesting the involvement of these enzymes in the metabolism of selumetinib.</p><p>Inhibition of CYP3A4 by itraconazole or CYP2C19 by fluconazole affected levels of the metabolite, <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib, differently. Co-administration of itraconazole resulted in a decrease in <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (~25%) and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> (~10%), indicating that CYP3A4 is involved in the formation of <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib. This was also reflected in a decrease in the ratio of metabolite to parent for peak concentration (MR<sub>Cmax</sub>) and overall exposure (MR<sub>AUC(0&#x02013;t)</sub>) when selumetinib was co-administered with itraconazole than on its own.</p><p>Co-administration of fluconazole with selumetinib did not affect <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>, while AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;t)</sub> was increased, by about 40%. With the inhibition of the CYP2C19 metabolic pathway by fluconazole, more <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl metabolite may have formed via an alternative metabolic route. This is also reflected in the generally unchanged mean metabolite to parent exposure ratios for <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;t)</sub> with fluconazole co-administration, suggesting minimal involvement of CYP2C19 in the formation of <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib.</p><p>A similar decrease in <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib exposure to selumetinib exposure was observed when selumetinib was co-administered with rifampicin, indicating that CYP3A4 is also involved in <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib metabolism. As rifampicin is also an inducer of other CYP450 enzymes to varying degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], including CYP2C19, the increase in selumetinib and <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl selumetinib metabolism may be due to a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inductions and potentially via other CYPs as well.</p><p>The dose of selumetinib was specifically selected to account for the potential changes in exposure on co-dosing with these potent CYP enzyme modifying agents; the resulting altered selumetinib AUC and <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> values did not exceed the safety exposure limit for healthy subjects that was derived from exposures in patients at the phase III selumetinib dose of 75&#x000a0;mg twice daily. No safety concerns were identified between treatment groups.</p><p>The study design of the itraconazole and fluconazole trial proved efficient, using the same control arm for both treatments with no marked complications in recruitment or subject dropout. Moreover, there were no treatment discontinuations due to any adverse event. Observed adverse events were consistent with the safety profile of selumetinib and the additional study treatments. Selumetinib was well tolerated administered as either a single dose or when co-administered with itraconazole, fluconazole, or rifampicin. There were three adverse events (alopecia, headache, and acne, which were all of mild severity) considered related to selumetinib in the itraconazole/fluconazole trial and none in the rifampicin trial.</p><p>In the PK trials discussed, results using the CYP modulator probes for inhibition of CYP3A4 (itraconazole) or CYP2C19 (fluconazole), or induction of CYP3A4 (rifampicin), are informative of the potential exposure profile for selumetinib when co-administered with other CYP3A4/CYP2C19 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers in the clinical setting and, thus, are useful tool probes. By administering potent CYP3A4/CYP2C19 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers over a prolonged, multiple-dose regimen, this likely reflects a &#x0201c;worst case&#x0201d; situation for drug-drug interactions. The results presented here are encouraging and show that changes in the PK of selumetinib are relatively small (~50%). That said, the clinical significance of these potential changes will need to be considered together with safety and efficacy data from pivotal trials to determine any advice such as caution, additional monitoring, or dose adjustment that may be appropriate when co-administration is indicated.</p><p>A potential limitation of the current studies is that selumetinib was administered as a single dose (25 or 75&#x000a0;mg), alone, or in combination with one other treatment in healthy subjects. In the clinical setting, patients are likely to receive one or more treatments as multiple doses. However, despite this limitation, the data collected are sufficient to provide appropriate guidance in the drug label.</p><p>Another potential limitation was the separation of the itraconazole/fluconazole dosing versus selumetinib dosing to accommodate fed/fast advice for the respective treatments. Whilst it is not ideal to have this separation, it is not expected that the somewhat reduced itraconazole/fluconazole exposure at the time the selumetinib was dosed would diminish the inhibitory effects or the measured DDI too much, and it is believed that the data give a realistic assessment of the DDI risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Co-administration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole, or the potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, fluconazole, with selumetinib increased selumetinib exposure by ~50%. Thus, concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitor with selumetinib may require caution. Co-administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, with selumetinib reduced exposure to selumetinib by ~50%. These study findings will be used to advise patient use in the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
