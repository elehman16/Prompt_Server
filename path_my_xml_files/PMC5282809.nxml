All participants of the control arm received the EMPOWER brochure during the trial extension. Normal cognition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;139) or MCI (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;122) was determined during baseline cognitive testing using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment questionnaire.

For this reason, both long and short-acting benzodiazepines are listed in the 2015 Beers criteria of medications to avoid in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A mild neurocognitive disorder is defined in the DSM-5 as a noticeable decrement in cognitive function beyond that of normal aging, which requires individuals to engage in compensatory strategies to maintain independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The term is meant to replace the previously used diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Over 1-in-5 community dwelling older adults have MCI at any given time, although the exact prevalence is difficult to estimate due to the variability in the criteria used, the source of subjects, the fluctuating nature of the condition and the reference standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Individuals with MCI may demonstrate significant impairments in their ability to understand, reason and participate in health related decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Longitudinal data suggest that medical decision-making capacity in patients with MCI tends to decline over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The majority of long-term benzodiazepine users aged 65&#x000a0;years of age and older report not being concerned about side effects, mainly because they have never been alerted to the risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, when provided with evidence-based information about harm in the form of a mailed educational brochure, 27% of chronic users discontinued benzodiazepines within 6&#x000a0;months in the EMPOWER trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It remains unknown whether patients with MCI retain capacity to understand the material in the brochure, and whether they respond equally well to the educational intervention. The objective of this report is to examine whether cognitive status affected the comprehension and success rates of the EMPOWER patient-centered educational approach to the deprescribing of benzodiazepines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Design &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>Participants in the EMPOWER trial were adults aged 65&#x000a0;years and older with polypharmacy (&#x02265;5 medications), taking at least one chronic benzodiazepine prescription (&#x02265;3&#x000a0;months). Participants with self-reported epilepsy, a diagnosis of established dementia, or a mental health disorder requiring treatment with antipsychotic medication, were deemed ineligible. In order to exclude patients with undiagnosed dementia from the study, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered at an in-home baseline screening interview. The MoCA was chosen due to its high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing normal individuals from those with MCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Participants with a MoCA score of 26 and over were qualified as having normal cognition, while those with scores of 21 to 25 were classified as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Participants with scores under 21 were excluded in order to eliminate all potential cases of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the original EMPOWER trial, participants randomized to the control group were wait-listed to receive the EMPOWER brochure at the end of the 6-month study period. In an extension to the trial, participants in the control arm were followed for an additional 6&#x000a0;months after study completion in order to evaluate their response to the EMPOWER brochure. This paper analyses all EMPOWER participants (from the intervention and control arm) having received the EMPOWER brochure and having completed the post-intervention EMPOWER assessment by 1-year (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;261) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p>The EMPOWER brochure consists of an 8-page paper-based benzodiazepine deprescribing tool embedded with program theories which participants received by mail. Development of the intervention has previously been described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A generic version of the EMPOWER tool is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.criugm.qc.ca/fichier/pdf/BENZOeng.pdf">http://www.criugm.qc.ca/fichier/pdf/BENZOeng.pdf</ext-link>. The deprescribing tool was individualized with the name of the participant&#x02019;s benzodiazepine on the front page. It included true and false questions about the harms of benzodiazepines, a short paragraph describing changes in drug metabolism with age, suggestions for alternate non-drug therapies for anxiety and insomnia, a peer champion story, and a standard 21-week tapering protocol showing a picture-based diminishing schedule of full-pill, half-pill, and quarter-pill consumption. The pictogram was proposed by consumers during the development of the intervention and allows participants to apply the benzodiazepine tapering protocol regardless of the type or dose of sedative-hypnotic consumed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Baseline data, including demographic characteristics and prescription details were recorded during the initial in-person interview. Follow-up data was collected by phone 1 week, 6&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months after each participant received the EMPOWER brochure by mail. Benzodiazepine cessation or dose reduction was ascertained using pharmacy renewal profiles, which contained information on drugs purchased, dates of purchase, dose, and quantity served. Cessation was defined as an absence of any benzodiazepine prescription renewal, sustained for a minimum of 3 months during the follow-up period. A significant dose reduction consisted of a &#x0003e;25% dose reduction, sustained over a minimum of 3 months when compared to baseline use. Withdrawal symptoms were measured using the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom questionnaire 6&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention. Participants reporting any withdrawal symptoms at either time point were qualified as having experienced withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Change in knowledge, beliefs and self-efficacy to taper benzodiazepines</title><p>In order to evaluate whether MCI participants understood and reacted similarly to the content of the deprescribing intervention, we measured knowledge gained, change in beliefs, improvements in self-efficacy and frequency of outreach to a healthcare professional. Change was calculated by comparing responses on the pre and post-intervention questionnaires. For knowledge, this consisted of scores on four true or false questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Beliefs about the necessity of taking benzodiazepines versus associated harms were measured by comparing the total scores on the specific section of the beliefs about medicines questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Change in self-efficacy was evaluated with the Medication Reduction Self-efficacy scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Outreach to a healthcare professional was measured by self-report.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analysis</title><p>Participant characteristics were described using means with standard deviations for continuous data and percentages for categorical data. A chi-square test was used when comparing baseline characteristics of MCI vs non-MCI participants. Univariable logistic regression was used to determine the odds of all reported outcomes comparing participants with normal cognitive function to those with MCI. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for variables that were significantly associated with MCI at baseline, namely living arrangement, education, baseline self-efficacy and anxiety as an indication for therapy (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The results are reported as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI, as appropriate. By combining participants who were randomized to the intervention, as well as the wait-list control group who received the brochure during the trial extension, the sample was powered to detect a 15% difference in proportions of individuals with and without MCI who discontinued benzodiazepines, based on an alpha of 0.05 and 80% power. The statistical significance for all analyses was set at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 (two-sided). SPSS Version 20.0 (SPSS Inc.

Clinicians should be encouraged to distribute the EMPOWER brochure to their MCI patients in order to engage patients in conversations about deprescribing sedative hypnotics, leading to shared decision-making despite declining cognitive status.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This is the first study of its kind to explore the association between MCI and the success rates of a patient-centered educational deprescribing intervention in a community-based clinical trial of older, community-dwelling adults. As the mild neurocognitive disorder diagnosis was not yet developed at the time of the study and the MoCA&#x02019;s usefulness in detecting mild neurocognitive disorder is modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we categorized participants according to the older MCI diagnosis. Our results are only generalizable to patients with mild-to-moderate MCI since we used a MoCA cut-off score of 21, thus excluding the lower spectrum of MCI (19&#x02013;20), which overlaps with early dementia. Additionally, as we did not re-measure scores on the MOCA at study endpoint, and were unable to ascertain whether cognition improved after discontinuation. The mean lorazepam equivalent dose was only 1.25&#x000a0;mg/day in both groups of participants, which may have facilitated tapering.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This report illustrates that the EMPOWER brochure can be distributed to community-dwelling older adults with MCI and still work, whether directly through patient comprehension of the material or through the support of caregivers or family. The EMPOWER tool can and should be used in primary care or memory clinics for chronic benzodiazepine users who are candidates for deprescribing sedative-hypnotic medication.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We express gratitude to all the participants and pharmacists who took part in this trial.
