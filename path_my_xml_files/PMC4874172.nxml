Although treatments for cancer-related anorexia do exist, patients have sought complementary and alternative medicine including herbal remedies, due to safety concerns. Sipjeondaebo-tang is one among other popular herbal medicines that are beneficial to management of anorexia in Korea. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility for a full randomised clinical trial of Sipjeondaebo-tang for cancer-related anorexia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study is a randomised, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial of Sipjeondaebo-tang. For the study, 40 patients with cancer, aged 20&#x02013;80&#x02005;years, who reported anorexia, will be recruited. The participants will receive either 3&#x02005;g of Sipjeondaebo-tang or a placebo, 3 times a day for 4&#x02005;weeks. The primary end point is a change in the anorexia/cachexia subscale (A/CS) of Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT). The secondary end points include changes in the visual analogue scale (VAS) of appetite, cortisol and ghrelin. The outcomes will be measured on every visit. Each participant will visit once a week during 4&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The present study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Dunsan Korean Medicine Hospital of Daejeon University (reference DJDSKH-15-03-2 (V.2.0)).

In 2012, there were 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths from cancer, while 32.6 million people throughout the world lived with cancer.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In Korea, cancer is also the leading cause of mortality, and researchers assume that this trend will continue for several years.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Global Industry Analysts, Inc (GIA), estimate that the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) market will reach 114 billion in dollars until 2015.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In this context, much CAM research on cancer has been conducted. However, most of the research consists of preclinical studies or studies on development of new drugs.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Patients with cancer often suffer from anorexia, which is one of the major cancer-associated symptoms. If herbal medicine alleviates the symptom, it will contribute to improving quality of life in patients with cancer. SJDBT has been recognised as being a potentially effective herbal medicine for management of anorexia in patients with cancer and is a frequently prescribed herbal medicine in real practice in East Asian countries. However, there are few clinical trials investigating its efficacy and safety. Although there are clinical studies on SJDBT, the study participants are limited to hip surgery and haemodialysis patients. There has been no clinical trial on SJDBT for patients with cancer.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thus, in this study, we will evaluate the efficacy of SJDBT, an herbal medicine consisting of 10 herbs that are known to be beneficial to strengthen the body after illness and to treat anorexia. In practice, it is difficult to confirm whether or not the cause of anorexia is cancer. Thus the present study will recruit every patient with cancer who has anorexia, but exclude participants who have disease or symptoms that can influence on appetite, such as depression, pain and hypoadrenalism. For recruiting participants who are currently suffering from cancer, patients who have survived for at least 5&#x02005;years after cancer diagnosis will be excluded.</p><p>Even though similar studies have already been published on cancer treatment using herbal medicines such as Shu Gan Jian Pi granules, Fuzheng Kang'ai decoction and Shen-Mai San,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref> this study has its own significance. First, it is the first randomised controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of SJDBT for treatment of cancer-associated anorexia in Korea. Whereas the studies mentioned above focused on cancer-related fatigue, quality of life and survival itself, this study focuses on anorexia in patients with cancer and measures anorexia-related factors including both, patients' reported outcomes such as FAACT, and anorexia VAS and biomarkers such as ACTH, cortisol and ghrelin, to evaluate them objectively. Second, the study is the first trial protocol using qi-deficiency syndrome and blood deficiency syndrome to evaluate the general health status of patients with cancer reporting anorexia. The present study focuses on qi-deficiency and blood deficiency, which are both included in prescription criteria of SJDBT as well as anorexia. According to prescriptionology, SJDBT has its effectiveness in tonifying qi and blood,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and thus it is clinically significant to evaluate the deficiencies of qi and blood. This trial may also provide scientific evidence for the efficacy of SJDBT for tonifying qi and blood and for increasing appetite. However, this study also has limitations, mostly stemming from its relatively small sample size and the fact that it is a single-centre pilot trial. Considering recruitment feasibility, patients with cancer with different types and at different stages will be recruited, making the characteristics of each type and stage difficult to detect. Further studies are needed to assess the influence of the specific type and stage of cancer. Despite these limitations, this study would serve as a pilot report to plan further clinical trials on herbal medicine and cancer-related anorexia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Hanpoong Pharm &#x00026; Foods Co, Ltd, for providing investigational product support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CC and SP wrote the initial manuscript and monitored this trial.
