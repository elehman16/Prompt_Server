antidepressant medication, but the responses to antidepressant treatment are only partial,
even poor, among 30%&#x02013;45% of patients. Refractory depression is
defined as depression that does not respond to antidepressant therapy after 4 weeks of
use. There is evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may exert
effects in treating psychiatric disorder through moderating focal neuronal functions.
High-frequency rTMS on the left prefrontal area and low-frequency rTMS on the right
prefrontal area were shown to be effective in alleviating depressive symptoms. Given the
statistically significant antidepressant effectiveness noted, the clinical application of
rTMS as a depression treatment warrants further studies. Application of rTMS as an add-on
therapy would be a practical research model. High-frequency (5&#x02013;20 Hz) rTMS over
the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was found to have a significant effect on
medication-resistant depression. In the present study, we not only measured the acute
antidepressant effect of rTMS during treatment and immediately after its completion but
also evaluated participants 1 month after completion of the treatment protocol. Study
participants were divided into two groups: an active rTMS group (n = 10) and a
sham group (n = 10). The active rTMS group was defined as participants who
received the rTMS protocol, and the sham group was defined as participants who received a
sham rTMS procedure. A significant Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score reduction was
observed in both groups after the fifth and tenth treatments. However, those in the active
rTMS group maintained their improvement as measured one month after completion of the rTMS
protocol. Participants who received active rTMS were more likely to have persistent
improvement in depression scores than participants who received sham rTMS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>treatment-resistant depression</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>adverse effect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is not a rare disorder in the general population.

High-frequency (5&#x02013;20 Hz) rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
was found to have a significant effect on medication-resistant depression in
meta-analyses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ndt-9-397">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ndt-9-397">11</xref> However, few studies with good

efficacy of rTMS in treating depressed Chinese patients. In addition, previous studies of
the efficacy of rTMS in treating MDD have focused on the acute antidepressant effect during
treatment. In the present study, we not only measured the acute antidepressant effect of
rTMS during treatment and immediately after its completion but also evaluated participants 1
month after completion of the treatment protocol. The study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of the Department of Health of the Republic of China
(Taiwan).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants in this study were recruited from our hospital from January 1, 2008, to
October 31, 2008. Patients who had received a diagnosis of MDD according to Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. criteria were evaluated using the
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Participants were also required to have
treatment-resistant depression that had not responded to two different antidepressants
administered for 6 weeks each. Patients were excluded from the study if they were
considered to have a high risk of suicide. Patients were also excluded if they had any
physical abnormality such as a head injury or epilepsy or if they had an implanted
pacemaker.</p><p>In the screening phase, if a patient had a score of over 24 on the Beck Depression
Inventory, version 2 (BDI-II), he or she was invited to complete a subsequent interview.
Those with scores of over 18 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) were
entered into the trial. Initially, 60 inpatients were selected and asked to visit our
clinics for the study. A total of 34 patients completed the screening process and met the
inclusion criteria.</p><p>Study participants were randomized into two groups: an active rTMS group and a sham
group. They received the same antidepressant and keep unchanged dosage during the rTMS
protocol. The active rTMS group was defined as participants who received the rTMS
protocol, and the sham group was defined as participants who received a sham rTMS
procedure. A total of 13 patients were unable to be hospitalized during the rTMS protocol,
so they were not included in this study. The final study sample consisted of 21 people
because people who met the criteria were able to receive the protocol in our hospital. The
clinical trial was performed using a double blind and randomized design. All subjects
joining the trial gave informed consent before they entered the protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>rTMS protocol</title><p>A well-trained psychiatrist (CHC) performed rTMS using a magnetic stimulator (Magstim
Company Ltd, Whitland, UK) with four booster modules with a figure-eight-shaped coil.
Participants were seated upright in a comfortable chair during the procedure. Before the
first treatment, we determined the motor threshold at rest for the right abductor pollicis
muscle, as in previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ndt-9-397">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ndt-9-397">15</xref> The DLPFC stimulation was defined as 5 cm
in front of the site of the right abductor pollicis muscle in the parasagittal plane (the
thumb), as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ndt-9-397">16</xref></p><p>None of the patients had received rTMS prior to this study. Each patient underwent 10
sessions of rTMS over the left DLPFC within 4 weeks, at 90% motor threshold. Sham
stimulation occurred in exactly the same manner as active rTMS, except that the angle of
the coil, rather than being tangential to the skull, was at 90 degrees to the skull. This
created a similar sensation in the patient but appeared not to actually stimulate the
motor cortex as in the active condition. Other parameters of stimulation characteristics
were as follows: 20 Hz, 20 trains of 2 seconds duration, 12 minutes per session, 10
sessions of stimulation over a 2-week period (10 weekdays).</p></sec><sec><title>Psychiatric assessment</title><p>Two scales were used to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in medication-resistant depression:
the BDI-II and the 17-item HAM-D. In addition, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) was
used because of a previous report of rTMS-induced mania.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ndt-9-397">17</xref> The Brief Psychotic Rating Scale (BPRS) was used if the
participant suffered from depression with psychotic features. Thus, assessments using the
BDI-II, HAM-D, YMRS, and BPRS were performed before the start of the treatment protocol,
after the fifth treatment session, after the tenth treatment session, and 1 month after
completion of ten treatment sessions. The raters who evaluated the patients did not know
whether a participant had been assigned to the rTMS or sham group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sex and age of study participants were recorded. The effects of rTMS on BDI-II and
HAM-D scores were analyzed. Analysis was performed using SPSS software (v 13.0; IBM
Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA), and the level of statistical significance was set at
<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 21 participants (9 males and 12 females) entered the trial. The baseline YMRS
and BPRS scores were less than 4 in both groups, and they remained stable during and after
the trial. One patient in the sham group withdrew from the study because of unspecified
somatic complaints. Thus, 20 patients completed the trial and 1 month follow-up. Of these 20
patients, 10 were in the active rTMS group and 10 were in the sham group. The
patients&#x02019; ages ranged from 20 to 62 years, and the mean (SD) age was 44.1 (4.4)
years in the active rTMS group and 47.3 (3.5) years in the sham group, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-9-397">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The baseline mean (SD) BDI-II scores were 32.1 (4.5) in the active rTMS group and 37.8
(2.4) in the sham group. The BDI-II scores after the fifth treatment were 26.5 (3.8) in the
active rTMS group and 29.2 (3.4) in the sham group. The BDI-II scores after the tenth
treatment were 24.2 (4.4) in the active rTMS group and 26.0 (4.9) in the sham group. The
BDI-II scores 1 month after the completion of treatment were 25.9 (8.4) in the active rTMS
group and 21.8 (2.7) in the sham group. No significant difference was found in the change in
BDI-II scores between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-9-397">Table
1</xref>).</p><p>The baseline mean (SD) HAM-D scores were 23.5 (1.9) in the active rTMS group and 24.9 (1.9)
in the sham group. The HAM-D scores after the fifth treatment were 16.1 (2.8) in the active
rTMS group and 17.5 (1.6) in the sham group. The HAM-D scores after the tenth treatment were
9.6 (1.5) in the active rTMS group and 12.3 (1.4) in the sham group. A significant change
was observed in both groups after the fifth and tenth treatments. However, those in the
active rTMS group maintained their improvement as measured by the HAM-D 1 month after the
completion of treatment. The HAM-D scores 1 month after the completion of treatment were 9.8
(1.6) in the active rTMS group and 16.4 (1.5) in the sham group with the difference being
statistically significant. If we used a 50% decrease in the HAM-D scores as the
cutoff point of a responder, there were no significant differences between two groups after
the tenth treatment but the active rTMS group was significantly superior than the sham group
1 month after the protocol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-9-397">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The YMRS and BPRS scores were less than 4 at baseline in both groups. These scores remained
stable during the trial and 1 month after the completion of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The change in HAM-D scores indicates that participants in both study groups improved after
the completion of treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-9-397">Table 1</xref>).
There were similar responders in the two groups after the tenth treatment. This result
differs from previous reports of a significant difference between active and sham rTMS
groups immediately after the completion of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ndt-9-397">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ndt-9-397">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ndt-9-397">18</xref> However, in the present study, participants
in the active rTMS group retained their improvement after 1 month, with a significant
difference observed between the two groups. Thus, participants receiving active rTMS had a
longer antidepressant-like response than did participants receiving sham treatment.
Percentage of responders in the active rTMS group was also significantly higher in
comparision to the sham group. The longer-term effect of rTMS is not well understood, and
studies with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate the duration of its effectiveness.</p><p>No significant difference was observed between the two groups in change in BDI-II scores.
This result differs from those of previous reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ndt-9-397">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-9-397">19</xref> It is important to evaluate
the difference between raters&#x02019; reports and self-report measurements such as the
BDI-II in order to better evaluate the antidepressant effect of active rTMS. The discrepant
antidepressant effects evaluated by HAM-D and BDI have at least four possible explanations:
First, they are evaluated in different ways.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ndt-9-397">20</xref> HAM-D is an observer rating and BDI is a self-report. Second, they measure
different depression symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ndt-9-397">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ndt-9-397">22</xref> The HAM-D accentuates somatic and behavioral
symptoms of depression, whereas the BDI emphasizes the subjective experience of depression.
Third, they have different sensitivity and effect sizes. In the course of antidepressant
treatment, a more pronounced decline in HAMD than in BDI scores has often been
reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ndt-9-397">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ndt-9-397">22</xref> Fourth, the discrepancy between HAM-D and BDI is not a
unique phenomenon. It was also reported in a previous rTMS study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ndt-9-397">23</xref></p><p>Although the discrepant change in HAM-D and BDI scores existed, our study still
demonstrated the antidepressant effect of rTMS. However, the effect was
&#x0201c;modest,&#x0201d; just as Garcia-Toro et al claimed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ndt-9-397">23</xref> The effects might be more related to somatic and behavioral
symptoms than subjective experiences. Therefore, the antidepressant effect of rTMS could be
noticed more easily by the observer rather than the patients themselves.</p><p>Some limitations of this study may affect interpretation of its results. First, the sex
distribution was not the same in the two groups; thus, the effect of rTMS may differ between
female and male populations. Another limitation is that all the data were collected while
the patients were also using antidepressant medication. The possibility that the difference
in change in HAM-D scores between the two groups was influenced by the combined effect of
antidepressants and rTMS cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study revealed an effect of rTMS that remained 1 month after the
completion of treatment. Participants who received active rTMS were more likely to have
persistent improvement in depression scores than were participants who received sham rTMS.
This information may be useful in future planning of rTMS treatment for MDD or other
psychiatric diseases. Further studies of the duration of effectiveness of rTMS are
warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>HCT received a grant from Tzu-Chi General Hospital. CCHL worked as a fulltime
