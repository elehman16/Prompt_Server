These impairments contribute to a high number of secondary health conditions, including psychological disorders and chronic pain.<xref rid="b1-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Rehabilitation in the post-SCI period is often focused on physical therapies and psychological interventions to support the recovery process, which may include access to resources or services to foster physical activity and community engagement (eg, therapeutic recreation). The post-SCI period requires a reorientation to meaningful life activities and flexibility engaging with new challenges in the context of abrupt physical and emotional changes.<xref rid="b3-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><sec><title>Psychological distress and pain</title><p>The rates of psychological disorders (eg, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder) after SCI range from 17% to 25%, highlighting this population&#x02019;s vulnerability to psychological distress,<xref rid="b4-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> which is considerably higher than the general population.<xref rid="b5-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A longitudinal study evaluating psychological health in individuals with SCI from 12 weeks to 10 years postinjury demonstrated that the rates of anxiety and depression were relatively stable.<xref rid="b7-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Not surprisingly, the relationship between physical and mental health is correlated for individuals with SCI, such that those with higher levels of physical symptoms, such as pain or fatigue, also report greater psychological distress, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms and poorer quality of life (QoL).<xref rid="b8-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Eighty-one percent of individuals with SCI report chronic pain up to 5 years postinjury, which can impact physical, social, psychological, and functional facets of living.<xref rid="b11-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Pain in individuals who have sustained SCI is classified by the International SCI Pain Classification according to three tiers.<xref rid="b13-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The first tier classifies the type of pain (eg, nociceptive, neuropathic, or &#x0201c;other&#x0201d;), and the second tier classifies the subtype of pain. Subtypes of nociceptive pain are classified as musculoskeletal, visceral, or &#x0201c;other&#x0201d;, and subtypes of neuropathic pain are classified as &#x0201c;at level SCI&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;below level SCI&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;other&#x0201d;. The third tier includes the primary pain source and pathology, and it is recommended to consider pain intensity also. This system parallels earlier systems that classify pain according to etiology, pathology, location, severity, and quality, and according to four dimensions: musculoskeletal, visceral, neuropathic, or &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; types, all of which significantly impact QoL.<xref rid="b1-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Pain is also classified relative to the level of the spinal injury: pain at or below the level of the injury tends to be neuropathic in nature, and depending on the completeness of the lesion may be akin to phantom pain. This pain is often referred to the lower limbs via the convergence and summation of inputs (somatic and visceral) in higher central nervous system structures. Pain above the level of the injury tends to be musculoskeletal in nature, and may arise from overuse. Musculoskeletal pain in individuals with traumatic SCI has been reported to be the most frequently reported type of pain.<xref rid="b12-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>According to the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain, pain catastrophizing, pain-related fears, and pain-related anxiety all contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain through a network of escape and avoidance behaviors, behavioral inactivity, the deconditioning syndrome, and disability.<xref rid="b14-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Pain-related cognitions, such as pain catastrophizing, are recognized as negatively impacting pain-related experiences and functional ability in individuals with SCI.<xref rid="b15-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Both active and passive pain-related coping statements have been correlated with pain intensity and unpleasantness in individuals with SCI in a pilot, longitudinal study, and it is recommended that pain-coping styles be addressed in the rehabilitation process to tailor treatments best to different response types.<xref rid="b16-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Bolstering inner resources</title><p>Current rehabilitation models typically focus on symptom reduction or health vulnerabilities, but there is increasing recognition that augmenting inner resources, such as self-efficacy, posttraumatic growth, and resilience, may serve as a buffer from challenging experiences and/or create positive psychological change after SCI.<xref rid="b17-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These constructs may also function in secondary synergistic and interconnected relationships for individuals with SCI. A cross-sectional study employing a convenience population found that self-efficacy was positively correlated with resilience while in hospital and at 3 months post-SCI, and that levels of self-efficacy predicted levels of resilience while in hospital.<xref rid="b21-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Similarly, self-efficacy, as well as low levels of depressed mood, predict resilience in individuals with SCI at discharge and 6 months postdischarge from an inpatient rehabilitation setting into the community.<xref rid="b22-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It has been recommended that rehabilitation strategies enhance self-efficacy by strengthening the relationship between behaviors and perceived goals through increased self-monitoring and self-awareness.<xref rid="b4-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Posttraumatic growth refers to the profound self-transformation that can emerge from suffering, pain, and trauma, and posits that growth and adaptability can be natural consequences of traumatic experiences.<xref rid="b23-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A model examining posttraumatic growth, depression, demographics, and injury characteristics in a community-based, cross-sectional study found that most individuals with SCI experienced some experiential growth postinjury, and these authors recommended further development of conceptual models of this construct in the context of SCI.<xref rid="b23-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Also, posttraumatic growth has been associated with higher levels of psychological distress in community-based individuals with SCI, highlighting it as a potentially useful target for improving well-being in this population.<xref rid="b7-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>A construct related to posttraumatic growth is resilience, which refers to adaptive coping and the ability to respond flexibly to adverse life events in a positive and growth-promoting way.<xref rid="b24-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This construct is particularly important in health conditions that can render an individual helpless or vulnerable to developing secondary psychological conditions. Resilience has been found to mediate the impact of pain on depression, such that resilience reduced the effect of pain severity on depression and was also found independently to predict both depression (negatively) and posttraumatic growth (positively).<xref rid="b18-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Latent growth mixture-modeling analysis of a longitudinal study evaluating individuals with SCI at 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years found that resilient individuals had fewer SCI-related QoL problems, evaluated stressors as challenges rather than threats, had greater acceptance and did not cope by using behavioral avoidance.<xref rid="b25-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Higher levels of resilience have also been associated with higher levels of self-efficacy, internal locus of control, and lower levels of psychological distress in community-dwelling adults with SCI in a cross-sectional postal survey.<xref rid="b17-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Increasing resilience may be a useful target for rehabilitation and have secondary gains in terms of fostering positive growth post-SCI.<xref rid="b18-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Constructs embedded in third-wave therapies, such as psychological flexibility, mindfulness, and self-compassion, have origins in Buddhist and Eastern contemplative philosophies, and are being incorporated into contemporary psychological and health interventions.<xref rid="b26-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A common thread among these constructs is the disentanglement of pain and suffering and shared attitudes of openness, nonjudgment, and present-mindedness. Psychological flexibility is negatively associated with depression, pain-related anxiety, physical disability, and psychosocial disability in individuals undergoing interdisciplinary treatment for chronic pain.<xref rid="b30-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It has been suggested that psychological flexibility involves a willingness to experience distressing emotions or pain, rather than avoiding or &#x0201c;pushing up&#x0201d; against them, with consequent reductions in suffering and improvements in daily functioning.<xref rid="b30-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Similarly, mindfulness has been found negatively to predict pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, pain hypervigilance, negative affect, and functional disability in chronic pain patients.<xref rid="b31-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The role of acceptance is an important factor in healthy psychological adaptation to SCI,<xref rid="b32-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and acceptance cognitions were associated with better mental health in a prospective study evaluating community-dwelling individuals with SCI over time.<xref rid="b33-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Self-compassion has been associated with self-efficacy and resilience in individuals with spina bifida,<xref rid="b19-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and is a significant predictor of positive and negative affect, pain catastrophizing, and pain disability in individuals with chronic pain and obesity.<xref rid="b29-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> To date, there have been no studies to evaluate self-compassion or psychological flexibility in the context of a rehabilitation intervention or as theoretically relevant for an SCI population.</p></sec><sec><title>Yoga as a health intervention</title><p>Focus groups consisting of individuals with SCI and physicians indicate that there is a need for highly individualized treatment approaches and a desire for complementary health therapies for SCI-related pain.<xref rid="b34-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Yoga is an ancient mind&#x02013;body practice dating back to 3,000 BC, and is traditionally defined as cultivating deep concentrative awareness, predominantly through the use of physical postures.

In addition, the role of stress in the development, maintenance, and exacerbation of chronic diseases is now widely accepted, and thus lifestyle factors that remediate stress, such as yoga, are of increasing value.<xref rid="b59-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p><p>Although there is an abundance of research evaluating the impact of yoga on chronic conditions and limited mobility, there is sparse research on the use of yoga for SCI. To date, there has been only one pilot study outlining the potential benefits of a yoga intervention for individuals with SCI, in which descriptive qualitative analysis revealed that participating in a specialized 8-week yoga program provided therapeutic benefits in emotional (increased present mindedness), mental (decreased stress), and physical domains (decreased pain).<xref rid="b60-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> A case report evaluating a twice-weekly, 12-week yoga intervention for an individual with SCI suggested that yoga may result in improvements in balance, strength, endurance, flexibility, posture, and functional outcomes.<xref rid="b61-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Yoga has also yielded benefits in individuals with scoliosis with respect to the degree of curvature of the spine, and there are now well-documented benefits for yoga reducing functional disability for chronic back pain.<xref rid="b38-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b62-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> It has been suggested that Iyengar yoga (IY) be integrated into SCI rehabilitation therapies to increase physical functioning and to cultivate a positive mind&#x02013;body experience.<xref rid="b63-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> IY has been selected as an appropriate form of yoga for individuals with chronic conditions and mobility restrictions, as it emphasizes careful alignment of the muscles and bones in each posture, in order to execute each pose with optimum safety and awareness, and to minimize the risk of injury or strain.<xref rid="b63-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="b64-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> This type of yoga is based on the principles of precise alignment, purposeful sequencing, and specific timing to hold postures.<xref rid="b65-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Yoga programs may be easily modified for varying degrees of impairment and mobility, making yoga a highly accessible intervention for this population.

The present study had one primary hypothesis and two secondary hypotheses. Firstly, participants in the IY group would demonstrate greater improvements in psychological inflexibility from pre- to postintervention compared to the wait-list control (WLC) group. Specifically, it was predicted that scores on measures evaluating psychological inflexibility at postintervention would be significantly lower in the IY group compared to the WLC group. Secondly, the IY group was expected to show greater improvements in pain and psychological measures from pre- to postintervention compared to the WLC group. Specifically, it was predicted that scores on measures evaluating self-efficacy, posttraumatic growth, resilience, mindfulness, and self-compassion would be significantly higher in the IY group compared to the WLC group at postintervention. It was predicted that scores on measures evaluating depressive symptoms and anxiety would be significantly lower in the IY group compared to the WLC group at postintervention. For participants with ongoing chronic pain, it was predicted that scores on measures evaluating pain, pain interference, and pain catastrophizing would be significantly lower in the IY group compared to the WLC group at postintervention. Thirdly, when combining the two groups we expected to see significant improvement on all measures from pre- to postintervention. Specifically, it was predicted that scores on measures evaluating psychological inflexibility, depressive symptoms, anxiety, pain, pain interference, and pain catastrophizing would be significantly lower from pre- to postintervention and scores on measures evaluating self-efficacy, posttraumatic growth, resilience, mindfulness, and self-compassion would be significantly higher from pre- to postintervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Trial-design overview</title><p>This two group, unblinded, crossover, pilot RCT was designed in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines, approved by the research ethics boards at the University Health Network (UHN)/Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (TRI) and York University, and registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02656927). This study employed an external pilot design, in order to provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of a yoga intervention for individuals with SCI, and to provide a foundation for a larger-scale RCT.<xref rid="b66-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="b67-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> Recruitment and retention for a previous trial evaluating yoga for individuals with SCI had low retention,<xref rid="b60-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> and so this pilot study would provide information on whether it is possible to recruit and retain individuals with SCI in compliance with an RCT design. This pilot study would also describe the intervention and its implementation, as well as determine safety and tolerability.<xref rid="b68-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> This RCT used a parallel design with a crossover feature, such that the WLC group received the yoga intervention after it had been provided to the IY group. The trial evaluated the effects of a specialized IY intervention versus a WLC group on psychological well-being, pain and related variables, and mindfulness factors. Participants (n=23) were randomized to one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Participants assigned to the modified IY (n=11) group received a twice-weekly, 6-week IY intervention; participants assigned to the 6-week WLC (n=12) group received the same 6-week IY intervention, starting the week after the IY group had completed the yoga intervention.</p><p>It has been suggested that RCTs are not always categorical according to the pragmatic&#x02013;explanatory dimension, and rather fit along a continuum in order best to evaluate a specific intention or research question.<xref rid="b69-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> This study sought to assess meaningfully the impact of a yoga intervention using a pragmatic design with explanatory features. Participant recruitment followed a pragmatic design, such that all participants with a broad range of SCI or SC-related conditions, irrespective of comorbidities or past compliance, were included. The active intervention adhered to explanatory models of RCTs in that the yoga program was highly specialized for individuals with SCI, was rooted in classical physical and contemplative traditions of yoga, and was taught by yoga instructors with high-level certifications. However, the WLC group received standard care if they were outpatients or no treatment if they were community members, which is consistent with a pragmatic design. Similarly, the design for data collection also used both pragmatic and explanatory factors: data collection was done via standardized questionnaires rather than administrative databases (explanatory), and qualitative interviews were used to assess meaningfully the impact of the yoga intervention (pragmatic). Extensive training was not required to administer these questionnaires (pragmatic; no biological or physiological parameters). Special strategies were not used to maintain or monitor compliance and adherence, other than attendance, which was in line with a pragmatic design. In summary, this study used primarily a pragmatic design with explanatory features to balance feasibility of testing a yoga intervention for a complex population under usual conditions in a hospital and rehabilitation setting with experimental rigor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The RCT took place at the TRI&#x02019;s UHN Lyndhurst Centre (LC) Brain and Spinal Cord Rehabilitation Program. LC staff circulated/posted flyers describing the yoga study and recruiting participants. Recruitment was also done via email, announcement board (including electronic versions, eg, postings on websites), and verbally at various interprofessional meetings. TRI staff were provided with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in the study for preliminary screening. A member of the research team completed a formal screen and determined eligibility for participation for individuals (n=45) who expressed interest in participating in the study. Of the 45 participants that were recruited, only 23 were eligible and available to participate. One of these participants was not able to provide a physician&#x02019;s note and so this person was excluded (n=22).</p><p>The yoga program was offered to outpatients on the waiting list for the activity room and other individuals with SCI who were connected with the LC, which included persons interacting with Spinal Cord Injury Canada (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sci-can.ca">http://sci-can.ca</ext-link>), an SCI consumer-advocacy organization. Specific inclusion criteria for participation were the presence of an SCI or spinal-related condition (all levels of injury), being aged 18 years or older, the ability to speak and read English, ability to commit to twice-weekly 1-hour yoga classes for 6 weeks, a referral from a clinician on the interdisciplinary team (if they were an outpatient at the LC), a sitting tolerance of 1 hour, ability to participate in gentle physical activity for 1 hour, awareness of health contraindications (ability to practice safely), and provision of a note from a physician indicating that it was safe for them to participate in a physical activity intervention, such as yoga. Gentle physical activity referred to actively engaging in low-impact activity in a purposeful and careful manner. Participants were excluded if there were not medically stable, had preexisting medical contraindications (determined by physician), had cognitive limitations or language-comprehension issues that would impact participation (determined by physician), or had had regular yoga practice in the previous 6 months (approximately once per week for a minimum of 1 month). The classification of SCI was broad, and included demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system or developmental/birth insult to the SC.</p><p>Persons who met eligibility requirements and who continued to express an interest in hearing more about the study were invited to a group-information session or to an individual meeting with a research team member (KC).

Each assessment time point was approximately 1 hour long and occurred within 1&#x02013;2 weeks of the beginning or ending of the yoga programs. Participants were provided with a questionnaire package to fill out independently at a table. A research-team member was available to answer questions. At T1, participants filled out the questionnaire package (see &#x0201c;Measures&#x0201d; section), and forms regarding demographic information (eg, ethnicity, income), SCI-related health information, medication, and a scale measuring secondary health conditions (Spinal Cord Injury Secondary Conditions Scale &#x02013; modified).<xref rid="b70-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="b71-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> There were no semistructured questions.

Participants in the WLC group attended a separate T2 data-collection session or set up an individual meeting with a member of the research team. At T3, participants in the WLC group filled out the questionnaires after the final yoga class. Participants with any fine-motor difficulties were offered assistance by a member of the research team for recording their answers. All the data were deidentified, and each participant&#x02019;s data was coded. Original participant names and codes were recorded in a password-protected document.

Randomization was blocked according to sex, and specified the group (IY or WLC) to which each prospective participant would be allocated upon enrollment into the trial. An opaque envelope containing the participant number and group assignment was prepared, sealed, and numbered for each potential participant. This envelope was opened at the time that each participant was randomized.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Individuals with SCI represent a vulnerable population and are a relatively overresearched group. Respect for their dignity was ensured through a careful consent process and with a thorough explanation of risks and possible benefits of participation. As mentioned earlier, no special strategies were used to maintain enrollment throughout the study. Confidentiality for participant privacy and secure data storing was maintained at all phases of the research process. In order to reduce barriers to participation for low-income individuals, transport tokens were provided, which promoted values of inclusion and equality.

The 6-week yoga intervention was held at the Therapeutic Recreation Department at the TRI/LC&#x02019;s Brain and Spinal Cord Rehabilitation Program. The duration of 6 weeks, dosage of two classes a week, class length of 60 minutes and total intervention hours (12) was decided in alignment with the yoga literature,<xref rid="b72-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> and participants were encouraged only to practice basic poses that had been determined safe and after they had practiced them with supervision for several classes.<xref rid="b64-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> The classes were offered at no cost to the participants. The program was designed and taught by certified IY teachers, who were certified as intermediate senior 1 and intermediate junior 3 teachers of IY. Both of these certification levels are advanced, and involve multiple (two to four) trips to study at the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute in Pune, India. Also, both teachers had 1) 22&#x02013;26 years of teaching yoga, 2) advanced training in therapeutics of IY, 3) knowledge of yoga philosophy<xref rid="b35-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and mindfulness-based practices, and 4) experience teaching yoga to limited-mobility populations. The class structure and content was based upon a book written by one of the teachers on a major yoga-philosophy text<xref rid="b35-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and a manual previously used in a research trial evaluating yoga for individuals receiving complex care in a hospital setting.<xref rid="b52-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> An LC recreation therapist was available for consultation during all the classes.</p></sec><sec><title>Wait-list control group</title><p>After informed, written consent to participate had been obtained, participants randomized to the WLC group received no additional treatment. They were informed that they would receive the same 6-week IY intervention after a period of 6 weeks, and should not start yoga practice while waiting for the intervention to commence.</p></sec><sec><title>Yoga program</title><p>The classes involved a broad and integrated approach to yoga and included breathing practices (pr&#x00101;&#x01e47;&#x00101;y&#x00101;ma), physical postures (&#x00101;sana), yoga philosophy (j&#x000f1;&#x00101;na), mindfulness (sm&#x01e5b;ti s&#x00101;dhan&#x00101;), and meditation/relaxation (dh&#x00101;ra&#x01e47;&#x00101;, dhy&#x00101;na) techniques. There is flexibility in the school of IY as to how the physical practices are applied (gentle versus more vigorous), and these can be easily modified according to the needs of the student. IY typically uses a variety of props as aids in performing &#x00101;sanas (postures), and this intervention used blankets to accompany principles of right action and alignment, in particular with regard to posture and for the action of lifting the chest. The emphasis on self-development and awareness is inextricably linked with the physical &#x00101;sanas, and the practice is conceptualized as a transformative process for mental, physical, and spiritual health, with consequent gains in energy and vitality.<xref rid="b73-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></p><p>Each class opened with a brief philosophy concept (~5 minutes, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-10-999">Table 2</xref>), which was based on relevant contemplative and reflective practices from Pata&#x000f1;jali Yoga S&#x0016b;tras that focused on self-study, personal development, observances, ethical discipline, and attitudes of acceptance, among others.<xref rid="b35-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This was followed by a concentration practice (dh&#x00101;ra&#x01e47;&#x00101;), with breathing, mindfulness, and relaxation components (~10&#x02013;15 minutes). The &#x00101;sana practice (~20&#x02013;30 minutes) focused on upper-body postures that were sequenced in a purposeful way to build on awareness and actions learned in previous poses. The sequences consisted of preparatory arm work, &#x0016b;rdhva hast&#x00101;sana (single arm and both arms), baddhanguliy&#x00101;sana, garu&#x01e0d;&#x00101;sana, hast&#x00101;sana with arms out to the side, gentle twist to either side, and neck stretch to either side and forward, using baddhanguliy&#x00101;sana bound fingers. In addition, breath&#x02013;movement coordination was used to transition between poses and to encourage sustained inward focus. There was a focus in each class on the principles of lifting the heart/chest, centering the head over the spine, and creating space in the spinal vertebrae. Repetition was emphasized so that participants could learn the sequence by the end of the study. Participants who required hands-on assistance were attended to by a yoga teacher. Participants were encouraged to push gently the edge of comfort and actively engage their muscles to build strength and flexibility, while also practicing safely within personal limits with respect to pain and fatigue. Safe variations or modifications were provided to participants with more limited arm movement, so that they could participate in all parts of the &#x00101;sana portion of the class. One participant with tetraplegia used a table for support in some &#x00101;sanas.

The results also suggest that the yoga intervention increased levels of mindfulness broadly, and also for specific components of mindfulness, such as the capacity to observe and not react to internal experience. These results do not confirm hypothesis one, but partially confirm hypotheses two and three. The yoga program was considered safe, with no reported adverse effects. All participants who began the yoga intervention completed it. Some attrition occurred at the time of randomization, with mostly logistical reasons of not being able to attend the sessions. This contrasts with our previous study, in which there was a high rate of attrition.<xref rid="b60-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></p><p>The lower scores for depressive symptoms at postintervention for the IY group were consistent with improvements from other yoga trials evaluating mood for limited-mobility populations and with previously documented evidence regarding the efficacy of yoga for clinical depression, according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine method of appropriateness.<xref rid="b45-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Depression was found to improve clinically in individuals with poststroke hemiparesis after participation in a 10-week yoga trial compared to no treatment controls.<xref rid="b100-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">100</xref> For participants with osteoarthritis, participation in a twice-weekly 8-week, &#x0201c;sit &#x02018;n&#x02019; fit&#x0201d; yoga program resulted in improvements in depression symptoms compared to an attention control group.<xref rid="b101-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">101</xref> A pilot trial evaluating the utility of yoga plus intensive physical therapy for individuals with multiple sclerosis found improvements in depressive symptoms when using the same scale as the present study (HADS-D).<xref rid="b102-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">102</xref> In addition, a pilot RCT evaluating the impact of an innovative yoga program consisting of classical breath exercises, relaxation, and meditation for individuals with Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome found improvements in depressive symptoms for individuals randomized to the yoga group compared to individuals receiving standard rehabilitation program, as measured by the HADS-D.<xref rid="b103-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">103</xref> The classification of SCI in this present study was broad and included demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, and so the results of similar studies emphasizing the breath-exercise and meditative components of a yoga program indicate that these accessible and more subtle elements of yoga may be useful and applicable for individuals who have limited range of motion or who have had trauma to the central nervous system.</p><p>The increased levels of self-compassion postintervention indicate that individuals in the yoga condition experienced a change in psychological orientation to pain and suffering compared to the WLC group. The present finding that self-compassion increased significantly from preintervention to postintervention parallels the results from other yoga-research trials involving chronic health populations. Individuals living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator who were randomized to a once weekly 8-week yoga intervention demonstrated increased self-compassion at the end of the yoga program compared to a treatment-as-usual group.<xref rid="b57-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Improvements in self-compassion were also observed from preintervention to postintervention in a pilot research trial evaluating an 8-week yoga intervention for individuals with chronic complex disease and disability.<xref rid="b52-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Notably, self-compassion was found to mediate changes in anxiety from preintervention to postintervention, speaking to the mechanisms of yoga practice and philosophy didactics on psychological experience. The authors concluded that self-compassion may enable individuals to contact distressing inner experience without ascribing evaluative or judgmental meaning, to bypass ruminative tendencies, and to select healthful and agential actions to create positive change.<xref rid="b52-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p><p>Corroborating the increases in self-compassion were changes in levels of mindfulness, which is an overlapping third-wave construct. Total levels of mindfulness and the subscales of observing and nonreactivity all increased from preintervention to postintervention when the participants were evaluated as one cohort. These findings parallel results from trials that evaluated mindfulness in the context of a yoga intervention for individuals with chronic pain and limited mobility. Specifically, an 8-week pilot yoga program for individuals with fibromyalgia resulted in improvements in the total scale and in the describing and nonreactivity to inner experience subscales of the FFMQ.<xref rid="b51-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Improvements in two subscales of the FFMQ &#x02013; nonjudging of inner experience and acting with awareness &#x02013; were observed for cancer survivors who participated in a 7-week yoga intervention.<xref rid="b104-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">104</xref> The fact that different subscales demonstrated improvements across the studies may be attributable to the differences in the intervention&#x02019;s philosophical focus, specific attentional or meditative training, variations in the teaching style, or to the specific health populations. In addition, there were also qualitative reports of increased present-mindedness (being in the moment, letting go, new way of being in old experience, increased awareness of body, increased concentration) for individuals with SCI who participated in an 8-week yoga program.<xref rid="b60-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Taken together, these studies indicate that yoga programs that are comprehensive in nature and that include philosophical concepts that bridge the two disciplines (eg, witness consciousness, one pointed concentration, non-judgment, openness) have demonstrated increased levels of mindfulness in individuals with health-related impacts or disability.</p><p>There were no demonstrated improvements in pain intensity, pain interference, or pain catastrophizing. It may be that the questionnaire used to measure pain (BPI) was limited in scope, as it used gross numeric rating scales for worst, least, average, and present pain levels, and did not query for pain quality or type. The use of more specific pain-measurement tools, such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire, may provide more detailed information about the type (eg, neuropathic, musculoskeletal) and quality (eg, affective, cognitive, evaluative) of pain and whether various types of pain respond differently to yoga practice. Similarly, there were no improvements in other psychological constructs, such as psychological flexibility, anxiety, self-efficacy, resilience, or posttraumatic growth. Scores on psychological flexibility, self-efficacy, resilience, and posttraumatic growth were all high at the beginning of the study, which may have served as a ceiling effect, resulting in limited room for improvement. The lack of a signification reduction in anxiety differs from an RCT evaluating yoga for individuals with chronic back pain compared to an exercise control group<xref rid="b105-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">105</xref> and from a previous pilot trial using a similar yoga-program manual.<xref rid="b52-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the components of the yoga program: active arm work and philosophy didactics may have provided an uplifting quality, rather than a calming or anxiolytic quality.</p><p>Given the breadth and variety of yoga interventions that are used in yoga research, it is imperative to document properly the specific components of a yoga program and delineate how interventions are tailored for various populations.<xref rid="b72-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="b106-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">106</xref> The present study used an integrated yoga intervention that incorporated many &#x0201c;limbs&#x0201d; or aspects of yoga, including breathing practices, physical postures, yoga philosophy, mindfulness, and meditation/relaxation techniques. Although such a comprehensive program is not a new format in the yoga literature,<xref rid="b72-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> this combination of limbs has not been applied to an SCI population and was innovative in the consideration and application of yoga philosophical concepts. This intervention was designed in accordance with the teaching philosophy of IY, in terms of progression of instruction with the skill development of the students/participants, in modeling the ethical principles through the style of teaching, the use of therapeutic variations of classical poses, and of the selection of practices that are considered within this yogic lineage both to calm the nervous system (eg, breathing and meditation), to promote vitality, and to lift depressive or &#x0201c;heavy&#x0201d; states of mind.<xref rid="b65-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> The authors have provided a table of philosophical concepts in order to document which yogic theories from traditional texts and the Iyengar lineage were considered appropriate for this population and to assist with replicability.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The present study was limited by its small sample size, which increased the possibility of type 2 errors, and by the exclusive use of self-report measures. The evaluation of multiple measures also introduced the possibility of a type 1 error, and so results should be replicated with a larger-scale RCT. Study methodology using a WLC design is limited by the possibility that participants in the WLC group may change their behavior in the waiting period. The authors instructed the participants to refrain from practicing yoga in that time, to prevent a possible confound. As well, there was the possibility of an expectancy effect for WLC participants, which should be considered when interpreting the results of the combined-group analysis, and in particular the findings that emerged in this analysis only (eg, increases in mindfulness). Although there was one member of the research team present at all assessment points, there were additional research assistants at each time point, which may have introduced variability in the assessment process.</p><p>In addition, there were a higher number of individuals of Caucasian heritage in the WLC group, and this discrepancy should be considered when interpreting the results. Although this pilot RCT tailored the yoga intervention to individuals with SCI who had limited mobility and instability of the musculoskeletal system, it was not specialized to the degree of injury and thus did not differentiate between individuals with varying levels of injury. Future studies should specialize yoga programs to a greater extent, especially for individuals with tetraplegia or complete SCI who may need greater one-on-one care and modification of &#x00101;sanas, due to the unique presentation of each SCI. The use of props was limited to IY blankets for spinal and postural support, and greater precision and effect of &#x00101;sana practice could be attained with the use of other traditional yoga props, such as straps and bolsters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Future research</title><p>The emerging field of yoga research for individuals with severe and impairing disability would benefit from larger trials to explore further the impact of yoga interventions on psychological, pain-related, functional, and mindfulness constructs. Given that levels of mindfulness and self-compassion increased in this study, and have been shown to be mediating variables of improvements in psychological experience in other yoga-research trials, future research should evaluate the mediating role of these constructs for individuals with SCI. It has been proposed that mindfulness may provide therapeutic gains by increasing compassion and psychological flexibility and by decreasing the propensity for rumination,<xref rid="b107-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">107</xref> and so modeling of the relationships of these variables in the context of a yoga intervention is warranted.</p><p>In order to create meaningful yoga interventions for individuals with tetraplegia, it is recommended that larger trials use a multiwave design rather than increased class sizes, so that individualized care is possible. Researchers employing an RCT design may consider stratifying participants by injury level, degree of completeness, or mobility characteristics, which may require multisite involvement, due to recruitment limitations. It may also be beneficial to have a high teacher:student ratio to ensure that participants maximize in obtaining benefits from the degree of movement that is accessible for each student. Previous research has documented that participation in an IY-intervention resulted in reduced pain-medication consumption for individuals with chronic low-back pain,<xref rid="b108-jpr-10-999" ref-type="bibr">108</xref> and so evaluation of the impact of yoga on pain-medication consumption for individuals with SCI may provide important information regarding alternate pain-management strategies. In communities where public and accessible transport is not possible, such as rural and remote settings, the use of electronic resources or videoconferencing for service provision may be useful and increase access for individuals who encounter physical limitations to attending institutionally based yoga interventions. Finally, interventions should be evaluated at follow-up intervals using a longitudinal research design to determine the lasting effect of yoga on psychological experience. It is important to conduct yoga research for this population, as yoga represents a mind&#x02013;body intervention that can simultaneously address physical and mental health impacts and thus improve multiple facets of patient well-being. Yoga is a relatively low-cost therapeutic intervention that once learned, can be practiced safely and independently, thereby empowering patients and partially reducing dependence on care providers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this pilot RCT revealed improvements in depressive symptoms and self-compassion for individuals randomized to IY compared to a WLC group. The results also suggest that a yoga program may result in increases in mindfulness from preintervention to postintervention, with an increased capacity to observe and not react to immediate physical and emotional experience. Yoga is a safe and supportive mind&#x02013;body practice that may simultaneously attenuate some of the negative psychological impacts of SCI, while also bolstering inner resources. Therapies, such as yoga, that incorporate mindfulness concepts, such as acceptance and openness, and that focus on positive and adaptive coping may offer protection from some of the devastating and life-altering consequences of SCI, and should be integrated in tertiary care settings offering rehabilitative services.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would
