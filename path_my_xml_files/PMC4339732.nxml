Exercise improves metabolic [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and cardiovascular health [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but the optimal exercise strategy for preventing T2D and CVD is not firmly established. Many of the benefits of exercise training are attributable to the acute effects of exercise, which can last for &#x0223c;24&#x02013;48 h following each individual training session [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In particular, numerous investigations have shown that acute exercise improves insulin sensitivity for up to 24&#x02013;48 h into recovery as assessed by fasting homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) scores [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], oral glucose tolerance testing [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and/or hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp[<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These findings have led to guidelines that recommend no more than one day off in between exercise sessions in individuals with, or at risk for, T2D [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Exercise also improves vascular health, with studies demonstrating improved endothelial function that can be measured for 2&#x02013;72 h following a single bout of exercise [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Damage to, and dysfunction of, vascular endothelial cells is strongly associated with CVD risk and it is hypothesized that many of the cardiovascular benefits of exercise can be linked to improved endothelial cell function [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Insulin is a potent vasodilator, providing evidence that increased insulin sensitivity and vascular function following exercise may be linked, perhaps through enhanced delivery of glucose to skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, examining how different exercise modalities acutely impact markers of insulin resistance and endothelial cell health may provide insight regarding the exercise option with the most therapeutic potential.</p><p>Although not all studies are in agreement, there is evidence that high-intensity exercise may lead to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity and endothelial function when compared to continuous moderate-intensity exercise [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Improvements in insulin sensitivity following acute high-intensity exercise may be linked to greater muscle fiber recruitment and/or muscle glycogen depletion, which augment skeletal muscle glucose uptake in the hours following exercise [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Vascular adaptations to exercise are mediated, at least in part, by shear stress acting on the endothelial cells that line conduit blood vessels [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In large conduit arteries, shear stress during and following exercise increases in direct proportion to intensity [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting that higher intensity exercise may have greater potential for improving endothelial function [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Cocks and colleagues have also shown that high-intensity training is comparable to traditional endurance-oriented exercise training for inducing microvascular adaptations [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which could further improve insulin and glucose delivery to skeletal muscle to enhance insulin sensitivity.</p><p>High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) has emerged as an exercise modality that is particularly effective at improving cardiometabolic health. A session of HIIE involves repeated bouts of vigorous intensity exercise that can last from a few seconds up to several minutes, separated by periods of rest or recovery. HIIE is potentially attractive as the rest periods can facilitate the completion of vigorous intensity exercise in clinical or unfit populations and overall training programs are time-efficient. As a result, HIIE has garnered attention in the general population and clinical settings as a potent, yet time-efficient, therapeutic exercise option [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Several training studies have compared HIIE to moderate-intensity continuous exercise and have demonstrated the HIIE is equal to, or superior, for improving markers of insulin sensitivity and endothelial function (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). However, comparisons between HIIE and high-intensity continuous exercise (HICE) are sparse. It therefore remains to be determined how high-intensity exercise, when performed in an interval versus continuous fashion, impacts markers of insulin sensitivity and endothelial cell function.</p><p>Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare HIIE to HICE on markers of insulin resistance and endothelial damage. Since several of the benefits of exercise can be attributed to acute effects of the most recent bout of exercise [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we examined fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR as indicators of insulin resistance on the morning following an acute bout of HIIE, acute HICE matched for external work, and a no exercise control condition. To determine how these exercise interventions affected endothelial health we measured circulating endothelial microparticles (EMPs), which are membrane-bound vesicles released from endothelial cells in response to inflammatory activation and/or apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. EMPs are emerging as novel biomarkers of endothelial activation and damage that are increased in overweight/obese individuals at risk for CVD [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], have been shown to directly impair endothelial function [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and are correlated with endothelial dysfunction in obesity [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We hypothesized that both types of exercise would improve insulin sensitivity and reduce EMP levels compared to the no exercise control condition but that responses to acute HIIE would be greater than acute HICE. Because insulin sensitivity and endothelial function may be different in males and females [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] an exploratory aim was to examine potential sex differences in the responses to acute HIIE and HICE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Review Board / Human Research Protection Program.

The protocol ramp rate varied between 15&#x02013;25 watts per minute and was based on a standardized formula [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The test was terminated when the participant could not maintain a pedal cadence of 30 rpm. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and expired gases were monitored using standard procedures. HR was measured using a HR monitor (Polar, Lake Success, NY) and BP was determined by auscultation. RPE was estimated each minute using the Borg CR-10 Scale [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Expired gases were collected through an air cushion mask and analyzed continuously using a metabolic cart (Vacumetrics, Ventura, CA).

Criteria for verifying maximal exertion were as follows: a peak HR of at least 90% of age-predicted maximal HR, a peak RPE of at least 9, and a peak respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of at least 1.15. VT was identified by visual inspection based on the ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Familiarization Session</title><p>On a separate visit participants were familiarized to the laboratory procedures and experimental sessions. This allowed for confirmation and experience of the exercise intensities for the experimental trials, which were based on maximal testing data.

Participants were given instructions to strictly follow the same diet for 24 h prior to each experimental trial, which was confirmed upon arrival to the laboratory. The participants completed three experimental trials in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion separated by at least 48 h. One trial served as a no exercise control (Control) and there were two high-intensity exercise trials that were matched for external work were performed. HICE involved 20 minutes of cycling at a power output corresponding to 10% of the difference between power at VT and peak power output (i.e., 10% delta, [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). HIIE involved 12 X 1-min at a power output of 60% of the difference between VT and peak power output (i.e., 60% delta, [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) interspersed with 1-min recovery periods at 10&#x02013;20% of maximal capacity, based on calculations designed to ensure total work was equal for all trials. The HIIE protocol was based on previous research showing cardiometabolic benefits in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] whereas the HICE protocol was chosen to ensure that it was vigorous exercise above the VT but tolerable and matched for work with HIIE. HR was monitored continuously throughout exercise to measure exercise intensity. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE; Borg category-ratio [CR]-10 scale; REF) were assessed during every other interval and rest period in HIIE and at six corresponding timepoints during HICE. Average RPE for the entire exercise session was calculated. Both exercise trials included a two-minute warm-up and cool-down at &#x0223c;20% maximal capacity. After completing the trial the participants left the laboratory with their food records and were instructed to follow the exact same diet for the rest of day. Participants then reported to the laboratory the following morning after &#x0003e;10 h fast for collection of a blood sample by venipuncture.

The top two thirds of plasma were then further centrifuged at 1500g for another 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma. The top 100ul of platelet poor plasma was then incubated with fluorochrome labeled antibodies specific for CD62E (CD62E-phycoerythrin, BD Biosciences Cat.

Samples were then fixed with 93ul of 2% paraformaldehyde and diluted up to 500ul with sterile, 0.2um filtered, PBS and analyzed on a Miltenyi Biotec MACSQuant Analzyer. A microparticle size gate was determined using 900nm NIST Traceable polystyrene beads (Cat. No. 64019, Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Unstained and fluorescence minus one controls were used to differentiate between true events and background/debris.

<bold>Plasma glucose and insulin.</bold> Plasma glucose was measured by the hexokinase method on a clinical chemistry analyzer (Chemwell 2910, Awareness Technologies). Plasma insulin was measured by ELISA following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Mercodia Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA) with absorbance read on a microplate reader (iMark, Bio-Rad). All samples were run in duplicate. The coefficient of variation for duplicate samples was 2.8% for glucose and 6.8% for insulin.

A two factor (sex X condition) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor was used to analyze EMPs, HOMA-IR, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin. Significant main effects and interactions were followed up with Fisher LSD post-hoc tests. Cohen&#x02019;s d was used to calculated effect sizes on pairwise comparisons. Potential relationships between EMPs in the Control condition and the change in EMPs (difference between Control and HIIE and Control and HICE) were assessed using Pearson correlations. Significance was set at P &#x02264; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec015"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Exercise trials</title><p>All participants were able to complete the full HICE and HIIE bouts.

In males, EMPs were reduced on the morning following a single bout of HIIE and HICE but HOMA-IR was paradoxically increased after HIIE. In contrast, EMPs were either unchanged (CD31+/CD42b-) or increased (CD62E+, for HICE only) in females whereas HOMA-IR was reduced on the morning following an acute bout of HIIE. These results, albeit in a small sample of overweight/obese young adults, indicate sex differences may exist when examining acute metabolic and vascular responses to high-intensity exercise. Our novel findings that high-intensity exercise can impact EMPs assessed the next morning also highlight the need to take into account recent exercise when assessing this proposed biomarker of endothelial cell health.</p><p>EMPs are membrane-bound vesicles released from endothelial cells in response to specific triggers. Based on findings in cell culture, CD62E+ EMPs have been shown to reflect endothelial activation or inflammation whereas CD31+/CD42b- EMPs are released upon endothelial cell apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Circulating EMPs are increased in overweight/obese individuals with metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and in various cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Due to the benefits of exercise on endothelial function and recent evidence that traditional moderate-intensity endurance training can reduce EMP levels [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we hypothesized that acute high-intensity exercise would lead to reduced EMPs in overweight/obese participants. Our results revealed a clear sex difference in EMP responses to exercise and this hypothesis was only supported for males.</p><p>Previous studies examining the impact of acute exercise on EMPs are limited and we are unaware of any studies in overweight or obese participants. Sossdorf and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported a small increase in circulating EMPs in trained male subjects assessed 45 minutes after an acute bout of moderate-intensity cycling but levels returned to normal at two hours of recovery. In contrast, Chaar et al [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] found no effect of high-intensity exercise (three consecutive maximal exercise tests) on EMPs assessed up to 2 hr into recovery, although the authors reported undetectable EMP levels in their healthy subjects at all timepoints. Moreover, using a similar prior exercise model as employed in the current study Jenkins et al. [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] reported that both CD62E+ and CD31+/CD42b- EMP concentrations were significantly reduced &#x0223c;14&#x02013;16 h after an acute bout of endurance exercise (45 min at &#x0223c;70% VO<sub>2</sub> peak) when compared to a non-exercise control day in healthy young men. Only one study to our knowledge has examined EMP responses to HIIE. Guiraud et al. [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] measured EMPs after an acute bout of HIIE (40 X 15-sec at 100% Wpeak) and moderate-intensity continuous exercise (&#x0223c;60% VO<sub>2</sub> peak) in fit cardiac rehabilitation patients and reported no significant changes at 24 and 72 hours of recovery. However, the participants in this study were tested after completing several weeks of exercise training (including HIIE) and our participants were inactive prior to the experimental exercise trials. It is possible that exercise training, which is well known to improve endothelial function [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and recently reported to reduce EMPs [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], may have reduced baseline EMPs in the fit cardiac rehabilitation patients studied by Guiraud and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] such that acute exercise had limited effects. Future studies are needed to examine acute and chronic EMP responses to high-intensity exercise in individuals at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. EMPs have been correlated with measures of flow-mediated dilation [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and it will also be important to determine if EMP changes in response to exercise track measures of endothelial function.</p><p>The significant negative correlations between EMPs measured in the Control condition and the change in EMPs in response to HIIE and HICE for males were interesting. The data suggest that males with the highest baseline EMPs experience the largest reduction following high-intensity exercise. In females, there were no significant correlations found and if anything there was a tendency for a positive relationship between CD62E+ EMPs measured in the Control condition and the increase following HIIE. Although correlational analyses in small sample sizes are not without limitations, we feel these responses in our study further highlight sex differences in the EMP responses to acute high-intensity exercise.</p><p>To our knowledge, only one previous study has examined sex differences in EMPs. Toth and colleageus [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported increased EMPs in healthy young women compared to men, which is in contrast to our findings in young overweight/obese participants. It is possible that sex differences in EMPs manifest differently depending on body fatness or that obesity has greater effect on EMPs in males. It is generally accepted that pre-menopausal women are at a lower risk from cardiovascular disease when compared to men [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which is attributed in part to a protective effect of estrogen. In as much that EMPs serve as a biomarker for endothelial cell health and cardiovascular risk [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], reduced EMPs in overweight/obese females in the present study supports a potential protective effect of estrogen on endothelial activation and/or damage.</p><p>The potential for exercise to improve insulin sensitivity is well established. Many studies have shown that a single bout of exercise can improve insulin sensitivity for up to 24 h following [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A series of studies form Magkos [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has shown that HOMA assessed from fasting blood can detect next day improvements in insulin resistance. It has been shown that exercise energy expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and possibly total duration of the exercise bout [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], are significant predictors of the improvements in insulin sensitivity following exercise. The majority of comparative studies have examined low/moderate-intensity versus high-intensity exercise preformed in a continuous fashion. Given the recent interest in HIIE for improving cardiometabolic health [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] we aimed to determine if the pattern of high-intensity exercise, performed as either HIIE or HICE, when matched for external work, impacted insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR on the morning following an acute bout. In females, HIIE reduced HOMA-IR when compared to both HICE and Control, indicating that a single session of HIIE may improve insulin sensitivity. The improvement in HOMA-IR following HIIE was driven by a reduction in fasting insulin as there were no changes in fasting glucose (<xref rid="pone.0115860.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, we recently reported that a single session of HIIE improved postprandial hyperglycemic responses to breakfast measured on the day following exercise in a sample of overweight/obese participants that were primarily female (8 females, 2 males) [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggest that one session of HIIE can improve metabolic control on the day following exercise in overweight/obese females. In contrast to our hypotheses, neither HIIE nor HICE improved HOMA-IR in males. In fact, there was a significant increase in HOMA-IR on the morning following HIIE in males, which could be attributed to an increase in fasting plasma insulin. Whether this increase in HOMA-IR is reflective of a potential &#x0201c;negative&#x0201d; response to HIIE in overweight/obese males will require further investigation.</p><p>EMPs are generally considered to reflect vascular damage [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and studies in mice have demonstrated that EMPs can directly impair endothelial function [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The contrasting findings with respect to markers of endothelial damage and insulin sensitivity in the present study (i.e., EMPs decreased while HOMA-IR increased in males, EMPs increase while HOMA-IR decreased in females) may reflect differences in the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of high-intensity exercise that are modulated by sex. However, some evidence now indicates that an increase in EMPs in response to cardiovascular stress may be a beneficial response [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and that microparticles may be involved in angiogenesis or vascular remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Taken in this context, the increase EMPs and reduced HOMA-IR in females could be interpreted to reflect an adaptive response linked to the well-known cardiometabolic benefits of exercise.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study was that we were unable to procure blood samples prior to or at multiple time points after exercise and therefore could not determine the time course of EMP changes in response to acute exercise. However, the changes detected on the morning following exercise were quite robust and remarkably consistent across individual subjects (see Figs. <xref rid="pone.0115860.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0115860.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> for individual values). The sample size in the present study was small, but analyses of the effect sizes for the differences between Control and both HICE and HIIE were all large (Cohen&#x02019;s d = 0.84&#x02013;3.7 for all pairwise comparisons that reached statistical significance for EMPs and HOMA-IR). Nonetheless, it will be important to conduct studies with larger sample sizes to further examine potential sex differences in the responses to high intensity exercise in overweight/obese males and females. It would also be of interest to examine integration between dynamic measures of insulin sensitivity, postprandial hyperglycemia, and EMPs on the morning following exercise but our measurements were limited to fasting samples only. In addition, our analyses were restricted to CD62E+ (inflammatory) and CD31+/CD42b- (apoptotic) microparticles. This was based on previous work in healthy humans that showed that these specific EMPs respond rapidly to acute alterations in blood flow [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, EMPs can also express various other cell surface markers that may provide further insight into what triggered their release [<xref rid="pone.0115860.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Addition of a measure of endothelial function (e.g., flow-mediated dilation) to see if changes in EMPs track functional markers of endothelial health would also have strengthened this study. We also did not strictly control for menstrual cycle within our female participants. This is a clear limitation but because the exercise trials were performed in a randomized and counterbalanced fashion 2&#x02013;7 days apart, it seems highly unlikely that any systematic effects of menstrual cycle could have contributed to the differences reported in females in the present design.</p><p>In conclusion, this investigation demonstrates that overweight/obese males and females appear to respond differently to acute bouts of high-intensity exercise. A single session of HICE and HIIE reduced circulating EMPs measured on the morning following exercise in males but in females CD62E+ EMPs were increased following HICE. Next day insulin resistance paradoxically increased in males but was reduced in females following HIIE. Future research is needed to investigate mechanisms responsible for differential responses between males and females and to determine if sex differences exist in the optimal exercise strategy for improving cardiometabolic health.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0115860.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
