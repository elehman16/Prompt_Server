This approach should, if pharmacogenomic studies are properly applied, minimise the side effects of treatment while optimising treatment effects. Adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used to treat node-positive breast cancer, but a great inter- and intra-patient variability regarding side effects has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Most studies of cancer patients&#x02019; experience of side effects have reported side effects according to single symptoms. Patients treated for cancer do often, however, experience multiple concurrent symptoms that interact with each other and affect patient outcomes differently than the single symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The relevant literature reveals that most of the research on symptoms has been focused either on a single symptom, such as for example fatigue, or on their associated symptoms, such as anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A symptom cluster is a condition where two or more symptoms that are related to each other occur simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The research on groups or clusters of symptoms in cancer care has increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] one approach to clustering looks at the grouping of symptoms to identify symptoms which may occur together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Symptoms within a cluster can have similar aetiology or a biological basis, and the treatment of one symptom in the clustering may have a positive influence on the occurrence of the other symptoms within the cluster as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Among women prior to surgery for breast cancer, fatigue, pain and sleep disturbance has been showed to form one cluster, and fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance and mild depression formed another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In women with breast cancer during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, the most distressing and burdensome clusters were made up of emotional, gastrointestinal and un-wellness symptoms (e.g., changes in skin, itching) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Another study shows that a symptom cluster consisting of fatigue, depression and perceived cognitive impairment was found before, during and after completion of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; the studies also found low levels of quality of life in those patients with high symptom prevalence.</p><p>As symptom burden and distress is considered to be an important aspect of the symptom experience, symptom clusters should be considered when individualising breast cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Clusters may change with time as individuals undergo anti-tumour therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is, however, a paucity of prospective studies on symptom clusters in tailored chemotherapy for breast cancer. Thus, it is important to study possible symptom clusters during chemotherapy treatment, in order to better understand the full experience of side-effects at different points in time. Knowledge about symptom clustering can help healthcare professionals to be aware that other symptoms often occur alongside an already identified symptom. The aim of the present study was to describe symptom clusters at four points in time during chemotherapy treatment in patients with stage I&#x02013;IIIa breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Newly diagnosed patients with histologically-confirmed stage I to IIIa breast cancer, participating in a randomised trial, the &#x0201c;Tailor Dose Trial&#x0201d; were included. The trial aimed to evaluate the usefulness of haemoglobin adduct to better tailor given doses of cyclophosphamide. The women were randomised to be treated with FEC (5-fluorouracil epirubicin cyclophosphamide) 75 (F600E75C600) at 3-week intervals &#x000d7; six, or to FEC 100 (F500E100C500) at 3-week intervals &#x000d7; three, followed by docetaxel &#x000d7; three times. Included patients should be able to give informed consent, read and speak Swedish, and to understand the purpose of the study. The exclusion criteria were known history of psychiatric disorder, non-Swedish-speaking, or a history of other cancer diagnoses within the previous 5&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure</title><p>Data were collected by a study nurse at two clinics at the Department of Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm. The women were consecutively approached after surgery, before being randomised in the Tailored Dose Trial, the symptom study commenced after 20 patients had been included in the Tailored Dose Trial.

</p><p>Consenting women were asked to complete the baseline questionnaires after written informed consent and thereafter at three points of assessment: day 12 after the first and third cycle of FEC75 or FEC 100, and day 12 after the last cycle of docetaxel, corresponding to 1, 3 and 6&#x000a0;months after inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The instrument</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Memorial symptom assessment scale</title><p>The MSAS scale was used to assess symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It includes 32 common cancer-related symptoms, assessed from the patient&#x02019;s experiences during the past week. Twenty-four of the symptoms are evaluated with respect to frequency, severity, and distress. Eight symptoms are evaluated in terms of severity and distress. Each symptom is recorded as being either present or absent, and, if present, rated using a four-point scale (1&#x02013;4) for frequency and severity, and a five-point scale (0&#x02013;4) for distress during the previous 7&#x000a0;days. Higher scores indicate greater frequency, more severity, and higher distress. If a symptom is present, the symptom score is an average of the total of all scores within the rating scales. The scoring of the MSAS yields two subscale scores, including a physical symptom subscale score (PHYS-MSAS) and a psychological symptom subscale score (PSYCH-MSAS). A global distress index (GDI-MSAS) is also incorporated. The PHYS-MSAS includes 12 symptoms: lack of appetite, lack of energy, pain, feeling drowsy, constipation, dry mouth, nausea/vomiting, change in food taste, weight loss, feeling bloated, and dizziness. The PSYCH-MSAS includes six symptoms: worrying, feeling sad, feeling nervous, difficulty sleeping, feeling irritable, and difficulty concentrating. The GDI-MSAS includes four psychological symptoms (feeling sad, worrying, feeling irritable, and feeling nervous) and the distress associated with six physical symptoms (lack of appetite, lack of energy, pain, feeling drowsy, constipation, and dry mouth).</p><p>MSAS was regarded as the most encompassing subjective general symptom assessment instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It has been used in clinical trials to assess the symptoms. The Swedish translation has shown sufficient validity and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarise socio-demographic and treatment data. The symptom score ranged between 0 and 4. The symptom score (symptom burden) was calculated as the average of the scores for the three dimensions (frequency, severity and distress), according to the MSAS manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and was used to identify the appropriate cut-off level for inclusion. If data were missing for one of the three dimensions, the average was calculated based on the remaining two dimensions. If data were missing for two or three dimensions, the symptom burden was not calculated, and thus considered as missing. MSAS data were reported and analysed from 102 women. A cut-off point of 0.5 was chosen, based on results from a previous study, where associations were found between the presence of symptom clusters among patients and survival duration, independent of other prognostic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This eliminated nine symptoms from further analysis; itching, weight loss, skin changes, swelling, swallowing difficulties, cough, numbness, urination problems and vomiting, because not reaching the cut-off point 0.5. The low &#x0201c;mean score&#x0201d; was based on low occurrence in combination with low levels of distress and severity. The symptom burden cluster analysis was conducted by means of factor analysis, including symptoms with high burden (symptom score above 0.5).</p><p>The factor analysis, employing principal component analysis as the extraction method and the varimax rotation method with Kaiser normalisation was conducted with the total symptom burden of the 23 remaining symptoms with a score above 0.5. The principal component analysis identified symptoms, those scoring highest burden, and the highest factor loading score that predicted the assignment to a &#x0201c;component&#x0201d; (cluster). The results were considered significant at the 5% level (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).

Interestingly, these symptoms seem to cluster together in several cancer populations, both in the early and advanced setting and are as such of importance to target in clinical practice. Sadness and worry during cancer treatment together with physical changes, including hair loss after chemotherapy, are thought to cause shock and depression. Our study results are supported by the findings of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] showing that alopecia is connected to negative moods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>At cycle 1</title><p>Hair loss was the most predominant symptom in the Physical cluster at the first cycle and perceived as quite distressing. Alopecia has consistently been ranked in the literature as one of the most distressing symptoms of chemotherapy with evidence that some women refuse chemotherapy because of the risk of losing their hair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This can give health care professionals direction of the importance of preparing patients for the physical impact of treatment, as well as follow-up assessment of the impact and coping ability of the individual patient as the hair loss occurs after the first cycle of treatment.</p><p>Similar to this study, Gastro clusters have previously been identified and commonly includes the items of nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and lack of appetite or taste changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the present study, vomiting was not present, which may be a result of the development and implementation of effective anti-emetic treatment. The connection between lack of appetite and energy, and dry mouth has also been observed in clustering previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] it was hypothesised that the connection between fatigue and dry mouth may indicate that fatigue is mediated by a dysfunction of the parasympathetic nervous system like for dry mouth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>At cycle 3</title><p>At the third treatment cycle there was an evident change in the connections between symptoms, lack of appetite was now more influenced by psychological issues such as worry and feeling sad. The gastrointestinal-fatigue and pain symptom clusters have been shown to affect functional status and overall aspects of quality of life in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>At cycle 6</title><p>It is also important to identify unstable patterns in order to understand the dynamic nature of symptoms over time. Problems with sexual interest or activity and pain moved from the Physical cluster to the Emotional cluster as treatment progressed, indicating a closer connection with psychological symptoms. Problems with sexual interest had a lower prevalence than pain but higher distress values. One explanation for the higher distress value in connection to lack of sexual interest might be that the women worry that the lack of sexual interest will remain after treatment is completed. Sexual dysfunction of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy has been shown to increase over time and even after treatment completion with the change of body image, and it may also be due to the systemic effects of chemotherapy or of abrupt, premature ovarian failure in younger women have probably a greater negative impact on sexuality than the effects of the local treatment for BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Despite the differences in dosage of chemotherapy in FEC 75 versus FEC 100, we were not able to find any significant differences in symptom cluster burden between the two groups, which is not very surprising as the level of toxicity between the two treatments are quite similar (data not shown).</p><p>The present study confirms the existing knowledge on the clustering of symptoms. The identification of connections between symptoms over time may assist health care professionals in identifying symptoms and to set priorities in symptom management especially if time is restricted in the clinical setting. When identifying symptoms patients need to be assessed for related symptoms since these are likely to be present. In order to improve symptom management knowledge about how the treatment of one symptom positively may impact other symptoms is necessary for health care professionals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Symptom clusters may vary according to the assessment of symptoms, the prevalence of symptoms within the sample, sample size, and sample composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The interpretation of results should be made cautiously because statistically derived clusters may be affected by several methodological considerations and clinical relevance can be difficult to determine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In order to convincingly demonstrate the presence of a symptom burden cluster, the symptom cluster was considered present if patients reported at least 50% of symptoms within the symptom cluster. The symptom assessments were timed to match important landmarks of the treatment process. The choice was also made to use the MSAS scale for assessment of symptoms in order to capture prevalence, severity and distress. Interestingly, our data concur with previous studies in cancer populations in that the most distressing symptoms were not the most prevalent ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This finding indicates that core symptoms within clusters should be identified because those seem to contribute most to the total symptom burden and causes of distress for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, by predefining score levels for symptoms for inclusion in analysis we have prospectively established that symptom clusters remain stable over time with defined core symptoms. This knowledge will aid in the development of effective interventions to minimise symptom burden for patients treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer. Future studies need to closely examine the relationships between multiple symptoms, specific interventions, and patient outcomes. Further research into symptoms and refinement of the definition of symptom clusters in the oncology population will aid in determining diagnostic criteria and the assessment, management, and prioritisation of care.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge all the women taking part in this study, and thank Aileen Ireland for English language
