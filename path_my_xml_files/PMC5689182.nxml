Clinical practice guidelines recommend individualized pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) as a first-line treatment for stress or mixed UI in women, although lack of human and financial resources limits delivery of this first-line treatment. Preliminary data suggest that group-based treatments may provide the answer. To date, no adequately powered trials have evaluated the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of group compared to individual PFMT for UI in older women. Given demographic projections, high prevalence of UI in older women, costly barriers, and group PFMT promising results, there is a clear need to rigorously compare the short- and long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group vs individual PFMT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">The study is designed as a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial, conducted in two facilities (Montreal and Sherbrooke) in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Randomly assigned participants will follow a 12-week PFMT, either in one-on-one sessions or as part of a group, under the supervision of a physiotherapist. Blinded assessments at baseline, immediately post intervention, and at one year will include the seven-day bladder diary, the 24-h pad test, symptoms and quality of life questionnaires, adherence and self-efficacy questionnaire, pelvic floor muscle function, and cost assessments. Primary analysis will test our main hypothesis that group-based treatment is not inferior to individualized treatment with respect to the primary outcome: relative (%) reduction in the number of leakages.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Should this study find that a group-based approach is not less effective than individual PFMT, and more cost-effective, this trial will impact positively continence-care accessibility and warrant a change in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02039830?term=NCT02039830&#x00026;recrs=ab&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02039830</ext-link>.

Additionally, group intervention is already acknowledged, within the field of health promotion, as a powerful tool for promoting behavior modification: group sessions provide greater motivation (by reducing an individual&#x02019;s sense of isolation) and a forum for providing information (particularly for those too timid to ask questions) and foster peer support and discussions: e.g. Weight Watchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Potential candidates are informed of the study&#x02019;s objectives and procedures. If interested, they are screened for eligibility using a standardized telephone questionnaire developed and used in our previous studies. The UI type is determined by the QUID over the telephone; it is a six-item self-administered questionnaire developed to identify and differentiate UI types in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This instrument has shown good internal consistency and test&#x02013;retest reliability, good content and criterion validity, and good specificity/sensitivity in women with UI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Further, QUID is highly recommended for UI type classification by the International Consultation on Incontinence (Grade A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. When women present with stress or mixed UI, the consent form (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) is mailed out to the participant with the seven-day bladder diary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]; the diary is completed and brought to the evaluator at the onsite eligibility evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Onsite eligibility evaluation (1 h)</title><p id="Par36">Women are scheduled for onsite evaluations with a physiotherapist if they report at least three UI episodes on the seven-day bladder diary. After signing the consent form, the Mini-Mental State Examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] questionnaire is completed (excludes women with cognitive impairment) and a vaginal exam is conducted to identify any perineal pain or prolapse likely to interfere with either the evaluation or the intervention. Those not eligible for the present study are referred back to their healthcare provider. Eligible participants complete the evaluation and are randomized to either individualized or group PFMT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par37">The women in both groups receive the same 12-week PFMT, either in one-on-one sessions or as part of a group, under the direction of an experienced physiotherapist trained in pelvic floor rehabilitation. The choice of a 12-week PFMT approach is based on muscle physiology theory: strength-training programs show positive effect after 8&#x02013;12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In post-menopausal women, Gunnarsson et al. reported a significant improvement in strength and reduction in UI episodes after 12 weeks of training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Both the one-on-one and group-based PFMT sessions are conducted once a week; participants are deemed to have successfully completed the program if they attended ten or more of the 12 sessions. Although there is no known side effect/complication related to PFMT other than possible discomfort following the intervention, any adverse event is monitored.

The educational period covers the various functions of the PFMs, including pre-contraction and normal bladder control, and voiding parameters: fluids and fluid intake; toilet positions; and voiding dynamics. The exercise component includes PFM strength, endurance, and coordination exercises. Between PFM exercises, lower extremity strength, balance and functional exercises (dance) are performed. This approach is in line with our previous research findings, which indicate that mixed and stress UI older women have reduced PFM and lower-extremity strength and balance as compared to continent women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

In the specific context of a non-inferiority trial, &#x003b1; is the selected risk of a false acceptance of the non-inferiority hypothesis (based on a one-tailed CI-based test, equivalent to an independent-group t-test); i.e. of a false conclusion that a truly inferior intervention is equally efficacious as the &#x0201c;standard treatment&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">To err on the conservative side, we relied on the &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; 95% CI, which corresponds to a stringent one-tailed type I error rate of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025 (2&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x02013;0.95&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05).

Because all primary and secondary outcomes are measured on continuous scales, the methods outlined below for the analyses of the primary outcome will also apply to all secondary outcomes. However, the analysis of secondary outcomes will be exploratory in nature and some (e.g. for PFM function) may have more limited statistical power.</p><p id="Par75">Preliminary descriptive analyses will compare the individuals in the two trial arms using means, medians, standard deviations, and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical and binary variables. Any variable for which the difference between the two arms is considered clinically relevant will be adjusted for in the multivariable regression analyses (see below). The distribution of the outcome scores will be assessed for normality of residuals, using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test. In the case of significant violation of normality, appropriate parametric (e.g. logarithmic or Box-Cox) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] or non-parametric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] transformation will be applied, to meet the normality assumption underlying the univariate t-tests, as well as multivariable linear regression (see below).</p><p id="Par76">Analyses for the primary outcome at one year (and secondary outcomes): The primary analysis will test our main hypothesis that group-based classes are not inferior to individualized treatment with respect to the primary outcome of relative (%) reduction in the number of leakages at one year post randomization. (For all outcomes, the analyses outlined below will be repeated using data on post-intervention assessment.) As recommended for non-inferiority trials, the hypothesis of non-inferiority will be accepted if, and only if, the upper bound of the two-tailed (1-2&#x003b1;) 95% CI (corresponding to a conservative Type I error of 0.025 for the one-tailed independent-group t-test) for the mean difference (in % reduction) excludes the non-inferiority threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], set at 10% difference. This basic analysis will be extended to multivariable analyses. Specifically, two multivariable linear models, of increasing complexity, will be used to adjust the estimated difference between the % reduction at one year in the two groups for, respectively, (1) only the two stratification variables (center and type of UI), as well as the baseline number of UI episodes (to account for regression to the mean phenomenon); and (2) (if necessary) in addition to variables in model (1): any variable, for which a clinically important imbalance between the two arms is revealed by descriptive analyses (see above). In both models, the two-way interactions between the trial arm and (a) center and (b) UI type, will be tested using 1-df model-based F-tests to verify if the difference between the effects of the two interventions depend on either of those stratification variables. In the case of a statistically significant interaction (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for the F-test), the intervention effects will be estimated and tested separately in the respective subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The results of multivariable linear regression analyses will be summarized in terms of adjusted mean difference between the outcomes in the two trial arms, together with the 95% model-based CIs. In sensitivity analyses for primary and secondary outcomes at one year, ITT analyses will be conducted, using the same statistical methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Economic analysis</title><p id="Par77">Mean, median, and interquartile (semi-IQ) will be used to describe the costs for the two groups. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed on the main outcome: reduction in number of leakages (%) one year after randomization and expressed as a ratio of incremental costs and percentage of leakages. In order to verify the robustness of the economic analysis, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted on the hypothesis that the costs for each participant should be between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the cost distribution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Multivariable models to predict response to treatment</title><p id="Par78">In additional analyses, multivariable logistic regression will be employed to assess patient characteristics associated with an increased likelihood of response to treatment, defined as at least 50% reduction in the number of UI episodes at one year. The logistic model will include, as independent variables, (a) the binary indicator of the trial arm, (b) the pre-intervention number of UI episodes, and (c) all previously listed covariates: age, BMI, general health status, level of physical activity, medical history and medications, parity and obstetrical history as well as type and duration of UI and current pad use. Independent, statistically significant predictors of response will be identified by <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for the respective multivariable model-based two-tailed 1-df Wald test and their effects will be summarized by adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par79">Considering demographic projections, human resources, and health system constraints, there is a pressing need to scale up evidence on the long-term benefits of low-cost interventions in urinary incontinent aging women and thereby improve clinical, functional, and social outcomes of this highly prevalent condition in this subpopulation. This GROUP trial, the first adequately powered RCT, seeks to study the non-inferiority of group PFMT in comparison to individual one-on-one PFMT in aging women with UI. If group-based PFMT classes prove to be equally effective, as well as more cost-effective, compared to individual one-on-one PFMT sessions, this trial could have a positive impact on the accessibility of continence care for aging women in Canada.</p><p id="Par80">The results of this RCT will be relevant to clinicians and clinical decision-makers as well as to administrative stakeholders. It will have implications for the organization and the administration of continence care services. Ultimately, the results may influence the cost of treatment per individual, the accessibility of conservative management, and the use of more invasive UI interventions such as medication and surgery in older UI women.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Dissemination of study finding</title><p id="Par81">The results of this study will be disseminated through national and international scientific and professional conferences, in addition to undergraduate and postgraduate courses in PFM rehabilitation for physiotherapists.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par82">This trial is actively recruiting participants (353/364).
