This recommendation is set to investigate possible drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval and to prevent associated potentially fatal pro-arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes. This growing concern for cardiac safety is because some drugs, which were not originally developed to treat cardiovascular diseases, were found to cause arrhythmias and were withdrawn from the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since its publication in 2005, ICH guideline E14 has gained a substantial amount of interest, and the guideline&#x02019;s proposal to examine TQT is currently followed worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although ICH guideline E14 does not specify the use of moxifloxacin as a positive control, it has been the most widely and most commonly used positive control in TQT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The effects of moxifloxacin on QT interval have been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and compared with ibutilide, an intravenous formulation that is the only other positive control that has been used in published TQT studies, moxifloxacin is orally administered and is therefore a better choice for use in blinded studies. When ICH guideline E14 was introduced in 2005, the initial assumption was that ethnicity would not significantly affect the results of TQT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since then, clinical data challenging this assumption have been accumulating. Unfortunately, two limitations have arisen to date: limited data evaluating inter-ethnic differences in baseline, drug-free QT intervals exist and evidence from TQT studies has been collected mostly from Caucasian subjects or subjects that do not adequately represent ethnic differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>A known debate concerning which QT interval correction method should be used in TQT studies also exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. QT intervals are influenced by the individual&#x02019;s heart rate and should be corrected (heart rate-corrected QT; QTc) for investigational purposes. Formulae that reflect individual heart rate include Bazett&#x02019;s formula, Fridericia&#x02019;s formula, and a correction using the individual QT/RR regression model. There was previously no consensus regarding which method to use in TQT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but as the data accumulated, it is now encouraged that newer correction formulae such as individual correction should be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, TQT studies may use either the time-matched baseline method or the pre-dose baseline method. ICH guideline E14 recommends the use of the time-matched method for parallel studies and the use of the pre-dose method for crossover studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; however, few studies have addressed the differences between the two baseline measurement methods. Comparing the two methods may provide some insight into whether using different baseline measurement methods significantly affects the results of TQT studies.</p><p>At present, no comparable published data collected from Korean subjects exist that can be used to evaluate an investigational product&#x02019;s effects on QT interval during the drug development phase. Furthermore, the effects of moxifloxacin 400 or 800&#x000a0;mg (supratherapeutic dose) on QT prolongation have not been fully assessed in healthy Korean subjects, nor has the known diurnal variation been evaluated in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hence, an investigation is required to evaluate whether the usual positive control dose for TQT studies, moxifloxacin 400&#x000a0;mg, is adequate for Korean subjects and to determine whether moxifloxacin can be used as a positive control in Koreans, as outlined by ICH guideline E14. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to evaluate QTc prolongation in healthy Korean male subjects (both at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of moxifloxacin), to assess the use of moxifloxacin as an adequate positive control, to compare QT interval correction methods, and to compare baseline measurement methods in Korean subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy Korean male subjects, aged 20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years with body weight over 50&#x000a0;kg and within &#x000b1;20&#x000a0;% of ideal body weight (calculated as: (height in cm&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;100)&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.9), were recruited to participate in this study and written informed consent was obtained prior to participation. Eligibility was assessed based on medical history, physical examination, and laboratory test results (hematology, routine clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and serology, including hepatitis B and C, and HIV) at screening. Twelve-lead electrocardiography (ECG) was taken at screening and subjects with ECG findings, such as QTc interval using Fridericia&#x02019;s formula (QTcF) over 450&#x000a0;ms, PR interval above 200&#x000a0;ms or below 110&#x000a0;ms, intraventricular conduction delay with QRS over 120&#x000a0;ms, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, pathologic Q waves (defined as Q-wave over 40&#x000a0;ms or depth over 0.5&#x000a0;mV), ventricular preexcitation, and left or right bundle branch block, were excluded from the study. Subjects with the following criteria were also excluded: family history of long QT syndrome, any torsades de pointes risk factors, such as sudden death, cardiac failure, hypokalemia, and arrhythmia, and history of hypersensitivity to drugs, including quinolone antibiotics. Enrolled subjects were asked not to drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages and not to smoke from 24&#x000a0;h prior to hospitalization until the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was designed as a multi-center, randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover trial.

ECGs were recorded once for every time point. On day 2, subjects received one of the three treatments in each period according to their sequence group: placebo (water), moxifloxacin 400&#x000a0;mg (Avelox Tablets, Bayer Korea Ltd., Seoul, Korea), or moxifloxacin 800&#x000a0;mg. ECGs were then recorded at the corresponding time points in the same manner as on the baseline day. Blood sampling for the pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses was conducted at the same time points as the ECG recordings for subjects who took moxifloxacin. When the procedures were to be processed at the same time, the ECG was taken first, after which point, the vital signs were measured and the PK sampling was conducted to minimize the influence of the other procedures on the ECG results. The plasma was immediately separated by centrifugation at 2,093&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 10&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and was stored at &#x02212;70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until further analysis. A washout period of 7&#x000a0;days was selected on the basis of the terminal half-life and the effects of moxifloxacin on the QT interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To minimize variability among the three study centers, each center used the same bottled water (Volvic, Group Danone S.A., Paris, France) for drug administration and the same meal plans. To minimize variability between the ECG recording periods, the exact placement of landmarks (e.g., clavicle, nipples, and sternal notch) and precordial electrodes were marked on a transparent plastic film for each subject during Period I, and this film was used throughout the study for each individual subject. The exact places of precordial electrodes did not change over the whole course of the study.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at Seoul St. Mary&#x02019;s Hospital, Seoul National University Hospital, and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Each center was limited to the investigation of 12 subjects. All of the procedures were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki regarding biomedical research involving human subjects and the Korean Good Clinical Practice guidelines. This study was registered in the public registry at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01756521).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pharmacodynamic Analyses</title><p>QT intervals were measured automatically using the MUSE CV information system (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and the representative median value from 12 leads was taken. For all other values, including heart rate, PR interval, RR interval, and QRS interval, automatically calculated values from the MAC5000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or MAC5500<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were used. The baseline-corrected difference in QTc (&#x00394;QTc) and the placebo-adjusted difference in &#x00394;QTc (&#x00394;&#x00394;QTc) were calculated using either Bazett&#x02019;s formula (QTcB&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT/RR<sup>1/2</sup>), Fridericia&#x02019;s formula (QTcF&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT/RR<sup>1/3</sup>), or an individual QT/RR linear regression model (QTcI). This was performed by first correcting the QT interval, then calculating &#x00394;QTc and &#x00394;&#x00394;QTc as follows: &#x00394;QTc&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT (Day 2)&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;QT (baseline) and &#x00394;&#x00394;QTc&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x00394;QTc (treatment)&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;&#x00394;QTc (placebo).

In addition, a supratherapeutic dose of moxifloxacin (800&#x000a0;mg) resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in the QTc interval from baseline compared with the 400-mg dose, which was greater than the previous report by Demolis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although Demolis et al. only used QTcB and QTcF values in their study, they found no relationship between the dose of moxifloxacin and QT interval lengthening, but found a positive relationship between QT interval prolongation and moxifloxacin concentration [<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.35, moxifloxacin concentration (&#x003bc;g/L) vs. QT interval (ms); <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.72, moxifloxacin concentration (&#x003bc;g/L) vs. &#x00394;QT interval (%)]. The study that was conducted by Demolis et al. differs from our study in that they performed submaximal exercise testing to allow for variation in RR intervals, which may explain the differences between the correlation coefficients (moxifloxacin concentration vs. QT or QTc interval) in the two studies. Their findings with supratherapeutic doses of moxifloxacin differed from those of our study, in which an increase in the moxifloxacin dose almost doubled &#x00394;&#x00394;QTc. Because there were no noticeable differences in PK parameters between the two studies, there is a possibility that Korean subjects may show different susceptibility to supratherapeutic doses of moxifloxacin than Caucasian subjects. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that moxifloxacin induces a detectable effect of greater than 5&#x000a0;ms on QTc prolongation, which confirms the adequacy of the use of moxifloxacin as a positive control in Korean TQT studies, explained by Answer 1 in the ICH E14 Questions-and-Answers document [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Data reported by Florian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed the sufficiency of linear concentration-&#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF model in describing the effect of moxifloxacin on QT interval. Pooled data from 20 TQT studies were analyzed, and a mean slope of 3.1&#x000a0;ms per &#x003bc;g/mL was estimated. This estimated slope is smaller when compared with the present study&#x02019;s slope (0.00535&#x000a0;ms per &#x003bc;g/L for &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF). Although Caucasians were more than 80&#x000a0;% of the dataset in Florian et al., it is unlikely that this difference is because of ethnicity. There seems to be a wide inter-individual variability in moxifloxacin-induced QT response, as the range of the slope varied greatly from 1.6 to 4.8&#x000a0;ms per &#x003bc;g/mL even when the percentages of ethnic backgrounds were similar between studies. Therefore, the difference in mean slopes of concentration-&#x00394;&#x00394;QTc models is likely because of individual variability.</p><p>A study that recruited healthy Japanese subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which reported the largest QTcF change from baseline as 11.6&#x000a0;ms (90&#x000a0;% CI 9.1&#x02013;14.1) in a non-fasting state and 14.4&#x000a0;ms (90&#x000a0;% CI 11.9&#x02013;16.8) in a fasting state, found no statistically significant differences between Caucasian and Japanese subjects in QTc interval prolongation. The value obtained in the fasting state was similar to the largest &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF found in our study, but because direct comparison is not possible, this does not imply ethnic differences between Japanese and Korean subjects. It is worth noting, however, that there was a study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01876316) that compared moxifloxacin-induced QT prolongation in Japanese and Korean subjects, and this study has concluded there was no significant difference between the two ethnicities (unpublished data).</p><p>One study that used a quinidine intravenous infusion to evaluate differences in QT interval prolongation between Caucasian and Korean subjects reported that Korean subjects were less sensitive to quinidine-induced QT prolongation than Caucasian subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although this study contributed valuable Korean QT prolongation study data, a difference exists: this study did not use moxifloxacin, a drug that is commonly used as a positive control in TQT studies.</p><p>Previously identified differences based on QT interval correction methods were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]: namely, the tendency of Bazett&#x02019;s formula to extend to extreme values. This tendency was more evident in the moxifloxacin 800-mg group, where the largest time-matched &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcB was calculated to be 28.83&#x000a0;ms (90&#x000a0;% CI 23.69&#x02013;33.97). Therefore, a correction method using either Fridericia&#x02019;s formula or individual correction may be a better choice for TQT studies in Korean subjects, where individual correction would most likely be the best choice as noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. We also investigated different baseline measurement methods and found a statistically significant difference between two baseline measurement methods; namely, a trend was observed in which the &#x00394;&#x00394;QTc from the time-matched baseline was measured to be lower than that from the pre-dose baseline. This trend did not change over time. This finding may be because the time-matched baseline measurement corrects for diurnal variation. One limitation to our study is the fact we took only one pre-dose recording, while the usual pre-dose baseline measurement is conducted by taking the median QTc value from three pre-dose ECG recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, an exact one-on-one comparison of the time-matched and pre-dose baseline methods was not appropriate. ICH guideline E14 recommends that parallel studies use the time-matched baseline method and that crossover studies use the pre-dose baseline method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In contrast to the recommendations, our study was a crossover study that used the time-matched baseline method; however, despite the identified limitations of our study, we think that the time-matched baseline measurement can also be used in crossover studies because of its merits in diurnal variation correction.</p><p>A study by Yan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] suggested that parallel studies using time-matched baseline correction could show higher variation in &#x00394;QTcF and result in smaller correlation, probably because of a time lag between baseline measurement and dosing. Yan et al. have also found slightly lower values for &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF in crossover designs that used pre-dose baseline correction. Because our study is unique in that we have set up a crossover study with time-matched baseline method, it is quite difficult to compare whether one baseline correction method is preferable in place of another. At present, there could be discrepancies between studies analyzing different correction methods.</p><p>We speculated that by confirming the QT interval prolongation effects of moxifloxacin we could obtain comparable pilot data that could be used in QT interval prolongation studies in drug development targeting the Korean population. By doing so, an effective safety monitoring plan can be established and guidelines for accurate ECG data collection and analysis may be presented. Bazett&#x02019;s formula is not recommended for calculating the range of QT interval prolongation corrected by individual RR, but Fridericia&#x02019;s formula and the individual correction method may be used interchangeably. The current study aimed to provide comparable pilot QT interval prolongation data in Korean subjects that could be used in scientific and regulatory fields and was not necessarily focused on detecting inter-ethnic differences. However, because other studies have suggested that possible differences exist between ethnic groups, further studies are needed to evaluate and incorporate possible interethnic differences. In addition, because this study only included male subjects, gender differences were not evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, moxifloxacin 400&#x000a0;mg causes moderate QT interval prolongation and is an adequate positive control in Korean TQT studies.
