As the duration of diabetes increases, &#x003b2;-cell function progressively deteriorates, partly as a result of apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Inflammation is associated with pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis and reduced insulin sensitivity, supporting the notion that inflammation plays a key role in aggravating or even causing type 2 diabetes specifically or the metabolic syndrome generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; is an inflammatory mediator that may contribute to this pathophysiology. IL-1&#x003b2; expression has been observed in &#x003b2;-cells of patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Moreover, production and secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; from &#x003b2;-cells is induced by high glucose levels and inhibits the function and promotes the apoptosis of &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) protects human &#x003b2;-cells from glucose-induced functional impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and apoptosis, and its expression is decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The hypothesis that blocking IL-1&#x003b2; activity could be therapeutic in type 2 diabetes was tested clinically with anakinra, a recombinant IL-1ra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Results from a proof-of-concept study indicated that anakinra modestly improved hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) relative to placebo, reduced circulating inflammatory cytokines, and showed signs of improved &#x003b2;-cell secretory function after 13 weeks of daily subcutaneous dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Nine months after treatment completion, anakinra-treated patients continued to have improved proinsulin/insulin ratios and reduced inflammatory cytokines; anakinra responders required less exogenous insulin than did nonresponders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Clinical evaluation of a neutralizing IL-1&#x003b2; monoclonal antibody (XOMA 052) in type 2 diabetic patients showed similar results. XOMA 052 improved HbA<sub>1c</sub> relative to placebo after a single intravenous infusion and after repeated subcutaneous dosing; improvements in fasting blood glucose and insulin sensitivity after subcutaneous dosing were also noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Typically only a small percentage of cytokine receptors require engagement to activate downstream signaling pathways, and cytokines are typically labile proteins expressed at low concentrations. Because anakinra binds to the IL-1 receptor and has a short half-life (4&#x02013;6 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), it is unclear whether the modest nature of the response in type 2 diabetes was related to compound-specific properties or a reflection of the role of this cytokine pathway in the disease pathogenesis. Although XOMA 052 binds and neutralizes IL-1&#x003b2; directly and has a longer half-life, it was dosed in a limited number of subjects and for short duration. Further evaluation of the intervention in the IL-1&#x003b2; pathway in diabetes would help determine whether this approach could be a successful therapy.</p><p>LY2189102 (LY) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4) that binds to IL-1&#x003b2; with high affinity (2.8 pmol/L) and neutralizes its activity. Previous clinical studies have evaluated its safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as its effects on signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (NCT00380744). This phase II study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LY in type 2 patients with diabetes treated with diet and exercise, with or without approved antidiabetic medications.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Protocol H9C-MC-BBDK (NCT00942188) was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study in type 2 diabetic patients conducted between June 2009 and November 2010. Among 19 secondary and tertiary U.S. sites, 17 sites randomized at least 1 patient. The trial consisted of 2&#x02013;6 weeks for screening and baseline; 12 weeks of treatment, and 12 weeks of follow-up (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1835/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>).</p><p>Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 0.6, 18, or 180 mg LY or placebo, dosed weekly with two 1.5-mL s.c. injections for 12 weeks (13 doses). Allocation was accomplished with a computer-generated schedule; randomization was at the study level with no stratifications used. Coded medication labels were used, and all injections were identical in appearance to conceal allocation. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability were evaluated for 24 weeks (12 weeks of dosing and 12 weeks of follow-up). This study was reviewed and approved by local research ethics committees and conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Basic inclusion criteria were as follows: men and women 20&#x02013;75 years old, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes according to American Diabetes Association 2007 criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), with duration &#x0003e;3 months (confirmed by fasting C-peptide levels &#x02265;0.8 ng/mL), BMI between 25 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and stable condition on diet and exercise with or without approved antidiabetic agents (except thiazolidinediones or insulin) for &#x02265; 8 weeks, and a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> between 7 and 10% and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) &#x02265;2 mg/L. Anti-inflammatory drugs (including corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) were not permitted, except for aspirin (allowed up to 100 mg/day). It was recommended that patients be on background statin therapy per National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Patients were excluded from participation if they had GAD65 autoantibodies, had evidence of tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C, had symptomatic herpes zoster or live or attenuated vaccination within 3 months of randomization, or had a screening fasting glucose &#x02265;270 mg/dL.</p><p>The doses selected in this study were intended to provide proof of the mechanistic concept and to generate an exploratory dose-response relationship that could guide future development. The highest dose (180 mg) was considered the maximum feasible dose and was not expected to exceed previously tested and safe exposure levels. The intermediate and low doses were chosen to explore the dose-response relationship in the different pharmacodynamic end points and were based on exploratory hs-CRP data in a previous study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Efficacy and pharmacodynamic assessments</title><p>Glucose-lowering assessments included HbA<sub>1c</sub> at screening and at weeks &#x02212;2, 0, 6, 10, 12, 18, and 24; fasting glucose at screening and at weeks &#x02212;2, 0, 1&#x02013;13, 18, and 24; fasting insulin at screening and at weeks &#x02212;2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, and 24 weeks; fasting C-peptide at screening and at weeks 12, 13, 18, and 24 weeks; and 0&#x02013;2 h postprandial glucose and insulin changes after a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) at weeks &#x02212;2, 0, 10, 12, and 24.

The pattern of infections observed was typical for type 2 diabetic patients, and no unusual infection types or patterns were observed. One serious adverse event (SAE) occurred in one subject at 0.6 mg (migraine) and three SAEs occurred in one subject at 18 mg (chest pain, asthma, and status asthmaticus); none of these events were considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug. Three patients (11.5%) in the 18-mg group and 2 patients (7.4%) in the 180-mg group discontinued the study because of TEAEs.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>TEAEs in the full analysis set through 24 weeks</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2239tbl2"/></table-wrap><p>There were six hypoglycemic events in four subjects: one in one subject at 0.6 mg and five in three subjects at 18 mg. No events were severe, all were documented as either symptomatic (4/6) or asymptomatic (2/6), and three of the four subjects were taking additional antidiabetic medications (metformin plus a sulfonylurea in each case).</p><p>There was a slight decrease in values for neutrophils and white blood cell count in the LY groups during the dosing period. No other clinically significant differences between treatment groups were seen for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, vital sign parameters, or 12-lead electrocardiography. The hypoglycemia incidence rate was 0 episodes per month for the placebo group and 0.02 episodes per month for all LY doses combined.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s13"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Several studies have shown elevated circulating levels of acute-phase proteins, cytokines, and chemokines to predict the incidence of type 2 diabetes, suggesting that such mediators play a significant role in the pathology of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). IL-1&#x003b2; may be a key mediator in this context because of its various proinflammatory effects (both direct and through induction of additional proinflammatory mediators from adipose tissue), inhibition of &#x003b2;-cell function, and promotion of &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Potential advantages of blocking the biological activity of IL-1&#x003b2; in type 2 diabetes thus include increased insulin production, improved insulin sensitivity, and slowing of disease progression by increasing &#x003b2;-cell burden. This study evaluated whether neutralizing IL-1&#x003b2; activity impacts glycemic control in type 2 diabetes and if so whether such effects are likely to be caused by increased insulin production or improved insulin sensitivity. These results further support the concept that blocking IL-1&#x003b2; activity improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, at least in part through improvement in insulin production.</p><p>Overall, improvement of glucose control was demonstrated, as reflected by reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting glucose, and postprandial glucose. The placebo-adjusted reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> ranged between &#x02212;0.245 and &#x02212;0.378% in the compliant treatment groups. Weekly dosing with LY for 12 weeks modestly reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and a positive glycemic effect was still evident 12 weeks after the last administration. Fasting and postprandial glucose values were improved by the end of LY treatment, although this effect had waned by the end of the follow-up period at 24 weeks.</p><p>The observed glucose-lowering effect is generally consistent with results from clinical studies evaluating two other IL-1&#x003b2; pathway inhibitors in type 2 diabetic patients: anakinra (IL-1ra) and XOMA 052 (monoclonal antibody to IL-1&#x003b2;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Collectively, these results appear to suggest that regardless of the mode of antagonism of the IL-1&#x003b2; pathway, only modest improvement of glycemia is to be expected.</p><p>Although the study included multiple dose levels of LY, it was not designed to provide precise dose-response relationships because of limitations of sample size. The dose-response relationship for the different end points measured in this study therefore appeared inconsistent. This inconsistency may be explained by random variability and the small sample size per treatment, and conclusions about the shape of the dose-response relationship will require larger studies.</p><p>Although the empirical results from our study do not address the mechanism of the glucose-lowering effect, results from the MMTT seem to favor an effect on insulin secretion rather than insulin sensitivity. This is consistent with the anakinra study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), which showed improvements in &#x003b2;-cell function, primarily by a reduced proinsulin/insulin ratio in the anakinra-treated groups, and no improvement in insulin sensitivity. Further, a subset of anakinra-treated patients with HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions at 13 weeks (anakinra responders) maintained improved &#x003b2;-cell function 39 weeks later, whereas placebo-treated and anakinra nonresponders had further declines in &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Moreover, XOMA 052 was shown to improve insulin production at 1 and 3 months after a single dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that neutralizing the effect of IL-1&#x003b2; results in limited improvement in glycemic control during the course of a few weeks to months, at least in part as a result of improvements in insulin secretion.</p><p>Antagonizing IL-1&#x003b2; led to a clear and general anti-inflammatory response, exemplified by the potent and durable effect on hs-CRP. The reduction in hs-CRP appeared to occur rapidly, with apparent maximal reduction by the earliest time point evaluated, consistent with the observations of Larsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Moreover, the magnitude of reduction was similar at all dose levels and sustained through the duration of the follow-up period. Anti-inflammatory pharmacology of LY was also seen in the general reductions of PAI-1 and IL-6. In addition, LY increased adiponectin, which has been associated with improved &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and negatively correlated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Because elevated circulating proinflammatory mediators are correlated with type 2 diabetes incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), patients with higher levels of inflammation may be more responsive to anti-inflammatory intervention. A post hoc linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between baseline hs-CRP and glucose-lowering response to LY. Changes from baseline in both fasting glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> appeared to correlate weakly with baseline hs-CRP, such that higher starting hs-CRP serum concentration was associated with an improved glycemic response at the end of dosing. Elevated IL-1ra levels are found in nondiabetic individuals who are likely to develop diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), whereas patients with established overt type 2 diabetes have reduced IL-1ra expression in both &#x003b2;-cells and serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Low baseline IL-1ra serum levels predicted better glycemic and &#x003b2;-cell secretory responses to anakinra treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Further, an increased frequency of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs4251961 allele C of the IL-1ra gene (<italic>IL1RN</italic>) and associated lower baseline IL-1ra and higher IL-1&#x003b2; serum concentrations were observed in the anakinra responders relative to the anakinra nonresponders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>LY was generally well tolerated, and no SAEs were attributed to the agent during the course of the study. The frequency of TEAEs was similar between LY and placebo groups other than a higher number of infections, all of which were mild to moderate, in the LY groups than in the placebo group. A dose-related mild neutrophil reduction occurred and resolved after discontinuation of LY. Although the study was not designed to look at immune status, the infection and neutrophil observations may be related to the mechanism of action. There were no other clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results of note. This study, however, does not address long-term safety.</p><p>A substantial fraction of patients (26 patients; 33%) exhibited antidrug antibody responses. Most were of low titer, however, and the sequelae were generally minor. Only 5 patients (19%) exhibited distinct changes in the pharmacokinetic profiles, and there were no discernible adverse events associated with the development of antidrug antibodies.</p><p>Because type 2 diabetes appears to result from a long-standing process that involves inflammation, long-term intervention may be required. A case-cohort study found elevated IL-1ra levels for as long as 13 years before diagnosis and also an accelerated increase in IL-1ra during the last 6 years before diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Increased IL-1ra levels thus may reflect a reaction to counterregulate the immunologic and metabolic disturbances before the onset of type 2 diabetes. One might speculate that greater benefits might be seen over periods of many years or with earlier intervention. The results from short-term studies do not adequately address whether IL-1&#x003b2; blockade can modify diabetes progression through pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell protection and survival. In the current study, some of the initial benefits appeared to decline within a few months after dosing was stopped, suggesting that long-term benefits might require continued treatment.</p><p>The potent effect of LY on inflammatory biomarkers raises the possibility of its use as a treatment in other conditions in which inflammation may play a significant pathologic role. For example, cardiovascular disease is associated with a chronic inflammatory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and is often a comorbidity of type 2 diabetes. LY decreased hs-CRP, PAI-1, and IL-6, so it may ameliorate cardiovascular events, and long-term studies are required to evaluate this.</p><p>In conclusion, weekly subcutaneous administration of LY for 12 weeks to type 2 diabetic patients resulted in modest reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, blood glucose, and multiple inflammatory biomarkers. Larger, long-term studies are required to determine the potential therapeutic utility of LY for this indication.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn2" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1835/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1835/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
