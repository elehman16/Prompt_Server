However, few interventions focus on improving healthcare worker (HCW) competencies and skills for provision of high-quality adolescent care. Standardized patients (SPs) are trained actors who work with HCWs in mock clinical encounters to improve clinical assessment, communication, and empathy skills. This stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial will evaluate a clinical training intervention utilizing SPs to improve HCW skills in caring for HIV-positive AYA, resulting in increased retention in care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The trial will utilize a stepped-wedge design to evaluate a training intervention using SPs to train HCWs in assessment, communication, and empathy skills for AYA HIV care. We will recruit 24 clinics in Kenya with an active electronic medical record (EMR) system and at least 40 adolescents enrolled in HIV care per site. Stratified randomization by county will be used to assign clinics to one of four waves &#x02013; time periods when they receive the intervention &#x02013; with each wave including six clinics. From each clinic, up to 10 HCWs will participate in the training intervention. SP training includes didactic sessions in adolescent health, current guidelines, communication skills, and motivational interviewing techniques. HCW participants will rotate through seven standardized SP scenarios, followed by SP feedback, group debriefing, and remote expert evaluation. AYA outcomes will be assessed using routine clinic data. The primary outcome is AYA retention in HIV care, defined as returning for first follow-up visit within 6&#x000a0;months of presenting to care, or returning for a first follow-up visit after re-engagement in care in AYA with a previous history of being lost to follow-up. Secondary outcomes include HCW competency scores, AYA satisfaction with care, and AYA clinical outcomes including CD4 and viral load. Additional analyses will determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial will contribute valuable information to HIV programs in Kenya and other low-resource settings, providing a potentially scalable strategy to improve quality of care and retention in critical HIV services in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02928900.

The Kenyan government has developed ambitious guidelines for adolescent-friendly HIV services in Kenya.

To address this need, the University of Nairobi and the University of Washington have partnered with the Kenya Ministry of Health&#x02019;s National AIDS and STI Control Program (NASCOP) to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative clinical training intervention targeting adherence to clinical guidelines, as well as communication and interpersonal skills among HCW.</p><p id="Par26">The intervention will be evaluated using a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

This pragmatic study design was chosen because this training intervention occurs at the clinic, rather than at the individual level, uses routine clinic data for primary outcome measurement, and would not be feasible to implement simultaneously at all facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this modified, one-way, cross-over design, all facilities eventually receive the intervention, which was important for government partners.

All facilities will contribute intervention and control periods. The RCT consists of four intervention waves approximately 9&#x000a0;months apart. Each wave includes HCW participants from six facilities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Once facilities receive the training intervention, they are considered &#x0201c;exposed&#x0201d; until the end of the trial.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Adapted CONSORT Diagram for trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2266_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study sites and population</title><p id="Par28">We engaged NASCOP and county leadership during the planning phase of this study to identify eligible health facilities. We also established a study Community Advisory Board (CAB), including AYA leaders from networks of people living with HIV, to provide guidance on recruitment and retention of facilities and participants. The sampling frame included secondary and tertiary HIV care facilities from four counties in Kenya that were purposefully selected to represent different HIV epidemic patterns and services to enhance generalizability by geographic region and HIV prevalence. Eligible clinics had at least 40 AYA enrolled in care, a current electronic medical record (EMR) system, and no other special adolescent interventions. Facilities were excluded if anything would prevent the complete conduct of the training intervention at that site and/or the collection of outcome measures (e.g., discontinuation of the EMR system). Among 30 eligible facilities, we selected 24 facilities ensuring a balanced distribution of counties and facility sizes in each wave.</p><p id="Par29">Electronic medical records from all AYA patients ages 10&#x02013;24 years enrolled in HIV care at participating sites are eligible for data abstraction. A sample of AYA presenting for HIV care at enrolled sites are further eligible to complete patient satisfaction surveys. Eligible HCW participants are 18&#x000a0;years of age or older, employed at trial sites, and provide clinical and/or counseling services to adolescents. Individuals are excluded if they experience any conditions that would place them at increased risk of harm or preclude the individual&#x02019;s completion of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization</title><p id="Par30">Facilities were randomized to one of four intervention waves (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), stratified by county: Nairobi, Kiambu, Kisumu, Homa Bay and by facility size.

All possible combinations that yielded an allocation of two Nairobi, two Kiambu, one Homa Bay, and one Kisumu site, half high (more than 73 AYA) and half medium volume (less than 73 AYA, based on the median number of AYA enrolled in all sites) in each wave were generated in Excel. One of the possible combinations was randomly chosen using a random-number generator for the randomization allocation.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the SPEED Intervention Timing, by Wave</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2266_Tab1_HTML" id="MO4"/><table-wrap-foot><p>Key: white boxes&#x02009;=&#x02009;unexposed periods; grey boxes=&#x02009;exposed periods</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

However, we have implemented procedures to minimize the number of individuals who are unblinded. Only the biostatistician has access to the randomization assignments of the 24 facilities. One month before each wave, the biostatistician provides a list of the six facilities in that wave to the study lead and the coordinator. All other facilities are informed that training will occur at a later wave. An independent External Advisory Panel reviews recruitment, enrollment, and potential for social harms annually during the trial. Because of the stepped-wedge design, there are no interim analyses or stopping rules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Training of standardized patients</title><p id="Par32">We contracted with a casting agency in Kenya to recruit professional actors to be trained as SPs, hiring 14 Kenyan actors over age 18&#x000a0;years who could believably role-play AYA patients between 14 and 21&#x000a0;years. Before piloting the intervention, actors received a 5-day training facilitated by a consultant expert in the SP methodology. The training included review of seven case scripts, individualized coaching on role playing cases believably without over dramatizing, video-taped practice of the simulated patient encounters with actual HCWs followed by group discussion to refine the SPs&#x02019; portrayal of the cases, and training on providing verbal feedback to HCWs and completing the SP actor feedback forms. At the end of the training, the consultant and study team determined the final case assignments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment and enrollment: HCWs and AYA clients</title><p id="Par33">Clinic leadership personnel are consulted to provide a list of up to 10 HCWs who provide adolescent services and to negotiate release from work to participate in the training and survey data collection. A study interviewer then approaches those HCWs to invite them to learn more about the study. HCWs provide written informed consent. HCWs are tracked over time to assess provider retention at clinical intervention sites, using a facility survey to monitor staff turnover. All AYA seeking HIV care on a given day are offered referral by a clinical staff member to our study team for survey participation. We schedule facility visits to &#x0201c;adolescent clinic&#x0201d; days or during school breaks to ensure adequate volumes of eligible patients. Oral consent or assent is obtained from AYA based on their status as emancipated minors. AYA aged 18&#x000a0;years and older, and those aged 14&#x02013;17 years who are emancipated minors, provide oral consent to participate in surveys. Otherwise, parents/caregivers provide oral informed consent for AYA ages 10&#x02013;17 years, and those adolescents provide oral assent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>SP training intervention</title><p id="Par34">The SP intervention is based on an adaptation of Kolb&#x02019;s model of Experiential Learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], Bandura&#x02019;s model of Social Learning Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and an adaptation of Andersen&#x02019;s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The 2-day training intervention focuses on skill-building through practice, with a series of SP encounters, individual feedback by SPs, and group debriefings. HCW participants receive orientation to the SP methodology, instructions for taking part in the encounters, and short didactic sessions on adolescent-friendly services in Kenya and motivational interviewing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. After the didactic session, each participant rotates through seven SP encounters. Encounters are video-recorded and occur at a training venue with stations set up to resemble counseling rooms, separated by a wall or curtain for privacy. At the end of each encounter, the SP provides non-technical, emotional feedback. Facilitated group debriefings consist of review of videos and discussion about strengths and areas for improvement in each encounter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Standardized case scripts</title><p id="Par35">Each case script follows a standard format, with a chief complaint, relevant medical and social history, and actor prompts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

We will examine whether an observed intervention effect may be explained through HCW post-training competency and AYA patient satisfaction scores. In that analysis, mean AYA satisfaction scores will be evaluated as predictors of AYA retention in care from EMR data. Temporal trends that change over time can confound the effect estimate in a stepped-wedge trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

The primary effectiveness estimate from the trial will be used for the number of additional AYA retained in care as a result of the intervention. Direct medical costs include laboratory tests, medication costs, other medical procedure costs, and personnel salaries. Direct non-medical costs include AYA transportation, food, and childcare costs. Indirect costs include opportunity costs from lost wages in AYA paid and unpaid work. We will also model the cost-utility of the intervention in terms of cost per life-year saved and DALY averted by maintaining HIV-positive AYA in care, including subsequent decreases in HIV transmission/acquisition. This will require linking effectiveness data to a mathematical model that estimates DALYs in AYA HIV progression, using a model adapted for AYA populations.</p><p id="Par49">We will examine how these estimates vary through one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses in settings with varying AYA HIV prevalence, HCW wages, patient volume, and linkage to care rates. This will assist in identifying scenarios where the intervention is most cost-effective, allowing policy-makers to determine incremental costs and net benefits of the intervention. We will perform this analysis both from a limited societal perspective and from a Ministry of Health (healthcare sector) perspective.

Importantly, there is a lack of rigorous studies of <italic>any</italic> HCW training programs in resource-limited settings to improve adolescent-friendly services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This study fills several important gaps in AYA HIV research. We are unaware of any other intervention that uses SPs to improve provider skills in working with HIV-positive AYA. While SPs are standard in pre-service medical education in high-resource settings, our use of SPs for an in-service training intervention is novel. This study will measure intervention effectiveness on AYA health outcomes using a rigorous RCT design. This study leverages Kenya&#x02019;s new EMR system for study outcomes, which is resource-efficient. This study is responsive to the Kenyan Ministry of Health request for novel interventions to inform the implementation of new adolescent-friendly HIV service guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In addition, this study will provide data on core AYA HIV indicators for the UN &#x0201c;90-90-90&#x0201d; targets from a range of geographic and epidemiologic settings in Kenya.</p><p id="Par51">Understanding the cost-effectiveness of HIV interventions for AYA is important for policy-makers to allocate resources effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. If the SP intervention is effective, we expect to generate novel and useful information on the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. To minimize the costs associated with this intervention, we designed the training to align with the local facility infrastructure, staffing, and training schedules. If the intervention is not effective, we will nonetheless generate estimates of the total cost of this training, as well as the direct and indirect costs to AYA for seeking HIV care, which will be useful for the Kenyan Ministry of Health and future economic analyses of AYA HIV interventions.</p><p id="Par52">Successful implementation of the SP intervention requires careful consideration of several contextual factors. First, strong engagement of stakeholders from NASCOP, county governments, community members, and non-governmental organizations that support facilities is essential. Our established partnerships with NASCOP and county leadership has facilitated access to study facilities and EMR data, and enabled us to stay current on the evolving landscape of adolescent-friendly services in Kenya. Youth perspectives are necessary to include in adolescent health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our CAB offers important insights into AYA attitudes towards HCWs and challenges of living with HIV. In addition, AYA case scripts, which are the foundation of the training intervention, require multiple revisions to ensure that they are tailored to the local clinical context. Cases were refined through pilot testing with HCWs from a range of cadres and through feedback from SPs, faculty experts, and AYA. Finally, EMR data abstraction is a complex process that likely will vary by partner organization and facility. The EMR system is new in Kenya, and facilities have different capacities for data entry and retrieval. We have established relationships with each partner organization that supports EMR systems at each facility. We can also offer sites support in the data abstraction process.</p><p id="Par53">This study also has limitations. A 3-month strike by public-sector physicians and ensuing staff shortages in public facilities resulted in delays in baseline data collection, and a nursing strike is ongoing. Our ability to recruit AYA for the surveys depends on their school breaks and facilities&#x02019; schedules for this patient population. As with any in-service training, turnover of SPEED-trained HCWs is possible, and would dilute the intervention effectiveness. A limitation of a stepped-wedge design is the potential bias introduced by contextual factors that vary over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We will monitor these changes with the facility survey and evaluate them in the analysis. This intervention targets HCWs to improve AYA retention in HIV care. Other community factors, including HIV-stigma, family and peer support, and school schedules, may also affect retention rates, which we do not capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Finally, our primary outcomes will depend on the quality of EMR data.</p><p id="Par54">A standardized patient intervention for HCW has the potential to promote high-quality patient-centered HIV services for AYA by providing HCWs with technical skills and pragmatic experiences. This improvement in delivery of care can, in turn, address barriers cited by AYA and improve retention in essential HIV services. By increasing engagement in care, the intervention can ultimately improve quality of life, survival, and decrease subsequent HIV transmission among AYA in Kenya, closing the gap in the &#x0201c;90-90-90&#x0201d; targets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par55">Pilot testing of the intervention was completed in October 2016.
