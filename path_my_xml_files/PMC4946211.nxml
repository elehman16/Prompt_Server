A 4&#x000a0;week maintenance period using the device followed. The device records physical activity level and information about food consumption, and provides motivational feedback based on energy balance. Twenty-seven participants were randomised to receive no intervention; intervention alone; or intervention plus weekly motivational support. All participants received advice on diet and exercise at the start of the study. Weight and HbA1c levels were recorded at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 16. Qualitative interviews were conducted with participants who received the intervention to explore their experiences of using the device and involvement in the study including the training received.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall the device was perceived to be well-liked, acceptable, motivational and easy to use by participants. Some logistical changes were required during the feasibility study, including shortening of the study duration and relaxation of participant inclusion criteria. Descriptive statistics of weight and HbA1c data showed promising trends of weight loss and HbA1c reduction in both intervention groups, although this should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A number of methodological recommendations for a future RCT emerged from the current feasibility study. The mHealth device was acceptable and promising for helping individuals with T2DM to reduce their HbA1c and lose weight. Devices with similar features should be tested further in larger studies which follow these methodological recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12911-016-0331-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>Mobile health</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Weight</kwd><kwd>HbA1c</kwd><kwd>Feasibility</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CLAHRC SY</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Overview</title><p>Obesity is the leading risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Around 62&#x000a0;% of the population in England and Wales are overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and in the United Kingdom (UK) the overall prevalence of diabetes is around 4.5&#x000a0;% (with around 90&#x000a0;% of these expected to have T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The costs to the National Health Service (NHS) are significant, with around &#x000a3;10 billion per year spent on diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. High prevalence and costs of T2DM are reflected on a global scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Weight loss is an important goal in the treatment of overweight and obese T2DM patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Intentional weight loss in T2DM can lead to reduced clinical symptoms, reduced use of medications, and reduced mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. National guidelines for T2DM treatment emphasise the integration of optimal dietary advice and increased physical activity within a multi-component diabetes management plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This multi-component approach can help individuals with T2DM to achieve HbA1c, blood pressure and lipid profiles in or near to the normal range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recently the use of mobile health (mHealth, e.g. apps on mobile phones, pedometers) for self-management of T2DM has received attention as a potentially cost-effective strategy for weight reduction and improved glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] concluded that mHealth-based interventions can lead to short-term (and potentially medium-term) clinically significant weight loss for some overweight and obese adults. Portable technology enables interventions to be employed by individuals whilst going about their daily lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and facilitates self-monitoring, which is acknowledged as a key component of weight loss intervention programmes. In addition interactive technology can be designed to assist people in modifying their attitudes and behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) which aim to assess the effectiveness of mHealth for weight loss typically have significant methodological weaknesses including a lack of blinding, and often, too little information on randomisation, measures to address attrition, and delivery of participant education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study context</title><p>The current study aimed to initiate the process of evaluating a specific mHealth intervention, in order to develop more robust evidence on whether this intervention could be used to help people with T2DM lose weight and control their HbA1c levels.</p><p>The aforementioned systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] identified a promising CE (European Conformity) marked mobile digital technology for overweight/obese T2DM patients, the AiperMotion 440 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Its primary impact on a user is assumed to be adding greater motivation overtly and through empowerment to self-monitor. A 2011 study (based in Germany) reported that after 6&#x000a0;months of using the device the intervention group of overweight/obese T2DM patients had a greater mean weight loss and greater reduction in HbA1c compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, diabetic medication was discontinued or reduced in 81&#x000a0;% of intervention participants (compared to 0&#x000a0;% in the control group). These promising results require verification because of: the researchers&#x02019; close working with the device manufacturers; unknown details about the participants and operational details of the trial; potential exaggeration because of the small number of participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;68); personal financial cost to participants for taking part; and a lack of UK-based data (which was deemed important by clinical advisors to the current project). The value of the authors&#x02019; study is that it will inform an RCT that doesn&#x02019;t have these shortcomings.</p><p>Following the 2011 study the device was superseded by the AiperMotion 500, which was smaller and lighter, had a longer battery life and a colour screen, provided anthropomorphic-visual motivational feedback and allowed the user to make retrospective &#x02018;corrections&#x02019; to calorie and physical activity data. In accordance with the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s (MRC) Complex Intervention guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] we planned a feasibility study to determine the acceptability of the AiperMotion 500 and the feasibility of conducting an RCT of the intervention in the UK, as a first step to more robust evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention. The manufacturers were aware of the project but were not involved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Research aims and objectives</title><p>The primary aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of conducting a future mixed-methods RCT of an mHealth supported weight loss intervention (AiperMotion 500) for overweight/obese individuals with T2DM. The primary objectives were to include measures to address the above noted shortcomings of other studies, review operation of the study (especially including recruitment, randomisation procedures, and attrition) and explore participants&#x02019;:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Views of the education on diet, exercise and use of the technology;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Views on acceptability of the technology;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adherence to using the technology;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Perception of how motivational the technology was;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Experience of taking part in the study.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The measurement of weight loss and change in HbA1c and inflating participant numbers allowed a secondary aim of obtaining an initial indication of any weight loss and HbA1c trends. Thus the secondary objective was to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Compare mean weight loss and HbA1c change across the study arms using descriptive statistics.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p>The mixed methods feasibility study occurred during April&#x02013;December 2013 (the maximum time available from funding), 5&#x000a0;weeks setting up the study ending in launching public awareness of the study, 5&#x000a0;weeks for recruitment (incorporating the training sessions), 20&#x000a0;weeks for participation and, 9&#x000a0;weeks for analyses and write up. For the feasibility study each participant was asked to take part for 12&#x000a0;weeks aiming at weight loss and blood sugar reduction followed by 8&#x000a0;weeks of maintenance of their achievement (reflecting the goal of achieving and observing a longer term change in behaviour and maintained weight loss/blood sugar reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). These durations were judged sufficient for the primary objectives and minimally sufficient for the secondary objectives. Longer durations for both goals of reduction and maintenance in any future trial were anticipated but were beyond resource and duration limits of the feasibility study.</p><p>Participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group One-advice on diet and exercise;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group Two-as Group One plus use of AiperMotion 500;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group Three-as Group Two plus email motivational support (to echo other AiperMotion studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]).</p></list-item></list></p><p>For the purposes of the primary study objectives methodologically recruiting around ten participants in total could be seen as sufficient, but for the secondary aim and objective more would be needed. About ten participants in each arm was judged as minimally sufficient, but to account for high published attrition rates (47&#x02013;60&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] twenty in each arm was selected as a suitable ambition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><p>The AiperMotion 500 is a wearable device, preferably worn at the hip (with less accuracy it can be carried in a pocket or bag). Added motivation to lose weight occurs through user awareness of the device&#x02019;s automatic recording of physical activity, the act of recording nutritional intake for eating healthily, and receiving graphical and pictorial feedback on these measures (both immediately and over time). The features of the device are outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Features of AiperMotion 500</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12911_2016_331_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>For Group 3 further motivational impact may have occured through emailed sending of weekly event diaries and receiving motivational feedback in return.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Procedures</title><p>At the beginning of the 12&#x000a0;week intervention all participants received 90-min group training, delivered by the research team, around appropriate behaviours to lose weight and control their HbA1c, specifically:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Eating a low Glycaemic Index (GI) diet (this included the first hand experiences, tips on cheap information sources and ingredients, and tasting of example baked foods with low GI);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maximising physical activity;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) was also employed as the primary motivational component of the training to enable participants to visualise themselves at their ideal weight and then set goals to reach it. NLP relies on making an individual aware of their subconscious sensations, movements, language and perceptions (as well as their conscious ones), and using this to explore alternative ways of thinking about their hopes, behaviours and experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>All participants were given a booklet summarising the training. While participants were encouraged to try the low-GI diet they were told they could choose to follow their preferred diet if it had been previously successful. The recommendation regardless of the selected diet was to combine this with increased physical activity. Participants were also told they could individually choose their own weight-loss goal to increase motivation.</p><p>Randomly arranged pre-sealed envelopes were used to randomly allocate individual participants to study groups; the envelopes were held by a responsible person who was physically remote from the training and independent from the study. At the end of training one of the researchers contacted the responsible person, who opened the next envelope and over the telephone revealed the next participant&#x02019;s allocation. Allocation was concealed from participants and researchers until training was completed.</p><p>Groups Two and Three then received a further 60&#x000a0;min training in use of the AiperMotion 500 during which their individual characteristics (weight, height, gender and age) were entered into their devices. These participants were asked to wear the device during waking hours and to report the amount of time that they engaged in physical activity where the device was not worn (e.g. swimming). They were also asked to enter dietary information into the device whenever they consumed food or drink (apart from water). They could choose to enter exact calorific values or category of meal and portion size. The motivational feedback was also highlighted to them. Participants in Group Three were asked to send weekly emails to the research team describing any positive or negative events which had impacted their conformance with the study or motivation to lose weight, and any behaviour changes, during the previous week (&#x02018;Event Diaries&#x02019;). Emailed replies delivered tailored positive encouragement&#x02014;thus potentially adding further positive motivation. If an Event Diary was not received then a reminder was sent to the participant.</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides an overview across the three arms and individual participant&#x02019;s entire timelines of their exposure to training, study measures and data collection. Each participant&#x02019;s five visits should accumulate to about 280&#x000a0;min. As can be seen this involved a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures to address the research aims including those of the anticipated future trial.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Participant activities at research venue visits</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>In week</th><th>Actions/Events</th><th>Group 1</th><th>Group 2</th><th>Group 3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="7">1</td><td>Answer baseline questionnaire</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Collection of blood samples for HbA1c</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Measure height and weight</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Training on diet and weight loss</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Randomisation</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Training on use of the device</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Training on email support</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">6</td><td>Measure weight</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Collection of blood samples for HbA1c</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Download data from device</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">12</td><td>Measure weight</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Collection of blood samples for HbA1c</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Answer repeat questionnaire</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Download device data</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Interviews/focus groups</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">16</td><td>Measure weight</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Collection of blood samples for HbA1c</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Answer repeat questionnaire</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Download device data</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>Interviews/focus groups</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>As can be seen in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> the 12&#x000a0;week intervention was followed by a weight maintenance period.

The device starts a new record for each calendar day at midnight. Participants would start by putting the device onto their clothing (ideally at the hip, but otherwise elsewhere, but if really necessary putting it into a bag they carry). The device immediately starts to record their physical activity automatically. If they wish they can alter their physical activity goals for that day. Similarly the goal daily calorific reduction can be set, or change in weight recorded. All of these values would be anticipated to be changed only occasionally&#x02014;e.g. when the user wants to reset their goals.</p><p>After each occasion they have eaten or drunk something they make a calorific entry into the device&#x02014;choosing whether they will use the quick estimated choices of type and size of meal, or to calculate the exact calorific value and enter that. The former choices are calibrated to the user&#x02019;s BMI, so nominally entering an appropriate number of &#x02018;normal&#x02019; sized selections would lead to no weight change, &#x02018;small&#x02019; and &#x02018;large&#x02019; leading to weight loss and gain respectively.</p><p>If they need to remove the device from their clothing at any time then they can add a calorific value to the exercise record. The device allows them to select a type of physical activity and its duration&#x02014;making an estimate of the energy burnt based on their BMI.</p><p>At any time they can obtain motivational feedback that is based on food intake, energy burnt and their BMI. On the screen they can see an anthropomorphic figure and get a sense of how they are doing that day, or they can choose to view the results and examine the calorific values of exercise and food and the energy balance, or look at how much of the required time for their exercise goals they have achieved, for that day or for up to the preceeding 7&#x000a0;days.

Attendance at the research facility at agreed dates and times was not perfect. There were several occasions where agreed visits had to be re-arranged&#x02014;usually because of a failure to arrive rather than a planned re-arrangement. Participants in most cases of both planned and unplanned re-arrangements gave reasons based on being too busy or another commitment.</p><p>With the range of BMI of recruited participants there were a couple of those with higher BMI who felt uncomfortable with the presence of people at the lower end of the study BMI range. The latter were mainly people with Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>As the study was not funded or approved to take advantage of the technically possible uploading of data to a third party secure online server a more manual process had to be adopted. Participants had to hand over their devices during research facility visits. The data would then be downloaded by the researchers, which proved cumbersome. However, some participants had a worse experience because they had completely downloaded the data from their devices to their computers at home. This made the process much more difficult for the affected participants as they had to be given instructions for copying the required folders and files to a memory stick to bring to the visits to the research facility. With occasional delays requiring extra support this was still completed successfully with the exception of those participants lost to follow up.</p><p>Focus group participants were generally satisfied with their experience of being involved in the study, and many stating that they enjoyed using the intervention and were satisfied with the technology. A few expressed difficulties with keeping to their chosen diet or dissatisfaction with having to calculate calories to then enter into the device.

Overall the device was well-liked and perceived to be acceptable, motivational and easy to use by most participants. Good average levels of adherence with wearing the device and inputting nutritional data were observed (NB faulty or lost devices created gaps in the device data which in turn reduced the averages reported in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), supporting previous studies which show that providing &#x02018;real-time&#x02019; feedback in self-monitoring is valued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, a certain amount of polarity in adherence of individuals to using the device was evident. With more detailed observation any polarity in use of mHealth to monitor physical and dietary activity by individual participants might be investigated in future pre-trial studies. Although caution should be employed in interpreting the quantitative results of the study, the mHealth intervention does show promise in helping people with T2DM to reduce their weight and HbA1c levels. The email motivational feedback, while possibly causing higher adherence to use of the device, did not appear to make a difference to the amount of weight loss and HbA1c reduction observed, although again caution should be employed.</p><p>Increased motivation attributable to the use of the device is of course an important factor in considering the results presented here. In reality the added motivation occurs within a context&#x02014;including many influences e.g. the participants&#x02019; routine environment, life events, and experiences from other elements of the study. There was no intent to separate or directly observe the motivation from the device. Beyond participants&#x02019; comments the study evidence can only give inferences about motivational impact indirectly from the results on adherence, acceptability, attrition, and from the weight and HbA1c changes. These results also broadly imply a useful and positive motivational impact.</p><p>Recent systematic reviews demonstrate the potential of portable technology for weight reduction in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However there is an acknowledged lack of rigorous RCT evidence in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], as well as uncertainty around the effectiveness of mHealth compared to other weight loss interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], whether any benefits are sustained long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which components of mHealth are most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which populations should be targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and whether they would be technically and financially viable for use on a larger scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The current feasibility study is an important first step towards answering some of these questions for weight loss in the T2DM population, and will be used to inform the design of a future RCT.</p><p>Problems were discovered with some of the practicalities of conducting the study, including recruitment and randomisation, inclusion/exclusion criteria, length of maintenance period and nature of the education session. An attrition rate and loss to follow up of 26&#x000a0;% is still a concern and rather than one significant cause there seems to have been a number of contributory factors for the participants in this study, including traumatic events/illness in the family, busy lives, frequency/density of visits to the research facility, and difficulties with parking at the research facility. Due to time and budgetary constraints, only 27 of the target 60 participants were recruited; even after attrition and loss to follow up those remaining were still sufficient to inform the feasibility of operating a future RCT.</p><p>The results demonstrated that it is feasible to conduct an RCT investigating the effectiveness of an mHealth device in aiding weight and HbA1c reduction in T2DM (with a view to conducting a large multi-site RCT), assuming that modifications to the methodology are made:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria should be less prescriptive so that people over the age of 60, people with co-morbid depression, and people with other co-morbid long term conditions, are included. Some older T2DM patients will be interested in using technology to manage their condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and open to use of digital technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There is a high rate of co-morbid depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and other co-morbid long term conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] among people with T2DM. It might be argued, despite some individuals on anti-depressant medications experiencing weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], that they could still benefit. Including such participants may require special allowances in the protocol.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study duration should be substantially increased to include longer periods of weight/HbA1c reduction and maintenance, in order to determine the long term effects of using this intervention. Twelve weeks was short for the ultimate weight loss goals of many of the participants. Although not explored at the time of the study, such a device as the Aipermon 500 (i.e. the intervention used here) would be well suited for a user to aim for an energy balance of zero during weight maintenance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The randomisation process should take place in private rather than in a group setting. Support should be in place if participants become distressed by their allocation, and ideally all participants should be offered the opportunity to use the device after the study has completed (although this would increase the cost of an RCT).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Any additional motivational techniques to encourage adherence should be of known value in weight loss and/or diabetes; where any uncertainty exists (perhaps as with NLP) they should be evaluated separately.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants should be recruited through diabetes clinics and other healthcare sources, rather than through public advertisements alone, in order to access the T2DM population pool more directly. It may be useful to note that after the study an NHS formed public involvement group reviewed the recruitment materials (to inform what should be used for the future RCT). Their view was that the information on the study website pages was entirely sufficient and that the ethically required detailed Participant information sheets were unnecessary, if not off putting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In light of the slow recruitment and failure to reach the target sample size the previous modifications on their own may not be enough. Thus some further measures to improve recruitment should be considered, e.g. a longer period to recruit. Financial incentive is another. Simply advertising and paying participants to take part, even if linked to just making sure they adhere to the administrative basics of the study, may increase recruitment without undue impact on outcomes. Financial motivation tied to individual participant success during a study has been shown to be effective as an intervention in its own right; however in the longer term follow up of the benefit is also reported to be eroded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Careful consideration should be given to the location of any visits participants make for the study. For instance, use of a health service facility as a location to collect blood samples seems appropriate but if at all possible there should be easy parking at and travel to the location. Use of local clinics, GP surgeries or other places where the participant&#x02019;s journey is shortened and made easy may help to reduce attrition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>People are not homogeneous in their confidence or capability to use ICT. Despite having reported ease of use, having on request responsive individualised support to using any technology during the early weeks of the study (i.e. period of adoption of the device) may help both with adherence and reduce attrition. As a minimum offering video instructions for participants to access at home (rather than just printed material) should be considered.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Including explicit opportunities for participants to report faulty or lost devices may not only improve data collection but, similarly to the previous modification, also improve adherence and reduce attrition.</p></list-item><list-item><p> More blinding measures should be included, for instance so that any staff taking physiological readings are not aware of a participant&#x02019;s allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p> Approval should be sought to allow the automatic transfer of data from the device to a secure server which can be seen and downloaded by the research team and the healthcare professional(s) responsible for the individual&#x02019;s care. This would mean fewer visits to the CRF, resulting in less chance of attrition, loss to follow-up and loss of data, and greater convenience for participants.</p></list-item><list-item><p> Adherence in this study was calculated based on overall percentages for wearing the device and inputting of nutritional values. Use of simple convenient estimates of adherence is not untypical for similar published studies. However this neither considers the voracity of the collected data nor the true complexity of adherence to behaviour change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In a future RCT it may be more appropriate to consider adherence as a &#x02018;specific&#x02019; measure to individual patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] before considering ways to judge adherence across a trial.</p></list-item></list></p><p>A pilot RCT, followed by a full scale RCT, with suitably amended protocols are required to evaluate the promising trends identified in the feasibility study and to provide a robust indication of effectiveness. Unfortunately, since the feasibility study&#x02019;s completion, the AiperMotion 500 has been withdrawn as its manufacturer stated it wished to invest its resources in other health product lines. Uncertainty around willingness of individuals or health services to purchase the technology, especially with burgeoning competition from smart phone fitness apps, may have contributed to this decision. At the time of the study the AiperMotion 500 was unique from many other mHealth interventions due to the combination of its characteristics: CE marking as a medical product, anthropomorphic pictorial feedback; flexibility to allow the user to enter either estimated or specific calorific values for food consumed; allowing input of additional exercise when the device was not worn; and in allowing secure cloud or server-based sharing of individual patient data with healthcare professionals. Features of the AiperMotion 500 were highly valued and therefore ideally an app or device incorporating similar features needs to be found or developed in order to continue evaluation of this intervention. However it is noted that a meta-analysis of digital interventions for T2DM suggests feature variation between interventions has only minor effects on blood glucose results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], so there is room for some variation in features in a future version of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The feasibility study has been a valuable first step towards informing evaluation of the effectiveness of an mHealth-based complex intervention for weight loss/HbA1c reduction in T2DM, in accordance with the MRC framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Methodological lessons will be carried forward into an RCT of a similar intervention but may also more generally be considered in similar feasibility studies of other mHealth technologies for obesity and/or diabetes. An intervention based on technology with similar features to the AiperMotion 500 is a potentially acceptable and promising aid for individuals with T2DM to control their HbA1c and weight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI, body mass index; CE, European Conformity; CLAHRC SY, Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for South Yorkshire; CRF, Clinical Research Facility; GI, glycaemic index; HbA1c, (make sure this is defined in the text as well); IT, Information Technology; mHealth, mobile health; MRC, Medical Research Council; NLP, Neuro-Linguistic Programming; NHS, National Health Service; NIHR, National Institute for Health Research; RCT, Randomised Controlled Trial; T2DM, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; TAM, Technology Acceptance Model; UK, United Kingdom</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12911_2016_331_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>In the file called &#x02018;Additional File 1&#x02019; can be found the study&#x02019;s &#x0201c;A feasibility study of weight loss interventions in people with diabetes Baseline Questionnaire&#x0201d;.
