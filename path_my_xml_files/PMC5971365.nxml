Using the 3-point responder definition, the odds of clinically meaningful improvement on the SDMT were significantly higher with daclizumab beta compared with IM IFN beta-1a at weeks 96 and 144, and the odds of clinically meaningful worsening were significantly lower at weeks 24, 72, and 96. Using the 4-point responder definition, the odds of clinically meaningful improvement on the SDMT were significantly higher with daclizumab beta compared with IM IFN beta-1a at weeks 96 and 144, and the odds of clinically meaningful worsening were significantly lower at week 24. These results provide evidence of not only a statistically significant benefit of daclizumab beta compared with IM IFN beta-1a in raw SDMT scores but also a clinically meaningful benefit in performance tied to a measurable functional deficit, highlighting the importance of these findings from a clinical perspective.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>It is interesting that there was greater observed reduction in relapses in the daclizumab beta group compared with the IM IFN beta-1a group by 12&#x02009;weeks in DECIDE,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> while the statistically significant effect on the SDMT occurred much later, at the 96-week time point. A delay between reduced inflammatory activity and benefits as measured on a neuroperformance scale such as the SDMT may be related to the time necessary for tissue repair, possibly including partial remyelination, neuronal functional recovery, synaptic reconstitution, and so on. Furthermore, the time course of these functional reparative events might reflect the volume of inflamed brain tissue and the locations of the active area of inflammation responding to daclizumab therapy. Over the course of 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;years, these anti-inflammatory and remyelination effects could conceivably protect against neurodegeneration. SDMT is robustly correlated with deep gray matter volume in MS,<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and recently, changes in SDMT over 3&#x02009;years were found to be correlated with preserved morphology of the anterior and dorsal aspects of the thalamus.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> It remains to be seen how changes in SDMT correlate with MRI variables in this phase III study.</p><p>The positive changes in SDMT scores seen in our study represent small, if statistically significant effects. By comparison, the magnitude of improvement was much larger in a retrospective analysis of SDMT when used to screen for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy during the reintroduction of natalizumab (STRATA).<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The studies differ in many respects, not the least of which is that herein SDMT was administered every 24&#x02009;weeks, whereas in STRATA, patients took the test every 4&#x02009;weeks. STRATA was also an uncontrolled open-label extension study in which patients had been receiving therapy for a duration longer than 96&#x02009;weeks. Furthermore, the primary purpose of the retrospective analysis of the STRATA neuropsychology data was to assess the reliability of monthly administrations of SDMT and the MS Neuropsychological Questionnaire<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> over a 48-week period. Frequent administrations of the SDMT are suitable to assess reliability but may not be suitable to evaluate treatment effects, as practice and training effects would be magnified with monthly administrations of the SDMT.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> The difference in practice effect between monthly versus 24-week intervals is unknown and may explain this difference.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Moreover, practice and training effects were controlled for in DECIDE through the use of a two-arm design to answer the question of relative effects between two treatments.</p><p>There are several limitations of this analysis that must be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. First, DECIDE was not powered to study the effects of daclizumab beta on cognitive function; the primary and secondary objectives of the study were to examine the effect of daclizumab beta on clinical endpoints (relapse and disability progression) and MRI endpoints (number of new or newly enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions).<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> That said, the large sample size was more than adequate to determine a small but reliable effect. Second, the linear mixed-model approach used to analyze change from baseline in SDMT score<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> was not pre-planned and was used because it is less sensitive to bias related to unequal dropout rates in the treatment groups. Third, although the result at week 144 appears to substantiate the findings of the pre-planned 96-week tertiary outcome analysis, only a small subset of patients completed 144&#x02009;weeks of treatment due to study design (i.e. because the end of study visit occurred for each patient either at week 144 or when the last patient enrolled had completed the week 96 visit, whichever was sooner), thereby introducing the potential for selection bias. Finally, the SDMT does not provide an exhaustive assessment of cognitive function; rather, it is used to assess a relatively narrow range of cognitive ability, even if processing speed impairment is known to be very relevant to disability in MS. The effects of daclizumab beta on SDMT scores at week 96 are complemented by a similar effect on the PASAT-3,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> but a fuller understanding of the impact of daclizumab beta treatment on cognitive function in patients with RRMS requires a more comprehensive test battery.</p><p>In summary, daclizumab beta demonstrated a benefit on one sphere of cognitive function as measured by the SDMT. In addition to improvements in traditional MS clinical and MRI outcomes,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1352458517707345" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> these findings suggest that daclizumab beta provides superior benefits over IM IFN beta-1a on cognitive outcomes, which may increase over time. These benefits may have implications for patients&#x02019; psychological, social, and occupational functioning and may contribute to improved quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Karyn Myers from Excel Scientific Solutions wrote the first draft of the manuscript based on input from authors, and Elizabeth Cassell from Excel Scientific Solutions copyedited and styled the manuscript per journal requirements.
