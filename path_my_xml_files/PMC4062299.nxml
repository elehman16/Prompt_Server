A UK-based study reported substantial improvements in the physical function sub-scale of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) at 8 weeks and 6 months, after a 6-week intervention involving a self-help rehabilitation manual.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The PRaCTICaL study of nurse-led follow-up after hospital discharge showed no substantial benefit of a self-directed, manual-based, physical rehabilitation programme on quality-of-life (SF-36) at 12-months.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In an Australian setting, an 8-week home-based physical rehabilitation programme demonstrated no substantial benefit for SF-36 physical function score or 6-min walk test distance at 8 or 26 weeks.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Similarly, a recent pilot trial of 12 weeks of home-based rehabilitation via telemedicine reported comparable substantial improvements in both control and intervention groups on the timed up and go test (an objective measure of ambulation ability).<sup><xref rid="AEU051C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Clearly, evidence for the effectiveness of interventions for survivors of critical illness after hospital discharge is limited. No studies have examined the effect of a supervised, hospital-based, aerobic training intervention on a precise, objective marker of aerobic fitness. The anaerobic threshold derived from cardiopulmonary exercise testing represents a salient primary outcome in this regard, as a marker of cardiorespiratory health reflecting the ability to carry out activities of daily living or prolonged exercise without undue fatigue.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="AEU051C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>The aim of this study, therefore, was to explore the effectiveness of a supervised, hospital-based aerobic exercise-training intervention on the anaerobic threshold and quality-of-life in ICU survivors.

Eligible patients were aged 18&#x02013;65 yr, had received a minimum of 3 days of ventilator support (for the emergency management of trauma or sepsis), and had been discharged home within 6 months of hospital admission. The study exclusion criteria were the inability to climb a flight of stairs, enrolment in another rehabilitation programme, and medical contraindication to cardiopulmonary exercise testing.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Patients were recruited either before discharge from hospital or in the ICU follow-up clinic. Eligible patients providing written informed consent were enrolled in the study 8&#x02013;16 weeks after leaving hospital. This time window was deliberately broad to maximize recruitment. The trial was approved by the Newcastle and North Tyneside 1 Research Ethics Committee on January 16, 2008 (ref.: 07/H0906/137) and registered with Current Controlled Trials (ref.: ISRCTN65176374).</p><p>Given that this was an exploratory trial, a formal sample size estimation is not presented herein.

Allocation was concealed from those assessing eligibility and recruiting patients, with eligible patients allocated remotely via e-mail by the trial statistician. Importantly, the research nurses in charge of recruitment were unaware of the specific minimization factors being used and so could not deduce future group assignments by keeping track of the past-allocations to control or intervention groups. Minimization was performed using the Minim software<sup><xref rid="AEU051C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> with a 1:1 allocation ratio and equal weighting for the three minimization factors. Participants could not be blinded to the group assignment, but outcome assessors were.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>The exercise intervention consisted of two hospital-based, physiotherapist-led supervised sessions per week. Participants were encouraged to add one unsupervised session each week of the same duration and intensity (e.g. a 30-min walk at a moderate pace). During the supervised sessions, participants exercised individually or in pairs for 40 min (including 5 min each of warm-up and cool-down) on a cycle ergometer (Life Fitness C Series C9i/C7i Exercise Bike, Life Fitness, Ely, UK). The exercise intensity was equivalent to levels 12&#x02013;14 on the 6&#x02013;20-point Borg scale of perceived exertion.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This intensity corresponds to moderate exercise, in which participants feel that the exertion is &#x02018;somewhat hard&#x02019;, and closely approximates the intensity at the anaerobic threshold.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The pedal resistance was increased progressively over the course of the intervention in line with improvements in fitness to maintain the same relative intensity (perceived exertion) throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcomes were the relative oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold (assessed during a cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle ergometer) and health-related quality-of-life using the SF-36 (version 2, UK norm-based) physical function and mental health sub-scales.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Of these, we define the anaerobic threshold as the outcome of main interest and importance, as it is a precise objective measure free from the threat of &#x02018;ascertainment bias&#x02019; inherent in patient-reported outcomes. Data were collected after group allocation (before the start of the intervention period: baseline), at Week 9 (after the 8-week intervention), and at 26 weeks after randomization (18 weeks after the end of the intervention period). The time point of primary interest was Week 9. Baseline measures were secured 8 and 16 weeks post-hospital discharge.</p><p>Secondary outcomes secured at each time point were peak oxygen uptake, additional quality-of-life measures using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) index (UK time trade-off value set) and 100 mm visual analogue scale,<sup><xref rid="AEU051C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and mood disorder using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Also, at the time of recruitment to the study, participants were asked to estimate their pre-morbid quality-of-life using the SF-36 instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Cardiopulmonary exercise tests</title><p>The cardiopulmonary exercise tests were conducted on a cycle ergometer (Lode Corrival; BV Medical Technology, Groningen, The Netherlands) using the MedGraphics Ultima gas exchange system (Tewkesbury, UK), according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The participants performed 3 min of unloaded cycling at 60 rpm, after 3 min of resting habituation on the cycle ergometer. The pedal resistance was then increased steadily to increase the workload at between 10 and 20 W per minute, with the aim of attaining the participant's predicted maximum exercise level in &#x0223c;10 min. Participants exercised to volitional exhaustion.</p><p>The anaerobic threshold (V-slope method<sup><xref rid="AEU051C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>) and peak oxygen uptake were read independently from each test by two investigators (G.D. and S.J.H.). When there was disagreement, the readers examined the test output in detail together and reached a consensus. The graphs of VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> against time were first examined to confirm that the VCO<sub>2</sub> was consistently less than the VO<sub>2</sub> before the start of exercise. If not, the participant was judged to have been hyperventilating before the start of exercise. In these circumstances. the observed anaerobic threshold is an artifactually low pseudo-threshold<sup><xref rid="AEU051C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and was therefore recorded as &#x02018;indeterminate&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The effect of the intervention was evaluated using an analysis of covariance (multiple regression) model. The Week 9 or 26 outcome was the dependent variable and trial arm (intervention and control) was the independent variable.

This model provides the difference between groups for the outcome in question, accounting appropriately for any chance imbalance between arms at baseline.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The minimization factors (age, sex, and cause of entry to ICU) must be included as covariates in the analysis for valid estimation of the intervention effect.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> It is also recommended that the study site be included in the analysis as a fixed effect, as ignoring site differences results in less precise estimates of the intervention effect (wider confidence intervals).<sup><xref rid="AEU051C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> For the physical function outcome, baseline mental health score was included as an additional covariate, as mental health is a non-specific predictor of outcome in this context.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="AEU051C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> That is, poorer mental health is associated with worse physical function in both groups, and by chance baseline mental health was higher in the control group; Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="AEU051TB1">1</xref>.

At Week 26 the mean difference between groups for physical function was negligible.

Again, the uncertainty revealed by the confidence interval indicates that the likely range for the true population effect on mental health at this time point is from trivial negative to moderate beneficial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our main finding is that the intervention resulted in a small beneficial effect on physical fitness (anaerobic threshold) at 9 weeks. The minimum clinically important difference for the anaerobic threshold has yet to be firmly established, but we believe that an increase of this magnitude is a clinically meaningful effect. It appears that the exercise-training programme was sufficient to accelerate the natural recovery process in the short term and superimpose a beneficial physiological adaptation in the intervention group <italic>vs</italic> controls. This finding contrasts with a recent trial in which no substantial benefit was observed for 6-min walk test distance after a home-based endurance and strength training intervention.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Plausible explanations for this difference in results include possibly greater compliance with the intervention and a higher overall intensity of exercise training in our study. It should be noted that the focus of the intervention in the Elliott and colleagues<sup><xref rid="AEU051C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> study was to optimize functional recovery during the first few months after a critical illness, as participants were recruited&#x02014;and baseline outcome measures secured&#x02014;within 1 week of hospital discharge. This time frame contrasts markedly with that in the current study and presents a competing hypothesis for the differences in findings.</p><p>The small benefit for anaerobic threshold was not sustained at Week 26. The data suggest that after stopping the intervention at Week 9 the control group essentially caught up with the physical fitness levels of the intervention group, with the latter maintaining their Week 9 fitness. This effect can be seen from the mean anaerobic threshold values in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="AEU051TB2">2</xref> for Week 26; the control group mean is 12.1 ml O<sub>2</sub> kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
<italic>vs</italic> 12.7 ml O<sub>2</sub> kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the intervention group. A larger trial, with precise objective monitoring of 24-7 physical activity energy expenditure, is required to define and explain any longer term effect of the intervention.</p><p>For self-reported physical function, there was a suggestion of a potential small beneficial effect at Week 9, consistent with the small benefit for objectively measured physical fitness; however, our exploratory study was not large enough to define this effect precisely, with a wide confidence interval around the mean observed effect. Again, this possible benefit was not apparent at Week 26, with similar mean physical function scores in both groups. This finding provides further support for our contention that the intervention is of most benefit for physical fitness/function in the short term, accelerating the natural recovery process; by Week 26 the groups are essentially equivalent as natural recovery prevails.</p><p>Our results revealed the importance of adjusting for any group differences in mental health when evaluating the effect of interventions on self-reported physical function. It has been shown that patients with worse mental health report more physical limitations, even after adjustment for objectively measured physical function.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Failure to adjust for the substantially higher baseline mental health score observed in the control group would bias the effect on physical function in favour of the control group, thus masking the true effect of the intervention. Indeed, re-running the analysis without baseline mental health as a covariate reduced the mean effect on self-reported physical function (intervention minus control) from a possibly small beneficial effect of 3.4 units (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="AEU051TB2">2</xref>) to a trivial 1.1 units. We, therefore, urge investigators to account for self-reported mental health when comparing groups for self-reported physical function.</p><p>Interestingly, there was a suggestion of a potential small beneficial effect for self-reported mental health at Week 26, though again this effect was not precisely defined, as indicated by the relatively wide confidence limits. The intervention was stopped at Week 9, at which point there was apparently no substantial benefit for mental health. Complexity theory indicates that we should not expect the effects of interventions to be immediate or linear.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Indeed, beneficial effects on mental health might not manifest until the participants are no longer frequenting the clinical hospital setting in which they experienced their ICU stay. Further investigation of this potential &#x02018;delayed effect&#x02019; of the intervention on mental health is warranted in a large definitive trial.</p><p>Comparing our quality-of-life findings with previous trials is difficult because of different methods and follow-up durations. Only one trial has shown substantial improvements in self-reported physical function, observed at 8 weeks and 6 months.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, in that study it appears that pre-intervention physical function was not assessed and the equivalence of the groups at baseline is therefore unknown, potentially confounding the results.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge limitations to our study. First, this is an exploratory trial and the sample size is small leading to imprecision in estimation of some of the intervention effects. Secondly, there were substantial missing data. For the variable of primary interest (anaerobic threshold) at the Week 9 time point, follow-up data were available for 30 of 59 patients. Some of this loss to follow-up was beyond our control, including withdrawals before the start of the intervention, return to work, and morbidity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="AEU051F1">1</xref>). However, a substantial proportion of Week 9 follow-up data (<italic>n</italic>=9 patients) was lost because of an indeterminate measure of anaerobic threshold (see Methods section). The anaerobic threshold was also indeterminate at baseline for a small number of patients. This phenomenon occurred because of hyperventilation pre-test, likely consequent to anxiety and/or poor accommodation to the mouthpiece. We might, therefore, have underestimated the amount of habituation required to stabilize the pre-test respiratory exchange ratio below unity in this patient population. Thirdly, there was no specific psychological or cognitive component to the intervention. Subject to feasibility and cost-effectiveness concerns, multicomponent interventions involving cognitive, physical, and functional training might be effective for targeting the post-intensive care syndrome broadly.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Fourthly, our eligibility criteria restricted the sample to patients admitted to the ICU with either sepsis or trauma. The effect of our intervention on a more diverse critical illness population is unknown and should be examined in a definitive trial. Fifthly, partly attributable to our eligibility criteria, our sample is relatively young compared with the general mean age of patients admitted to ICU of 61 yr.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The effect of our intervention&#x02014;and compliance to it&#x02014;in an older patient population is uncertain, and should also be evaluated in a definitive trial. Sixthly, the exercise intensity was prescribed using the patients' perceived exertion. Although the rating of perceived exertion and physiological measures of exercise intensity are strongly correlated, and the rating of 12&#x02013;14 adopted in the current study is broadly coincident with the intensity at the anaerobic threshold,<sup><xref rid="AEU051C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="AEU051C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> patients might have been exercising below, at, or less likely above this threshold. Future studies should seek to confirm the fidelity of the exercise intervention using objective physiological measures in addition to ratings of perceived exertion. Seventhly, there were small-moderate chance imbalances between groups at baseline for the ICNARC physiology score and total hospital length of stay. However, these variables were not included as covariates in the analysis as neither was predictive of any of the outcomes. The fact that these variables are not prognostic is possibly because patients discharged from hospital are at a broadly similar level of recovery irrespective of how sick they were to begin with (ICNARC) or their total length of stay. Finally, we acknowledge that there are many other potentially relevant outcome variables useful in determining functional recovery from critical illness, and these must be considered for any future definitive trial. For example, with 10&#x02013;12 days of artificial ventilation, it is likely that a substantial proportion of patients would have experienced a degree of acute lung injury. Therefore, outcome data on resting and exercise respiratory parameters might be useful. Muscle strength and power would also be relevant outcomes, because of the muscle wasting consequent to critical illness.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In this regard, a more broadly focused intervention package, incorporating resistance training and aerobic training, might be more effective for functional recovery.</p><p>The intervention was well-tolerated, compliance was good, and implementing the exercise-training programme appears feasible. Further research is needed to build on the encouraging results of this exploratory trial. More sustainable fitness benefits might accrue with an intervention longer than 8 weeks. Alternatively, as the time course of adaptation in anaerobic threshold was not explored in the current study, future work should address this issue to see whether an intervention shorter than 8 weeks would be effective. Potentially, a short intervention could be delivered intermittently to maximize benefit over the longer term (e.g. 2&#x02013;4 weeks on, 2&#x02013;4 weeks off). Lower volume, higher-intensity interventions should also be explored, subject to due safety considerations in this heterogeneous patient population. The programme of research should address the level of habituation required to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in this patient population to prevent missing data for the anaerobic threshold because of pre-test hyperventilation. In addition, more work is required to help determine the optimum multicomponent intervention package (cognitive, psychological, physical, and functional) to maximize effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Finally, the current study focused exclusively on rehabilitation after hospital discharge. An emerging body of work is also examining the effectiveness of early mobilization and physical rehabilitation within the ICU<sup><xref rid="AEU051C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and research is needed to address the need for a tailored and integrated care package both pre- and post-discharge from hospital.<sup><xref rid="AEU051C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that an 8-week supervised hospital-based aerobic exercise rehabilitation programme led to a small benefit in physical fitness that accelerated the natural recovery process in the short term.
