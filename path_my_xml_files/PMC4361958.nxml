One of the problematic intraocular surgery operations for the surgeon is increasing intraocular pressure (IOP), so the elevation of IOP and controlling it in normal range is necessary.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] IOP control before, during, and after the surgery is required for anesthesia management in ophthalmic surgery and one important aim in anesthetic management during ocular surgery is to provide adequate control of IOP.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Ocular and visual function may impair postoperatively after large variations in IOP in open-system ocular surgery. Mechanical and pharmacological stress during surgery must be avoided because these procedures can contribute to an increase in IOP.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In general anesthesia in ocular surgery, short-acting anesthetic agents are commonly used.

So, this randomized controlled clinical trial was aimed to evaluate IOP change in cataract surgery patients using the combination of propofol and remifentanil or the combination of isoflurane and remifentanil and to find a technique which is associated with minimal changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized, parallel-group, double-blind clinical trial was conducted between May and December 2013, on 180 patients who were scheduled for undergoing elective cataract surgery, under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, in Faize hospital in Isfahan, Iran. Patients older than 18 years in both genders with American Society of Anesthesiologists classification I and II, without glaucoma and ophthalmic disease, no history of chronic disease, no history of surgery of the eye, no use of NSAIDs drugs up to 2 weeks before surgery were eligible. Also, patients were excluded from the study if they had known allergies; adverse reactions to any of the anesthetic agents used in the study; unstable angina or manifest congestive heart failure; if airway management was expected to be difficult. The ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all studied patients.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomly divided into four 40-member groups by Random Allocation software. Anesthesia in all patients was induced intravenously with remifentanil (1 mcg/kg), sodium thiopental (5 mg/kg) and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg). Balanced anesthesia in groups I and II was maintained using with isoflurane (1 mc/kg/min) and in groups III and IV was maintained using with propofol (100 mc/kg/min). So, patients in group I received isoflurane and infusion of remifentanil (0.1 mcg/kg/min), group II received isoflurane and normal saline, group III received propofol and infusion of remifentanil (0.1 mcg/kg/min), and patients in group IV received propofol and normal saline. Endotracheal intubation in all patients was performed with a single-lumen tube. Patients&#x02019; lungs were mechanically ventilated with the same setting during ventilation (VT, 10 mL/kg and RR, 10 min). The patients were monitored and observed using an electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial blood pressure device, and pulse oximeter. To maintain blinding, studied drugs were prepared in syringes in a double-blind fashion by a team member who was not involved in data recording and also patients were unaware of the treatment allocation.</p><p>Collected data included age, sex, weight, duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, duration of recovery, IOP, systole blood pressure (SBP) and diastole blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate which were assessed in all patients. A handheld applanation tonometer was used by an ophthalmologist to measure IOP contralateral to the operated eye. All measurements were taken singly with the patients in a horizontal position at nine predefined time points reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Time points for intraocular pressure measurement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-4-55-g001"/></table-wrap><p>All statistical analyses were done using SPSS software for Windows, version 20.

Our findings showed that IOP in patients who received propofol and remifentanil from baseline to 3 min after infusion of remifentanil was significantly lower than normal saline group. These results demonstrated that adding remifentanil to propofol was more effective than placebo or adding remifentanil to isoflurane in management of IOP in cataract surgery. Also, patients who received propofol and remifentanil were more stable than other groups in term of SBP, DBP, MAP and heart rate although there were no significant differences among groups in all time points.</p><p>It is reported that most anesthetic drugs, including i.v. anesthetics, volatile agents and muscle relaxants, reduce IOP,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but studies that have yet assessed the effect of isoflurane and propofol, both in combination with remifentanil, on IOP in humans are limited; in a study by Sch&#x000e4;fer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] 40 patients scheduled for elective cataract surgery were assessed in a prospective, randomized study to compare the effect of sevoflurane and propofol, in combination with remifentanil, on IOP. They found that during and following the induction of anesthesia, IOP was reduced in both groups, and reported IOP was significantly lower in the propofol group than in the sevoflurane group during the induction of anesthesia. Also, they concluded that in patients undergoing cataract surgery under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, anesthetic regimens with propofol as well as with sevoflurane, both combined with remifentanil, decrease IOP significantly; however, in the propofol group the decrease in IOP was significantly more pronounced than in the sevoflurane group. Similar to the results of Sch&#x000e4;fer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] study we found that IOP was reduced in both groups that received isoflurane or propofol, both in combination with remifentanil, during and following the induction of anesthesia; also, anesthetic regimens with propofol and remifentanil were better than anesthetic regimens with isoflurane and remifentanil and isoflurane or propofol both in combination with normal saline.</p><p>In another study 66 patients were randomly allocated to a maintenance anesthetic consisting of remifentanil and sevoflurane or remifentanil and propofol. IOP in this study was measured at nine predefined time points. This study showed that propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia is more effective than sevoflurane-based inhalation anesthesia in reducing IOP increase during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenberg.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Other study by Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed that propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia was superior to isoflurane inhalation anesthesia in reducing the increase in IOP during laparoscopic surgery in the Trendelenberg position. Similar to Yoo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] our results showed that propofol was superior to isoflurane inhalation anesthesia in reducing the increase in IOP during cataracts surgery. In our study like Yoo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] IOP in all studied groups decreased during cataracts surgery whereas Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that the significant increase in IOPs was observed with isoflurane anesthesia in their study. This discrepancy between studies seems to be due to the difference in the study population. Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] study conducted in young female patients with a mean age of 31 year and baseline mean of IOP found to be within the normal range in all studied patients (&#x0003c;20 mmHg). Yoo <italic>et al</italic>.'s[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] study was conducted on patients older than 60 year while studied patients in the present study were between 23 and 75 years age.</p><p>Based on the results, it can only be assumed that propofol with remifentanil may have a greater ability to alleviate adrenergic stimulation and thus maintain IOP at a lower level. The more marked and sustained decrease in IOP in the propofol group compared with the isoflurane group may be explained that propofol is better in blocking the sympathetic response during endotracheal intubation and extubation than isoflurane. However, MAP and heart rate are the only parameters for the depth of anesthesia[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and our results showed that no differences occurred among the groups for MAP but in propofol with remifentanil was more effective than other anesthetic regimens to reducing heart rate increase during cataracts surgery.</p><p>The possible main limitation of our study is that 26 patients who were allocated to study groups were exclude during the study although there were no significant differences between excluded patients and analyzed patients in any of baseline variables but decrease in the number of patients in final analyses would have been a possible cause of bias and can effect on the power of the study to clear the differences between groups.</p><p>In conclusion, results of our study show that propofol in combination with remifentanil was more effective than placebo or adding remifentanil to isoflurane in management of IOP in cataract surgery and overall the use of propofol in combination with remifentanil may be of benefit in this patient population. However, further studies are need to be done.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gainsburg</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anesthetic concerns for robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy</article-title><source>Minerva Anestesiol</source><year>2012</year><volume>78</volume><fpage>596</fpage><lpage>604</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22415437</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Molloy</surname><given-names>BL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Implications for postoperative visual loss: Steep trendelenburg position and effects on intraocular pressure</article-title><source>AANA J</source><year>2011</year><volume>79</volume><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21560974</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goepfert</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><name><surname>Ifune</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Tempelhoff</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ischemic optic neuropathy: Are we any further?</article-title><source>Curr Opin Anaesthesiol</source><year>2010</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>582</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20802327</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name><name><surname>Colyer</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lesser</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Subramanian</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after minimally invasive prostatectomy</article-title><source>J Neuroophthalmol</source><year>2007</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>285</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18090562</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bathija</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Zangwill</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinreb</surname><given-names>RN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Changing definition of glaucoma</article-title><source>J Glaucoma</source><year>1998</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>165</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9627855</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kymes</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kass</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>MO</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study Group (OHTS).
