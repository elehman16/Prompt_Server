proprioception repositioning accuracy of the knee joint and on balance in healthy
subjects. [Subjects and Methods] Sixty healthy college students and faculty members from
faculty of physical therapy, Cairo University were recruited to participate. Participants
were randomly assigned to training group (n=30) and control group (n=30). The training
group received proprioceptive training program only for the dominant leg while the control
group did not receive any kind of training. Outcome measures were twofold: (1)
proprioception repositioning accuracy quantified through the active repositioning test for
the non-dominant knee; and (2) balance stability indices determined through using Biodex
balance system. Measurements were recorded before and after 8 weeks of proprioception
training. [Results] There were significant decrease in the error of repositioning accuracy
and the stability indices including anterposterior stability index, mediolateral stability
index, and overall stability index of training group, measured post training, compared
with control group. [Conclusion] Proprioception training has significant cross training
effects on proprioception repositioning accuracy of the knee joint and on balance among
healthy subjects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cross training</kwd><kwd>Repositioning accuracy</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Proprioceptive training has been extensively investigated in multiple studies<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Proprioceptors are sensors that relay information about joint angle, muscle tension and
muscle length to the central nervous system. Proprioception is responsible for collection of
sensations regarding joint movement which is known as kinesthesia and collection of
sensation regarding joint position. The proprioceptors also contribute in controlling
posture and coordination through a complex reflex system<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioceptive disorder is
common in individuals with chronic joint instability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and in patients with severe arthritis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioception acuity becomes disrupted subsequent to any
capsulo-ligamentous injury, articular musculoskeletal injury or surgery<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive training is an essential component of rehabilitation program in order to
restore functional stability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is well
stated in literature that proprioception training decreases the incidence of injuries,
diminishes the postural sway and improves proprioception accuracy and strength in trained
subjects more than non- trained subjects<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioceptive training program is
recommended for prevention and rehabilitation of recurrent and chronic joint instability.
Moreover, it can be integrated in the regular training program<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However; joint immobilization, pain and inflammation might limit
proprioception training. Therefore; training of the contralateral unaffected limb could be a
solution. It is often claimed that unilateral strength training can induce positive effects
in the untrained limb, which is called contralateral strength training effect or cross
training<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The central nervous system
could take the pattern of motor control established through training the non-injured leg and
apply it completely to the injured leg to expedite the process of return to normalcy once
training is resumed<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The neurophysiologic
mechanisms include, but is not limited to, cross education, the increase of the neural drive
from motor cortex and the spillover to the control system of the untrained leg<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies investigated the effect of cross training on muscle strength, torque, and
dynamic balance but to the best of our knowledge, the value of cross training on
repositioning accuracy have not clearly established. The objectives of the current study was
to investigate the possible cross effects of an eight weeks proprioceptive training program
applied on healthy subjects on twofold: (1) knee joint proprioception accuracy measured
using Biodex isokinetic dynamometer and represented by active repositioning test, and (2)
balance measured using Biodex balance system and represented by three balance indices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty healthy subjects aged between 18&#x02212;30&#x02005;years were recruited to participate. Inclusion
criteria: subjects were included if they were free from any significant history of
musculoskeletal, neurological injuries, or had surgery and are willing to participate.
Exclusion criteria: subjects were excluded if they have balance or coordination disorders,
taking medication on regular basis, using tobacco, or if they suffer from any significant
complications of musculoskeletal, neurological, metabolic or vascular disorder of the lower
limbs.</p><p>This was a randomized controlled trial in which subjects were randomly assigned into
training group and control group with thirty subjects in each. The researcher randomized
participants using a computer based randomizer program. The researcher has 15&#x02005;years of
experience and was the only one responsible for training &#x00026; measurements but was not
blinded to the groups&#x02019; assignment. Proprioception accuracy and balance were measured in both
groups at baseline and after 8 weeks of training. The training group (18 male and 12 female)
received a proprioceptive training program for the dominant leg only. The control group (20
male and 10 female) did not receive any type of training. The study protocol was explained
to every participant and written informed consent was obtained. The study has been approved
by the institutional ethical review committee. The Biodex isokinetic system 3 pro (Biodex
medical systems, Shirley, NY, USA) was used for all measurements<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> It has shown good reliability and validity for measuring
position sense and torque<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Proprioception accuracy was measured through the active repositioning test for the
non-dominant joint of every subject in both groups<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was proved to be a valid and reliable test for
proprioception<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> Subjects were instructed to firstly sit on the chair of the Biodex
system with the tested knee positioned in 90&#x000b0; flexion. The target angle was set at 45&#x000b0;. The
blindfolded subjects were instructed to actively reproduce the target joint position at
45&#x000b0;<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three trials with the dominant leg
were repeated with a rest period of 30 seconds between each. The angular differences between
the target angle and the subject&#x02019;s reproduced angle (the absolute error) were recorded in
degrees. The absolute error of the target angle was calculated in degrees for each subject
before and immediately after training. The deficits in repositioning accuracy were used for
statistical analysis. Three trials were recorded.</p><p>Balance during single leg stance on the non- dominant leg was assessed by the Biodex
balance system which was proved to be a valid and reliable method for measuring balance<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Overall, anterior/posterior and
medial/lateral stability indices were measured for each subject before and immediately after
training. The ability of subjects to control the tilt angle of the system was calculated as
a deviation from the neutral position with time, as well as degrees of deviation with time.
A large deviation implies poor neuromuscular response. Three indices were electronically
generated: Overall stability index (OSI), antero/posterior stability index (APSI) and
medio/lateral stability index (MLSI). Higher value of the stability index in numbers
indicates greater challenge in stabilizing the platform. Three trials were carried out with
a rest period of one minute between trials. The averages were calculated.</p><p>Subjects in the training group received proprioceptive training for the dominant leg only,
3 times per week over a period of 8 weeks while subjects in the control group did not
receive any type of training. Rasool and George underpin the exercises that use progressive
dynamic balance exercises on a single leg to improve dynamic balance stability<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proprioceptive training program
consisted of six steps: 1. single leg standing on the dominant leg for 30 seconds with
leaning forward, backward, and to the sides with eyes opened; 2. single leg standing on the
dominant leg for 30 seconds with leaning forward, backward, and to the sides with eyes
closed; 3. single leg training on the rocker board in the antero posterior direction; 4.
single leg training on the rocker board in the mediolateral direction; 5. single leg
training on the multidirectional wobble balance board; and 6. single leg training on the
minitrampoline. Each participant was required to repeat every step once and complete all six
steps.</p><p>An independent t-test was run to establish baseline equivalency for both groups. Mixed
MANOVA was conducted to compare repositioning accuracy and stability indices of pre and post
treatment conditions within each group and between both groups. The level of significance
was set at (p&#x02264;0.05). SPSS 20.0 was the software used for all data analysis. (SPSS Inc.

training on knee proprioception accuracy and on balance in healthy subjects. The findings of
the present study showed the superiority of the training group compared with the control
group in proprioception accuracy as well as in all stability indices. Several authors have
discussed the lack of adequate proprioceptive acuity secondary to capsulo-ligamentous
injuries of different joints with subsequent alteration of joints kinematics and consequent
pathomechanics that necessitate intensive rehabilitation in order to restore adequate joint
mechanics before engaging in sports activities<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muaidi et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported significant reduction in proprioceptive acuity in
participants with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture compared with healthy
matched controls. Ellis and Rosenbaum encourraged incorporation of proprioceptive exercises
into rehabilitation programme for prevention of recurrent injuries<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The findings of the present study are in agreement with several studies aimed to improve
repositioning accuracy and decrease repositioning absolute error. Fong and Ng<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the repositioning error of the
active knee joint angle in 48 healthy subjects after Tai Chi training. Results showed
significant decrease in the repositioning error and better joint position sense. Muaidi et
al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> assured the role of long term
training in developing proprioceptive acuity. The study was conducted in a group of anterior
cruciate ligament rupture participants and matched controls. Osborne et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> studied a group of patients with ankle
sprain. Patients received 8 weeks of ankle disc training. Results showed significant
improvement in a muscle reaction time of both the experimental as well as the control ankles
which was attributed to the potential effect of cross training. The unpredicted movements
during proprioceptive training teach the body to react without having to think about these
movements. Munn et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the
cross training effect but in terms of strength. Researchers reported that the average of
strength improvement in the untrained side was approximately 7.8% of its pre-training
strength. In the current study, the percentage of change in proprioception accuracy and
balance of the untrained leg following proprioceptive training was high (42% and 38%
respectively) as compared with the pre-training level. This change could be used efficiently
in training of the unaffected limb in case of inability of the affected limb to be trained
as in cases of immobilization, acute inflammation and after surgery or injury. Moreover, in
the current study subjects were randomized and proprioception gains were compared in the
trained and untrained subjects. That randomization eliminated the potential of systematic
differences between groups secondary to allocation bias.</p><p>Multiple studies discussed the neurophysiologic explanations behind the positive cross
training effect on the untrained limb. Carroll et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> mentioned that the cross training effect can be achieved in the
contralateral homologous muscles. The effect is attributed to the increased motor neuron
output with subsequent spillover to the control system of the contralateral limb. Lee et
al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> attributed the cross training
effect to the increase of neural drive from motor cortex and cortical voluntary activation.
Hortobagyi<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that there is
possibility that cross education is mediated by cross-spinal path. Also, the contralateral
elements of the central nervous system play a functional role, through adaptation or cross
education, in affecting the motor output of the contralateral homologous muscle.</p><p>Carroll et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> pointed out the
involvement of cortical, subcortical and spinal levels in the facilitation of transfer of
strength from one side to the contralateral side. Researchers discussed the central
mechanism through the adaptations in the control system of the trained limb and the
spillover to the control system for the contralateral limb. Kofotolis and Kellis<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> emphasized the role of cross training effect
of proprioceptive training on the knee torque of the immobilized contralateral leg.</p><p>Regarding balance stability; Treleaven et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that joint position error has high positive prediction
value to determine balance disorders. Rasool and George<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> studied thirty healthy male athletes to investigate the effect of
dynamic balance training on dynamic stability. Participants received progressive one-leg
dynamic balance training. Star excursion balance test was the main outcome measure. Results
showed significant, even for a smaller extent, improvement in dynamic stability performance
in the untrained leg. Malliou et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>
studied 100 young soccer players aiming to investigate the effect of balance training on
proprioception ability and on lower limb injuries. Results showed improvement in
proprioception and significant reduction in lower limb injuries. Irrgang et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> confirmed the role of balance and
proprioceptive training to restore motor control of the lower extremities.</p><p>Limitations of this study are the lack of homogeneity of the subjects in terms of activity
level and the assessor of the outcome variables was aware of group&#x02019;s assignment.
Shortcomings also include the potential influence of participants&#x02019; motivation on the quality
of proprioceptive assessment. The assessor tried to control the influence of motivation
through verbal encouragement during testing. Future studies are warranted to explore the
effect of proprioceptive cross training in patients and after surgeries.</p><p>In conclusion, proprioceptive training for 8 weeks had significant cross effects in
improving proprioceptive accuracy and balance in healthy subjects. The proprioceptive
training program used in the current study is effective, feasible and could be considered by
clinicians to incorporate into the rehabilitation program.</p><p>The authors recommend benefiting from the new advances in robotic devices; that have
adequate sensitivity and reliability in detecting small differences in proprioceptive
acuity<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, we recommend
investigating proprioceptive acuity in different subgroups of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Contu</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cappello</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Konczak</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Preliminary analysis of non-dominant proprioceptive acuity
