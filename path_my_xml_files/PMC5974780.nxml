The World Health Organization&#x02019;s &#x02018;three-step ladder for cancer pain relief&#x02019; recommends the use of analgesics depending on the severity of pain, and the use of potent opioid analgesics is stipulated for moderate to severe pain (<xref rid="hyy038C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Potent opioid analgesics are the most effective for relieving cancer pain and can provide successful pain control (<xref rid="hyy038C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl are currently used in Japan as the Step 3 opioid analgesics (<xref rid="hyy038C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Hydromorphone is a selective &#x003bc;-opioid receptor agonist analgesic that was synthesized in Germany in the 1920s and is currently used clinically in 45 countries and regions in the world (<xref rid="hyy038C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Hydromorphone is an alternative drug for morphine (<xref rid="hyy038C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="hyy038C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), but at the time this study commenced, it was not approved for use in Japan. Options for opioid switching are limited in Japan, so a request for the development of hydromorphone was submitted by the Japanese Society for Palliative Medicine.</p><p>We conducted a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, comparative study to investigate the non-inferiority of hydromorphone tablets relative to oxycodone hydrochloride powder, and to investigate the efficacy of hydromorphone tablets in Japanese opioid-na&#x000ef;ve patients with cancer pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="hyy038s7"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This study was conducted from 2013 to 2014 as a multicenter, active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison study, enrolling 183 patients at 50 sites. The participating centers and institutes are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental File</xref>. The study was approved by the institutional review board of each study site and was conducted in compliance with ethical principles based on the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to study participation.</p><sec id="hyy038s8"><title>Participants</title><p>The study participants were cancer patients over 20 years of age receiving non-opioid analgesics for pain relief who had not used opioid analgesics within 2 weeks of registration. At registration, the average pain within the last 24 h, as measured on the visual analog scale (VAS), was required to be &#x02265;35 mm and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was required to be &#x02264;3. All patients were judged by the investigator to require treatment with potent opioid analgesics. Exclusion criteria included patients presenting with symptoms for which oxycodone or morphine are contraindicated or relatively contraindicated, patients receiving treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 days of registration, patients participating in another clinical trial within 28 days of registration, and patients with a serious hepatic, renal or respiratory disorder of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3.</p></sec><sec id="hyy038s9"><title>Study design</title><p>Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 to either hydromorphone immediate-release tablets (DS-7113b; Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) or oxycodone immediate-release powder (OxiNorm&#x000ae; Powder; Shionogi, Osaka, Japan). The computer-generated block random allocation sequence was provided by Bell Medical Solutions Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and was stratified according to history of opioid usage. A double-dummy method was employed for blinding, and patients received either hydromorphone plus placebo or a placebo tablet plus oxycodone hydrochloride powder orally four times daily for 5 days. This dosage frequency was selected based on the standard pharmacokinetic profile for immediate-release hydromorphone (i.e., onset of action in ~30 min and duration of action ~4 h) (<xref rid="hyy038C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The initial doses of hydromorphone and oxycodone hydrochloride were 4 mg/day and 10 mg/day, respectively. When a dose increase was deemed necessary during study drug administration, the dose could be increased up to the fourth dose (hydromorphone 16 mg/day, oxycodone 60 mg/day) by one step every 24 h (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="hyy038TB1">1</xref>). Treatment was switched to appropriate analgesics after completion of study drug administration and after the post-study observation. The initial 4 mg/day dosage of hydromorphone was set based on 1&#x02013;2 mg per dose as specified by the World Health Organization. The oxycodone hydrochloride powder dose used was that stipulated in the Japanese package insert for opioid-na&#x000ef;ve patients.

The level of significance used for the hypothesis test was 5% (two-sided), and the confidence interval (CI) was 95% (two-sided). SAS System Release 9.2 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Summary statistics were calculated for VAS scores at baseline, at treatment completion/discontinuation and for the change in VAS scores. For primary efficacy evaluation, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted using the baseline VAS scores as a covariate to calculate the 95% CI (two-sided) for a difference in the least squares mean in the magnitude of change in VAS scores between the hydromorphone and oxycodone groups. The numeric pain rating scale, a method widely used in clinical settings, also employs an 11-step scale. Assuming that the change between each step is equivalent to 10 mm in the VAS, the limit of non-inferiority was determined to be 10 mm and was considered a clinically acceptable difference against the oxycodone group. A sample size of 180 patients (<italic>N</italic> = 90/arm) was determined to achieve a power of at least 80% to show non-inferiority, assuming the difference in VAS change from baseline between groups was 0 mm and the standard deviation for this parameter was 22.5 mm, referring to other clinical studies in opioid-na&#x000ef;ve patients (data on file: available at <uri xlink:href="http://www.pmda.go.jp/drugs/2010/P201000027/index.html">http://www.pmda.go.jp/drugs/2010/P201000027/index.html</uri> [in Japanese]). <italic>P</italic>values and least squares means for each group were calculated.</p><p>Summary statistics were calculated for VAS scores on each evaluation day (Days 1&#x02013;6) and for changes in VAS scores between baseline and each evaluation day.

The results showed equivalent efficacy and safety between treatments. Our data demonstrate that hydromorphone immediate-release tablets can achieve clinically meaningful pain management in Japanese patients with cancer. Only opioid-na&#x000ef;ve cancer patients were included to eliminate potential bias from previous opioid analgesia.</p><p>The dosing interval of hydromorphone immediate-release tablets is reported to be ~4 h (<xref rid="hyy038C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="hyy038C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="hyy038C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), but in this double-dummy study, hydromorphone had to be administered four times daily to match the administration of oxycodone.</p><p>There was a significant improvement in sleep scores compared with baseline in both treatment groups, with no significant intergroup difference. The type and incidence of adverse events did not differ greatly from previous reports (<xref rid="hyy038C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="hyy038C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>The results of this study suggest that the analgesic effect of hydromorphone immediate-release tablets given four times daily was comparable with that of oxycodone immediate-release powder, even though, typically, the standard regimen of hydromorphone is administered every 4 h (equivalent to six doses daily). With the latter schedule, or with administration of immediate-release morphine formulations, patients must be woken for drug administration at 4-hourly intervals; patients are therefore not permitted to sleep continuously for more than 4 h. As four-times-daily hydromorphone proved non-inferior to oxycodone in the present analysis, this hydromorphone schedule may have quality-of-life advantages over conventional opioid regimens. That is, the need to interrupt night-time sleep to administer conventional opioid medication can be avoided, as can double-dosing before bedtime and the potential for overdose-related adverse events during sleep. Because of these potential benefits, four-times-daily hydromorphone may be an appropriate treatment schedule for opioid-na&#x000ef;ve patients.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. The analgesic effect was investigated only at relatively low doses because patients were opioid-na&#x000ef;ve, so the efficacy and safety of four daily doses of hydromorphone need to be confirmed in patients who switch from other opioids, and in patients who require high-dose opioids. All patients in this study were required to take a laxative and antiemetics so that it was possible to compare between groups the onset of nausea/vomiting and constipation, which are adverse drug reactions often observed with opioids (<xref rid="hyy038C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The impact of prophylactic administration of laxatives and antiemetics on opioid safety has not been specifically investigated, and the incidence and severity of nausea/vomiting and constipation observed in this study cannot be compared with other studies that did not include prophylactic antiemetics and laxatives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="hyy038s17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We verified the non-inferiority of hydromorphone given four times daily relative to oxycodone given four times daily in Japanese opioid-na&#x000ef;ve cancer patients. There were no notable intergroup differences in the incidence of adverse events or serious adverse events. The efficacy and safety of hydromorphone tablets are, therefore, comparable to those of oxycodone immediate-release powder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="ds7113-a-j301-rw_supplemental_rev3_1r_reformat.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="hyy038ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank all of the investigators at the participating centers for their contributions to this study (this information is available in Supplementary Data File 1).
