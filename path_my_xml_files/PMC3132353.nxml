The patients frequently list pain, nausea, and vomiting as their most important perioperative concern.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] With the change in the emphasis from an inpatient to outpatient hospital and office-based medical/surgical enhancement, there has been increased interest in the &#x0201c;big little problem&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] of PONV.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting have been associated for many years with the use of general anesthetics for surgical procedures. Extensive descriptions of the phenomenon were elaborated by John Snow. He suspected that movement shortly after operation may have triggered vomiting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The etiology and consequences of PONV are complex and multifactorial with patients&#x02019; medical- and surgery-related factors. A thorough understanding of these factors, as well as the neuropharmacology of multiple emetic receptors (dopaminergic, muscarinic, cholinergic, opioid, histamine, and serotonin) and physiology (cranial nerves VIII, IX, X, and gastrointestinal reflex) relating to PONV is necessary to manage PONV.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>There are at least 3 kinds of vomiting, the first of which is attributed to anesthetics, such as ether, the second to reflex responses, such as pain or ovarian surgery, and the last to opioids. Early studies reported incidence of PONV as high as 75%&#x02013;80% after opioid premedication and prolonged ether anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Over the years, numerous drugs have been used in the management of PONV. Various techniques, including olive oil and insulin glucose infusion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and addition of atropine to morphine premedication were reported to be effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Persistent nausea and vomiting may result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and delayed discharge. It can cause tension on suture lines, venous hypertension, and increased bleeding under skin flaps. It exposes the subject to increased risk of pulmonary aspiration of vomitus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Esophageal rupture, subcutaneous emphysema, and bilateral pneumothorax are additional complications. The annual cost of PONV in the United States is thought to approach a billion dollars.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>The newest class of antiemetics used for prevention and treatment of PONV are serotonin (5HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonists&#x02014;ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, and dolasetron. These antiemetics do not have the adverse effects of the older, traditional antiemetics.</p><p>The available antiemetics, such as 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists, are effective in very low doses. Thus, cost could be lowered and drug side effects prevented when given as prophylaxis, lowering the economic burden imposed due to complications and increased medical care resulting from PONV.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims</title><p>To assess the (i) efficacy of prophylactic antiemetic drug therapy, (ii) safety and benefits of using combination, and (iii) the requirement of rescue antiemetic in the postoperative period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized controlled trial was done after taking approval from the ethics committee. Written informed consent was taken from all the 100 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 and 2 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. They were then randomly divided into Group I and Group II with sealed envelope technique of 50 patients in each group. Group I received 4 mg of ondansetron intravenously (i.v.), whereas Group II received ondansetron 4 mg and dexamethasone 4 mg i.v. just before the induction of anesthesia.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Methods</title><p>A day prior to surgery, preoperative evaluation of the patients was done. Necessary preoperative investigations based on the diagnosis were done. All the patients received Tab diazepam 10 mg at night and 5 mg in the morning of surgery and also Tab ranitidine 150 mg on the night of the surgery. Patients were kept nil per oral from midnight.</p><p>After shifting the patient to the operation theatre, normal saline infusion was started. Preinduction monitors were connected, which included electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, and oxygen saturation through pulse oxymetry. The patients were then given study medication based on groups they belonged</p><p>The patients were then preoxygenated for 3 min and premedicated with 0.2 mg/kg of midazolam and 1 mg/kg of pethidine. Anesthesia was then induced with inj thiopental sodium to the loss of eyelash reflex neuromuscular blockade achieved, which was achieved with inj vecuronium, 0.1 mg/kg after 3 min of assisted ventilation, endotracheal intubation was done with an appropriate-sized endotracheal tube. General anesthesia was maintained with air in oxygen and halothane 0.5%&#x02013;1% with controlled ventilation through closed circuit. Postinduction monitoring included end-tidal carbon dioxide and temperature. After completion of the surgery, the residual paralysis was antagonised with inj. neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg. The patients were then transported to the recovery room after extubation and later to the ward after confirming that there was adequate level of conciousness and intact reflexes. The incidence of PONV was recorded within the first 24 h of surgery at intervals of 0&#x02013;2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Episodes of PONV were identified by spontaneous complaints by the patients or by direct questioning.</p><p>Complete response was defined as the absence of any nausea or vomiting and no need for rescue antiemetic during the whole observation period. Rescue antiemetic was provided with inj. ondansetron 4 mg i.v. in case of patient complaining of nausea or had vomiting. Pain was measured using a 11-point numerical visual analog scale (VAS) with 0=no pain and 10 = severe pain. Rescue analgesia was provided on patients&#x02019; demand with inj. diclofenac sodium 75 mg i.m. to counter the pain. The results were analyzed statstically, evaluated, and compared between the 2 groups [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic profile of study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JETS-4-168-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Different types of surgical procedures in study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JETS-4-168-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Duration of surgery in the study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JETS-4-168-g003"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic data, type of surgery and duration of surgery among the groups are demonostrated in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> respectively.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Postoperative data</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Postoperative nausea and vomiting</title><p>PONV was present in 12 of 50 patients in Group I, whereas 4 of 50 patients had PONV in Group II.

The incidence of PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopy ranges from 40% to 75%. It is the one of the most important factors that determines the length of hospital stay after ambulatory anesthesia. In fact its contribution to patient dissatisfaction is such that over 70% of patients considered avoidance of PONV to be very important.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Numerous factors can affect PONV, such as age, gender, obesity, motion sickness, history of PONV, duration of the procedure, anesthetic technique, use of opioids, and pain. In our study, the majority of these factors (age, gender, weight, duration of the procedure, anesthetic technique, and medication) were not significant among both the study groups.</p><p>The selection of drug dosages was based on the previous work that demonstrated that these doses were effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Ondansetron, a selective 5 HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, has been shown to be effective in the prevention and treatment of PONV in many studies.</p><p>Role of steroids as antiemetics was established in 1980, and dexamethasone as an antiemetic was introduced later. Many studies have shown that dexamethasone alone or in combination with other antiemetics used prophylactically prevents PONV.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The mechanism of action of corticosteroids is unknown; however, there have been some suggestions, such as central/peripheral inhibition of production of 5HT, central inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins, or changes in permeability of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier to serum proteins.</p><p>It was shown that dexamethasone was most effective when adminstered at the time of induction of anesthesia. As for ondansetron, it was suggested that in operative procedures lasting more than 2 h, it might be relevant to administer the drug toward the end of the surgery as the half-life of ondansetron is approximately 3.5-4 h in adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Since the mean duration of the procedure in our study was about an hour, we assumed that the timing of antiemetic combination before induction would not affect the outcome.</p><p>A complete response to the prophylaxis of antiemetic therapy was defined as no nausea or vomiting and no need for rescue antiemetic during the 24 h observation period postoperatively. It was duly noted. In our study, the complete repsonse occurred in 76% of the cases in ondansetron group and 92% in ondansetron and dexamethasone group. This is comparable to the study conducted by Panda <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the incidence of complete response is comparable to other studies conducted by Biswas <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] in patients undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation and Elhakim <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] in pateints undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies.This may be explained due to variation in the type and duration of laparoscopic procedures in our study as compared to a single type of laparoscopic procedures in those studies.</p><p>In our study, 12 cases in Group I had complaints of PONV of which 11 cases (22%) needed rescue antiemetic. This can be compared with 4 cases (8%) in Group II who had complaints of PONV and all of them needed rescue antiemetic. The need for rescue antiemetic is more in Group I (22%) than in Group II (4%), which is comparable to a study conducted by Elhakim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, 2 patients who had been treated for PONV within the first 2 h in Group II with rescue antiemetic had persistent nausea and vomiting later on. Of the 2 cases, one required a second dose of antiemetic, whereas the other had only one episode of nausea and vomiting after treatment and did not require a repeat dose.</p><p>The incidence and severity of pain was less in Group II than in Group I. This probably reflects the strong anti-inflammatory action of dexamethasone, which has been shown to decrease postoperative pain. This is comparable to the study conducted by Elhakim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Considering the side effects profile of ondansetron and dexamethasone, both the drugs are well tolerated. A single dose of dexamethasone is considered safe. Two cases had minor side effects that included headache, heartburn, and transient chest pain. These side effects were statistically insignificant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>PONV is one of the most distressing side effects of anesthesia and surgery, which is even higher after laparoscopic surgeries. The quest for more effective antiemetic drugs without the potential for sedative or extrapyramidal side effects has led to the recent development of a relatively new class of drugs, 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists, of which ondansetron is a prototype.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Although 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists are potent antiemetics, no single drug has been successful in effectively controlling PONV. This has led to a number of studies investigating the efficacy of combination of various antiemetics with an assumption that using a combination of antiemetics acting on different receptors can further reduce the incidence of PONV.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>In our study we have compared the efficacy of ondansetron 4 mg alone with the combination of ondansetron 4 mg and dexamethasone 8 mg i.v. given prophylactically just before induction of anesthesia in adult patients undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia.</p><p>It has been concluded from this study that the combination of ondansetron 4 mg with dexamethasone 4 mg is more effective than ondansetron 4 mg alone in preventing PONV. Both the monotherapy and the combination therapy have a very good safety profile and are well tolerated among patients.
