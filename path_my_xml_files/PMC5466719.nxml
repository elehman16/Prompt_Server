Evaluations have noted that coverage of selected MNCH services to be delivered by the ASHAs is low. Reasons for low coverage are inadequate supervision and support to ASHAs apart from insufficient skills, poor quality of training, and complexity of tasks to be performed. The proposed study aims to implement and evaluate an innovative intervention based on mobile phone technology (mHealth) to improve the performance of ASHAs through better supervision and support in predominantly tribal and rural communities of Gujarat, India.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a two-arm, stratified, cluster randomized trial of 36&#x000a0;months in which the units of randomization will be Primary Health Centers (PHCs). There are 11 PHCs in each arm. The intervention is a newly built mobile phone application used in the public health system and evaluated in three ways: (1) mobile phone as a job aid to ASHAs to increase coverage of MNCH services; (2) mobile phone as a job aid to ASHAs and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) to increase coverage of care among complicated cases by facilitating referrals, if indicated and home-based care; (3) web interface as a job aid for medical officers and PHC staff to improve supervision and support to the ASHA program. Participants of the study are pregnant women, mothers, infants, ASHAs, and PHC staff.</p><p>Primary outcome measures are a composite index made of critical, proven MNCH services and the proportion of neonates who were visited by ASHAs at home within the first week of birth. Secondary outcomes include coverage of selected MNCH services and care sought by complicated cases. Outcomes will be measured by conducting household surveys at baseline and post-intervention which will be compared with usual practice in the control area, where the current level of services provided by the government will continue. The primary analysis will be intention to treat.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will help answer some critical questions about the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing an mHealth solution in an area of MNCH services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trial Registry of India, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pdf_generate.php?trialid=11820&#x00026;EncHid=&#x00026;modid=&#x00026;compid=%27,%2711820det%27">CTRI/2015/06/005847</ext-link>.

Many of the deaths can be prevented with the help of proven, cost-effective, community-based services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some of the proven maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) services include antenatal examination, supplementation of iron and folic acid during pregnancy, promotion of skilled birth attendance, home-based neonatal care, and early and exclusive breast feeding during the first 6&#x000a0;months, initiation of complementary feeding at the completion of 6&#x000a0;months, supplementation of vitamin A among infants, case management of pneumonia, and oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>To increase the coverage of proven MNCH services, a new cadre of village-based frontline workers, called the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), was created by the Government of India in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An ASHA is a native of a particular village and is selected by the village council with help of local government health staff. ASHAs are expected to be literate and to have an educational qualification of at least 8<sup>th</sup> grade. After training, an ASHA is expected to contribute 3&#x02013;5 hours every day for her activities. There is one ASHA for approximately every 1000 members of a rural population, and there were 863,503 ASHAs in India in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. ASHAs are supported and supervised by the staff of Primary Health Centers (PHCs). A PHC is an operational and administrative unit which provides curative and public health services for all of its designated villages. Each PHC has a team of two medical officers (doctors) and four to six Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) along with one Lady Health Visitor and several male multi-purpose workers. ASHAs receive a performance-based incentive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, coverage of some of the most impactful MNCH services to be delivered by ASHAs has remained low, especially in hard-to-reach tribal areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some important reasons for the suboptimal performance of the ASHA program are common implementation bottlenecks such as inadequate training leading to suboptimal skills and knowledge, along with a lack of institutional capacity leading to insufficient supervision, support, and motivation of ASHAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To overcome these problems, an mHealth-based intervention, called "ImTeCHO," was created. ImTeCHO is a mobile phone application which aims to increase the performance of the ASHAs and PHC staff by creating a platform to improve supervision, support, and motivation. Detailed information about the development and components of the ImTeCHO intervention is described in another publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this protocol is to test the effectiveness of the ImTeCHO intervention in improving coverage of proven MNCH services through a cluster randomized trial in tribal areas of Gujarat, India. The primary objective of the trial is to examine the effect of ImTeCHO in the form of job aid to ASHAs during their scheduled home visits to increase coverage of selected MNCH services provided by the ASHAs in tribal and rural areas of Gujarat, India compared to a control area where usual care will be continued. The secondary objective is to examine the effect of ImTeCHO intervention to increase coverage of care among complicated maternal, neonatal, and child cases by facilitating referrals to health facilities and managing at home for those cases that cannot be referred. Another secondary objective is to examine the effect of ImTeCHO intervention in the form of job aid to medical officers and PHC staff to improve the support and supervision of ASHAs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a two-arm, parallel, stratified cluster randomized trial in which the unit of randomization is the PHC. Because this is a complex community-based intervention, a cluster randomization is required. The ImTeCHO web interface will be primarily used by the PHC staff, including the medical officer, and other support staff; thus, using the PHC as the unit of randomization will reduce contamination between clusters. A PHC is an operational and administrative unit for providing curative and public health services for all its covered villages. Each PHC has a team of two medical officers, four to six ANMs, one Lady Health Visitor, and several male multi-purpose workers. Of the two medical officers, one has an MBBS degree and is in charge of the PHC, including clinical services. The other medical officer is usually an Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) practitioner and is involved in field-based duties. Each ANM is in charge of one subcenter which serves a population of 3000&#x02013;4000. On an average, there are 20&#x02013;25 ASHAs per PHC. There is one ASHA Facilitator for approximately every 10 ASHAs. The average size of the population per PHC is approximately 20,000 in tribal areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study will be conducted by SEWA Rural, which is a voluntary organization located in the Jhagadia block of Gujarat. SEWA Rural has been involved in health and development activities in rural, tribal areas of Gujarat, India since 1980 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The study area belongs to the tribal belt which stretches along the Satpura mountain range located along the eastern part of Gujarat. Some of the study area is covered by thick forest.

Such care will include confirming the diagnosis, encouraging referral, counseling, and administering drugs, including oral antibiotics. The ANM conducts a monthly Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) in each of her coverage villages during which she provides important MNCH services including vaccination, antenatal examination, and growth monitoring. Along with the AF, the ANM also provides supportive supervision and support to the ASHAs.

</p><p>Every ASHA is given a low-cost smartphone which will be General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)-enabled, with a multi-media feature. The mobile phone application will have the following features: home visit forms, log of case details, work log, announcements, and SMS information channel. The ASHA fills out forms on her mobile during home visits which will be sent to a server using the GPRS network. Similarly, the ANMs will be given a tablet to track high-risk cases and monitor the performance of the ASHAs. Each medical officer views a web interface which is a computer screen where organized data is available online. The ImTeCHO software organizes the data into useful information (based on predefined logic) for the PHC staff. The web interface will have features to track high-risk cases, see reports, and manage incentives and supplies. No other concomitant care and interventions, apart from that mentioned above, will be delivered by the trial team; however, other organizations cannot be prohibited from introducing new public health programs, considering the nature of the trial and implementation research.

</p><p>The same weight was given to each of the four main domains of interventions throughout the continuum of care: maternal, neonatal, young infant care, and care seeking for complications.</p><p>A composite outcome was required to reflect the effectiveness of ImTeCHO because the scope of the intervention is throughout the continuum of care including maternal, neonatal, and young infants up to 2&#x000a0;years of age. We were guided by the composite coverage index (CCI), which is now widely used to measure the coverage of key MNCH interventions and strength of the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The formula for calculating the CCI was modified to develop a modified ASHA-centric composite coverage index (MACCI) for this study to focus on (1) the coverage of MNCH interventions to be provided by the ASHAs in India, (2) the scope of the ImTeCHO intervention, and (3) the relevance in India. Subsequently, ASHA visitations during antenatal and postnatal periods, exclusive breast feeding, and care seeking to the ASHAs for maternal, neonatal, and childhood complications were included, and family planning need satisfaction was omitted from the CCI formula.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Secondary outcomes of interest</title><p>Most of the secondary outcomes of interest are coverage of proven MNCH services to be delivered or facilitated by the ASHAs throughout the continuum of care and process indicators to assess adherence to the ImTeCHO intervention.

All ASHAs in the control and intervention area will receive the refreshers' training described above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Based on the information available for a sample of the study area before baseline and earlier surveys, we assumed there will be 25 ASHAs (cluster size) in a PHC and the MACCI will be 36%. In the absence of existing information regarding the intra-class correlation, we assumed the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to be 0.02. Assuming a loss of one cluster per arm and three ASHAs per PHC, for detecting 15% absolute improvement in the MACCI in the intervention arm compared to the control arm at the endline survey with 80% power and a 5% two-sided significance level, we estimated the required sample size per arm to be 11 PHCs/clusters. Similarly, we assumed that 46% of neonates/mothers would receive at least two postnatal home visits within the first week of delivery by the ASHA in the control arm based on earlier surveys. Assuming the loss of one cluster per arm and three ASHAs per PHC, we estimated the required sample size per arm to be six PHCs/clusters for detecting 20% absolute improvement in the proportion of neonates/mothers who received at least two postnatal home visits within the first week of delivery by the ASHA in the intervention arm compared to the control arm at the endline survey with 80% power and a 5% two-sided significance level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Randomization</title><p>Stratification was done to ensure that the prevalence of primary outcomes would be similar in the intervention and control groups along with almost equal selection of PHCs from the most backward Dediyapada block. The randomization was done after a baseline survey. The allocation ratio was 1:1. The stratified randomization was performed by a statistician at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS, New Delhi) who was not involved in implementation of the intervention. The baseline variable used for stratification was the primary outcome indicator; the assessment will be described in detail in a later section. The mean value of the primary outcome indicator was used as a cut-off to divide each PHC into one of the two strata. The PHCs in each of the two strata were randomly allocated into an intervention and a control group. The randomization was done using the software <italic>nQuery</italic>. Due to the nature of the community-based intervention, blinding was not possible.

Bharuch and Narmada districts were selected because both are predominantly tribal districts with several hard-to-reach, high-priority areas identified by the state government and with proximity to the lead organization conducting this study. Those PHCs were excluded where all medical officer posts and more than 20% of posts for ASHAs were vacant at the time of initiation of the study. PHCs that had more than 10% villages without GPRS (mobile connectivity) most of the time were excluded. Although the ImTeCHO mobile application can function without a GPRS signal, the lack of this signal in large areas of intervention will affect components of the intervention to a significant extent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Recruitment of respondents, measurement of outcomes, and follow-up</title><p>Household surveys will be used for assessing the above-mentioned outcomes of interest.

This study will help answer some critical questions about the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing mHealth solution in area of MNCH. Reducing maternal, neonatal, and infant mortality is one of the Sustainable Development Goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. If ImTeCHO is found to be effective and feasible, then investment of resources at a scale for replicating this model can be justified. More research after appropriate modification to the proposed intervention will be advised if the intervention is found to be not effective and/or not feasible in real-life situations. Some of the specific areas of impact are listed below. The web interface can be easily integrated into existing medical information systems. This study and its deliverables will provide an exact road map to be followed for implementing mHealth solutions for community-based MNCH. Deliverables of this study such as mobile phone applications, implementation plan, training modules, and process indicators can be adapted in other states immediately for wider use, as these will be based on existing policies and the health system in place. The endline survey will begin in the summer of 2017, and results will be available by the end of 2017.</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Trial status</title><p>The clusters were randomized in July 2015.
