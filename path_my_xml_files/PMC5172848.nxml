An open-label (OL), single-arm, safety study preceded the trial (randomized period). Women aged 19&#x02013;49, who provided written informed consent, were screened based on medical history, physical examination, pelvic examination, colposcopy, and laboratory testing, including for HIV and STIs. Healthy, HIV-negative, nonpregnant women currently using an effective, nonvaginal contraceptive method, with a body mass index of 18&#x02013;32 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and who agreed to remain sexually abstinent from the time they were screened until they exited the study were eligible. Women who tested positive for STIs other than asymptomatic HSV-2, bacterial vaginosis or candidiasis, were ineligible.</p><p>Participants enrolled in the 6-day OL period (n = 5), who were not subsequently eligible for the randomized period, were requested to self-administer 4 g of PC-1005 vaginally, under clinical supervision, once daily at the same time (&#x000b1;5 minutes) for 3 consecutive days (days 1&#x02013;3) to collect preliminary safety data and to identify the most appropriate PK time points for the randomized period. Participants stayed overnight for 24-h PK blood draws on day 1 into day 2 and day 3 into day 4, and attended outpatient visits on days 5 and 6. Safety was assessed after each dose and at study exit (day 6).</p><p>Participants enrolled in the randomized period were to be assigned (4:1) to apply PC-1005 or placebo (hydroxyethylcellulose) gel vaginally once daily for 14 consecutive days (days 1&#x02013;14). Participants were simultaneously stratified (1:1) to a final PK/PD specimen collection time point either 4 hours (day 14) or 24 hours (day 15) after the last dose. Treatment randomization occurred in blocks of 5. At enrollment, a study nurse opened the next consecutive presealed randomization envelope indicating the randomization number and time point.

Participants were given instructions to take home that illustrated how to insert the gel properly, emphasized the importance of adhering to the dosing regimen, and reinforced the need for abstinence. Participants were instructed to save all used applicators, to document the date and time each home applicator was inserted on individual plastic bags provided by the study staff, and to return all applicators at the next study visit. Clinical and laboratory safety assessments occurred at all visits. Drug concentrations were assessed after doses 1, 8, and 14, and PD was assessed before the first and after the last dose. The first dose (day 1) was scheduled at least 7 days after enrollment, and as soon as possible after the participant's last menstrual period.

Almost all participants (13/14, PC-1005; 3/3, placebo) reported that they would be willing to use a similar gel if it effectively reduced the risk of HIV infection, and they were worried about getting HIV.

(One participant missed the 24-hour postdose CVL collection because severe weather shut down the clinic.) Anti-HIV activity was detected for 3 participants at baseline (mean EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.096 dilution), 7/7 participants at 4 hours postdose (mean EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.025 dilution, corresponding to a mean of 0.78 nM of MIV-150), and 1/6 participants at 24 hours postdose (EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.377 dilution). Anti-HPV activity was detected for 4 participants at baseline (mean EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.036 dilution), 7/7 participants at 4 hours postdose (mean EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.0002 dilution, corresponding to a mean of 67.43 ng/mL of CG), and 4/6 participants at 24 hours postdose (mean EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.029 dilution, corresponding to a mean of 212.87 ng/mL CG). In some cases, HIV or HPV infection was reduced when cells were infected in the presence of baseline CVLs compared with virus controls, which presumably reflects the endogenous activity of genital tract secretions. This endogenous activity of CVLs in microbicide trials has been described previously.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, MIV-150 and CG concentrations were correlated with each other (r = 0.956; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), with zinc concentrations (r = 0.8487, MIV-150; r = 0.9172, CG; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 for both) and with their respective antiviral activity (r = &#x02212;0.6190, MIV-150; not significant; r = &#x02212;0.9879, CG; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

CVLs obtained at 4 hours postdose demonstrated anti-HIV and anti-HPV activity in all 7 women assessed. Based on self-reports, most (14/17) participants completing the trial inserted all home doses and the majority (11/17) reported liking the gel, overall. No safety signals emerged in AEs, laboratory, or clinical parameters. As expected based on animal studies, MIV-150 was absorbed at low levels, with no drug accumulation observed in daily dosing. The lower C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values for MIV-150 on days 8 and 14 versus day 1 likely reflect the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes by MIV-150. Human CYP3A4 has been implicated in metabolism of MIV-150<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> and other NNRTIs and has been shown to be induced by the NNRTI rilpivirine.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> In addition, a similar decline of MIV-150 in plasma after MIV-150&#x02013;sustained exposure has been seen in macaque preclinical studies.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> How this may affect tissue PK and efficacy is unknown and should be explored in future studies. In addition, Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in plasma were similar before and after PC-1005 exposure. Studies in macaques indicating a similar PK profile have shown that PC-1005 affords complete protection against simian-human immunodeficiency virus-reverse transcriptase in animals challenged 8 hours after single or repeated gel application.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Eight hours of protection substantially exceeds the target product profile specifications for PC-1005, an on-demand gel used around the time of intercourse. Low systemic concentrations of MIV-150 also minimize the potential for adverse reactions.</p><p>MIV-150 and CG concentrations in CVLs collected 4 hours postdose were 300 and 10,000 times their respective EC<sub>50</sub> values, and MIV-150 tissue concentrations were 100 times and 700 times the in vitro EC<sub>90</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> values, respectively. An important advantage of this study is that antiviral activity was measured rather than estimated based on active pharmaceutical ingredient concentrations and presumed EC<sub>50</sub> values. Anti-HIV and anti-HPV activity were detected in cell-based assays demonstrating that efficacy of MIV-150 and CG is not negated by vaginal fluids. Both MIV-150 and CG in CVL had the expected EC<sub>50</sub> values (&#x0003c;2 nM for MIV-150, &#x0003c;100 ng/mL for CG).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> More MIV-150 and CG were detected in CVL samples collected 4 hours postdose than 24 hours postdose, corresponding to PC-1005's greater anti-HIV and anti-HPV activity at 4 hours. These findings mirror preclinical macaque data.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Although Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations also increased at 4 hours postdose (compared with baseline), it was not possible to demonstrate the impact of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on anti-HSV-2 activity because viral infection was blocked in baseline CVLs in the assay used (data not shown). Explant studies have shown activity of PC-1005 against HIV and HSV-2.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p><p>Safety findings from this study indicate that PC-1005 seems comparable with the extensive data available for tenofovir gel<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and early clinical data available for dapivirine (gel and IVR).<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Differences in the PK profiles (such as C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>1/2</sub>) between tenofovir, dapivirine, and MIV-150 are likely due, in part, to the much higher concentrations of tenofovir and dapivirine loaded in the respective gels (due to the higher EC<sub>50</sub> values, in the case of tenofovir, compared with MIV-150).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Unlike dapivirine, which is only active against HIV, and tenofovir, which is active against HIV and has recently been shown to prevent HSV-2,<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> PC-1005 is the only MPT that also has activity against HPV. The capacity of PC-1005 gel to block HPV is critical given that multiple strains of HPV&#x02014;including low risk types that are not included in any of the currently available vaccines&#x02014;have been shown to double HIV risk in certain settings.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p><p>Data from this first-in-human trial provide the foundation for further exploration of PC-1005 gel's safety when used over longer periods of time, multiple times per day, by sexually active women, and when used rectally. Given that more than one-third of participants recommended reducing the amount of gel delivered, future studies will need to identify an acceptable volume when the gel is used as designed: on demand in the context of sexual activity. Despite overall low levels of adherence in recent microbicide trials, there are women who achieve high rates of adherence using an on-demand regimen.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, PC-1005 vaginal gel is safe and well tolerated. CVLs collected 4 hours after dosing had anti-HIV and anti-HPV activity in cell-based assays. These promising findings warrant the further development of PC-1005 as an MPT for prevention of HIV and other STIs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to thank the women who volunteered to participate in the trial; the Alabama Microbicide Clinical Research Site team for study implementation; ICON Development Solutions for data management and analysis; Thierry Bonnaire, Radhika Menon, Arif Samad, and Samantha Seidor for manufacturing support; Keith Levendosky, Olga Mizenina, Larisa Kizima, and Aixa Rodriguez and the Teleshova Laboratory for evaluating clinical samples; Christine Mauck for her guidance on protocol development; Craig Hendrix for his advice on PK analysis; Polly Harrison, Salim Abdool Karim, Ian McGowan, Douglas Taylor, and Cynthia Woodsong for their thoughtful review of the manuscript; and Virginia Kallianes for assistance with manuscript preparation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through the U.S. Agency for International Development Award No. GPO-A-00-04-00019-00.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Presented in part at HIV Research for Prevention (HIV R4P), October 28&#x02013;31, 2014, Cape Town, South Africa, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), February 22&#x02013;25, 2016, Boston, MA.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The opinions expressed herein are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)</collab>. <source>The Gap Report</source>. <publisher-loc>Geneva, Switzerland</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>UNAIDS</publisher-name>; <year>2014</year> Available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/UNAIDS_Gap_report_en.pdf">http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/UNAIDS_Gap_report_en.pdf</ext-link>.
