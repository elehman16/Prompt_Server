Although many programmes are directed at assisting agencies to better use research, there have been few tests of the effectiveness of such programmes. This paper describes the protocol for SPIRIT (Supporting Policy In health with Research: an Intervention Trial), a trial designed to test the effectiveness of a multifaceted programme to build organisational capacity for the use of research evidence in policy and programme development. The primary aim is to determine whether SPIRIT results in an increase in the extent to which research and research expertise is sought, appraised, generated and used in the development of specific policy products produced by health policy agencies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A stepped wedge cluster randomised trial involving six health policy agencies located in Sydney, Australia. Policy agencies are the unit of randomisation and intervention. Agencies were randomly allocated to one of three start dates (steps) to receive the 1-year intervention programme, underpinned by an action framework. The SPIRIT intervention is tailored to suit the interests and needs of each agency and includes audit, feedback and goal setting; a leadership programme; staff training; the opportunity to test systems to assist in the use of research in policies; and exchange with researchers. Outcome measures will be collected at each agency every 6&#x02005;months for 30&#x02005;months (starting at the beginning of step 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval was granted by the University of Western Sydney Human Research and Ethics Committee HREC Approval H8855.

<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The target for these programmes is government agencies who develop national or regional policy and programmes rather than organisations that provide health services and clinical care. Despite the proliferation of such programmes and their cost to government, there have been few examinations of their impact on the use of research. A recent comprehensive review<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> found only five studies examining the impact of strategies to increase the use of evidence in policy and since that time, to the best of our knowledge, only one other relevant study protocol has been published.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The paucity of trials may be partly a result of the considerable challenges in evaluating the impact of strategies designed to increase the use of research in policy and programme design. Agencies involved in policy and programme development, even within health, are heterogeneous&#x02014;they will be different in remit, size, proximity to central government and in their need for and current capacity to use evidence from research. These agencies are also often complex organisational systems and may respond very differently to the same strategy programme. Effective strategies will therefore most likely be multicomponent and highly tailored to meet the needs of different agencies. Study designs will need to be capable of assessing complex interventions and of carefully measuring the context in which the programme is delivered; it is most likely that the programme will need to be delivered at the level of the health policy agency, which means a cluster design will be required. It may not be feasible to recruit and intervene with sufficient agencies to power a randomised controlled trial. A further challenge lies in the lack of established validated measures of the use of research in policy and programme development; in a trial context, an objective measure of the impact of the programme is required.</p><p>This paper describes SPIRIT (Supporting Policy In health with Research: an Intervention Trial), an evaluation of the impact of a multifaceted programme designed to build the capacity of health policy agencies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">i</xref></sup> to use research in policy and programme development. The trial is based on the SPIRIT Action Framework described in detail elsewhere; the Framework hypothesises that the use of research in policy is mediated by the <italic>capacity</italic> of the organisation to use research (including the extent to which the agency values research, has systems in place to use research and the skills of its staff). It predicts that greater capacity will lead to more <italic>research engagement actions</italic> (demonstrated by accessing and appraising existing research, generating new research and interacting with researchers) and that, in turn, more engagement actions will result in <italic>a greater use of research evidence</italic>.</p><p>SPIRIT is a stepped wedge trial evaluating a complex intervention and using an objective measure for its primary outcome. It extends previous studies which often evaluated only one strategy,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> did not use objective outcome measures<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

Our primary outcome measure is an objective assessment made by an expert panel, our secondary measures utilise self-informant or key informant reports and our process evaluation includes coded and descriptive accounts of the intervention delivery and participation made during observations of sessions, semistructured interviews and written participant feedback. We will examine these data across the components of the SPIRIT Action Framework (capacity, research engagement actions and use of research evidence); this will enable us to examine the impact of the SPIRIT intervention programme and to test the causal relationships hypothesised by the model. By <italic>capacity</italic>, we mean the extent to which the agency values research, has systems in place to use research and the skills of its staff. By <italic>research engagement actions</italic>, we mean the extent to which research is accessed, appraised and generated, and where interaction with researchers occurs, in relation to the development of a specific policy or programme document. By <italic>research use</italic>, we mean the extent to which research is sought and used in developing the policy or programme document, taking into account barriers and facilitators.</p><p>The specific aims are:</p><p><italic>Primary outcome</italic>

Two agencies are randomly assigned to each step. This design is a variation on a cross-over design where each intervention unit is measured in the control and intervention phases, except that the step wedge design involves a cross-over in one direction only. The key feature of this design is that the intervention is rolled out sequentially over a number of time periods, such that all trial units have received the intervention by the end of the trial, although the order in which they receive it is determined at random.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Outcome measures are obtained at the same time in all sites, at baseline and after implementation in each site. This design was selected in accordance with the UK Medical Research Council<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> recommendations because the intervention is delivered at the level of the health policy agency (cluster) and recruiting and intervening with a large enough number of policy agencies to power a traditional randomised controlled trial was unfeasible due to the resource-intensive nature of SPIRIT and its status as a new, untested programme.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Recruitment of health policy agencies</title><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for policy agencies were established prior to recruiting trial participants. An agency was eligible to participate in SPIRIT if: (A) a significant proportion of its work was in health policy or programme development; (B) at least 20 staff members were involved in policy or programme design, development or evaluation; and (C) it was located in Sydney (for ease of provision of the programme).</p><p>Government websites which list all New South Wales and Australian government health policy and programme agencies were used to identify potentially eligible agencies located in Sydney, New South Wales (where most of the major health policy agencies in the state are located). Information from the website of each agency was reviewed by members of the investigator team with policy experience to exclude those agencies without a significant focus on health and on policy or programme design, development or evaluation. Seventy-five agencies were classified as potentially eligible and email and/or phone contact was made with each agency to determine the number of relevant staff members. Following this step, the 16 agencies still regarded as potentially eligible were ranked to determine those with the greatest specific focus on health and the largest numbers of relevant staff. A visit was made by two of the authors (SR and NL) to the top six ranked agencies, all of whom agreed to take part. The agencies which agreed to participate in SPIRIT comprise a major centre within the New South Wales Ministry of Health and five agencies (four state and one national) that develop policy and programmes about specific aspects of health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Development of the intervention programme</title><p>The intervention programme is underpinned by the programme logic shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005293F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014005293F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The programme logic for Supporting Policy In health with Research: an Intervention Trial (SPIRIT).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005293f01"/></fig><p>The intervention was designed to be appropriate for policy agencies, taking into account that they are sophisticated, complex organisations with skilled staff and diverse policy priorities.

The CE of each participating agency was asked to nominate a senior member of staff to function as the liaison person (LP) and to be the primary point of contact for the SPIRIT team. An individual with extensive knowledge of brokering experience was appointed as the SPIRIT officer for each agency and worked with the LP to ensure that SPIRIT was provided effectively at that agency.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Timing of recruitment, intervention delivery and follow-up</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005293F2">figure 2,</xref> the SPIRIT programme runs for 12&#x02005;months in each health policy agency.

An expert panel will be assembled to assign SAGE scores on the basis of interview data and document review. At each of the six data points, agencies are asked to provide the four policy documents finalised during the past 6&#x02005;months that best represent the use of research in their policy and programme development work. The level of measurement is the policy document. Information about each document is collected via a structured qualitative interview with an individual who was heavily involved in the development of the document, nominated by the LP. The interview runs for approximately 1&#x02005;h. A separate interview is conducted for each nominated document. The domains SAGE assesses are: (A) <italic>research engagement actions</italic> (accessing research, appraising research (for quality and relevance), generating new research or analysis and interacting with researchers)&#x02014;each of these six dimensions receives a score from 0 to 9. Scores can be summed or reported separately; (B) <italic>outcome: research use</italic> (four types of research use are considered: instrumental, tactical, conceptual and imposed).

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Organisational Research Access, Culture and Leadership (ORACLe)</italic> is used to assess each agency's capacity to use research findings. ORACLe data are collected via a structured qualitative interview with a senior staff member from each agency, nominated by the agency LP. The qualitative data are transcribed and used to assign scores to seven dimensions related to an organisation's capacity to use research. Two researchers separately score the responses (0=no, 1=yes&#x02014;some or to a limited extent, 2=yes&#x02014;very much so) of each participant to the 21 questions which make up the ORACLe scale. Inter-rater reliability has thus far been high (95%). Scores for each domain and a total score are then generated using an algorithm developed via a discrete choice experiment. This experiment harnessed the views of leaders in policy and knowledge exchange on the most important agency-level factors influencing the use of evidence.</p></list-item></list></p><p>ORACLe assesses agencies across the following seven domains: (A) processes that encourage or require the examination of research in policy and programme development; (B) tools and programmes to assist leaders of the organisation to actively support the use of research in policy and programme development; (C) strategies to provide staff with training in using evidence from research in policy and in maintaining these skills; (D) organisational strategies to help staff to access existing research findings; (E) methods to generate new research evidence to inform the organisation's work; (F) methods to ensure adequate evaluations of the organisation's policies and programmes; and (G) strategies to strengthen research relationships.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>A mixed methods process evaluation is conducted in parallel with the intervention in each of the six agencies. It collects data about, and analyses the interactions between, three domains:
<list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p><italic>The delivery of the intervention</italic>, including implementation of <italic>essential elements</italic> (fidelity). All intervention sessions are observed and audio recorded by process evaluation staff. Initial essential elements (ie, aspects of each intervention component that are considered critical to its success) are identified, and codes developed to monitor their delivery descriptively and, where possible, quantitatively. Essential elements and codes are tested in the early stages of the programme delivery, refined and further tested throughout the trial. Revised elements are applied retrospectively to earlier sessions to enable comparison across intervention sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Participation in and responses to the intervention</italic>: Participation attributes are recorded during session observations, and self-report evaluation forms are used to collect feedback on the relevance, applicability and value of each intervention session from the participants&#x02019; point of view, including whether they are likely to use knowledge/skills developed in the session. Following the intervention, five to seven semi-structured interviews are conducted in each site which explore participants&#x02019; responses to the programme, including changes in relation to individual and organisational capacity to use research, research engagement actions and actual research use.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Contextual factors that might have affected the intervention and responses to it</italic>: Session observations are used to collect data on participants&#x02019; views and experiences of research use in their work. Preintervention interviews with participants explore workplace priorities and culture, how they perceive their organisations&#x02019; support for research use, the role of research within the mix of other information and any other contextual factors that affect their use of research or may affect how they will engage with and respond to the intervention, including exposure to other research use drivers.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The process evaluation will complement the outcome measures by describing how and why the intervention worked or did not work, including why the same intervention strategies may have had different effects in different contexts.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> In addition, it will aid future programme improvement by identifying beneficial design and implementation strategies and suggesting contextually responsive programme adaptation for different recipients and settings. The full protocol for the SPIRIT process evaluation is described in detail elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Cost analysis</title><p>A cost analysis is being conducted as part of SPIRIT because: the intervention will include non-market goods for which standardised cost estimates are less likely to exist. This cost analysis is conducted from the perspective of the intervention provider; detailed data on the resources used to deliver the intervention and their values are collected via interviews with central intervention staff, logging of the costs involved in hiring session facilitators, interviews with agency liaison people regarding the time taken to complete their SPIRIT tasks, recording the length of interviews, monitoring the time taken to complete the SEER online surveys and careful record keeping regarding the duration of sessions. Microcosting (a bottom-up approach methodology) is being used.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The health policy agency is the unit of randomisation and intervention in the SPIRIT trial, with two sites randomised to start the intervention at each &#x02018;step&#x02019;. The six participating agencies were each assigned a code. The list of agency codes was sent to a biostatistician who was not involved in any other aspect of the trial, who assigned each agency code a computer-generated random number sequence and resorted them. The first two agencies in the list were allocated the October 2012 start date (step 1), the second two the April 2013 start date (step 2) and the final two the October 2013 start date (step 3).</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Blinding</title><p>The SPIRIT staff and those investigators involved in delivering aspects of the intervention, by necessity, are not blind to allocation. All other investigators are blind to allocation, although analysis will need to know when sites start the intervention. They will not be informed which agencies are in the active intervention phase, and all questionnaire responses and interview records that they receive will be de-identified for individual participants. The agency allocation is concealed from those scoring SAGE and ORACLe to limit bias; this is particularly important since the intervention team cannot be blinded to the active intervention agencies.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analysis will be undertaken using generalised linear models with a link function and error distribution appropriate to the outcome measure. In each model, the intervention effect will be estimated as the difference between the postintervention and preintervention levels of the outcome after adjusting for time. The unit of analysis will be the agency for the SAGE and ORACLe outcome measures and the individual for the SEER outcome measure. Since there are too few clusters to employ either a linear mixed model or a generalised estimating equation (GEE) approach, all models will adjust for the clustering by using agency as a fixed effect.</p><p>For the study design outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005293F2">figure 2</xref> and with the assumption of an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01, a total sample size of 144 documents, 4 per site per time period, will give 89% power to detect a 1 SD difference in the mean SAGE total score at the 5% significance level.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Data management and monitoring</title><p>Data for the SEER measure are entered online by participants.
