We aimed to study whether endogenous adenosine also limits tissue injury in a human in vivo model of systemic inflammation. In addition, we studied whether subjects with the common 34C &#x0003e; T nonsense variant (rs17602729) of adenosine monophosphate deaminase (<italic>AMPD1</italic>), which predicts increased adenosine formation, have less inflammation-induced injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized double-blinded design, healthy male volunteers received 2 ng/kg E. Coli LPS intravenously with (<italic>n </italic>= 10) or without (<italic>n </italic>= 10) pretreatment with the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (4 mg/kg body weight). In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered to 10 subjects heterozygous for the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>34C &#x0003e; T variant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The increase in adenosine levels tended to be more pronounced in the subjects heterozygous for the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>34C &#x0003e; T variant (71 &#x000b1; 22%, <italic>P</italic>=0.04), compared to placebo- (59 &#x000b1; 29%, <italic>P</italic>=0.012) and caffeine-treated (53 &#x000b1; 47%, <italic>P</italic>=0.29) subjects, but this difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. Also the LPS-induced increase in circulating cytokines was similar in the LPS-placebo, LPS-caffeine and LPS-AMPD1-groups. Endotoxemia resulted in an increase in circulating plasma markers of endothelial activation [intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)], and in subclinical renal injury, measured by increased urinary excretion of tubular injury markers. The LPS-induced increase of these markers did not differ between the three groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Human experimental endotoxemia induces an increase in circulating cytokine levels and subclinical endothelial and renal injury. Although the plasma adenosine concentration is elevated during systemic inflammation, co-administration of caffeine or the presence of the 34C &#x0003e; T variant of <italic>AMPD1 </italic>does not affect the observed subclinical organ damage, suggesting that adenosine does not affect the inflammatory response and subclinical endothelial and renal injury during human experimental endotoxemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials (NCT): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00513110">NCT00513110</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome that occurs during infection, is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in non-cardiac intensive care units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. During sepsis, the initial inflammatory response can be overwhelming, leading to significant collateral damage to normal tissues.</p><p>During systemic inflammation, the extracellular concentration of the endogenous nucleoside adenosine increases rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], with concentrations increasing up to 10-fold in septic shock patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Animal studies have shown that subsequent stimulation of adenosine receptors, mainly the adenosine A<sub>2A </sub>receptor, on various immune cells potently reduces the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In humans, however, evidence that adenosine can limit the inflammatory response or prevent tissue injury is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, a genetic loss-of-function variant of the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase (<italic>AMPD1</italic>) was recently shown to improve prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], most likely because of augmented adenosine formation during ischemia in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is unknown whether subjects with this polymorphism have an altered immune response or whether these individuals are protected from inflammation-induced organ injury.</p><p>In the present study, we addressed three major questions, illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. First, does systemic inflammation induced by experimental human endotoxemia increase the circulating adenosine concentration <italic>in vivo</italic>? Second, does this enhanced increase in circulating adenosine modulate the innate immune response? Third, does this increase reduce end-organ damage? We addressed these questions in healthy volunteers after systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without concomitant administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine. In addition, we separately studied healthy volunteers with the 34C &#x0003e; T variant of the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>gene to test the third hypothesis (that is, that the inflammation-induced increase in circulating adenosine is augmented and organ damage is attenuated in these subjects).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic view of the hypothesis</bold>. During systemic inflammation, the circulating adenosine concentration increases rapidly, resulting in a negative feedback loop limiting (a) inflammation-induced cytokine release and (b) tissue injury. However, in the presence of caffeine, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, this mechanism of protection is lost and inflammation-induced tissue damage will be aggravated. In the presence of the 34C &#x0003e; T variant of the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>gene, the inflammation-induced increase in adenosine concentration is augmented, and therefore the inflammatory response and organ injury are reduced.

After the study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, 43 healthy male volunteers provided written informed consent. Since the inflammatory response that occurs in this particular model is different in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we included male subjects only. All volunteers had a normal physical examination, electrocardiography, and routine laboratory values before the start of the experiment. Since the prevalence of the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) in Caucasian and African-American individuals is approximately 15% to 20%, we screened a total of 43 individuals. After genotyping of the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>rs17602729 variant (also known as 34C &#x0003e; T and Cys12Arg), we selected 10 subjects with the heterozygous (CT) genotype. Of the remaining 33 subjects, 20 subjects (at random) were asked by an independent research nurse to participate in the study and were randomly assigned to either the control or caffeine-treated group. Since the study was double-blind, the investigators who were involved in the conduct of the study were not aware of whether the patient belonged to the AMPD1 group or the caffeine or placebo group (both without the AMPD1 polymorphism).</p><p>Volunteers were asked not to take any prescription drugs, and they refrained from caffeine intake 48 hours prior to the LPS administration. The subjects were admitted to our clinical research unit on the day of the experiment and were kept under close observation for 10 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>During the experiment, all volunteers were monitored for heart rate (electrocardiogram), blood pressure (intra-arterially), and body temperature (infrared tympanic thermometer; Sherwood Medical, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) from 2 hours before the administration of LPS until the end of the experiment (8 hours after the LPS administration). A cannula was inserted in a deep forearm vein for prehydration (1.5 L of 2.5% glucose/0.45% saline solution in the hour before LPS administration) and LPS infusion. During the first 6 hours after the LPS administration, all subjects received 150 mL/hour and, after that period until the end of the experiment, 75 mL/hour of 2.5% glucose/0.45% saline solution to ensure an optimal hydration status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>An intra-arterial cannula was placed in the a. brachialis of the non-dominant arm, into which LPS was injected at t = 0 hours. The course of symptoms (headache, nausea, shivering, and muscle and back pain) was scored on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = no symptoms, 5 = very severe symptoms), resulting in a total score of 0 to 25. Blood was collected at various time points after LPS administration. Furthermore, during the first 10 minutes of every hour after LPS administration, forearm blood flow was determined in both forearms with venous occlusion plethysmography (Filtrass; DOMED Medizintechnik GmbH, Munich, Germany) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The 20 subjects with the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>CC genotype (<italic>n </italic>= 20) received either caffeine (4 mg/kg body weight intravenously over 10 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]) or saline 10 minutes before LPS infusion. Caffeine, dosed at 4 mg/kg, has been shown to effectively antagonize the hemodynamic effects of adenosine, which are mediated by adenosine A<sub>2A </sub>receptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The 10 subjects heterozygous for the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>polymorphism (CT genotype) also received saline in a double-blinded fashion 10 minutes before LPS infusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Endotoxin</title><p>US Reference <italic>E. coli </italic>endotoxin (<italic>Escheria coli </italic>O:113; Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used in this study. Ec-5 endotoxin, supplied as a lypophilized powder, was reconstituted in 5 mL of 0.9% saline for injection and vortex-mixed for at least 10 minutes after reconstitution. The endotoxin solution was administered as an intravenous bolus injection at a dose of 2 ng/kg of body weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood collection for adenosine measurement</title><p>The circulating adenosine concentration was measured prior to and serially after the administration of LPS, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. With a special syringe system, the blood was immediately mixed with a 2.5-mL solution containing pharmacological blockers of adenosine formation, transport, and degradation immediately at the tip of the syringe.

Apparently, the systemic inflammatory response during experimental endotoxemia is sufficient to stress the body to a level that induces adenosine release. These results are in accordance with those of previous findings demonstrating increased plasma adenosine concentrations in humans with septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We found no evidence that circulating adenosine exerted immune modulatory effects or tissue-protective effects during inflammation. Pretreatment with the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine did not potentiate the inflammatory response or the inflammation-induced subclinical organ damage, suggesting that this increased adenosine concentration does not act as a negative feedback signal to temper inflammation and organ damage in this model.</p><p>Previous <italic>in vitro </italic>and animal studies have provided robust evidence that endogenous adenosine plays a pivotal role in the limitation of excessive tissue injury in situations of inflammation, mainly by activation of adenosine A<sub>2A </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In humans <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, data on the effect of inflammation on the endogenous adenosine concentration are limited to only one small study in which the plasma adenosine concentration was significantly higher in patients with septic shock compared with control patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we studied the effect of inflammation on circulating adenosine in a well-validated model of systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and used a previously described method to measure the plasma adenosine concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our results show that, during endotoxemia, the endogenous adenosine concentration increases in time, with a maximum concentration reached 2 hours after LPS administration. Recently, measuring circulating adenosine in 10 septic shock patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit, we found a median (IQR) adenosine concentration of 30.9 [24.1 to 39.8] ng/mL (BPR, NPR, PvdB, JGvdH, PS, and PP, unpublished observations). The adenosine concentration was lower in the LPS-treated volunteers, probably indicating that the less severe and shorter duration of the inflammatory response during experimental endotoxemia induces a smaller insult compared with septic shock. In addition, in septic shock patients, not only the inflammatory response but also tissue hypoperfusion may play a role in the formation of adenosine. We subsequently aimed to demonstrate that this increased circulating adenosine could act as a negative feedback molecule, which attenuates the inflammatory response and ameliorates end-organ dysfunction. To this end, subjects were pretreated with the nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] in a dose previously shown to completely block the cardiovascular effects of adenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Subjects were asked to refrain from caffeine ingestion for the 48-hour period prior to the experiment in order to reveal any effects of adenosine receptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. At the moment of LPS administration, the plasma caffeine concentration averaged 6.0 mg/L, which is a concentration previously shown to effectively antagonize adenosine receptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In more detail, we recently showed that an intravenous dose of caffeine of 4 mg/kg, similar to the dose of the present study, completely blunted ischemic preconditioning, which is mediated by adenosine receptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, our group has demonstrated, in the past, that caffeine in a plasma concentration of 5 mg/L significantly antagonizes the hemodynamic effects of adenosine administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in animal models have shown that caffeine is able to potentiate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines both <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and that caffeine exacerbates tissue injury during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast to these results, in our human endotoxemia model, caffeine did not augment the immune response nor did it increase (subclinical) organ damage. There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, endogenous adenosine may not have an important anti-inflammatory potential in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, this is not likely, given the consistent findings in animal studies and isolated cell studies and given the observation that administration of exogenous adenosine can limit the IL-6 response during human experimental endotoxemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Second, the limited increase in adenosine in our model might not be sufficient to induce significant anti-inflammatory effects. Recently, Soop and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] demonstrated that the administration of 40 &#x003bc;g/kg per minute adenosine attenuated the release of the soluble RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) but was unable to decrease the pro-inflammatory response. Unfortunately, no endogenous adenosine concentrations were measured in that study, although it was speculated that blood adenosine levels were at the submicromolar range. Finally, it needs to be realized that caffeine only blocks the adenosine A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2A</sub>, and A<sub>2B </sub>receptors in the dose we used. Therefore, stimulation of the adenosine A<sub>3 </sub>receptor, which also exerts anti-inflammatory potential, may have counteracted the pro-inflammatory effects of caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Specific adenosine subtype receptor antagonists are being developed but are not currently available for human use.</p><p>We studied the effect, in a separate group of healthy volunteers, of the common 34C &#x0003e; T variant of the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>gene on the adenosine concentration and subclinical end-organ damage during endotoxemia. In Caucasians, approximately 20% of subjects are heterozygous for this variant allele, encoding a premature stopcodon, which results in a dysfunctional enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. AMPD catalyzes the intracellular conversion of AMP into IMP (inosine monophosphate). Subjects heterozygous for this variant allele appear to have a 50% reduction in enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Interestingly, heterozygosity was recently associated with an improved cardiovascular prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease, probably because of an increased conversion of AMP into adenosine with subsequent increased adenosine concentrations and subsequent organ protection during ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Considering the beneficial cardiovascular effects of adenosine receptor stimulation in subjects with AMPD deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], we hypothesized that endotoxemia-induced adenosine formation and subsequent adenosine receptor stimulation would also be potentiated. Although the LPS-induced increase in adenosine concentrations tended to be most strongly potentiated in the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>heterozygous group (with a mean increase of 71% versus 59% and 53% in the placebo and caffeine groups, respectively), this difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, we did not observe an attenuation of organ damage in subjects heterozygous for the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>variation. A different route of adenosine formation during inflammation as compared with situations of ischemia could be an explanation. During ischemia/hypoxia, an increased intracellular degradation of ATP significantly contributes to the increase in extracellular adenosine. In this situation of increased intracellular AMP availability, a reduction of AMPD activity could have an important effect on adenosine formation. In contrast, during inflammation, the main source of adenosine formation following endotoxemia is the extracellular hydrolysis of ATP instead of an intracellular increase in AMP. Previous studies have suggested that inflammation directly leads to active release of adenine nucleosides, such as ATP, as well as passive release due to endothelial cell damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. ATP is then quickly converted into adenosine. During sepsis, tissue hypoxia will most likely also play an important role in the accumulation of adenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; however, this is unlikely during the relatively mild model of experimental endotoxemia. This could explain why the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>polymorphism did not influence the inflammation-induced increase in extracellular adenosine concentration. The lack of a significantly more pronounced increase in circulating adenosine in <italic>AMPD1 </italic>subjects may also be explained by the fact that adenosine is produced locally in the tissue and the endothelium acts as an active metabolic barrier for adenosine. Thus, circulating adenosine concentrations may not correctly reflect the inflammation-induced adenosine increase in the interstitial compartment. Pharmacological interventions, such as dipyridamole, an adenosine re-uptake inhibitor that increases the local adenosine concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], or pentoxifylline, of which the immunomodulatory effects depend on sufficient levels of adenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], may represent new therapeutic interventions to modulate the immune response.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Human experimental endotoxemia results in systemic inflammation and increases the circulating endogenous adenosine concentration. Pharmacological blockade of the adenosine receptors, however, does not augment the innate immune response or its resultant (subclinical) organ injury. In addition, organ damage is not reduced in subjects with the AMPD1 polymorphism, despite the tendency to a more pronounced LPS-induced increase in endogenous adenosine in these subjects. Given these observations, we conclude that, during human endotoxemia, endogenous adenosine does not act as a negative feedback molecule to limit the inflammatory response and subsequent tissue injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; During human experimental endotoxemia (as a model of systemic inflammation), the circulating adenosine concentration increases.</p><p>&#x02022; Blockade of the adenosine receptor with caffeine does not augment the inflammatory response or subsequent organ damage.</p><p>&#x02022; The presence of the <italic>AMPD1 </italic>polymorphism is associated with increased levels of adenosine but does not affect the inflammatory response during human experimental endotoxemia.</p><p>&#x02022; We conclude that the slight increase in endogenous adenosine that occurs during human endotoxemia is not sufficient to act as a negative feedback mechanism to control the inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AMPD1: adenosine monophosphate deaminase; ANOVA: analysis of variance; GSTA1-1: glutathione S-transferase alpha 1-1; GSTP1-1: glutathione S-transferase pi 1-1; ICAM: intercellular adhesion molecule; IL: interleukin; IL1RA: interleukin-1-receptor antagonist; IQR: interquartile range; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; TNF-&#x003b1;: tumor necrosis factor-alpha; VCAM: vascular cell adhesion molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BPR carried out the study, gathered all data, performed the statistical analysis and wrote the manuscript.
