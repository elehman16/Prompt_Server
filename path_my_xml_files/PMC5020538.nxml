The aim is to optimise drug use and dosage regimens to improve the clinical efficacy of existing antibiotics, and to reduce ecological disturbances in the normal microbiota. The clinical trial described below is one of the projects prioritized by independent experts within this assignment.</p><p>Pharyngotonsillitis is one of the most common infections in primary health care (PHC) in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and accounts for about 20&#x000a0;% of all antibiotic prescriptions within PHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The estimated number of patients in Sweden treated for pharyngotonsillitis is about 400,000 each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Streptococcus group A (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology and also the dominating reason for antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the Swedish guidelines the recommendation is to treat pharyngotonsillitis with phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) if 3&#x02013;4 Centor criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and GAS is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The recommended dose for adults is 1000&#x000a0;mg penicillin V three times daily for 10&#x000a0;days which corresponds to about 12&#x000a0;t of penicillin V each year in Sweden, calculated on the basis of adult doses. The infection is most frequent among school children and young adults, resulting in a somewhat lower total amount of consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>According to present European and American guidelines, 10&#x000a0;days penicillin treatment is generally recommended as first line treatment of streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The historical reason for 10&#x000a0;days treatment duration with penicillin is mainly to avoid serious complications like acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. These conditions are currently extremely rare in western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. According to a Cochrane report from 2012 patients recover without antibiotic therapy but treatment is sometimes advised to hasten clinical resolution and prevent suppurative sequelae, like peritonsillitis, acute otitis media or sinusitis. Clinical studies on shorter treatment duration with penicillin for streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis are encouraged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>There are few published studies comparing 10&#x000a0;days treatment duration with shorter treatment durations with penicillin V. Three studies which were published in the 1980s have been identified. Five versus 10&#x000a0;days (250&#x000a0;mg three times daily and 800&#x000a0;mg twice daily respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 7 versus 10&#x000a0;days (500&#x000a0;mg three times daily) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] were studied. All of the studies concluded that 10&#x000a0;days of treatment was preferable but in the light of current knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) the doses used in these studies were suboptimal. The effect of beta-lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the unbound drug concentration in serum (free drug time above MIC; fT&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;MIC). Usually, the target is that 95&#x02013;99&#x000a0;% of the population should achieve a fT&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;MIC of around 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% for non-severe infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], also expressed as the population target attainment for a given target. For beta-lactams a more frequent dosing is preferred and the dosing interval is more critical than the size of the dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The dosing regimen 800&#x000a0;mg four times daily provides better target attainment compared to 1000&#x000a0;mg three times daily (33&#x000a0;% fT&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;MIC compared to 25&#x000a0;% fT&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;MIC at the breakpoint MIC 0.25&#x000a0;mg/L). Our hypothesis is that the experimental dosage regimen 800&#x000a0;mg four times daily gives at least the same efficacy, possibly better patient adherence and a significantly lower total exposure.</p><p>In the present study we will examine if penicillin V given four times daily for 5&#x000a0;days is non-inferior to the currently recommended dose regimen of 10&#x000a0;days to patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by streptococcus group A. Reducing the treatment duration to 5&#x000a0;days will almost halve the consumption of penicillin V for this indication. A shorter treatment duration may potentially improve patient adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], cause less effect on the human microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] as well as lower medicinal costs for patients and community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p>The overall aim is to study if the total exposure with antibiotics can be reduced from 1000&#x000a0;mg three times daily for 10&#x000a0;days to 800&#x000a0;mg four times daily for 5&#x000a0;days when treating streptococcus group A pharyngotonsillitis with penicillin V.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>This Phase IV study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study with non-inferiority design regarding the therapeutic use of penicillin V with two parallel groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>Patients will be recruited from 17 primary health care centers (PHCC) in the counties of Sk&#x000e5;ne, Kronoberg and V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland in the southern of Sweden.

Thus, public funding is often the only option available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For the current study, funded by the Swedish government, an initial systematic review to identify knowledge gaps was performed, followed by a structured prioritizing process by independent experts, in order to select the most needed non-clinical and clinical studies.</p><p>There is currently no substantial scientific evidence to recommend less than 10&#x000a0;days treatment of penicillin V against streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis. A shorter treatment period though, with lower total antibiotic exposure, is expected to reduce the risk of ecological disturbance on the human microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and possibly improve patient adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>One possible disadvantage with a shorter treatment duration could be an increased risk for relapses, since the time with protection against a new infection is shorter. Furthermore, it could be argued that the daily dose for the 5-day treatment is slightly higher than the recommended daily dose, which may increase the risk for adverse events. However, there is extensive clinical experience of even higher doses in treatment of other infections like acute otitis media, sinusitis, and dental infection, justifying the safety profile of penicillin V also at high doses.</p><p>Overall we believe that this study, facilitated by public funding, may contribute with important knowledge and may have a substantial impact on public health. If a shorter and more potent treatment regimen is shown to be equivalent with the normal 10&#x000a0;day regimen this can imply great advantages for both patients (resistance, adverse events, adherence) and the community (resistance, drug costs).</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>Case record form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAS</term><def><p>Gtreptococcus group A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good clinical practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International conference on harmonization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIC</term><def><p>Minimum inhibitory concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MITT</term><def><p>Modified intention to treat population.
