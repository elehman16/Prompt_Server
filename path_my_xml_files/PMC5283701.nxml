The number of emergency department visits and deaths related to nonmedical use of opioids also has increased substantially over the past decade, prompting serious public health concern over recreational use of prescription opioids [<xref rid="pnw122-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pnw122-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers development of opioids formulated to deter abuse to be a high public priority [<xref rid="pnw122-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent data suggest that the introduction of abuse-deterrent opioids has been associated with less overdose and abuse [<xref rid="pnw122-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pnw122-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Hydrocodone immediate release (IR) reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 2&#x02009;hours and has a half-life of 4.0 to 4.5&#x02009;hours, requiring repeated dosing every 4 to 6&#x02009;hours for adequate management of pain [<xref rid="pnw122-B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>]. These pharmacokinetic properties may contribute to the likelihood of abuse; the quick onset of action may lead to a faster onset of pleasurable effects, and the short half-life necessitating repeated administration may promote continued use and increase positive reinforcement [<xref rid="pnw122-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several studies evaluating the abuse potential of hydrocodone IR, alone or in combination with another product, have suggested an increased drug liking and other positive effects with hydrocodone compared with placebo [<xref rid="pnw122-B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>].</p><p>A single-agent (i.e., acetaminophen- and ibuprofen-free) extended-release (ER) formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate (Teva Pharmaceuticals, Frazer, PA, USA) has been developed to provide sustained pain relief with twice-daily dosing [<xref rid="pnw122-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This formulation employs CIMA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Abuse-Deterrence Technology (ADT), a novel platform that allows for controlled release of hydrocodone over an extended period and provides resistance against rapid release of hydrocodone when tablets are comminuted (i.e., broken into small pieces by crushing, milling, grating, or grinding) and resistance against dose dumping when tablets are taken with alcohol [<xref rid="pnw122-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have found that the two most common routes of administration in the abuse of IR hydrocodone products are the oral and the intranasal routes (i.e., snorting) [<xref rid="pnw122-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pnw122-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One way individuals may abuse ER products via the oral route is by altering the formulation (i.e., cutting, chewing, or crushing) to change the rate of drug release (dose dumping) [<xref rid="pnw122-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To obtain a better understanding of the impact of a technology on a product&#x02019;s abuse potential, the properties of hydrocodone ER have been thoroughly characterized as recommended by the US FDA in in vitro (data on file, Teva Pharmaceuticals) and pharmacokinetic studies [<xref rid="pnw122-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pnw122-B18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref>]. The primary objective of the current study was to assess the abuse potential of hydrocodone ER (finely crushed and intact) administered via the oral route compared with hydrocodone IR in healthy, nondependent, recreational opioid users.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted at one study site in the United States between January 2012 and May 2012 in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline approved by the International Conference on Harmonisation and applicable national and local laws and regulations [<xref rid="pnw122-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive each of the following once via the oral route: 60&#x02009;mL of a noncarbonated flavored beverage (placebo) and 45&#x02009;mg of hydrocodone bitartrate powder (representative of hydrocodone IR) reconstituted in 60&#x02009;mL of a noncarbonated flavored beverage.

Limiting abuse is particularly important with ER formulations, as they have an increase in total drug load that may increase the potential for abuse and the risk of overdose [<xref rid="pnw122-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the abuse potential of hydrocodone ER, a novel formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate formulated with CIMA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ADT to protect against rapid release of hydrocodone when tablets are comminuted and provide resistance against dose dumping when tablets are taken with alcohol. Abuse potential after oral administration was evaluated, as this route has been shown to be the most common route of administration in the abuse of hydrocodone products [<xref rid="pnw122-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pnw122-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in nondependent, recreational opioid users, significantly lower drug liking was observed after oral administration of intact hydrocodone ER compared with hydrocodone IR based on mean E<sub>max</sub> &#x0201c;at the moment&#x0201d; drug liking over 72&#x02009;hours (53.9 vs. 85.2; <italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.001) and the Overall Drug Liking VAS 24&#x02009;hours after study drug administration (49.2 vs. 75.0; <italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.001). Although drug liking for finely crushed hydrocodone ER was significantly higher (<italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x02264;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.004) compared with that for intact hydrocodone ER, drug liking was significantly lower (<italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.001) for finely crushed hydrocodone ER compared with that of hydrocodone IR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pnw122-T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pnw122-F2">Figure 2</xref>). The outcomes for secondary measures were consistent with these results, showing that positive, negative, and sedative drug effects were diminished with intact and finely crushed hydrocodone ER tablet compared with hydrocodone IR. Pupillometry assessments confirmed that the physiologic effects of intact or crushed hydrocodone ER were significantly lower compared with those of hydrocodone IR. Significant (<italic>P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;</italic>0.05) differences in drug liking were observed after administration of placebo vs. hydrocodone IR, confirming the validity of these study findings. Significant (<italic>P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;</italic>0.05) differences in drug liking were also observed for finely crushed hydrocodone ER but not intact hydrocodone ER compared with placebo, indicating a lack of liking for hydrocodone ER when administered intact as intended.</p><p>Reductions in drug liking with ER formulations of opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydromorphone, morphine) over IR formulations have been observed in several studies evaluating abuse potential [<xref rid="pnw122-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pnw122-B25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref>]. One study using methodology similar to that of the current study compared the abuse potential of 40&#x02009;mg of IR oxycodone with 40&#x02009;mg of an encapsulated, water insoluble, highly viscous ER oral formulation of oxycodone (Remoxy<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) [<xref rid="pnw122-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Compared with peak drug liking for IR oxycodone, peak drug liking was approximately 42% lower for whole ER oxycodone and 21% lower for chewed oxycodone ER (<italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.05). In our study, peak drug liking was approximately 37% lower for intact hydrocodone ER and 21% lower for finely crushed hydrocodone ER than for hydrocodone IR (<italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.001).</p><p>In a study by Webster et al evaluating the abuse potential of different formulations of oxycodone, drug liking was lower with the intact ER formulation of oxycodone than with IR oxycodone [<xref rid="pnw122-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, when the ER oxycodone tablet was crushed, drug-liking results resembled those seen with the IR oxycodone formulation [<xref rid="pnw122-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A recently approved hydrocodone ER formulation with abuse-deterrent properties (Hysingla<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ER, Purdue Pharma, Stamford, CT) was evaluated for oral abuse potential in a study that compared pharmacodynamic parameters following administration of intact and chewed ER drug and a hydrocodone IR solution [<xref rid="pnw122-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Mean drug liking was significantly lower for both the intact and chewed ER drug compared with the hydrocodone IR solution. The present study used finely crushed tablets, which may provide a more rigorous standard for assessing abuse potential than chewing. The significantly lower drug liking with orally administered finely crushed hydrocodone ER compared with hydrocodone IR observed indicates that the CIMA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ADT platform employed in this ER formulation of hydrocodone may effectively reduce the potential for drug tampering and abuse. However, given that intact hydrocodone ER behaves much like placebo, there was a significant increase in most drug likeability and effect measures when comparing crushed to intact hydrocodone ER, suggesting that potential for abuse cannot be fully eliminated.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of hydrocodone IR and hydrocodone ER (intact and crushed) were consistent with the known profile of hydrocodone IR products and hydrocodone ER in earlier studies [<xref rid="pnw122-B18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref>]. Overall systemic exposure to hydrocodone was comparable between the treatments. The plasma concentration-time curves for intact hydrocodone ER, finely crushed hydrocodone ER, and hydrocodone IR resemble its corresponding &#x0201c;at the moment&#x0201d; drug liking over time profile. Hydrocodone ER retained some of its extended-release properties after being finely crushed, as shown by its lower C<sub>max</sub> (55%), longer t<sub>max</sub> (400%), and lower early absorption (90% during the first 0.75&#x02009;hours and 58% during the first 4&#x02009;hours) compared with those seen with hydrocodone IR.</p><p>Although this study was conducted prior to the FDA issuing recommendations on assessment of opioid abuse-deterrent potential, the design is consistent with these guidelines [<xref rid="pnw122-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as well as with previous studies of drug liking and abuse potential [<xref rid="pnw122-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pnw122-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A crossover design was employed to control for within-subject variability, and subjects were required to have a history of recreational drug abuse for eligibility. Additionally, a qualification phase was implemented to ensure the study did not enroll a substantial percentage of nonresponders (patients not able to discriminate between active drug and placebo) [<xref rid="pnw122-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pnw122-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Results from this abuse potential study are in line with results from in vitro manipulation and extraction studies and pharmacokinetic studies of hydrocodone ER, and confirm the abuse-deterrent properties of this hydrocodone ER formulation which limits rapid release of drug when finely crushed, significantly reducing drug-liking compared with hydrocodone IR. However, because these studies are typically conducted in controlled settings with small sample sizes, caution must be taken when generalizing these results to the at-risk population. A number of additional factors also may play an important role in the abuse of an opioid in the real-world setting, including cost, accessibility, mechanisms of abuse, and what other peers are abusing. As such, the FDA recommends phase IV, post-marketing studies to assess the abuse potential of a product in the community [<xref rid="pnw122-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In this study, hydrocodone ER, orally administered intact or finely crushed, and hydrocodone IR were generally well tolerated in the healthy nondependent recreational opioid users. No new safety issues associated with the use of hydrocodone ER were observed. A lower overall incidence of AEs was observed with intact hydrocodone ER (53%) compared with hydrocodone IR (79%) and finely crushed hydrocodone ER (73%).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The abuse potential with oral use, the most common route of abuse for hydrocodone products, is significantly lower for intact and finely crushed hydrocodone ER tablets developed with CIMA Abuse-Deterrence Technology compared to hydrocodone IR in non-dependent, recreational opioid users based on &#x0201c;at the moment&#x0201d; and Overall Drug Liking over 24&#x02009;hours. Positive, negative, and sedative drug effects were also diminished with intact and finely crushed hydrocodone ER tablet compared with hydrocodone IR. When administered as intended (intact orally), liking scores for hydrocodone ER were similar to those for placebo. The time course of the &#x0201c;at the moment&#x0201d; drug liking profiles for each treatment mimicked its corresponding plasma concentration-time profile. Additionally, assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters for the finely crushed hydrocodone ER tablet showed that it retained some of its ER properties. The reduced dosing frequency and lower abuse potential of this hydrocodone ER tablet may provide a much needed alternative to currently available, combination hydrocodone IR products.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Cathye Shu, MD, PhD, formerly of Teva Pharmaceuticals, for contributions to the study design and data analysis.</p><p>Funding sources: Medical writing assistance was provided by Bina J.
