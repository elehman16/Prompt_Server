Data from the run-in period were collected to test internal consistency, test&#x02013;retest reliability, convergent validity and known-groups validity of the SOBDA. Three hundred and sixty six patients were randomised 2:2:1 to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g, salmeterol 50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g or placebo, twice daily. Results from the SOBDA questionnaire, Patient Global Assessment of Change Question, modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale (mMRC), Clinician Global Impression of Dysponea Severity (CGI-S), Clinician Global Impression of Change Question and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire self-administered standardised version (CRQ-SAS) were evaluated; spirometry and safety parameters were measured. Study endpoints were selected to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal validity of the SOBDA questionnaire in relation to the clinical criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Internal consistency of the SOBDA questionnaire (Cronbach &#x003b1;) was 0.89. Test&#x02013;retest reliability (intraclass correlation) was 0.94. The SOBDA weekly scores correlated with the patient-reported and clinician-reported mMRC, CGI-S and CRQ-SAS dyspnoea domain scores (0.29, 0.24, 0.24 and &#x02013;0.68, respectively). The SOBDA weekly scores differentiated between the responders and the non-responders as rated by the patients and the clinicians. Anchor-based and supportive distribution-based analyses produced a range of the potential values for the threshold for the responders and MID.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The 13-item SOBDA questionnaire is reliable, valid and responsive to change in patients with COPD. On using anchor-based methods, the proposed responder threshold shows a &#x02212;0.1 to &#x02212;0.2 score change.

In one survey of 3000 patients with COPD, 56% were found to have breathlessness during normal physical activities and 42% reported breathlessness while doing household chores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><p>Capturing the effect of a treatment intervention on dyspnoea from the patient's perspective is therefore an important objective in order to demonstrate treatment effectiveness. While patient-reported aspects of COPD have been assessed using currently available instruments, most do not adequately address the concept of dyspnoea in patients with COPD for use in clinical trials, due to the limited assessment of psychometric properties during development of the questionnaire or inconsistent clinical validity in use. In addition, there are no currently available instruments for assessing COPD-related dyspnoea that can support a specific label claim for a medicinal product in the USA.</p><p>The Shortness of Breath with Daily Activities (SOBDA) questionnaire is a daily diary questionnaire developed to quantify a patient's perception of dyspnoea related to daily activities and how this changes over time during treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Development of the SOBDA questionnaire followed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Guidance for drug development issued by the US Food and Drug Administration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> and included the creation of an endpoint rationale and the development of a conceptual framework.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Qualitative research, including individual interviews and patient focus groups, was used to develop potential questions (item pool), item format and response options, which were subject to clinical and translation expert review. Further cognitive interviews with patients were conducted to test content validity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> The item pool was tested in a non-interventional study, and the number of items was appropriately reduced to produce the final SOBDA questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Initial psychometric validation from this non-interventional study showed excellent internal consistency and test&#x02013;retest reliability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p><p>The objectives of this study were to (1) confirm reliability and validity, (2) evaluate the responsiveness, (3) define the threshold for the responders and also the minimal important difference (MID) of the final SOBDA questionnaire in patients with COPD. The threshold for response was established by comparing the SOBDA change scores for the responders and the non-responders, defined according to a range of established patient-completed and clinician-completed assessments. The study included active treatments to ensure that some patients would be classified as &#x02018;responders&#x02019; based on the established clinical measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Male and female patients &#x02265;40&#x02005;years of age with an established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society definitions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> were recruited.

Patients attended three clinic visits. At screening visit 1, eligible patients entered a 2-week run-in period during which short-acting bronchodilator rescue medications (salbutamol and/or ipratropium) were permitted. At visit 2, eligible patients were randomised (2:2:1) to receive fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination (FSC) 250/50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g, salmeterol (SAL) 50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g or placebo, all administered twice daily via a DISKUS inhaler, for 6&#x02005;weeks. The FSC and SAL active treatments were included to potentially induce a change in the degree of the patients&#x02019; symptoms of dyspnoea, which would allow the responsiveness of the SOBDA questionnaire to be assessed. The final dose of study medication was taken on the day before visit 3 (week 6). In the event of a patient not completing the week 6 visit, attempts were made for the patient to attend an early withdrawal visit that included the week 6 assessments.</p><p>All non-COPD medications, including pre-existing selective &#x003b2;-blocker therapy, could be continued if their dose remained constant. The concurrent use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids, long-term oxygen therapy, long-acting bronchodilators and theophylline were the exclusion criteria within the study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Measurements and assessments</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Patient-completed measures: SOBDA questionnaire</title><p>The 13-item SOBDA questionnaire (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>) was completed in an electronic diary (e-diary) each evening immediately before bedtime, which allowed the patient to reflect on and capture the current day's activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>

Patients were also given an option of &#x02018;did not do&#x02019; for activities they did not perform for other reasons. In scoring the questionnaire, these responses were regarded as missing data. Owing to the design of the e-diary, it was not possible for the patients to skip individual questions within the diary, although a full day of data could be missed if the patient did not access the diary within the time window allowed.

Pearson's correlation coefficient between the baseline SOBDA weekly scores and the CRQ-SAS dyspnoea domain score at visit 2 was also assessed. Known-groups validity, demonstrating that groups of patients who are known to be different report different SOBDA scores, was assessed by comparisons of SOBDA weekly scores between groups of patients based on the mMRC (patient and clinician) ratings and CGI-S ratings collected at visit 2 using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models adjusted for age, gender and FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted measured during the screening visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2d4"><title>Responsiveness</title><p>Responsiveness of the SOBDA questionnaire was assessed by comparing score changes between the responders and the non-responders on the PGAC, CGI-C and CRQ-SAS dyspnoea domain and mMRC. Responders by PGAC and CGI-C were defined as patients with a rating of &#x02018;better&#x02019; or &#x02018;much better&#x02019;, and non-responders were defined as patients with a response of &#x02018;much worse,&#x02019; &#x02018;worse&#x02019; or &#x02018;no change&#x02019;, on their respective scales.

A responder by mMRC was defined as a patient who had a score decrease of 1&#x02005;unit or more between visit 2 and week 6/early withdrawal, and a non-responder was defined as a patient who had the same score or an increase in score.</p><p>Changes from the previous week to the current week's SOBDA score during the six-week study treatment period were compared for the responders and the non-responders (defined according to the corresponding weekly PGAC assessment) using ANCOVA, adjusted for age, gender and the baseline SOBDA weekly score. In addition, changes in the mean SOBDA scores during the last week of the treatment were compared for the responders and the non-responders based on the PGAC, CGI-C and CRQ-SAS dyspnoea domain, clinician-completed mMRC and patient-completed mMRC using ANCOVA adjusted for age, sex and the baseline SOBDA weekly score.</p></sec><sec id="s2d5"><title>Defining the threshold for SOBDA responders and MID</title><p>A preliminary MID for SOBDA mean score change within a participant was also determined. This threshold for the SOBDA response allowed a comparison of the proportions of responders in different intervention groups or treatment categories. Anchor-based methods using the PGAC, CGI-C and CRQ-SAS dyspnoea domain scores were used to establish the threshold for the SOBDA responders and the MID, by calculating SOBDA weekly change scores (for PGAC) and changes in SOBDA weekly scores from baseline to the last week of treatment (for the PGAC, CGI-C and CRQ-SAS dyspnoea domain and FEV<sub>1</sub>) in the response category or prespecified grouping of &#x02018;better&#x02019; for each anchor. Cumulative distribution plots based on these anchors were also used to determine the MID.</p><p>Post hoc supportive analyses using distribution-based approaches were also conducted after completion of the a priori specified anchor-based analyses to further supplement estimation of a responder threshold. A method described by Revicki <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> was used to estimate the response threshold by calculating 0.2 and 0.3 times the SD of the SOBDA scores at baseline.

The available questionnaires have limited assessment of the psychometric properties, inconsistent clinical validity and/or are not dyspnoea-specific. The CRQ-SAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and SGRQ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> questionnaires, for example, measure multiple dimensions that are much broader than dyspnoea with activity, which is the specific aim of the current SOBDA questionnaire. The mMRC questionnaire has been used to discriminate between levels of dyspnoea associated with exercise, but shows very limited response to change in clinical trials due to the limited number of categories for response.</p><p>This study confirms that the SOBDA questionnaire has sound psychometric properties. The SOBDA weekly scores had an internal consistency reliability of Cronbach's &#x003b1; value of 0.89, which surpassed the established threshold goal of &#x0003e;0.7.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> SOBDA also had good test&#x02013;retest reliability (ICC=0.94), exceeding the threshold goal of &#x0003e;0.60, in patients reporting no change in their breathlessness as measured by the PGAC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p><p>The convergent validity assessed through the Spearman rank order correlations was reasonable, although it was lower than expected for CGI-C and mMRC. This may have been due to the narrow range of responses given by clinicians: most patients were rated as &#x02018;2&#x02019; or &#x02018;3&#x02019; by clinicians on both scales. The narrow range of clinician mMRC ratings reflects the inclusion criteria requiring patients to have an mMRC &#x02265;2 at study entry. The CRQ-SAS dyspnoea scale, which measures the concept most similar to SOBDA, showed the highest correlation with the SOBDA questionnaire and is supportive of SOBDA's construct validity.</p><p>The SOBDA weekly scores in the study population demonstrated good known-groups validity through a series of analyses. The scores were differentiated between dyspnoea severity as rated by clinicians and patients. As expected, discrimination based on patient ratings was better than that based on clinician ratings. Known-groups validity was also confirmed when comparing SOBDA with CGI-S.</p><p>Assessment of responsiveness of the SOBDA questionnaire was conducted independent of treatment allocation. Good separation in the SOBDA weekly scores was observed between the PGAC groups at day 8 as indicated by significant differences between the scores for the responders and the non-responders. Less separation was observed between the PGAC groups throughout the later weeks of the 6-week treatment period compared with week 1. This diminished separation may be partially explained by the way the PGAC score was derived, that is, each week's PGAC score was based on scores from the previous week. This is also not an unexpected trend as any improvement in dyspnoea would be expected to occur or be perceptible to patients soon after initiating therapy, with continued improvement being less noticeable over time. The particularly diminished responsiveness observed at week 6 was potentially due to approximately half of the patients not providing a response to the PGAC at day 43 or at the last visit. Changes from baseline in the SOBDA last treatment week scores were statistically significant between responders and non-responders using the CGI-C and CRQ-SAS dyspnoea domain, but not the mMRC. This again may be due to the narrow range of the mMRC ratings.</p><p>The thresholds for the SOBDA responders and MID were explored by using anchor-based and distribution-based methods. Anchor-based methods were used to establish a preliminary MID range for SOBDA mean score changes within a patient, which would also be considered as the threshold for the SOBDA responders to allow a comparison of the proportions of responders in different categories (eg, different interventions or treatments). The evaluation of data around the MID was based on the change from the baseline in the SOBDA score for those patients who endorsed or had the clinician endorse for them, (depending on the anchor), the response category &#x02018;better&#x02019; for the global assessments or the prespecified grouping of meaningful improvement on other measures (PGAC, CGI-C, CRQ-SAS and FEV<sub>1</sub>). Based on these anchors, a preliminary response threshold for the SOBDA questionnaire is a &#x02212;0.1 to &#x02212;0.2 score change. This is further supported by distribution-based estimations of the MID using methods described by Revicki <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> and Wyrwich <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Thus, a threshold of &#x02212;0.1 to &#x02212;0.2 for the score range of 1&#x02013;4, supported by anchor-based and distribution-based methods, seems reasonable at this stage of questionnaire development. This MID estimation is also consistent in scale with that of the CRQ-SAS in which the MID is 0.5 on a 7-point Likert scale.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></p><p>Exploratory analysis by treatment group suggested that the proportion of patients crossing the &#x02212;0.1 and &#x02212;0.2 thresholds was numerically greater for the SAL group compared with the placebo, and numerically greater for the FSC group compared with the SAL group. As the study was designed only to validate SOBDA and cannot reliably demonstrate differences between treatment groups, these changes from baseline in the SOBDA weekly score at last treatment can only be regarded as exploratory. Even after adjusting for age, gender and the baseline SOBDA weekly score, the mean change in the score for each treatment group when compared with placebo did not meet the MID of &#x02212;0.1 or &#x02212;0.2.</p><p>This study had some limitations. Only patients with mMRC &#x02265;2 were included in the study, which restricted the ranges of the dyspnoea severity. The effects of exacerbation and possible cultural differences on the study results were not evaluated. Finally, approximately half of the patients did not answer the last PGAC question despite completing other final visit assessments. These limitations could have had an effect on some of the results of our study, although we do not feel that there would be any change to the overall conclusions.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that the 13-item SOBDA questionnaire is reliable, valid and responsive to change in patients with COPD. At this stage of questionnaire development, a change score of &#x02212;0.1 to &#x02212;0.2 is the most appropriate estimation for determining a threshold for treatment response. A specific value will be identified as more data are generated from future clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e226" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003048.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e227" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003048.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support in the form of copyediting, editorial suggestions to draft versions of this manuscript, assembling tables and figures, collating author comments, fact checking, referencing and graphic services was provided by Tara N Miller, PhD (Lyndhurst, New Jersey, USA), David Cutler, PhD and Lisa Moore, PhD (Macclesfield, UK) at Gardiner-Caldwell Communications.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the authors contributed to the drafting of the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all approved the final version to be published.
