Risk factors for compromised development often coexist and include inadequate cognitive stimulation, poverty, nutritional deficiencies, infection and complications of being born low birthweight and/or premature. Moreover, many of these risk factors are closely associated with newborn morbidity and mortality. As compromised development has significant implications on human capital, inexpensive and scalable interventions are urgently needed to promote neurodevelopment and reduce risk factors for impaired development.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><p>This cluster randomized trial aims at evaluating the impact of volunteer community health workers delivering either an integrated neonatal survival kit, an early stimulation package, or a combination of both interventions, to pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy, compared to the current standard of care in Kwale County, Kenya. The neonatal survival kit comprises a clean delivery kit (sterile blade, cord clamp, clean plastic sheet, surgical gloves and hand soap), sunflower oil emollient, chlorhexidine, ThermoSpot<sup>TM</sup>, Mylar infant sleeve, and a reusable instant heater. Community health workers are also equipped with a portable hand-held electric scale. The early cognitive stimulation package focuses on enhancing caregiver practices by teaching caregivers three key messages that comprise combining a gentle touch with making eye contact and talking to children, responsive feeding and caregiving, and singing. The primary outcome measure is child development at 12&#x000a0;months of age assessed with the Protocol for Child Monitoring (Infant and Toddler version). The main secondary outcome is newborn mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide evidence on effectiveness of delivering an innovative neonatal survival kit and/or early stimulation package to pregnant women in Kwale County, Kenya.

Children&#x02019;s development encompasses several interconnected domains including cognitive, language, motor, social and emotional, and adaptive behaviour. Early child development (ECD) establishes the foundation for wellbeing and productivity throughout the life-cycle. For example, early cognitive impairment is a predictor of poor educational achievements later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Children who do poorly in school are less likely to become productive adults; they are more likely to have low incomes, high fertility, and have difficulty in providing adequate care for their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, compromised development contributes to the propagation and exacerbation of poverty between generations and has implications on social equity and national development. In general, investments in women&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s health yields high rates of return in health, social and economic benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Notably, a recent economic simulation study that included 73 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) estimated that by increasing preschool enrolment, only one component of ECD, by 25&#x000a0;% and 50&#x000a0;%, a total economic benefit of $10.6 and $33.7 billion, respectively, could be achieved with a benefit-to-cost ratio of 17.6 to 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The first month of life is an important period in brain development during which there is significant neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and myelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Even small perturbations in the early developmental pathway of the brain can have long-term consequences on its strutural and functional capacity, and subsequent child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Brain development can be affected before and after delivery by both biological and psychosocial factors. Risk factors associated with compromised child development are complex and include poverty, malnutrition, infection, complications due to being born premature or with a low birthweight (LBW) and inadequate cognitive stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since exposure to multiple risk factors increases the likelihood of poor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the coexistence of factors associated with impaired development further exacerbates the problem in LMICs. The importance of promoting healthy brain development and preventing cognitive impairment in LMICs is further underscored by the absence of systems to identify and manage developmental delays soon after onset. Moreover, many risk factors for compromised development, namely infection and complications due to being born LBW and/or premature, are also closely related to newborn morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Newborn deaths account for approximately 40&#x000a0;% of all deaths in children under the age of five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and most are largely preventable. Thus, reducing the incidence of insults during the neonatal period has the potential to not only improve newborn survival but also improve long-term developmental outcomes.</p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that early interventions can help prevent or reduce the loss of developmental potential in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recent systematic review reported substantial positive effects on child development in most effectiveness studies on ECD conducted in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Interventions that target parenting and education support, preschool enrolment and programing, and improved maternal and child nutrition have each demonstrated positive effects on development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Interventions that were most effective were those that were comprehensive, engaged younger and disadvantaged children and families, were of adequate duration, intensity, and quality, and were integrated with other interventions including health, nutrition and conditional cash transfer programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Parenting interventions include promotion of stimulation through responsive and developmentally suitable caregiver-child interactions. Stimulation has been shown to have positive effects on child development in numerous effectiveness studies and can be promoted through home visits, community groups, regular clinic visits, media outlets or through a combination of delivery mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Delivery of stimulation interventions that focus on only the parent and family or on both the parent and the child has demonstrated positive effects. In rural Pakistan, children who received responsive stimulation delivered by Lady Health Workers, had significantly higher developmental scores on the cognitive, language, and motor scales at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months of age, and on the social-emotional scale at 12&#x000a0;months of age, than those who did not receive responsive stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, early stimulation among stunted children aged between 9 and 24&#x000a0;months in Kingston, Jamaica had a beneficial and sustained effect on their development at 2&#x000a0;years of age and during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite evidence on the effectiveness of stimulation interventions in early childhood, successful scale-up of programs to sustainably improve child development has been variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, there are limited data on the effect of parenting interventions that focus on the engagement of pregnant women. Inclusion of pregnant women in early stimulation interventions has shown promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and has been identified as a research area that merits further exploration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Although a relationship between newborn morbidities and impaired cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] has been established, there remains a paucity of data on how interventions, that either reduce newborn maladies or facilitate their early detection, impact child development. For example, while numerous controlled studies have reported an association between emollient therapy and reduced risk of infection, improved thermoregulation and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and reduced newborn mortality in preterm neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], neurodevelopmental outcomes have only been reported in one emollient therapy trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Of note, the study was limited to assessment of neurobehavioral aspects during the neonatal period and demonstrated no difference between intervention and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, while umbilical cord cleansing with chlorhexidine has been shown to reduce both neonatal mortality and omphalitis/infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; to the best of our knowledge, no studies have explored the effect of chlorhexidine application on developmental outcomes. While several studies have investigated the beneficial effects of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) on morbidity and mortality among LBW infants, limited data are available on the association between KMC and long-term developmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Given the link between neonatal insults and compromised development, the importance of interventions for the prevention and early detection of newborn illness goes well beyond their effect on short-term health outcomes and newborn survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Child health and development in Kenya</title><p>As is the case in most LMICs, Kenya has no data on child development. Using poverty and stunting (height-for-age z-scores below &#x02212;2 SD from the median of the reference population) as indicators of poor development, the prevalence of disadvantaged children under the age of five in Kenya in 2004 was estimated to be between 40 and 60&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Stunting in early childhood is caused by poor nutrition, which in itself is often aggravated by infection. Significant associations have also been reported between stunting and developmental delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Kenya was ranked 47<sup>th</sup> out of 136 countries with highest prevalence of stunting in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. According to the 2014 Kenyan Demographic Health Survey (KDHS), approximately 25&#x000a0;% of Kenyan children are stunted, while 8&#x000a0;% are severely stunted (height-for age z-scores are below &#x02212;3 SD from the median of the reference population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Stunting was noted to be more common among children in rural areas (29&#x000a0;%) compared to those in urban areas (20&#x000a0;%). An inverse relationship was also found between household wealth and child stunting. Stunting in Kenyan children decreases with rising household wealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In Kenya, associations between height and child development measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] as well as socioeconomic status during infancy and cognition at 5&#x000a0;years of age have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Child mortality rates provide a basic indicator of a country&#x02019;s socioeconomic level and quality of life. During the 5-year period prior to the 2014 KDHS survey, child, infant and newborn mortality rates were 52, 39 and 22 per 1000 live births, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], falling short of the country&#x02019;s Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. While Kenya has experienced a downward trend in under-5 mortality rates since 1998, newborn mortality rates have declined much more slowly. Today, newborn mortality accounts for approximately 40&#x000a0;% of all deaths within the first 5&#x000a0;years of life in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Kenyan health system</title><p>The Constitution of Kenya, 2010, created a decentralized system of governance that became operational in 2013. In the decentralized structure, selected functions including provision of health care services were devolved to 47 County level governments; County governments are responsible for health facilities, pharmacies, ambulance services, and the promotion of primary health care in their counties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Health service delivery is structured along six tiers of service provision that range from level-1 (community) to level-6 (tertiary referral facilities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Community-based health services, which comprise basic promotive, preventive and simple curative health, aim to strengthen primary health care at the community level. The building block for level-1 health service provision is the Community Unit where each unit comprises between 5000 and 10,000 people, and served by 50 to 75 community health workers (CHWs) and 1 or 2 community health extension workers (CHEWs). CHEWs are formally engaged, government-paid employees of the health system who, among other tasks, are responsible for providing continuous training and supervision to approximately 50 CHWs. This implies that each CHEW supervises approximately 25 CHWs. CHWs are part-time volunteer workers who act as &#x02018;gate keepers&#x02019; of health in the community and are each responsible for providing care to about 20 households. CHWs are connected to primary health facilities through their supervising CHEW. While the existing Community Health Strategy (CHS) is appreciated, high attrition rates, lack of accountability for volunteer CHWs and lack of funds to pay CHW salaries need to be addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Rationale</title><p>In order for children to reach their developmental potential, interventions designed to promote development, alongside the prevention and early detection of newborn illness are essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This study aims to investigate the impact of delivering a neonatal survival kit and/or early cognitive stimulation package, on development at 12&#x000a0;months of age and neonatal mortality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objective and hypothesis</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether an integrated neonatal survival kit and/or newborn stimulation package, when delivered to pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy by volunteer CHWs, improves developmental outcomes at 12&#x000a0;months of age. Through a reduction in severe infections and improved thermoregulatory care in the first month of life, we hypothesize that utilization of the neonatal survival kit will result in an improvement of at least one standard deviation in development at 12&#x000a0;months of age as measured by the Protocol for Child Monitoring &#x02013; Infant/Toddler version (PCM-IT) assessment. Moreover, we hypothesize that the combination of both the neonatal survival kit and early stimulation messaging will have an additive effect on development. Secondary objectives are: i) to determine if introduction of the neonatal survival kit reduces all-cause neonatal mortality; ii) explore whether use of the kit is effective in reducing the incidence of omphalitis and/or severe infection, improves caregiver ability to identify hypothermia and/or fever through use of ThermoSpot, and improves identification of low birth weight through use of a handheld scale. The study will also determine if the interventions increase appropriate referral to local health facilities. Finally, the study will assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices of mothers with their newborn and their willingness to use the kit and their capacity to pay for it.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study is being conducted in Kwale County, which is located in the southern most point of Kenya in the former Coast Province (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Vast distances, a poor network of roads and limited access to motorized transportation for many make it difficult to access health care facilities. In spite of government emphasis on the promotion of facility deliveries, more than 60&#x000a0;% of women in Kwale County still deliver at home without the assistance of skilled birth attendants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

A cluster is defined as a single CHW, where each CHW is responsible for the provision of basic health promotion and disease prevention services to approximately 20 households.

Specifically, the timing of intervention delivery coincides with the existing schedule of CHW home visits. In this trial, a trained study worker accompanies CHWs to their third trimester home visit, explains the study to potential participants, and seeks informed written consent. After obtaining consent, CHWs deliver the appropriate intervention(s) and corresponding education to enrolled pregnant women. In control clusters, CHWs deliver the current standard of community-based pre-natal care in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>The integrated neonatal survival kit comprises a clean birth kit, 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine solution, sunflower oil emollient, ThermoSpot&#x02122;, Mylar infant sleeve, and a reusable, instant heat pack (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

The cognitive stimulation program was adapted from the UNICEF and WHO Care for Child Development package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which promotes the appropriate use of communication and play activities by guiding caregivers to be sensitive and responsive to signals from their child. CHWs teach caregivers to integrate each stimulation message into daily activities (e.g., during feeding, bathing, bedtime routines). Three fifteen-minute sessions take place in the homes of participants. At the first visit during the third trimester visit, caregivers are given a locally developed one-page pictorial brochure to act as a memory aid. CHWs describe the messages verbally as participants follow along with the pictorial illustrations of behaviors associated with each of the key messages. The information is re-iterated by CHWs at subsequent routine visits during the first week of life, and at the four to six week follow-up visit. At post-natal visits, CHWs provide modeling, coaching and support while encouraging caregivers to practice the behaviors associated with the three key messages.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Cognitive stimulation messages</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Key message</td></tr><tr><td>Making eye contact and talking to their children<break/>&#x02022;&#x02009;Encourage caregivers to look into baby&#x02019;s eyes, smile and talk/sing to their baby<break/>&#x02022;&#x02009;Provide ways for child to see, hear, move their arms and legs freely, and touch (e.g., Caregivers are taught to slowly move colorful objects in front of the child)<break/>&#x02022;&#x02009;Caregivers are taught to not cover the child&#x02019;s face for long periods of time</td></tr><tr><td>Responsive feeding and caregiving</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022;&#x02009;Teach caregivers that children learn to communicate their needs through movements, sounds and cries.

In this training, the goals of the study were explained to them, they were taught basic methodology, and provided with an in-depth understanding of each data collection form. To assess secondary outcomes, data collectors visit homes in the intervention and control clusters on days 1 (or as soon as possible after birth notification), 3, 7, 14, and 28 of life. Data collection in the first few days of a newborn&#x02019;s life is critical to the study&#x02019;s success as many of the secondary outcomes measured in this study may occur very soon after delivery. Data collection visits are considered missed once the next data collection point is reached. For example, the day 7 visit can be completed up to day 13; on day 14, the day 7 visit is considered missed. The day 28 visit is considered missed, if two weeks after the scheduled visit, the questionnaire has still not been completed. To facilitate timely birth notifications, at the time of consent, participants are provided with contact information and instructions to notify the study team and/or their CHWs as soon possible following delivery. Moreover, a small monetary incentive is provided to both participants and CHWs for birth notifications that lead to the enrolment of an infant by day three of life.</p><p>At the first data collection visit, the data collector administers a questionnaire to document the events surrounding delivery and the immediate post-natal status of the newborn, including measurement of newborn weight. At each subsequent visit, data collectors administer a questionnaire covering the events that have occurred since the last visit to assess outcomes in the newborn. Data collectors are not trained to treat outcome conditions; rather, they are trained to identify newborn danger signs and make appropriate referrals. As an extra precaution, data collectors are required to report all newborn danger sign to their direct supervisor who then relays the information to the CHEWs based at their dispensary. On the day 28 visit, data collectors also administer a brief questionnaire to participants enrolled in the kit-only and kit plus stimulation intervention arms to assess participants&#x02019; knowledge, attitudes and practice toward the neonatal kit as well as their willingness to pay for the kit. Information on caregiver socio-demographics characteristics is also collected.</p><p>If a newborn is not enrolled into the study by day three of life, they are no longer eligible to receive a complete series of data collection visits (days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 of life). In these situations, a short questionnaire is administered on day 28 of life to capture information on the pregnancy outcome (i.e., live birth or stillbirth), whether components of the kit were used by participants in the kit-only and kit plus stimulation groups, and in cases of live births, the neonatal outcome (i.e., alive or dead on day 28 of life). In cases where the study team is not aware of the birth of a baby until after day 28 of life, a data collector is dispatched to the home of the participant as soon as the delivery notification is received. If the mother or caregiver is unavailable at the time of this visit, the data collection visit is rescheduled to the earliest available time.</p><p>In the event of a newborn death, the parent will be given the choice of participating in a verbal autopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; a minimum 2-week mourning period precedes the administration of the verbal autopsy. To determine cause of death, two pediatricians will review all completed verbal autopsy forms. If a discrepancy exists in the cause of death ascertained by the two primary reviewers, a third senior pediatrician will act as an adjudicator.</p><p>At 12&#x000a0;months of age, a subset of children will undergo a standardized assessment of development by a study worker trained in the delivery of the PCM-IT assessment. The study worker will be blinded to the arm of the trial to which the participant was randomized. The assessment will take place in the child&#x02019;s home in the presence of their primary caregivers and will take approximately 1&#x000a0;h to administer. At the assessment, the study worker will explain and demonstrate each new task before monitoring the child&#x02019;s attempt at the activity and scoring their abilities. A number of items on the PCM-IT, for example &#x02018;sitting with support,&#x02019; will be scored through observing the child&#x02019;s behavior. Children will receive a score for all 57 assessment items in the checklist and a summated score will be calculated for four areas; gross and fine motor skills, cognition and executive function. In addition, the parental interview covering 46 items will yield scores in four areas: language, self-help/adaptive, social and emotional regulation. The PCM-IT assessment will also be used to measure the baseline developmental score within the study population in a group of children born before this study commenced and thus were not exposed to the kit, stimulation, or other study activities. A questionnaire will be administered to every study participant who receives a developmental assessment to assess various demographic and socioeconomic factors, which may be associated with developmental outcomes.</p><p>Data are collected on paper forms in the homes of participants. Completed data forms are transported to local health facilities where they are stored securely until they can be transported to the centralized Data Management Unit (DMU) in Mombasa, Kenya. Each week, paper forms are delivered to the DMU where they are double entered into electronic format by two independent data clerks. Prior to data entry, all forms are checked for completeness and consistency. In case of inconsistency or missing responses, the editors flag the errors/omissions and consult the interviewers for possible explanations. For data entry, databases and entry screens were developed using EpiInfo version 3.5.1. The entry screens employ range and consistency checks to minimize entry of erroneous data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data analysis plan</title><p>Data will be analyzed as intention to treat using univariate and multivariate methods in STATA version 13.

Interventions that aim to promote early child development alongside the prevention and timely detection of newborn illness are important investments in minimizing the loss of human capital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. While evidence exists in support of various interventions and delivery mechanisms to promote child development, at present, very few studies have explored the feasibility and effectiveness of volunteer community health workers delivering interventions that aim to promote development and/or reduce newborn morbidity and mortality directly to women during pregnancy. The utilization of CHWs to deliver and provide education regarding the interventions has the potential to positively influence the health of the community and will facilitate national scale-up and long-term sustainability. Indeed, the effectiveness of CHWs in delivering key health promotion messages has been previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The findings of this trial will provide evidence to inform policy on the implementation of sustainable interventions in rural settings to promote child development and reduce risk factors of compromised development, newborn morbidity and mortality.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial status</title><p>Enrolment in ongoing</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CHEW</term><def><p>Community health extension worker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHS</term><def><p>Community health strategy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHW</term><def><p>Community health worker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMC</term><def><p>Developmental milestones checklist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMU</term><def><p>Data management unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECD</term><def><p>Early childhood development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KDHS</term><def><p>Kenya demographic and health survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KDI</term><def><p>Kilifi developmental inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KMC</term><def><p>Kangaroo mother care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBW</term><def><p>Low birth weight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMIC</term><def><p>Low and middle income country</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDG4</term><def><p>Millennium development goal 4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCM-IT</term><def><p>Protocol for child monitoring &#x02013; infant and toddler version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSED</term><def><p>Profile for socio-emotional development</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Simon Cousens for assistance with randomization of clusters.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This project is funded by Grand Challenges Canada (0346&#x02013;03) and the March of Dimes Foundation (#5-FY14-48) and is implemented by The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, Department of Community Health, Aga Khan University, East Africa and the Ministry of Health, Kwale County, Kenya.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SKM, ZAB and RA conceived the study idea and design.
