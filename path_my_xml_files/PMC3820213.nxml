with visual biofeedback on balance, body symmetry, and function among individuals with
hemiplegia following a stroke. [Subjects and Methods] The present study was performed
using a randomized controlled clinical trial with a blinded evaluator. The subjects were
twenty adults with hemiplegia following a stroke. The experimental group performed balance
training with visual biofeedback using Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> together with conventional
physical therapy. The control group underwent conventional physical therapy alone. The
intervention lasted five weeks, with two sessions per week. Body symmetry (baropodometry),
static balance (stabilometry), functional balance (Berg Balance Scale), functional
mobility (Timed Up and Go test), and independence in activities of daily living
(Functional Independence Measure) were assessed before and after the intervention.
[Results] No statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and
control groups. In the intragroup analysis, both groups demonstrated a significant
improvement in all variables studied. [Conclusion] The physical therapy program combined
with balance training involving visual biofeedback (Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) led to an
improvement in body symmetry, balance, and function among stroke victims. However, the
improvement was similar to that achieved with conventional physical therapy alone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Postural balance</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Visual biofeedback</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke causes sensory-motor impairment, leading to balance problems, falls, and
considerable functional limitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Balance is associated with the motion of the body in a static posture, which is maintained
through sensory-motor interactions. The control of balance depends on sensory information
(visual, vestibular, and somatosensorial), which triggers motor actions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A stroke leads to the incapacity to perform different tasks
of extreme importance to daily living<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hemiplegia is the most common result of a stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Body asymmetry and difficulty transferring weight to the paretic
side affect the capacity to maintain postural control, impeding the orientation and
stability necessary for proper movement of the trunk and limbs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Visual biofeedback is a rehabilitation method that can be used during static balance
training, offering the patient visual information on the position of the center of gravity
within the range of stability as the patient stands on a pressure plate. Upon changing the
center of gravity on the support base, the individual can view the movement of the body on a
monitor. Visual biofeedback stimulates proprioceptive information that may be negatively
affected in stroke victims<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Novel
biofeedback resources are currently being developed for balance training. One such device,
Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> from Nintendo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, simulates the body movements of an individual
during play activities that require balance and displays the results on a television
screen.</p><p>A systematic review revealed a limited number of randomized controlled clinical trials
addressing the effect of balance training with the use of visual biofeedback. The evidence
suggests that this modality is beneficial, especially in terms of body symmetry, but little
has been reported with regard to balance and function in stroke victims.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess balance, body symmetry, and function among
individuals with hemiplegia due to a stroke performing to conventional physical therapy
alone or in combination with balance training using visual biofeedback.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade
Nove de Julho (Brazil) under process number 312133, in compliance with Resolution 196/96 of
the Brazilian Health Board. All individuals agreed to participate in the study and signed a
statement of informed consent.</p><p>A randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out at the physical therapy clinic of
the Universidade Nove de Julho (Brazil). The sample was made up of individuals with chronic
sequelae stemming from a stroke who met the following inclusion criteria: weekly physical
therapy sessions at the institution, the ability to remain in an orthostatic position
without support, absence of osteoarticular deformities, and the ability to understand the
visual biofeedback. Individuals with associated diseases not pertinent to the
physiopathology of stroke were excluded from the study.</p><p>Following the initial evaluation and fulfillment of the eligibility criteria, the
participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group (conventional physical therapy
plus balance training with visual biofeedback using the Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> interaction
program from Nintendo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and a control group (conventional physical therapy
alone). Randomization numbers were generated from a randomization table at a central office.
A series of numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes was used to ensure confidentiality. Each
envelop contained a card stipulating to which group the individual would be allocated.</p><p>Evaluations of balance, body symmetry, and function were performed before and after the
intervention by an evaluator who was blinded to which group the subjects belonged.
Anthropometric characteristics (body mass, stature, and body mass index) were first
determined. The evaluation was carried out on a single day, and the order of administration
of the measures was determined by lots.</p><p>Functional balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, functional mobility was assessed using the Timed Up and Go test
(TUGT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and independence in
activities of daily living was assessed using the Functional Independence Measure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For assessment of static balance (stabilometric exam) and body symmetry (baropodometric
exam), a pressure plate was used (Medicapteurs<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Fusyo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> model) that
had 2300 pressure sensors with a precision of 0.1&#x02005;mm and an acquisition frequency of 40&#x02005;Hz.
This platform records oscillations from the center of pressure (COP) in the anteroposterior
and mediolateral directions. In the same exam, the platform measures body symmetry by
recording mean peak plantar pressure. The data were recorded and interpreted using the Fusyo
Analysis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> program. During the test, the subject remained in orthostatic
position on the pressure plate, was barefoot, kept the arms alongside the body and staring
at a fixed point marked on the wall at a distance of one meter at the height of the glabella
of each individual, with an unrestricted width of the foot base and the heels in alignment.
Data acquisition was performed for 30 seconds under each condition (eyes open and eyes
closed).</p><p>For the stabilometric exam, the oscillation of the COP on the mediolateral (X) and
anteroposterior (Y) axes was defined using the method described by Winter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>:<disp-formula>&#x02022; Delta X (&#x02206;X) = maximal
oscillation of the COP in the X direction in&#x02005;mm = maximal COPX &#x02212; minimal
COPX;</disp-formula><disp-formula>&#x02022; Delta Y (&#x02206;Y) = maximal oscillation of the COP in the Y
direction in&#x02005;mm = </disp-formula><disp-formula>&#x02022; maximal COPY &#x02212; minimal
COPY.</disp-formula></p><p>The area of total displacement of the COP was defined as:<disp-formula>&#x02022; Displacement area
= (&#x02206;X)* (&#x02206;Y) (mm<sup>2</sup>).</disp-formula></p><p>The intervention was carried out over a five-week period, with two sessions per week.
Conventional physical therapy sessions lasted 60 minutes, and balance training lasted 30
minutes.</p><p>Conventional physical therapy involved stretching, joint movement, muscle strengthening,
static and dynamic balance training, and the training of functional activities. These
procedures were performed in accordance with the physical therapy sessions in which the
individuals were already participating.</p><p>The sessions in the experimental group involved conventional physical therapy and 30
minutes of balance training with visual biofeedback using the Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> program,
which reproduces real movements in virtual actions. This equipment consists of a platform,
referred to as the Wii Balance Board<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which has sensors that measure weight and
center of gravity. Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has 40 types of balance exercises. However, for the
present study, only three were selected: plataformas, pesca bajo cero, and la cuerda floja.
The degree of difficulty is based on the interaction with the exercises, with the patient
going on to the next level after successfully completing the previous level. Each exercise
lasted 10 minutes, with a rest interval between exercises based on the physical conditioning
of each patient.</p><p>For the statistical analysis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the
distribution of the sample, using the parametric test in the analysis of the pressure plate
data and the nonparametric test in the analysis of the functional capacity scales. Paired
and unpaired t tests were used for the intra and intergroup comparisons, respectively. The
GraphPad InStat program (version 3.5, 2000, Windows 95) was used for the statistical
analysis, with the level of significance set at 5% (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Flowchart of the study based on CONSORT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-25-1027-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of the individuals in the experimental group and control

control group, with different degrees of reduction when the eyes were open (p &#x0003c; 0.001)
and closed (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The same degree of reduction in body oscillations occurred in the
experimental group following treatment with the eyes open and closed (p &#x0003c; 0.001). These
findings demonstrate that both interventions led to lesser body oscillation and,
consequently, greater orthostatic control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of the use of Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as

patients following a stroke and found no significant differences between groups, as both
exhibited motor improvements, as determined by the three measures employed&#x02013;the Berg Balance
Scale, TUGT, and Gait Speed test. Geiger<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> compared conventional physical therapy with visual biofeedback in
hemiparetic patients and found no differences between interventions, as determined by the
Berg Balance Scale and TUGT. Both aforementioned studies used the Balance Master program as
the visual biofeedback, for which the individual stands on a pressure plate and executes
body movements without moving the support base while a computer screen displays the body
movement that should be executed. The activities are the same as those performed in the Wii
program. What differentiates these resources is the illustration on the screen (the visual
biofeedback of each program).</p><p>Srivastava<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup> also carried out a study on
stroke victims using the Balance Master program, in which the patients carried out
activities with visual biofeedback for twenty minutes five times a week for four weeks.
Forty-five patients between 22 and 65&#x02005;years of age with a mean time of 16 months elapsed
since stroke were evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale and Barthel Index, which
demonstrated significant improvements in both balance and function. In the study by Cho et
al., the best results after balance training with virtual reality were observed in
functional balance (increase of 4 points in BBS) and TUGT (&#x02212;1.3 seconds). These results are
similar to these in the present study, in which it was observed that there was an increase
of 1 point in BBS and 3.6 seconds in TUGT.</p><p>Rehabilitation institutions often do not offer visual biofeedback resources, which cost
more than conventional physical therapy. However, this situation is changing, and many
institutions are investing in such resources, as patients demonstrate greater motivation
when sessions involve fun activities with therapeutic objectives. The Wii program is less
expensive than the Balance Master program and is easier to transport. Therefore, recent
studies have preferred the use of the Wii for orthostatic balance training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are as yet no studies assessing psychosocial factors in this type of intervention. As
emotional behavior is known to be affected after a stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, addressing this alteration in rehabilitation could offer further
benefits.</p><p>Leisure activities constitute a fundamental human right and an important factor to quality
of life. Individuals with physical disabilities often do not participate in such activities.
Thus, virtual reality can serve as a form of rehabilitation associated to leisure, as
patients perceive this technique as pleasant and successful. Moreover, the participants in
the present study demonstrated clear preferences with regard to motivation and learning,
performing the virtual reality tasks in a coherent fashion and with a high degree of
interest throughout the intervention period. Virtual reality appears to provide various
opportunities and motivation for leisure activities among young adults with physical
disabilities. Ease of use and adaptability make this a viable option for such patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Nintendo Wii Balance Board<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is one of the more recent virtual reality
programs researched and analyzed, as it precisely detects performance during a standing
posture. A recent study carried out with two individuals with multiple physical disabilities
analyzed the capacity to actively adjust standing posture based on visual stimuli. The data
demonstrated a significant increase in the length of time in maintaining postural control in
both participants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Improvements in motor function following a stroke occur as the result of spontaneous
recovery, learning, and practice due to reorganization of the brain. Studies suggest that
this process is strengthened by specific intensive tasks. Virtual reality biofeedback has
emerged as a new computer-assisted paradigm that allows greater training intensity while
providing sensory feedback. More than mere play, use of this technology can provide
neuroplasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A literature review carried out by Barclay-Goddard<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup> and published in the Cochrane Library reported that visual or
auditory biofeedback in combination with the use of a pressure plate leads to greater static
balance control, but has no impact on functional independence. The patients in seven
clinical trials achieved a more balanced orthostatic position, but with no improvement in
balance during functional activities</p><p>Based on the findings of the present study, physical therapy patients should perform both
static balance exercises as well as functional exercises, applying the static balance
acquired through visual biofeedback training to functional activities. The review carried
out by Barclay-Goddard<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup> does not address
balance training combined with conventional physical therapy, which also includes training
sessions in activities of daily living.</p><p>A recent study determined the efficacy of the Wii Balance Board<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in comparison
with a pressure plate in the acquisition of orthostatic balance with the eyes open and eyes
closed as well as with a one-foot and two-foot stance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The evaluation was carried out on 30 healthy individuals (mean
age: 23.7 &#x000b1; 5.6&#x02005;years) with no lower-limb impairment in sessions lasting approximately one
and a half hours over a 14-day period, totaling 24 hours of training. The study demonstrated
the efficacy and validity of the Wii Balance Board<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the acquisition of balance
control during exercises in the two-foot stance with the eyes open, although it did in the
one-foot stance with the eyes closed.</p><p>Visual biofeedback in combination with physical training may also enhance the effects of
motor training, as similar mechanisms may be involved in Wii exercises. One randomized study
assessed the viability, safety, and efficacy of Wii exercises with regard to the improvement
in recovery of upper limbs in 20 stroke victims aged 18 to 85&#x02005;years, with motor deficit and
less than six months since stroke. The authors compared the use of the Wii with conventional
therapy carried out in eight 60-minute sessions over a two-week period and concluded that
the Wii is valid and efficacious for use in neurological rehabilitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study related balance training with visual biofeedback to body symmetry and
distribution of plantar pressure. No other studies addressing these aspects were found in
the literature.</p><p>All participants in both groups in the present study exhibited greater balance control,
body symmetry, and functional independence in activities of daily living following the
intervention. Both forms of treatment had the same therapeutic objectives, and both groups
of stroke victims exhibited motor improvements. This demonstrates that visual biofeedback
with a virtual reality program can achieve significant results in neurological
rehabilitation and may be adopted as a resource in physical therapy. It is likely that a
longer adaptation and execution period with the Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> could lead to even more
significant results.</p><p>Thus, the Wii Fit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> program provides positive results in physiotherapeutic
rehabilitation and constitutes a further resource for treatment, as this interactive, fun
resource may allow greater motivation during physical therapy sessions. Nonetheless,
conventional physical therapy maintains its importance, as the group submitted to this type
of treatment also achieved a significant improvement in the aspects evaluated in the present
study.</p><p>A recent study reported that traditional physical therapy can be boring, which lowers
motivation and reduces adherence to treatment, thereby providing limited benefits to
patients with balance disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus,
the aim of the present study was to train balance using the Wii Balance Board in patients
with acquired encephalopathy. The sample was made up of 11 men and six women with a mean age
of 47.3 &#x000b1; 17.8&#x02005;years and chronicity of the condition ranging from 10 to 19 months. The
patients were trained in 20 one-hour sessions. Assessments were performed using the Berg
Balance Scale. The present study demonstrates that such training is viable, safe, and
potentially effective in enhancing balance in the standing position, suggesting that the Wii
Balance Board is a safe, effective alternative for individuals with acquired encephalopathy.
There is an increasing use of virtual exercises as a new physiotherapeutic resource, and the
results of the present study demonstrate the high degree of acceptability on the part of
patients regarding such exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Some limitations of the present study should be pointed out, especially with regard to
sample size. The study was carried out with a convenience sample (patients from a specific
physical therapy clinic) composed of only 20 individuals. Further studies should be
conducted with a sample based on a specific sample calculation and patient follow-up to
determine whether the benefits of the intervention are maintained over time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento
