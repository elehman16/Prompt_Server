This makes preventive audiology a practicable and fundamental foray in current times. Early detection and intervention for hearing impaired infants has become a progressively imperative aspect of neonatal and infant care and has magnified the audiological scope of practice significantly, as a form of secondary prevention.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] This change in scope of practice has produced a host of new challenges in the delivery of effective and reliable hearing care services to newborns and young infants. This has also resulted in large scale research initiatives that address the rising surge of questions regarding the improvement of methodologies for identification and intervention of hearing loss, most especially in developing countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] One of the questions that the current study aims to explore is whether epidural anesthesia has any effect on the hearing screening results in newborns.</p><p>The process of identifying the section of population at the highest risk of hearing loss is an essential component of audiological practice and serves as the initial step toward delivering effective audiological services to the pediatric population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] The screening of children and infants for hearing loss is a steadily advancing process that has accelerated significantly over the past few years. Even though a number of different methods of detecting hearing loss were evaluated earlier, it was only during the 1990s that substantial progress was made in lowering the average age at which significant hearing loss was identified.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] This delayed identification of hearing loss was predominantly due to a lack of methodical screening programs and the shortcomings of subjective behavioral screening methods. Fortunately, the emergence of a more accurate, noninvasive, and rapid means of screening hearing loss as well as more concerted and rigorous efforts by professional bodies, such as the Health Professions Council of South Africa,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] has resulted in the prospect of screening prior to hospital discharge being urged and supported.</p><p>As hearing loss cannot be promptly and effortlessly identifiable by routine clinical examinations such as behavioral observation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] screening with more objective electrophysiological measures such as otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem responses is advocated for the universal screening of all newborns and infants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] Universal new-born hearing screening programs are aimed at obtaining hearing screening results for every new-born at any time prior to discharge from the hospital.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] This is believed to possibly be the major way forward to guarantee that early identification and early access to services, including amplification and individualized family-centered early communication intervention, ensues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] Early hearing detection through universal newborn screening has taken on exceptional reputation as being the best practice in child healthcare in the developed world;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] and this highlights the value of ensuring that the methodologies employed are effective and accurate; and yield minimal false positive results in a time frame that is as early as possible.Therefore, it is vital to isolate and categorize factors that may influence the success or failure of new-born audiological screening programs, such as epidural anesthesia, in neonates born to mothers who undergo elective Cesarean section.</p><p>False positive results are obtained when a condition is not present, but the test results indicate that it is present. For example, Owen <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] document the high number of false positive results when OAEs are obtained in the first 24 hours after birth. Referral rates for OAEs are reported to be 5 &#x02013; 20% when conducted earlier than 24 hours after birth and less than 3% when conducted 24 to 48 hours after birth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] Differing results exist regarding the specificity of OAEs measured at various time intervals after birth. Korres,, <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] report a high rate of screening OAE recordings after 24 hours. Research conducted by Levi <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] indicates that OAEs can be measured reliably earlier than 48 hours after birth, while Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Counsel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] suggests that OAEs recorded after 48 hours are more reliable.</p><p>Unfortunately, an early discharge from maternity wards may contribute to a significant increase in false positive results due to vernix in the ear canal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] Such reports underscore the need for establishing other conditions present early during the postnatal period; such as epidural anesthesia, which may increase the rate of false positive hearing screening findings. Stuart and Moretz[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] suppose that the presence of false positive results may be an important factor hindering the implementation of new-born hearing screening programs. False positive results are also assumed to incur a significant cost to screening procedures;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] hence, the significance of the current study. According to Gorga <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] an efficient new-born audiological hearing screening program aims to identify newborns with a hearing loss in a cost-effective manner, and incorporates tests that have a low false positive rate. Mehl and Thompson[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref>] assert that the expense of hearing screening programs also need to be deliberated in terms of the cost of special education and support programs. A delay in the diagnosis of a hearing loss leads to a cost to the general public, the child&#x02019;s family, and the child with the hearing loss. This is thought to be particularly important considering the documented numbers of hearing impaired individuals.</p><p>There is an increasing prevalence rate of hearing loss reported globally.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>] This increasing prevalence has resulted in the customary practice of universal new-born hearing screening in developed countries. Despite South Africa having a comparatively well-developed infrastructure compared to other regions in the Sub-Saharan Africa, new-born hearing screening programs are a long way from common practice. This may be due to the availability of very little contextual research on infant hearing screening. In addition, this lack of data and the increasing priority toward addressing the overwhelming burden of infectious diseases such as HIV / AIDS has raised obstacles in cultivating support, funding, and political activism for infant hearing screening.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>] Therefore, additional research on Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) in a South African context is vital for the collation and development of appropriate and efficient neonatal hearing screening guidelines and protocols; hence, the current study.</p><p>With the documented prevalence of one to four in every 1000 live births globally, hearing impairment is one of the most common congenital abnormalities in new-borns.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref>] Globally, it is reported to be twice as prevalent as other neonatal conditions, screened for at birth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref>] The current literature suggests that globally, approximately six in every 1000 infants present with permanent hearing loss at birth or within the neonatal period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>]</p><p>This documented rise in the prevalence rate of hearing impairment worldwide correlates with that reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), which maintains that the estimate for incapacitating hearing loss has increased from 120 million to approximately 278 million in the decade between 1995 and 2005.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref>] This increased prevalence is more in developing countries where it is reported that more than 90% of all infants with congenital or early-onset hearing loss reside.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>] In these developing countries, Olusanya and Newton[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>] assert that environmental risks are more prevalent, and that early identification programs are exceptionally scarce. Moreover, this reported increased prevalence rate is reported to be even higher, if mild and unilateral hearing losses are also incorporated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>]</p><p>Literature has identified universal new-born hearing screening as the recommended protocol for Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI), particularly in developed countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>] Factors influencing the implementation of universal new-born hearing screening in South African tertiary hospitals include: practicality, ergonomics and economics (cost effectiveness), and the availability of equipment and manpower.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref>]</p><p>If a South African prevalence estimate of 10% is used, an estimated 4.5 million individuals are present with sensorineural hearing loss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref>] This reportedly results in each audiologist being required to serve a significantly larger number of patients when compared to their counterparts in developed countries. Most importantly, the majority of these audiologists operate within the private healthcare sector, where only a small minority of individuals who can afford these services can be seen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref>] Therefore, when matching population size with the number of qualified audiologists in South Africa, there is an apparent scarcity of manpower in the public healthcare sector.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref>] This situation is far from being remedied, as formal training in the profession of audiology is also lacking in most tertiary institutions in developing countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref>]</p><p>In comparison to first world countries, the aforementioned factors may influence the ability of audiologists in South Africa to effectively implement universal new-born hearing screening on all infants, prior to hospital discharge. Therefore, the use of targeted screening in high-risk neonates, as well as a clear understanding of the influence that certain postnatal factors (such as epidural anesthesia) may have on the implementation of early hearing screening measures may be more cogent. A need exists to determine the audiological findings in neonates born to mothers who have undergone epidural anesthesia during elective Cesarean sections. It is possible that anesthesia may depress the functioning of the auditory system, as also the integrity of the hearing screening, thereby causing false positive results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT29">29</xref>]</p><p>Epidural anesthesia is a procedure that entails the injection of a substance outside the dura mater of the spinal cord, and this causes an autonomic and partial central nervous system blockade. It is commonly used for elective Cesarean section.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref>] It has the advantage of allowing the mother to remain awake, minimizes the risk of maternal aspiration, and reduces drug effects on the new-born.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT31">31</xref>] The long-term effects of epidural anesthesia, which are rare and minimal, have been well-documented;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref>] however, if or how the hearing abilities of new-born infants are affected by epidural anesthesia is not well established.</p><p>Some evidence of the influence of anesthesia on new-born infant&#x02019;s hearing was reported as early as 1988 by Diaz <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT32">32</xref>] examined the effects of maternal lidocaine hydrochlorideanesthesia on the brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs)in neonates born by Cesarean delivery. In their study, the findings indicated the effect that maternal anesthesia had on the auditory brainstem response, with a significant delay noted in the central neuralcomponent of the BAER at 90 dB for the experimental group when compared to the control group. In another study by Bozynski <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT33">33</xref> the mean wave I-V intervals were prolonged when testing was conducted at less than four hours when compared to findings at 48 hours or longer; and these researchers concluded that changes in the serial auditory brainstem-evoked response tests occurred after maternal lignocaine epidural anesthesia in newborn infants, and that these changes correlated with the blood lignocaine concentrations.</p><p>As many studies conducted in the United Kingdom, Israel, and a majority of the developed countries have already established the feasibility of hospital-based hearing screening programs despite early postnatal hospital discharge;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT34">34</xref>] studies investigating improved methodological strategies need to be prioritized before the realization of effective and efficient low-cost universal new-born hearing screening programs. This includes the appropriate timing of such programs in the postnatal period, to minimize false positive results, while ensuring early identification of neonatal hearing loss prior to hospital discharge.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Main aim</title><p>To establish if epidural anesthesia has an influence on new-born hearing screening results in newborns born via elective Cesarean section in healthy pregnancies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Specific objectives</title><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Materials and procedures</title><p>All mothers in the study completed a questionnaire pertaining to the birth time, pregnancy, and birth and family medical history. Information obtained from this questionnaire and from the medical chart reviews allowed the researchers to ensure that the participants met the inclusion criteria and were without risk indicators for hearing loss as defined by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>]</p><p>Screening measures that were recommended for newborn hearing screening were required to be physiological or objective in nature. These included transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and automated auditory brainstem response (AABR).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref>] TEOAEs were low intensity sounds originating from active amplification of the outer hair cells of the cochlear, whereas, DPOAEs were generated by two continuous pure tones presented simultaneously to the ear.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT37">37</xref>] In contrast, the AABR was an electrical response to auditory stimuli and assessed the integrity and function of the eighth cranial nerve and auditory pathway. OAE and AABR testing modalities were considered to be complementary in nature; hence their combined use in the current study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT38">38</xref>]</p><p>All participating newborns were screened using automated TEOAEs (through the use of GSI AUDIO screener) followed by automated ABR (through the use of Maico MB11- MAICO Diagnostic) measures, while resting quietly in open bassinets in an empty new-born nursery. Although both these measures did not require testing to be conducted in a soundproof environment, as they possessed advanced digital signal processing that reduced the effect of ambient noise; the ambient noise levels were monitored through the use of a sound level meter during data collection, to ensure that the findings were valid and reliable and were not negatively influenced by noise. Nursing and sanitary staff were informed about the importance of a quiet environment to obtain accurate results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] Every effort was made to minimize physiological noise, by screening newborns when they were resting or immediately after feeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT39">39</xref>] For both test measures, the results were recorded as either <italic>pass</italic> or <italic>refer</italic> for each participant at each testing session.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p><italic>Pass / refer</italic> criteria for the analysis of TEOAE and AABR results was adopted.

The same cannot be said for the OAE screening results, which seemed to remain fairly the same at sessions 1 and 2 for both groups; with clear significant changes at session 3. The TEOAE findings confirm documented evidence that OAE screening is more reliable 24 hours after birth, due to vernix.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Comparison of hearing screening findings of the experimental group with the comparison group</title><p>Overall, as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, a large majority of newborns in both groups obtained <italic>refer</italic> TEOAE findings at the earlier testing sessions. The TEOAE hearing screening findings of both groups only changed when screening was conducted after 24 hours (at discharge). The AABR findings indicated a higher (40% at session 1) <italic>refer</italic> rate in the experimental group when compared to the 10% in the comparison group. The AABR findings positively changed with all newborns who had obtained <italic>refer</italic> results at session 1 passing at sessions 2 and 3.

</p><p>These findings may indicate that even though the effective use of OAEs and AABR as screening measures has been well established, it is important to establish factors that may influence the reliability of these measures. In the current study, epidural anesthesia seems to have had an influence with regard to increasing false positive findings when testing was conducted earlier than four hours after birth.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Establishing if the time of hearing screening following delivery has any effect on the screening results</title><p>The p-values of 0.00014 for a two-sided exact significance and 0.00007 for a one-sided exact significance were found when examining if time of screening following delivery had any effect on the results. These values reject the null hypothesis (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), hence indicating that time of testing did have an effect on the screening results in the current study.</p><p>From the results obtained, it can be concluded that TEOAE testing earlier than four hours after birth, as well as between four and six hours after birth is unfavorable. This was postulated to be possibly due to the vernix present in the external auditory canal at such times. According to Korres <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] and the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Counsel,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] TEOAEs are viable tools during new-born hearing screening between 24 and 48 hours after birth, because at that time the external auditory canal would be free of vernix. An index of suspicion about the influence of epidural anesthesia was raised.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite the fact that the sample size for the current study was small; and therefore limited the generalizability of the results, findings from the current study have significant implications for the implementation of universal new-born hearing screening programs; particularly in developing countries, where allocation of resources is driven by priorities such as management of infectious conditions such as the HIV / AIDS pandemic. Knowing where and when to focus the available resources for the best and effective EHDI programs would not only improve service delivery; but may improve access by the general South African population to the services of audiologists; which are currently scarce, particularly in the public healthcare sector. From the current findings, evidence points to the reliability of performing hearing screening with AABR on the day of delivery, as long as that happens four hours following the birth, in newborns where anesthesia was used during delivery. The timing of universal hearing screening, especially in babies born with epidural anesthesia, is important, as the use of epidural anesthesia could lead to increased false positive results, which may therefore cause undue maternal anxiety. The use of OAEs seems to be significantly influenced by vernix in the first few hours following birth, highlighting the need for ensuring that fluids in the external auditory canal are actively cleared before reliable use of OAEs can be implemented as a screening measure before 24 hours. Findings from the current study have particular relevance in developing countries such as South Africa, where women attending state hospitals&#x02019; maternity wards are discharged with their babies a few hours after giving birth. The current study should be replicated within a larger sample size with diagnostic ABR and OAEs, where findings will not be restricted to <italic>pass</italic> or <italic>refer</italic>; but would provide specific findings about the site and degree of the influence of anesthesia on the auditory pathway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Azeemah Mayet, who significantly assisted in conducting data collection for the current study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Parving</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Guest Editorial</article-title><source>Audiol Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>154</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Olusanya</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Luxon</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Wirz</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Benefits and challenges of newborn hearing screening for developing countries</article-title><source>Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol</source><year>2006a</year><volume>68</volume><fpage>287</fpage><lpage>305</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15129939</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Swanepoel</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>infant hearing screening at maternal and child health clinics in a developing south african community, doctor of philosophy communication pathology</article-title><source>Department of communication pathology</source><year>2005</year><publisher-loc>South Africa</publisher-loc><publisher-name>University of Pretoria</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Olusanya</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Luxon</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Wirz</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ethical issues in screening for hearing impairment in newborns in developing countries</article-title><source>J Med Ethics</source><year>2006b</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>588</fpage><lpage>91</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17012500</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Academy of Pediatrics, Joint Committee on Infant Hearing.
