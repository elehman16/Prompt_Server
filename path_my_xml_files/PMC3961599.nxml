Patients with AF/AFL are more likely than age-matched individuals without AF/AFL to have other cardiovascular and cardio-metabolic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, the presence of AF/AFL worsens the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, elevates the risk of stroke and doubles the risk of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. AF is considerably more frequent than AFL, and accounts for &#x0003e;90% of all cases of AF/AFL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the USA, AF-associated hospitalizations and deaths have been increasing steadily over the past 30&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and one in three patients can expect a cardiovascular-related hospitalization within the first year following diagnosis of AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Clinical trials have provided evidence of significant improvements in patient-centered outcomes in AF, including decreased rates of stroke, cardiovascular hospitalization, and cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Whether trial-tested outcomes translate into improved outcomes in the real-world setting is not well studied and remains an important clinical question. Although randomized clinical trials are important in establishing treatment efficacy, their emphasis on internal validity often limits the generalizability of their findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Differences in patient selection, treatment conditions, and practice patterns between the clinical trial and the real-world setting can influence treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Important patient subgroups, including the elderly, and those with coexisting morbidities, are frequently under-represented in clinical trials of cardiovascular drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Likewise, AF clinical trial populations vary in their representativeness to real-world AF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Large, observational cohort studies can be useful in bridging the gap between the highly controlled environment of the randomized clinical trial and routine clinical practice. Observational studies can enroll more heterogeneous populations, including older patients and those with comorbidities, provide extended patient follow-up, and incorporate a diversity of outcome measures. Retrospective cohort studies have been helpful in determining the resource use and cost burden associated with disease management among real-world AF/AFL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The recent ATHENA trial (A Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Parallel Arm Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Dronedarone 400&#x000a0;mg bid for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Hospitalization or Death from Any Cause in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter; NCT 00174785), demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular-related hospitalization rates among dronedarone-treated patients with AF/AFL (26%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The Commercial Claims database contains health claims records from privately insured individuals and their dependents, whereas the Medicare Supplemental database focuses on the over 65-year-old population with employer-sponsored Medicare-supplemental healthcare insurance. Collectively, the databases capture patient-level healthcare claims data from more than 100 different insurance companies, Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, and third-party administrators. The claims data include inpatient and outpatient information, health and productivity data, laboratory data, and hospital drug data.

These data are of value in that the ATHENA trial population, which excluded patients with severe heart failure and permanent AF, was similar to the current study population. The cardiovascular outcome benefit of reduced cardiovascular hospitalizations seen in the real world helps to validate both the clinical trial findings from ATHENA and the recommendations of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACCF/AHA/HRS) AF-focused guideline update regarding dronedarone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The ATHENA trial population comprised patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF/AFL who were aged either &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years (with or without cardiovascular risk factors) or &#x0003c;75&#x000a0;years with one or more additional cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with recently decompensated heart failure or severe heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV] were excluded. Over a mean follow-up period of 21&#x000a0;months, dronedarone reduced (inter alia) the risk of first cardiovascular hospitalization by 26% relative to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of the ATHENA trial findings, dronedarone was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009 to reduce the risk of cardiovascular hospitalization in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF/AFL, with a recent episode of AF/AFL and associated cardiovascular risk factors, and in sinus rhythm or scheduled for cardioversion. A subsequent FDA review, prompted by the PALLAS (Permanent Atrial fibriLLation Outcome Study Using Dronedarone on Top of Standard Therapy) trial findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], led to the revised recommendation that dronedarone should be initiated only in patients with non-permanent AF (but not AFL) who are in sinus rhythm, and discontinued on progression to permanent AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The therapeutic value of dronedarone, including its risks and benefits, has been reviewed extensively in several articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], with the general consensus that patients being considered for dronedarone therapy be carefully selected and monitored to prevent potential adverse events and drug interactions. As such, current 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) practice guidelines for management of AF recommend dronedarone as a treatment that can be initiated in the outpatient setting to reduce the need for cardiovascular hospitalization in patients with paroxysmal AF or after cardioversion of persistent AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The study population, drawn from patients who initiated dronedarone treatment between June 2009 and March 2011 following a recent diagnosis of AF/AFL, is likely to have satisfied the clinical criteria of the initial (pre-2011) product label, and appears to have been at comparable cardiovascular risk to the ATHENA trial population. By excluding patients with recent hospitalization for heart failure, it is likely that any patients with significant heart failure were removed from the study. Patients had a high level of baseline cardiovascular/cardio-metabolic comorbidity, most commonly hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes, and were of similar age (mean 68.4&#x000a0;years) to the ATHENA trial population (mean 71.6&#x000a0;years). Patients were required to have a minimum of 180&#x000a0;days of continuous use of dronedarone both to ensure treatment compliance and to match the treatment duration of the ATHENA trial. Results from this real-world population indicated that initiation of dronedarone treatment resulted in pronounced reductions in all-cause, cardiovascular-related, and AF-related hospital admissions (~40&#x02013;45%), emergency department visits (~30&#x02013;45%), and lengths of hospital stay (~35&#x02013;40%), which were offset by modest increases in office visits (~10&#x02013;30%) and a marked increase in AF-related drug (predominantly dronedarone) prescriptions (74%) over the following 12&#x000a0;months. Numerically similar changes in healthcare resource utilization to those in the full study population occurred in the Prior Rhythm-Control cohort over this period; reductions in all-cause, cardiovascular-related, and AF-related hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and lengths of hospital stay were accompanied by an increase in AF-related prescriptions.</p><p>In clinical practice, AF/AFL patients at high thromboembolic risk, who represent prime candidates for dronedarone treatment, experience high rates of hospitalization, with approximately 40% requiring readmission within the first 12&#x000a0;months after their initial hospitalization for AF/AFL, resulting in a mean cost per AF hospitalization of US$7,476&#x02013;8,493 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In keeping with the high volume and temporal pattern of cardiovascular admissions displayed by this high-risk patient population, the study findings suggest that the benefit of reduced hospital resource utilization associated with dronedarone is realized promptly, within 12&#x000a0;months of commencing treatment.</p><p>With the healthcare costs of AF/AFL currently estimated at $26 billion annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and the number of cases of AF/AFL in the US predicted to rise to more than 8 million over the next 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the development of treatments that can reduce the need for cardiovascular admission assumes importance in restraining the growing cost burden of this condition. The recent ACC and Institute for Healthcare Improvement-led Hospital to Home initiative was designed to reduce 30-day all-cause readmission rates for patients discharged with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction by 20% nationwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is feasible that a national quality initiative of this type might also be applied to the management of AF/AFL, with the aim of reducing hospital admissions and improving the transition of care from the inpatient to outpatient setting; one element of this would be improvement of post-discharge medication management.</p><p>Limitations of this study include its retrospective, nonrandomized design, the absence of a control group, meaning a placebo effect cannot be eliminated, and reliance on data from a highly regulated, US-specific, healthcare system. Use of the MarketScan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> databases has the advantage of capturing the reimbursement policies and practices of multiple payers; however, the applicability of the study findings to Medicare patients without employer-sponsored supplemental insurance and to the uninsured is uncertain. The MarketScan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> databases are also limited to the diagnostic information that supports claims for reimbursement, and errors may arise through coding inaccuracies. Furthermore, there was little information on the causality and severity of AF/AFL, and the time interval from disease diagnosis to initiation of dronedarone therapy was variable. Given the constraints of the administrative claims data and the non-randomized design of the study, it was not possible to assess the contributions of patient profile, the AF disease process, and rhythm- or rate-control therapy to the observed clinical outcomes. It is unclear whether the patients switching from Prior Rhythm-Control therapy were doing so because of treatment failure or on account of the more favorable tolerability profile of dronedarone. Although intra-cohort comparison of baseline versus follow-up outcomes allowed patients to serve as their own controls, the absence of a control group prevented assessment of the potential influence of disease evolution on the measured outcomes.</p><p>In the study, patients were required to have received dronedarone for at least 180&#x000a0;days. Thus, the patients receiving a shorter duration of dronedarone treatment were not evaluated. Also, the study did not take into consideration the monitoring requirements for dronedarone introduced in the post-approval period. The small increase in office visits observed with patients receiving dronedarone was not controlled for, and may have an impact on the numbers of hospitalizations and emergency department events. The use of anticoagulation during the 12-month baseline period appears to be higher in the Prior Rhythm-Control cohort than in the full study population (67.1% vs. 56.3% of patients). As a potential hypothesis, the patients in the Prior Rhythm-Control cohort may have been considered to have more severe AF/AFL and/or at a higher risk of stroke. Similarly, the increase in anticoagulation use following dronedarone initiation (coverage rose to ~69% of patients in both groups) may have been a consequence of the increased number of office visits (i.e., improved patient care) and closer adherence to treatment guidelines. Thus, it cannot be excluded that some of the benefits associated with dronedarone may be due to improved anticoagulation and/or overall patient care. Finally, patients selected for inclusion in this study were required to have demonstrated reasonable persistence (&#x02265;6&#x000a0;months) with dronedarone therapy, in keeping with the ATHENA trial population, whereas in clinical practice initial rhythm-control therapy is often associated with high rates of discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study extends the findings of the ATHENA trial by indicating that either first- or second-line treatment with dronedarone substantially reduces the rate of cardiovascular hospitalization among AF/AFL patients in real-world practice. The reduction in number and duration of hospitalizations that follows initiation of dronedarone treatment is offset in part by a modest increase in office visits and a more marked increase in AF-related prescriptions claims (mainly on account of claims for dronedarone itself).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12325_2014_108_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 190&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>All authors had full access to all of the data in this study and take complete responsibility for the integrity of the data and accuracy of the data analysis.
