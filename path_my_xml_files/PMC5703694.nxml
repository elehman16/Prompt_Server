This is achieved by working collaboratively with parents to explore ways in which their emotional and relational difficulties impact on parenting and child functioning, and to identify meaningful and realistic goals for change. The intervention is delivered via one-to-one sessions at weekly intervals over a period of 16 weeks. This protocol describes a two-arm parallel RCT in which consenting parents are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the Helping Families Programme plus the usual services that the parent may be receiving from their mental health and/or social care providers, or to standard care (usual services plus a brief parenting advice session). The primary clinical outcome will be child behaviour. Secondary clinical outcomes will be child and parental mental health, parenting satisfaction, parenting behaviour and therapeutic alliance. Health economic measures will be collected on quality of life and service use. Outcome measures will be collected at the initial assessment stage, after the intervention is completed and at 6-month follow-up by research staff blind to group allocation. Trial feasibility will be assessed using rates of trial participation at the three time points and intervention uptake, attendance and retention. A parallel process evaluation will use qualitative interviews to ascertain key-workers&#x02019; and parent participants' experiences of intervention delivery and trial participation. The results of this feasibility study will determine the appropriateness of proceeding to a full-scale trial.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Parenting</kwd><kwd>Interpersonal</kwd><kwd>Personality</kwd><kwd>Child</kwd><kwd>Behaviour</kwd><kwd>Psychoeducational</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">One in ten children in developed economies experience emotional or behavioural difficulties that interfere with developmental progress, family life and school achievement <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. They are also at risk for poor health and social outcomes in adolescence and adult life <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The likelihood of long-term negative outcomes is increased when a parent also has significant personality difficulties for which they may or may not have received a formal diagnosis of Personality Disorder <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A substantial number of adults - around 4% in community samples and 40% in mental health services - experience persistent, pervasive and impairing difficulties in managing their emotions and relationships <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Such difficulties are associated with developmental trauma or unmet needs and are often called personality disorder <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Persistent problems in areas of personality functioning, such as emotional instability <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and interpersonal hypersensitivity <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, can affect a parent's capacity to offer the stable and responsive care required for healthy child development <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Children of parents with these complex interpersonal needs are more likely to require support from child mental health and social care professionals <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, having a child with emotional and/or behavioural difficulties can increase the risk of a mental health crisis for vulnerable parents with limited interpersonal coping resources <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Interventions that support parents in developing parenting skills, in understanding the emotional needs of the child and in developing effective emotional communication lead to significant benefits in child mental health and developmental outcomes. The strongest effects are obtained for programmes that use structured &#x02018;psychoeducation&#x02019;, in which parents learn about child development, and the skills and application of positive parenting and personal coping strategies <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Unfortunately, families affected by personality difficulties experience comparatively high dropout rates and worse outcomes from the typical group format of standardised parent psychoeducation interventions <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">The &#x02018;Helping Families Programme&#x02019; (HFP) was originally developed for families with a range of complex needs including parental emotional dysregulation, interpersonal hostility, early school exclusion and risk of child maltreatment. Within this feasibility trial the HFP was adapted for use with families affected by clinically significant personality difficulties. HFP uses parent-focussed cognitive, behavioural and interpersonal strategies to optimise parents' use of positive parenting strategies and their understanding of child development and the tasks of parenting. This manualised approach incorporates systematic personalisation methods to assertively engage parents who have difficulties often associated with personality disorder to develop intervention goals that reflect the needs and preferences of individual families.</p><p id="p0030">Evaluations of HFP have indicated positive parent engagement and clinically significant changes on a range of child and parent outcomes. The current trial will be a test of HFP in a larger sample of families with complex intergenerational needs, using a more rigorous randomised controlled trial (RCT) design.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><label>1.1</label><title>Trial aims and objectives</title><p id="p0035">The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of undertaking a full clinical trial of the HFP psychoeducational parenting intervention for families affected by personality difficulties.

This is achieved by working collaboratively with parent participants to: (i) explore the ways in which parental emotional and relational difficulties impact on parenting and child functioning; (ii) identify meaningful and realistic goals for change; and (iii) understand and use a range of evidence-based parenting and self-care strategies. The intervention is delivered over 16 weekly sessions. HFP will be delivered by specially trained and supervised trial therapists according to a detailed manual. This will primarily involve 1:1 sessions with the primary parental caregiver, although other family members may be involved when appropriate.

Other resource use information for parents and children will be collected for the six months prior to baseline and follow-up using a modified version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Versions of this schedule have been used in over 300 research studies in the UK and internationally with adults and children. Services will include primary and secondary health care, social care, school-related services (e.g. educational psychologists and other educational support), early years help, and youth and criminal justice services. We will also record (i) time spent by parents accompanying their children to use services, (ii) days off work due to health problems, and (iii) days out of school for children. Resource use data will be combined with appropriate national unit costs <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> to calculate the total service costs. Parental time lost from work will be valued using average wage rates. Time lost from school is complex to value and a range of estimates will be used in sensitivity analyses.

These will be employed flexibly and subject to iterative development in order to reflect and explore emergent themes from early interviews. Respondents will be asked questions that explore all topics set out in the pre-defined topic list. However, the researcher will be responsive to issues emerging from respondents' accounts. All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interview content, data collection and analytic methods are grounded in Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> in order to gain a detailed understanding of participants' subjective experiences of the novel intervention and research procedures.

It was decided a priori that the single most important feasibility criterion would be a treatment retention rate of at least 65%. Using a 95% CI for the proportion of parents who complete treatment and an expected completion rate of 80% based on previous evaluations of HFP, we have determined that a sample size of N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;35 in the intervention arm will enable a sufficiently precise estimate of this feasibility objective (95% CI 0.67-0.93). We expect further attrition to occur over the subsequent follow-up period. With a sample size of N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;70 across both groups, we can be 95% confident that the anticipated 6-month follow-up rate of 70% will be estimated to within &#x000b1;10.7% points.

In the course of this conversation, the researcher will establish if the parent (i) is willing and able to participate, (ii) is unwilling/unable to participate, or (iii) requires additional time/information to make a decision. If the latter, the researcher will follow up as needed. If the parent is agreeable, the researcher will arrange a face-to-face meeting at a convenient time/location to obtain informed written consent. The meeting will start with a further review of the PIS. The researcher will explore the parent's understanding of the research and address any outstanding questions and concerns. If the parent is agreeable, the researcher will obtain two signed consent forms (one for the research team; one for the participant to keep). The researcher will then administer the two brief parent-reported screening measures.</p><p id="p0235">If the family is eligible, the researcher will establish if there is sufficient time to complete some or all of the baseline measures in the same meeting.

A description of the sample will be presented using means and standard deviations for continuous data, or medians and interquartile range if data are skewed. Frequencies and proportions will be used to analyse categorical variables. Feasibility of trial procedures will be assessed using proportions of predetermined parameters and their estimated 95% CIs.

The point estimates of cost and QALYs will indicate whether the new health technology is dominant (resulting in better outcomes at lower cost) or whether each extra QALY produced by the intervention (or indeed usual care) is at an increased cost. Uncertainty around cost-effectiveness estimates will be addressed using cost-effectiveness planes (produced by generating 1000 cost-QALY combinations using bootstrapping). This will allow us to determine the probability that the intervention results in (i) lower costs and more QALYs, (ii) lower costs and fewer QALYs, (iii) increased costs and fewer QALYs, or (iv) increased costs and more QALYs than usual care. Cost-effectiveness results will be further interpreted using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) generated using the net benefit approach where the monetary value of an individual's QALY gain minus their service cost is calculated <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

These parents and their children have very high levels of unmet need and we currently lack robust evidence on the best way to help them. HFP is the first intervention of its kind designed to help these groups and our study will test the feasibility of evaluating HFP using a randomised design.</p><p id="p0375">The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a full-scale trial to deliver a psychoeducational parenting intervention for families affected by personality difficulties. The Helping Families Programme intervention provides an important alternative to existing group-based interventions for parents whose interpersonal problems present barriers to intervention engagement and achievement of improved outcomes. There is currently a significant gap in evidence-based services for these families, and this feasibility study will test whether a trial of this intervention is possible. Positive feasibility findings for the research and intervention methods and measures will provide a platform for the planning and conduct of a subsequent full-scale trial.</p><p id="p0380">The strengths of the protocol lie in its scope and methods of recruitment. Parents who themselves have personality difficulties and whose children have significant mental health problems can be service users in adult and child mental health services as well as clients of social care services. Often the parental and child needs are under-recognised and care tends to focus on the needs of the individual adult or child. This protocol actively seeks to recruit from across services sectors rather than restricting recruitment to specific service types. The research team will need to engage and communicate with a wide range of practitioners and service provision. The breadth of recruitment routes means that parents located in a range of existing pathways will be given the opportunity to participate in the trial. All parents meeting eligibility criteria will receive support that is additional to the common forms of usual care typically available. Once screened, individual participants will have the chance of allocation to the HFP intervention, an intensive 16 session psychoeducation intervention. Parents randomised to the control arm will receive a manualised one session parenting intervention with a qualified therapist based on an existing evidence based programme <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p id="p0385">Recruitment through this protocol is intended to include parents who have previously received formal assessment, diagnosis and treatment for their complex interpersonal difficulties. It is also intended to be open to parents who meet eligibility criteria but who have not received previously received formal diagnosis and intervention. The latter group of parents are more likely to be found in child mental health and social care services, where diagnostic assessment of the adult parent is not within the scope of services. The protocol uses eligibility criteria based on the use of the SAPAS as a screening measure rather than formal diagnosis of personality disorder. Earlier feasibility work that informed the development of this protocol indicated that many potentially eligible parents had not received formal diagnosis. In addition, staff and service user consultations expressed concerns about the acceptability of screening procedures for the study using diagnostic instruments such as the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders-II (SCID) <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. There are important ethical and personal implications of using a research administration of instruments such as the SCID with parents who have not previously sought diagnosis for complex interpersonal difficulties.</p><p id="p0390">Use of the SAPAS as a screening tool enables participation in the trial of individuals who might otherwise have been excluded because they have not previously sought a formal diagnosis for their interpersonal difficulties. However, not including diagnosis as an eligibility criteria has potential implications for the interpretation of the trial results against studies which do use such inclusion criteria.</p><p id="p0395">Further limitations to the protocol include the use of parent informant self-report outcome measures which is reliant on parents' accurate and reliable assessment of their own and their children's functioning across a range of domains. The inclusion of third party assessment measures would increase validity but are not feasible within the funding available for this pilot study. Furthermore, consideration needs to be given to the recognised variations and discrepancies between parent, child and other informant ratings of child outcomes.</p><p id="p0400">Evidence suggests that there is an under-recognition of coexisting parent and child mental health problems. Feasibility work underlined the challenges underpinning this under-recognition, in which adult mental health practitioners focussed on the care of their adult service user, gave limited attention to the mental health of their children, and potential parenting difficulties. Within child mental health services, clinician assessment and intervention is focussed on the young person, with limited attention to the interpersonal function of the adult parent and the effects on their parenting. These practice differences are likely to affect the ability of practitioners across referring services to identify potentially eligible participants and confidently involve the parents in an open and informed discussion about participation. The research team has developed proactive methods to support and train practitioners from across service sectors to preliminary identify participants and engage them in the study.</p><p id="p0405">The trial aims to examine the feasibility of conducting a randomised design to test a new intervention for families affected by personality difficulties, whose needs are typically under-served. Although the impact of the active intervention are as yet unknown, parent participants randomised to the Usual Care arm of the trial may be disappointed by their allocation. Such disappointment may lead to participant withdrawal or to further help-seeking outside of the parameters of the trial. Any additional service utilisation will be recorded through the CSRI. Participant retention and withdrawal reasons will be recorded as part of the assessment of trial feasibility.</p><p id="p0410">This is a new intervention for a highly vulnerable population of parents and children where there are significant deficits in evidence based interventions and clinical practice. This paper describes a research protocol for a pilot randomised control trial for a new psychoeducational parenting intervention that will provide feasibility data that will be used to inform the design and planning for a full-scale trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="p0415">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p id="p0420">CD (Chief investigator), CD conceived and led the study with contributions from the other authors.</p><p id="p0425">JB contributed to the writing of this manuscript.
