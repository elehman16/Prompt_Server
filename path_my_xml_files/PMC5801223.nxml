While at least 90% of the filtered glucose is typically reabsorbed in patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors prevent reabsorption of filtered glucose, leading to urinary glucose excretion (UGE) and a consequent reduction in plasma glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Due to their mechanism of action, the glycemic efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors is dependent on renal function and the amount of filtered glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As the glomerular filtration rate declines in patients with impaired renal function, the glycemic efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors is attenuated, although beneficial effects on body weight and blood pressure (BP) have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may have long-term beneficial effects on renal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which is likely due to several direct and indirect effects on the kidney through tubuloglomerular feedback and improvements in hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, and hyperuricemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Ertugliflozin is a SGLT2 inhibitor that is highly selective for SGLT2 over other glucose transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

No patients in the ertugliflozin 5&#x000a0;mg group, one (0.7%) in the ertugliflozin 15&#x000a0;mg group, and two (1.3%) in the placebo group had at least one eGFR decrease&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;50%. Renal-related AEs (defined according to a standard MedDRA composite query of acute kidney injury, acute prerenal failure, or renal impairment) were reported in 0.6%, 2.5%, and 1.3% of patients in the placebo, ertugliflozin 5&#x000a0;mg, and ertugliflozin 15&#x000a0;mg groups, respectively, at week 26, and in 1.3%, 3.2%, and 1.3% of patients, respectively, at week 52.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Mean change from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) through week 54. <italic>SE</italic> standard error</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13300_2017_337_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

After 52&#x000a0;weeks, the placebo-adjusted mean percent increase from baseline in HDL-C were 2.2% and 5.7% in the ertugliflozin 5&#x000a0;mg and ertugliflozin 15&#x000a0;mg groups, respectively.</p><p id="Par45">In the ertugliflozin groups, small mean increases from baseline in hemoglobin were seen from week 6 (ertugliflozin 5 mg, 0.4&#x000a0;g/dL; ertugliflozin 15&#x000a0;mg, 0.4&#x000a0;g/dL) through week 52 (ertugliflozin 5&#x000a0;mg, 0.8&#x000a0;g/dL; ertugliflozin 15&#x000a0;mg, 0.9&#x000a0;g/dL); no meaningful change over time was observed in the placebo group.

However, metformin, which was used by approximately 17% of patients, modified the primary endpoint response. Metformin use was not reported to investigators and was discovered after phase A by analysis of retained plasma samples, and contrasts with the use of rescue medication, which was reported to investigators. It is possible that patients self-medicated based on fingerstick glucose measurements, which were performed by patients during the study to monitor glucose levels, which is required for safety monitoring (for hypo- and hyperglycemia) and assessing glycemic rescue requirements. A small number (6%) of patients initiated the allowed non-metformin glycemic rescue therapy during the trial; this proportion was roughly similar across treatment groups.</p><p id="Par50">At the time of initiation of this global study, metformin was not recommended for use in patients with moderate renal impairment, and it was therefore a prohibited medication. Consequently, patients who were taking metformin at the time of screening (~&#x000a0;25% of patients) were required to wash off metformin prior to randomization. These patients accounted for 41% of the 78 patients who tested positive for metformin use post-randomization. Metformin is available without a prescription in the Russian Federation and Romania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; sites in those countries accounted for 28% of the metformin users. Overall, many patients had access to metformin and had the ability to use metformin without the knowledge of the investigators. Additionally, patients enrolled in the study were supplied with glucose meters and test strips and counseled to measure their glucose levels throughout the course of the study (at least twice weekly, or more frequently if required by the investigator). Thus, it is possible that some patients self-medicated with metformin in response to fingerstick glucose measurements. This might also explain why the reduction in A1C was greater in metformin users allocated to placebo than to ertugliflozin, despite the fact that similar proportions of patients used metformin across treatment arms (i.e., patients may have used metformin more frequently or taken higher doses in the placebo group in response to fingerstick glucose measurements). A greater response to metformin might also be expected in those using placebo compared to those on ertugliflozin, since the use of an active agent might partially attenuate the effect of a co-administered AHA. After the initiation of the study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that metformin can be used in some patients with moderate renal impairment, and has mandated changes to the labeling of all metformin-containing medicines to reflect this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">A large placebo response was also observed in a study of another SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, in patients with moderate renal impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unlike in our study, the dapagliflozin study showed no early separation in the change in A1C over time curves for the placebo and drug treatment arms. In our study, the percentage of patients who discontinued study medication or discontinued the study was similar among the treatment arms (Fig.&#x000a0;S2 in the ESM), making differential dropout an unlikely source of the observed placebo response. Patients enrolled in the present study were meant to keep their background AHA treatment regimen stable; however, those requiring intensification or meeting hyperglycemic rescue criteria were to titrate existing agents or add new agents. All such post-rescue data were censored in the presented A1C analyses, which also suggests that the observed placebo response was likely not the result of the intensification of the AHA regimen that was reported to investigators. We note that the percentage of patients meeting the hyperglycemic rescue criteria through week 52 was similar among the treatment arms (32.0&#x02013;36.4%), and a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis of time to glycemic rescue did not reveal any differences between treatment arms. The analysis of glycemic efficacy may have been affected by metformin use, so the post hoc analysis excluding data from patients who were known to have used metformin likely provides a better estimate of the effects of ertugliflozin on A1C than the primary analysis. Fewer patients had metformin assays available at week 26 than at previous time points, so it is consequently possible that the number of metformin users at week 26 has been underestimated. Nevertheless, this post hoc analysis suggests that ertugliflozin 15&#x000a0;mg lowers A1C in patients with stage 3 CKD versus placebo. The degree of A1C lowering from baseline with ertugliflozin was almost identical to that observed with other SGLT2 inhibitors in this patient population (dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10&#x000a0;mg at week 24: &#x02013;&#x000a0;0.4% and &#x02013;&#x000a0;0.4%, respectively, in patients with eGFR&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;30 and&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>; canagliflozin 100&#x000a0;mg and 300 mg at week 24: &#x02013;&#x000a0;0.3% and &#x02013;&#x000a0;0.4%, respectively, in patients with eGFR&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;30 and&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>; empagliflozin 25&#x000a0;mg at week 24: &#x02013;&#x000a0;0.4% in patients with eGFR&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;30 and&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The efficacy of ertugliflozin in patients with stage 3 CKD is supported by additional observations in the pre-specified analysis (i.e., including metformin users). For example, the analysis of body weight or BP would not be expected to be influenced by metformin use. Greater reductions in body weight were observed for ertugliflozin 5&#x000a0;mg and 15&#x000a0;mg versus placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 for both comparisons). There were also small reductions in SBP for ertugliflozin 5&#x000a0;mg and 15&#x000a0;mg versus placebo. These additional benefits in relation to body weight and BP are similar to those observed with empagliflozin in patients with moderate renal impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additional evidence of ertugliflozin efficacy in this patient population is provided by the observed early complete separation of the ertugliflozin and placebo groups for A1C change from baseline and the greater reduction in FPG for ertugliflozin 15 mg versus placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.019). Analyses of the efficacy endpoints at week 52 showed that the effects of ertugliflozin on A1C and body weight were maintained over 52&#x000a0;weeks of treatment.</p><p id="Par53">In a phase 1 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study, administration of a single dose of ertugliflozin 15&#x000a0;mg to patients with T2DM and stage 3 CKD (eGFR&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;30 and&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;59&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>) resulted in substantial UGE (observed median UGE<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> of 33.4&#x000a0;g), which was approximately 48% of the median value in T2DM patients with eGFR &#x02265;90&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> (observed median UGE<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> of 69.3&#x000a0;g) noted in the same study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A regression-model-predicted mean UGE<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> for a patient with an eGFR of 52.5&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> (midpoint of stage&#x000a0;3A CKD) is 29.5&#x000a0;g. Given that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce A1C by promoting UGE, these data are direct evidence of the pharmacodynamic activity of ertugliflozin in patients with T2DM and stage 3 CKD. The relative reductions in UGE in patients with moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function for ertugliflozin are similar in magnitude (approximately 50%) to those reported for other SGLT2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Both doses of ertugliflozin had an acceptable safety profile, with no clinically meaningful differences in the overall incidences of AEs, SAEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation across groups. In contrast to the evaluation of glycemic efficacy, the analysis of safety is not expected to be affected by metformin use, with the potential exception of hypoglycemia. In this study, approximately 96% of patients were using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea, consistent with the overall high incidence of hypoglycemia that was observed across the three groups. The incidence of symptomatic and documented hypoglycemia was similar in each ertugliflozin group compared with the placebo group. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the incidence of GMIs. SGLT2 inhibitors are generally associated with an increased incidence of GMIs, and while this association was observed with ertugliflozin in patients without moderate renal impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], both a lower overall incidence of GMIs and no increase in risk relative to placebo were observed in patients with moderate renal impairment in the present study. This result was inconsistently obtained in other studies of SGLT2 inhibitors in this population, with some studies showing an increased risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and another not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The incidence of renal-function-related AEs was low overall and more frequent in the ertugliflozin groups than in the placebo group. The observation of hypovolemia-related AEs and decreases in eGFR are also evidence of the pharmacological activity of ertugliflozin in patients with stage 3 CKD. Most patients experiencing hypovolemia were taking a diuretic medication. Decreases from baseline to week 6 in eGFR were followed by a slight increase, but it remained below baseline through week 52. The reversible changes in eGFR observed upon cessation of ertugliflozin treatment in this study further support the pharmacodynamic activity of ertugliflozin in this patient population and the hypothesis that eGFR reductions observed with SGLT2 inhibitors are hemodynamically mediated and are not the result of renal injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par55">In patients with T2DM and stage 3 CKD who were inadequately controlled on their existing antihyperglycemic therapy, the addition of ertugliflozin showed evidence of pharmacologic activity in glycemic control and body weight and BP reduction, although the comparison with the placebo group was not statistically significant. Ertugliflozin was generally well tolerated and the safety profile was largely consistent with that observed in phase 3 clinical trials of patients with T2DM and normal renal function, except for a higher incidence of hypovolemia in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
