In the original study, blood was collected at days 0 (before) and 28 (after vaccination), respectively. In this study, an additional blood sample was collected 21&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months after vaccination, and tested for neutralizing antibodies to Sabin poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We collected sera from 59/60 (98.3%) subjects; 59/59 (100%) remained seropositive to all poliovirus types, 21&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months after vaccination. The decay curves were very similar among the study groups. Between day 28 and 21&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months, there was a reduction of &#x02a7e;87.4% in median antibody levels for all poliovirus types in all study groups, with no significant differences between the study groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The decay of poliovirus antibodies over a 21&#x02013;22-month period was similar regardless of the type of booster vaccine used, suggesting the scientific data of Salk IPV long-term persistence and decay may be broadly applicable to Sabin IPV.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adjuvant</kwd><kwd>Aluminum hydroxide</kwd><kwd>Inactivated poliovirus vaccine</kwd><kwd>Phase I trial</kwd><kwd>Sabin strains</kwd><kwd>Duration of antibodies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2008, the WHA recommended the WHO develop safer inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) production technology using attenuated seed strains, such as Sabin polioviruses (Sabin-IPV) <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

To date however, only one study has assessed the duration of immunity induced by Sabin-IPV. This was a phase III trial conducted in Japan, using tetravalent diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-Sabin-IPV vaccine (DTaP-Sabin-IPV), which demonstrated comparable immunity between Salk-IPV and DTaP-Sabin-IPV, 6&#x02013;18&#x000a0;months after vaccination <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>We conducted a follow-on study to the phase I Cuba study conducted in 2012.

Sera were tested at the Institute Pedro Kouri, for neutralizing antibodies to Sabin poliovirus types 1&#x02013;3, using standard micro-neutralization assay. The antibody titers were diluted to 1:65,536, above the standard 1:1024 because high titers were expected with a boosting dose of IPV. Seroconversion was defined as a &#x02a7e;fourfold increase in reciprocal antibody titers.</p><p>We calculated the decay in antibody titers at day 28 and at 21&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months, and the overall increase in antibody titers during day 0 and 21&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months, by poliovirus type and study arm with 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapping sampling and estimation with 10,000 replications.

However, the greater decay observed may have been an artifact, due to the differences in the dilution of antibody titers; in our study antibody titers were diluted up to 1:65,536, however we were not able to verify the level of dilution in Okada&#x02019;s study.</p><p>Previous boosting studies for Salk-IPV demonstrated greater antibody decay following booster dose in the developing country, compared to industrialized country setting. A study conducted in Oman by Sutter demonstrated a relative reduction of 72.4% in median antibody titers to poliovirus type 3, 6&#x000a0;months after administration of a booster dose of Salk-IPV, in children who received a primary schedule of OPV. Furthermore, the decay in median antibody titers may have been greater in this study, as antibody titers were only diluted up to the standard 1:1448 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This contrasts with findings from the Netherlands, published by Rumke, which demonstrated a relative reduction in antibody geometric mean titers of 62.1%, 71.3%, 83.5% to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively, 5&#x000a0;years after administration of a booster dose of DT-Salk-IPV, in children who received a primary schedule of DTP-IPV, and a booster dose of DT-IPV at 4&#x000a0;years <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. The sample size was small, limited to healthy adults from a potentially socio-economically homogenous area. The study was conducted in a specific tropical developing country setting. While our study found similar rates of antibody decay in adults, at 21&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months between Sabin-IPV, aSabin-IPV, and Salk-IPV groups, we cannot directly extrapolate this trend to longer term decay between the groups. Therefore similar studies are needed to assess and compare medium and long term antibody decay, particularly in naive children.</p><p>Our study only assessed antibodies against Sabin virus type 1, 2, 3. Previously a study conducted in infants in Poland using the same vaccine (produced by Intravacc), demonstrated that seroconversion rates against both Sabin and wild virus were equivalent between the Sabin-IPV and Salk-IPV groups; however, neutralizing antibody titers induced by Sabin-IPV were higher against Sabin strains compared to wild poliovirus strains, and similarly, titers induced by Salk-IPV were higher against wild poliovirus strains <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, although we assume the rate of decay of antibodies against Salk strains is similar between Salk and Sabin IPV, the cross neutralisation effect is worth assessing in future studies.</p><p>There may have been secondary exposure to OPV during the study period (10/2012&#x02013;08/2014); however we concluded that secondary exposure of enrolled subjects was minimal, as although there were four national OPV campaigns targeting children under 3&#x000a0;years of age, two of which also included children 9&#x000a0;years of age, during this period, we did not find that any subjects demonstrated an increase in antibody titers between day 28 and 21&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months.</p><p>This study demonstrates comparable immunogenicity and trends in antibody decay 21&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months in adults who had received multiple doses of OPV, after booster dose Sabin-IPV and aSabin-IPV, to Salk-IPV. This should galvanize momentum for countries and vaccine producers to further develop Sabin-IPV and aSabin-IPV technology. Future research should be conducted to further assess, and build the evidence for the medium and long-term immunity of Sabin-IPV.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>Funding for this study was provided by World Health Organization, Geneva and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan.
