Parents play a central role in young children&#x02019;s PA. However, there is currently little research on parenting interventions to increase child PA. This study was formative work to inform the content of a pilot randomised-controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In-depth telephone interviews were carried out with 32 parents of 6 to 8 year old children residing in two areas that varied in their socio-economic characteristics, in Bristol, UK. Data were analysed thematically using a framework approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Most parents described their child as being active or very active and indicated that they did not perceive a need for an increase in their child&#x02019;s PA. Parents used a variety of visual cues to make this judgement, the most common being that they perceived their child as having lots of energy or that they did not view them as overweight. Parents reported environmental factors such as monetary cost, time constraints, lack of activity provision and poor weather as the main barriers to their child&#x02019;s PA. Parental support and child&#x02019;s enjoyment of PA appeared to be important facilitators to children participating in PA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Improving parents&#x02019; knowledge of the PA recommendations for children, and increasing their awareness of the benefits of PA beyond weight status may be an important first step for a parenting PA intervention. Although parents commonly perceive environmental factors as the main barriers to their child&#x02019;s PA, parental concern about low levels of child PA, their capacity to support behaviour change, child motivation, self confidence and independence may be key areas to address within an intervention to increase child PA. Effective methods of helping parents address the latter have been developed in the context of generic parenting programmes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Parenting</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The benefits of physical activity (PA) in adults have been well documented and include decreased risk of obesity, type-2-diabetes and all cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Among children, PA has been associated with improved mental well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and lower levels of cardiovascular disease risk-factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Research suggests that children do not engage in the recommended amount of 60 minutes moderate-to-vigorous PA per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The early primary school years (6&#x02013;8 years) is a critical time for physical skill development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and is the period in which PA behaviour is formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is evidence that PA behaviours in childhood track into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and therefore establishing healthy behaviours in early childhood is important for the current and future health of children.</p><p>Increasing children&#x02019;s PA levels is a key UK government public health policy target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] but presents a major challenge for public health practitioners and promoters. The majority of interventions to increase PA in children are school-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and reviews highlight that many school-based interventions have had limited success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Parents are able to influence their children&#x02019;s behaviour and play an important role in encouraging children to be physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Research has shown that parental support (i.e., parental self-efficacy associated with child PA, parents&#x02019; PA behaviour, and parents&#x02019; perceptions of the value of PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and logistic support (i.e., providing equipment for PA and taxiing children to activities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] are important correlates of PA levels in children. Parenting programmes have shown to be effective in preventing childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] but parenting interventions to promote children&#x02019;s PA is an understudied area of research. There may be particular parenting skills which would encourage increased PA in children and working with parents is a potential intervention route.</p><p>Parents&#x02019; poor recognition of children&#x02019;s PA levels could present an important barrier to behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, we do not currently know how parents&#x02019; assess their child&#x02019;s PA. This may be particularly important for interventions as parents with inactive children have been reported to overestimate their child&#x02019;s PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, parents&#x02019; perceived barriers to PA have been consistently negatively associated with child PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and may be important issues to address within the content of an intervention. Reported parental barriers have included lack of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], monetary cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], lack of opportunities to be active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the local environment, safety concerns, increasing distances between homes and school, home distractions and peer pressure for sedentary activities (e.g. screen-viewing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The UK&#x02019;s Medical Research Council provides a development-evaluation-implementation model to guide the development and testing of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A key element of this process is the developmental stage in which intervention elements are developed based on existing evidence and pilot research. The present study is situated at the developmental stage and the information arising from it will be used to inform the content of a pilot randomised-controlled trial consisting of a parenting intervention aimed at increasing the PA among 6&#x02013;8 year old children. Interviews were held with parents to examine factors that may influence their child&#x02019;s PA levels, specifically: a) parents&#x02019; awareness of their 6&#x02013;8 year old child&#x02019;s PA; b) the parents&#x02019; perceived barriers to their 6&#x02013;8 year old child&#x02019;s PA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Interviews were held between January and March 2011 with parents of children aged 6 to 8 years old. The study was approved by the School for Policy Studies ethics committee at the University of Bristol and written informed consent was obtained for all participants.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Parents were recruited from a low social economic status (SES) area and a mid-SES area in Bristol, UK. Recruitment was carried out via two methods: 1) letters describing the study and inviting parents to take part in an interview were sent home with the children in Years 2 and 3 at two schools in each of the study areas; and 2) face-to-face contact with parents at community activities (including children&#x02019;s centres, after school clubs and church clubs), and at the school gates at child pick-up time. Each parent was provided with a study information sheet. Parents that agreed to take part in the study gave written consent. Parents were eligible to take part if they were the main carer for a 6 to 8 year old child and lived in either of the two research locations. Fifty-seven parents in total were recruited and consented to take part in an interview (46% from the low-SES area and 54% from the mid-SES area). Parents were interviewed on the basis of who could be contacted first whilst attempting to get an equal number of parents in each of the two study areas. Data collection ended when data saturation had been reached, (i.e., no new themes were emerging from the analysis).</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>A semi-structured interview guide was used. The guide focused on questions relating to children&#x02019;s PA levels and barriers to participation in PA, e.g. questions were asked about parents&#x02019; opinions of their child&#x02019;s PA levels, how they gauge their child&#x02019;s PA levels, barriers to their child&#x02019;s PA, and support for their child&#x02019;s PA. Interviews were arranged and conducted by GFB and JKG and lasted between 10 and 47 minutes (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;22 minutes). The interviews were conducted by telephone because it is a convenient method for parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and studies have shown that parents are more likely to answer potentially sensitive questions over the telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The interviews were audio recorded and the two interviewers listened to each other&#x02019;s recordings to ensure consistency in interviewing. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and anonymised. GFB and JKG listened to the recordings to check for accuracy with the transcriptions and any differences were reconciled. Data collection and analysis proceeded in parallel.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>The data were analysed thematically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The approach involved researchers reading and re-reading the interview transcripts in order to identify emerging themes and to develop a coding frame. Whilst all data were read and considered, the main aim of the analysis was to identify factors that would need to be taken into account when developing a parenting programme. The coding frame was provisionally tested with a sample of three transcripts by three members of the research team. Discrepancies were discussed and the coding frame was refined.</p><p>Once the coding frame was finalised, transcripts were imported into NVivo (Version 9.0, QSR, Southport, UK) to allow for electronic coding and retrieval of data. To assist with the systematic interpretation of the data, a framework approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] was used, which allowed for <italic>a priori</italic> as well as emergent themes. Using headings from the thematic coding frame a chart of the data was created, with each participant represented across all themes. This enabled comparisons to be made within and across the interviews, identification of deviant cases, and the views parents held towards a particular issue to be highlighted.

The interviews indicate a variety of factors that may influence a child&#x02019;s activity levels, which are important to take into consideration when designing the content of an intervention to increase PA levels in children. The data presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> provide a summary of how the key issues that were raised in this study could be addressed in the development of a PA parenting programme. These issues are discussed in detail below.</p><sec><title>Improving parents&#x02019; awareness of their child&#x02019;s PA levels</title><p>Most parents considered their child to be active or very active, and they used a variety of visual cues to make this assessment. Most prominently, a child that displayed a lot of energy was seen as an active child. However, there is evidence that parents of inactive children overestimate their child&#x02019;s PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As the cultural norm has shifted to support a more sedentary lifestyle there may be a loss of intuitive knowledge of the value of PA. The normal desire for children to move about and explore their surroundings may seem to parents to be inappropriate and in need of correction. Suppression of such a normal desire could lead children to appear to be hyperactive.</p><p>Weight status was also commonly used by parents as an indicator of sufficient child PA. However, it has previously been shown that parents do not have accurate perceptions of their child&#x02019;s weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and they may look for ways to validate their child&#x02019;s size as being 'normal' whether over or underweight, and define their comparators (e.g., other children, family members, clothes size) in ways that achieve this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The use of visual cues may lead to an inaccurate perception of their child&#x02019;s PA levels, and therefore parents may not consider an increase of PA for their child as necessary. Indeed, only a few parents in this study commented that their child would benefit from increasing their PA. These findings align with previous observations that parents who believed their child to be sufficiently active did not promote PA for their child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, improving PA awareness is an important first step for interventions aiming to increase PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This may be achieved by facilitating realistic perceptions through knowledge and tools to monitor PA and studies have suggested that self monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and personalised feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] may be effective tools to help promote PA awareness.</p><p>Parents may be unaware of PA recommendations for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In this study it appeared that parents were unaware of the UK PA recommendations. Parents did not use time references to reinforce their judgement of their child being sufficiently active but seemed to place emphasis on the role of PA in preventing overweight. Educating parents about the current PA guidelines for children and how children can meet these recommendations should form a significant component in a parenting PA intervention. In addition, promoting the benefits of PA beyond weight control is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], such as promoting the short term and long term benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and facilitating an awareness of the relationship between weight status and PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Alongside these suggestions for increasing parents&#x02019; awareness of their children&#x02019;s PA levels lies the possible relevance and importance of increasing awareness of recommendations for adult activity levels and encouraging more PA amongst parents themselves. If parents identify with the benefits of PA for themselves they are likely to want to enable this for their children. Such motivation would be more authentic than motivation based on externally derived recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Overcoming barriers to PA and increasing opportunities to be active</title><p>The key environmental barriers reported by parents related to cost, time, lack of safe outdoor space, lack of activity provision, weather, and transport. It is not possible to modify these barriers in the context of a parenting intervention, nevertheless they should be addressed and tools for overcoming or reducing these barriers discussed alongside parenting interventions.</p><p>Inclusion of information and support for low-cost activities and active play is likely to be important for parenting PA interventions to address [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and the promotion of low&#x02013;cost activities such as active travel and active play has been identified as a useful strategy to increase family activity in lower socioeconomic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, parents cite lack of safe outdoor play space as a barrier to their child&#x02019;s PA and therefore interventions should consider facilitating strategies to increase perceived safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and promote appropriate settings for children&#x02019;s PA by encouraging parents to use the most appropriate spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Lack of opportunities and transport might be more important to address with parents in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Improving parental support of their child&#x02019;s PA</title><p>Parental support has been found to be associated with child PA, and children whose parents provide support and encouragement are more likely to participate in PA and have higher overall levels of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The value of parental support within the 6 to 8 years age range was highlighted, with parents reporting that their child may feel unsure about participating in an activity without their presence. This suggests that interventions to increase children&#x02019;s PA may need also to address approaches to improving children&#x02019;s confidence and autonomy.</p><p>Many parents talked about their child&#x02019;s intrinsic motivation towards a particular activity, where this was the principle driver for them to participate in that activity. Children within this age range are motivated by activities that they find fun and engaging whilst parents may prefer other activities either because they rate the skills more highly or because they fit in with parental time schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Parental control and structure is essential for family life and normal development but excessive control undermines intrinsic motivation, reducing feelings of self-determination and impeding an inherent need for autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. This was reported by parents who had presumed that their child would do a certain PA and found that the child did not engage with the behaviour. Balancing the needs of family members and allowing children choice within the realistic constraints of family life, require problem solving and communication skills that may be part of generic parenting programmes.</p><p>Children who are more intrinsically motivated are those who perceive themselves as competent and in control of their successes and failures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. As children&#x02019;s perceived physical competence is related to their PA involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], helping parents to facilitate their child&#x02019;s feelings of competence is likely to be important. This might be achieved through helping parents to teach their children basic, age-appropriate physical skills and by facilitating parenting styles that influence competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study provides insights into parents&#x02019; assessment and views of their child&#x02019;s PA and provides information on how they can be used to form the content of a parenting programme to increase PA in children. We recruited parents from areas varying in their socio-economic characteristics and interviewed a sufficient number of parents to reach data saturation. However, a number of limitations should be acknowledged including the relatively small sample size, the recruitment of parents in Bristol, UK only, and that our sample included very few fathers. The data relied on parents&#x02019; perceptions of their child&#x02019;s physical activity and may not be an accurate representation of reality (we had no way of knowing how active the children really were).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study suggests that parents may not identify a need for their child to increase their PA based on their judgement of their child&#x02019;s current PA levels. In addition, parents most commonly reported that environmental barriers and time and energy constraints prevented their child from participating in PA. Although these barriers should be considered and addressed within a parenting intervention to increase child PA, other factors, such as parental support for children&#x02019;s motivation, competence and enjoyment of PA may play a more tangible role in behaviour change. Strategies and practices that enhance these factors may in turn influence long term PA behaviour and could be included in PA parenting interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PA: Physical activity; SV: Screen-viewing; SES: Social economic status.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>We have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The study was designed by RJ, SJS, PJL, KRF, SSB and KMT.
