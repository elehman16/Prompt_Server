It was hypothesised that repeated delivery of gp140 may facilitate antigen uptake and presentation at this mucosal surface. Twenty two healthy female volunteers aged 18&#x02013;45 years were entered into the trial, the first receiving open-label active product. Subsequently, 16 women were randomised to receive 9 doses of 100 &#x000b5;g of gp140 in 3 ml of a Carbopol 974P based gel, 5 were randomised to placebo solution in the same gel, delivered vaginally via an applicator. Participants delivered the vaccine three times a week over three weeks during one menstrual cycle, and were followed up for two further months. There were no serious adverse events, and the vaccine was well tolerated. No sustained systemic or local IgG, IgA, or T cell responses to the gp140 were detected following vaginal immunisations. Repeated vaginal immunisation with a HIV-1 envelope protein alone formulated in Carbopol gel was safe, but did not induce local or systemic immune responses in healthy women.</p><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00637962">NCT00637962</ext-link>

There is growing evidence that an effective vaccine against HIV-1 will need to induce broadly protective immune responses at the virus portal of entry which can be recalled at sufficient magnitude shortly after <italic>in vivo</italic> infectious challenge <xref rid="pone.0025165-Haase1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025165-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Our specific interest is to investigate vaccine strategies which attempt to invoke persistent genital tract as well as systemic immune responses that might be sufficient to block female receptive vaginal HIV-1 transmission. Data from macaque SIV-challenge models suggests that HIV is able to traverse the vaginal mucosa within a few hours, and establish infection within 24 hours <xref rid="pone.0025165-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although systemic immunisation is able to block sexual transmission in women of some pathogens (e.g. HPV) <xref rid="pone.0025165-The1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, it is not clear whether this approach will be effective against HIV, which directly targets and subverts the immune system. Therefore our goal is to investigate novel vaccine strategies that might drive maximal anti-HIV-1 female genital tract mucosal immune responses.</p><p>Vaginal vaccination has been explored in women and female non-human primates in a number of systems <xref rid="pone.0025165-Ogra1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0025165-Johannson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Although some degree of response was reported in all of these experiments, the antigens were usually co-administered with a local adjuvant, such as recombinant cholera toxin B <xref rid="pone.0025165-Wassen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0025165-Johannson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These studies demonstrated that the efficiency of vaginal immunisation was influenced by the menstrual cycle <xref rid="pone.0025165-Kozlowski2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025165-Johannson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To circumvent this variable we hypothesised that repeated exposure to antigen throughout the menstrual cycle may be most likely to generate an immune response. Furthermore, we used HIV-1<sub>CN54</sub> clade C recombinant trimeric envelope (gp140), which maintains CD4-binding function, and is to some extent expected to emulate natural exposure to HIV-1 envelope protein. We chose to avoid the use of mucosal adjuvants in the vagina because of the inherent dangers of up-regulating target cells and HIV transmission <xref rid="pone.0025165-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. For the first human study in our programme, we therefore determined whether nine vaginal immunisations with an HIV-1 envelope protein alone, administered throughout one menstrual cycle, could induce genital tract and systemic immunity. We had performed a series of toxicological, immunological, and formulation studies in rabbits prior to the human trial, and were encouraged by the results showing that formulations of the CN54 gp140 trimer were well tolerated and induced both serum and mucosal antibody responses after a single cycle of vaginal immunisation <xref rid="pone.0025165-Cranage1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025165-Curran1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1.1 RCT</title><p>This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1 clinical trial. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1. The trial was conducted at two centres, the Vaccine Institute, St George's, University of London, and the Department of GU Medicine, York Hospital, York, UK. We first gained regulatory, ethical, and governance approvals. All volunteers gave fully informed written consent, and the trial was conducted according to the UK Clinical Trials Regulations and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>1.2 Subjects, randomisation and interventions</title><p>Subjects were healthy female volunteers aged 18&#x02013;45 years. Potential participants were screened for medical abnormalities, HIV, HBV, HCV, sexually transmitted infections and gynaecologic disorders, and there was a range of other inclusion and exclusion criteria. All women had to use condoms without a spermicidal agent, and in addition use either combined oral contraception, a diaphragm, or be sterilised. There was a total of 16 study visits over 4 menstrual cycles. The randomisation was computer generated by an independent statistician using a 2&#x02236;1 ratio of active: placebo and a target population of 30. This was provided to Polymun Scientific who prepared blinded individual subject doses. Corresponding IMP supplies were used sequentially and provided to the sites in blocks of five. The sample size was chosen based on expected side effects. The first subject was given open label active product as a safety precaution. The vaginal vaccines were prepared by bedside mixing of the carrier gel plus the blinded study products [eitherCN54 gp140 (see below), or placebo buffer] and administered by the volunteers at clinic visits nine times (3 times a week for 3 weeks) during a single menstrual cycle following randomisation. Immunisations were performed by insertion of 3 ml of active or placebo gel into the vagina. Subjects were followed up for 8 weeks after the last immunisation. We collected fractionated sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), plus endocervical and vaginal mucosal secretions using Weck-Cel&#x02122; surgical spears (Medtronic&#x02122;).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>1.3 Primary and secondary outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes were safety variables as comprised by local cervico-vaginal AEs (epithelial disruption, erythema, or bleeding) and systemic AEs, either by report including diary card, or by clinical examination including colposcopy, and laboratory AEs. Adverse events, both local and systemic, and serious adverse events were recorded and graded according to pre-defined criteria. The secondary outcomes were immunological responses, (i) IgG &#x00026; IgA responses to CN54 gp140 in vaginal &#x00026; cervical secretions and serum, (ii) T-cell responses to HIV gp140 peptides in blood, and (iii) T cell responses in cervical mononuclear cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>1.4 Vaccines</title><p>We designed, expressed and produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) a trimeric gp140 from a clade C envelope clone p97CN54, kindly provided by H Wolf &#x00026; R Wagner, University of Regensburg, Germany. The trimeric gp140 (gp120 plus the external domain of gp41), designated as CN54 gp140, was produced as a recombinant protein in CHO cells, and manufactured to GMP specifications by Polymun Scientific, Vienna, Austria (accession number AF286226). The fidelity of the product was confirmed by mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments by the Medical Biomics Centre at St George's, University of London. An aqueous gel using Carbopol 974P as the matrix-former, and benzyl alcohol as preservative, was designed for vaginal use by Particle Sciences, Bethlehem PA, US. Directly before each immunisation the CN54 gp140 was added to the gel vehicle, the mixture homogenised by multiple passages between two interconnected syringes, and then loaded into a vaginal applicator for administration. The final gel formulation contained 33 &#x000b5;g/ml of gp140. A full battery of toxicology, stability and rabbit vaginal irritation tests were performed with this material with no significant adverse reactions detected.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>1.5 Genital tract secretions</title><p>Mucosal secretions were sampled using pre-weighed Weck-Cel surgical spears placed either in the cervical os or against the vaginal wall for 2 minutes. After reweighing, secretions were eluted from the sponges using a modified version of a previously described method <xref rid="pone.0025165-Cranage1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In brief the spearheads (having absorbed the vaginal secretions) were snipped into the top chamber of a Spin-X tube (Corning) containing 300 &#x000b5;l of sterile filtered extraction buffer [250 mM NaCl, 1&#x000d7; protease inhibitor cocktail set 1 (Calbiochem) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)]. The Spin-X tubes were centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes at 13,000 g. A repeat extraction was performed by adding an additional 300 &#x000b5;l extraction buffer to the top chamber as described above. Then 8 &#x000b5;l of heat inactivated foetal calf serum was added to pooled secretions from each sample site prior to separation into 200 &#x000b5;l aliquots and freezing at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C before batch analysis by ELISA as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>1.6 Cervical cytobrush sampling</title><p>Cervical cytobrush samples were collected at screening and weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the last immunisation. A speculum was inserted into the vagina and the cytobrush (Cytobrush&#x000ae;plus, Medscan) was placed in the cervical os and rotated twice through 360&#x000b0;. Cytobrushes were transferred to sterile 15 ml tubes containing 3 ml transport medium, then placed on ice prior to transport to the laboratory for processing and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>1.7 Immunological assays</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>1.7.1 ELISA for antibody responses in serum and mucosal secretions</title><p>Systemic IgG &#x00026; IgA anti-gp140, and cervical and vaginal total IgG &#x00026; IgA, and anti-gp140 responses were measured by ELISA. Antigen-specific ELISA assays were initially standardised and optimised using a panel of serum samples from 20 HIV negative and 20 HIV positive volunteers.

The saturating concentration of recombinant gp140 for solid phase adsorption was determined as 5 &#x000b5;g/ml by checkerboard titration of serum and conjugate dilutions. Although this is a relatively high concentration of antigen it was found to result in reproducible and co-linear serum titration curves even with very low titre sera which were negative in other assay formats (data not shown). For gp140-specific serum IgA detection, the addition of an extra stage of amplification using biotinylated anti-IgA and streptavidin-HRP detector was found to give better discrimination between sera from HIV infected subjects and uninfected individuals (data not shown). The assays were calibrated using sera from 40 HIV-infected and 40 HIV-uninfected women and representative results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025165-g002">Figure 2</xref>. 100&#x00025; specificity and sensitivity was obtained for the detection of anti-gp140 IgG.

Recent vaginal vaccine trials have used cholera vaccines including recombinant cholera toxin B (CTB), and given promising results <xref rid="pone.0025165-Wassen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0025165-Johannson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, CTB is known to be a potent mucosal adjuvant, and the doses administered were in the milligram range. More recently, the immunogenicity of vaginally administered recombinant hybrid soluble HIV-1 gp160 formulated with or without the cationic lipid mucosal adjuvant DC-cholesterol was assessed in a phase 1 clinical trial <xref rid="pone.0025165-Pialoux1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A single 50 &#x000b5;g dose of vaccine was given in each of 3 menstrual cycles at weeks 0, 4 and 8, although the timing of vaccine administration in relation to the menstrual cycle was not specified. This study also failed to detect serum or mucosal responses to the candidate vaccine. The study reported here was markedly different in providing a repeated exposure to gp140 antigen throughout the menstrual cycle. We had conducted initial <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and shown that the gp140 antigen was efficiently eluted from the carbopol carrier gel in an aqueous environment to 100&#x00025; levels over 20 minutes (data not shown). We were also encouraged by pre-clinical safety data in rabbits demonstrating that repeated vaginal delivery of gp140 without an adjuvant elicited systemic IgG and mucosal cervico-vaginal IgG &#x00026; IgA responses, including anti-HIV-1 neutralising antibody responses <xref rid="pone.0025165-Cranage1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025165-Curran1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The reasons for the species differences in response to vaginal gp140 between rabbits and humans may well relate to anatomical, histological and physiological factors, as the rabbit female genital tract is quite different to the human, with much of the cervico-vaginal tract covered in columnar single-cell layer epithelium <xref rid="pone.0025165-Barberini1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, rabbits are induced ovulators and therefore will not replicate the menstrual cycle effects on immune responsiveness reported in women <xref rid="pone.0025165-Kozlowski2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025165-Johannson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In order to facilitate future studies of protective efficacy we also undertook, in parallel with this clinical trial, a similar vaginal gp140 vaccination study in cynomolgus macaques <xref rid="pone.0025165-Cranage2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The strategy of para-clinical evaluation was adopted to allow cross validation of immunogenicity between humans and macaques using standardised assays. Interestingly, the results from the macaque study showed that a similar immunisation regime delivering nine intravaginal doses over one menstrual cycle also failed to induce any detectable humoral or cellular responses, but two additional monthly cycles of the same immunisation regime lead to a significant systemic and mucosal antibody response in 2/4 animals and primed a third animal for an anamnestic response. Furthermore, the same intravaginal regimen was shown to boost a single intramuscular immunisation of gp140 given with the AS01 adjuvant, and reciprocally that a single intramuscular immunisation was boosted by subsequent vaginal immunisation <xref rid="pone.0025165-Cranage2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Taken together, these data suggest that intravaginal immunisation with non-adjuvanted gp140 inefficiently primes vaginal mucosal or systemic immune responses, reflective of the lower genital tract being a relatively inefficient immunological inductive site. Nevertheless the boosting of parenteral immunisation seen in macaques suggests that the same intravaginal formulation of gp140 might be able to boost vaginal and systemic responses in humans following priming by a different route of administration. Although the Carbopol used in the vaginal formulation has been shown to enhance immunogenicity when given parentally <xref rid="pone.0025165-Krashias1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we have found no evidence that it has adjuvant properties when applied mucosally in the concentration included in the gel.</p><p>Calibration and validation of immunological assays is critical for reliable interpretation of clinical trial and pre-clinical data. This is particularly challenging for mucosal samples that vary widely in volume and composition. Here we used clinical materials from HIV-infected and uninfected volunteers to standardise, optimise and validate antigen-specific assays. Antibody assays applied to sera gave robust performance. Despite the paucity of HIV-specific IgA responses reported in serum and mucosal secretions of HIV-infected individuals <xref rid="pone.0025165-Raux1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025165-Mestecky1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> our assay was sensitive enough to detect anti-gp140 IgA antibodies in the majority of individuals tested. Moreover, data from the macaque study demonstrated that the recombinant gp140 used in the clinical trial is capable of eliciting IgA responses in serum and mucosal secretions <xref rid="pone.0025165-Cranage2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Despite 100&#x00025; specificity of the assay in validation tests it is interesting that weak anti-gp140 IgA reactivity was observed in 14/139 vaginal and 6/139 cervical samples. This reactivity was shown to be non-specific as it was observed both in some pre-immune sera and placebo participants. Furthermore this reactivity was not related to total concentration of IgA in the mucosal samples. Non-specific IgA reactivity against the HIV envelope has been previously described, although its association with HIV-exposed uninfected status remains controversial <xref rid="pone.0025165-Mestecky2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025165-Tudor1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In this study all trial participants were classified as low risk. Significantly, multiple exposures to gp140 at a concentration probably many times higher than that seen in infectious semen failed to boost any pre-existing non-specific reactivity to gp140. Vaccination with either the active or placebo formulation had no effect on the total IgA or IgG concentrations detected in the cervix or vagina and although variability was seen between individuals the median concentrations of IgG and IgA detected in the cervix were remarkably similar to those reported by others <xref rid="pone.0025165-Safaeian1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and in cynomolgous macaques <xref rid="pone.0025165-Cranage2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, we found lower concentrations of total vaginal immunoglobulins, and IgG and IgA in women, and IgG in macaques than previously reported.</p><p>Analysis of IFN-&#x003b3; secreting cells in PBMC from HIV-infected individuals demonstrated that the gp140-ELISpot assay did not require an exact sequence match to detect reactivity. As our cohort of HIV-infected women were not virus-clade defined, it is likely that non-responders were infected with non-clade C virus. Only one trial participant demonstrated weak and transient gp140 T cell reactivity. This was also the only subject displaying a relatively high titre anti-gp140 IgA in the cervix. However, attempts to analyse cervical T cell reactivity proved to be unsuccessful. Although recovery of cells in sufficient numbers for meaningful analysis has been achieved in HIV-infected multiparous women <xref rid="pone.0025165-Kaul1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025165-Gumbi1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> low yields have limited their usefulness <xref rid="pone.0025165-Bere1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Our results bear this out. Even fewer T cells could be detected in cytobrushes from healthy trial volunteers and where phenotype analysis was possible, as expected, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells predominated over CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. Preliminary experiments were undertaken using polyclonal expansion of cells from HIV uninfected women using CD3 and CD28 co-stimulation and a novel method using CD3 and CD137 co-stimulation in the presence of survival and anti anti-apoptotic cytokines designed to bias expansion of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. However this strategy was successful in only 4 of 16 samples tested (MM-unpublished observations). Even if the efficacy of polyclonal expansion could be improved, the rate-limiting step will remain the number of precursor cells available from cytobrush samples.</p><p>To summarise, we found no evidence for adverse safety outcomes in association with the gp140 vaginal immunisation. However, we observed frequent local AEs within both active and placebo arms. Of note, the female participants in this trial disliked both the multiple invasive (i.e. vaginal, by using a speculum) sampling procedures, and vaginal product deliveries within the clinic. We are currently evaluating new vaginal self-sampling methods, and self-administered vaginal product delivery at home, which within research studies would clearly be more acceptable <xref rid="pone.0025165-Boskey1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that it is feasible to conduct a HIV vaccine phase 1 trial focussing intensely on measurement of cervico-vaginal immune responses. We found no evidence in humans that immunisation with the vaginal gp140 vaccine candidate induced local or systemic immune responses. Further studies in both macaques and humans will determine whether priming by intramuscular or intranasal routes followed by vaginal boosting with gp140 leads to enhanced local and/or systemic responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025165.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
