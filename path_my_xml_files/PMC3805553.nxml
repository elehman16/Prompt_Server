Whether altitude-dependent changes in the sleep EEG are also prevalent at moderate altitudes of 1600 m and 2600 m remains largely unknown. Furthermore, the relationship between sleep EEG variables and central apneas and oxygen saturation are of great interest to understand the impact of hypoxia at moderate altitude on sleep.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fourty-four healthy men (mean age 25.0&#x000b1;5.5 years) underwent polysomnographic recordings during a baseline night at 490 m and four consecutive nights at 1630 m and 2590 m (two nights each) in a randomized cross-over design.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Comparison of sleep EEG power density spectra of frontal (F3A2) and central (C3A2) derivations at altitudes compared to baseline revealed that slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.8&#x02013;4.6 Hz) in non-REM sleep was reduced in an altitude-dependent manner (&#x0223c;4% at 1630 m and 15% at 2590 m), while theta activity (4.6&#x02013;8 Hz) was reduced only at the highest altitude (10% at 2590 m). In addition, spindle peak height and frequency showed a modest increase in the second night at 2590 m. SWA and theta activity were also reduced in REM sleep. Correlations between spectral power and central apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and oxygen saturation revealed that distinct frequency bands were correlated with oxygen saturation (6.4&#x02013;8 Hz and 13&#x02013;14.4 Hz) and breathing variables (AHI, ODI; 0.8&#x02013;4.6 Hz).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The correlation between SWA and AHI/ODI suggests that respiratory disturbances contribute to the reduction in SWA at altitude.

Several studies have reported a reduction in the duration of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, an increase in the number of awakenings and arousals, and minutes of stage 2 sleep <xref rid="pone.0076945-Zielinski1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0076945-NussbaumerOchsner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Because central apneas and periodic breathing increase at altitude, the sleep fragmentation observed at altitude may in part be due to arousals resulting from these events. A large field study at 4559 m found, however, that the number of arousals in the first nights at altitude was increased, although not in proportion to the increase in central apneas/hypopneas <xref rid="pone.0076945-NussbaumerOchsner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Moreover, oxygen saturation and not the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) revealed a significant effect on slow-wave sleep. Therefore, it remains unclear whether breathing disturbances are the main trigger for reduced sleep quality at altitude, despite the observation that the number of apneas and arousals are altitude-dependent, worsening with increasing altitude. Moreover, published studies do not differentiate between the effects of altitude, other environmental factors (e.g., activity level) and acclimatization <xref rid="pone.0076945-Anholm1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076945-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>One further limitation of the above-mentioned studies is that sleep at altitude has primarily been investigated using visually defined sleep stages which are dependent on characteristic features in the EEG, EOG and EMG signals. It is known that severe hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes (&#x0003e;3000 m) results in evident changes in sleep architecture <xref rid="pone.0076945-Zielinski1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0076945-Anholm1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and slight changes were observed at moderate altitude <xref rid="pone.0076945-Hoshikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076945-Kinsman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. More subtle, but physiologically relevant changes in the sleep EEG may not necessarily be detectable by sleep stage analysis.</p><p>One method to extract information from the EEG is power spectral analysis <xref rid="pone.0076945-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076945-Achermann1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, a quantitative summary of EEG measured cortical activity. An advantage of power spectral analysis is that it allows detailed investigation of the oscillations present in the EEG by decomposing the signal into its constituent frequency components. Thus, power spectral analysis provides valuable information that is lacking in sleep stage scoring and is more sensitive to subtle changes in sleep physiology.</p><p>Therefore, our aim was to examine the impact of altitude on sleep using power spectral analysis in a field study with a large sample size (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;44) and a randomized cross-over design. Despite the popularity of recreational sports and stays at moderate altitudes (&#x0003c;3000 m), few studies have examined whether sleep is altered at moderate altitudes. We therefore compare sleep at a low altitude (490 m) with sleep at two moderate altitudes (1630 and 2590 m). Altitude dependent changes in sleep architecture, respiration and performance <xref rid="pone.0076945-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> as well as on vascular function, metabolism and systemic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0076945-Stwhas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> were reported recently.</p><p>Our design allows us to take advantage of spectral analysis to uncover subtle but relevant changes to sleep in an altitude-dependent manner. Since sufficient, undisrupted sleep is essential for well-being and good motor and cognitive performance <xref rid="pone.0076945-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, altitude dependent sleep EEG alterations are of great interest. In addition, we examined the relationship between sleep EEG spectral characteristics and respiratory disturbances and oxygen saturation by correlation analysis. This allows us to investigate which physiologically relevant frequency bands are affected by these variables and in which direction. Our results revealed alterations in the sleep EEG at moderate altitude associated with respiratory disturbances and oxygen saturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifty-one healthy men, living below 600 m, non-smokers, free of sleep complaints and medication participated in the study. Recruitment mainly consisted of an invitation via email, which was sent to students at the ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich. In addition, subjects were recruited using flyers. For further details on participant characteristics see Latshang et al. <xref rid="pone.0076945-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Because the focus of the present analysis was on spectral changes in the sleep EEG the exclusion criteria was a sleep efficiency &#x0003c;80% during sleep at 490 m and the first night at higher altitude (see below for study protocol) to assure sufficient data for the calculation of spectra. Based on these criteria seven participants were excluded (three at 490 m; two at 1630 m; two at 2590 m) resulting in a final sample size of forty-four men [mean age &#x000b1; SD: 25.0&#x000b1;5.5 years] for the current analysis. Sojourns to altitudes above 1500 m during the last 2 weeks before the study period were not allowed. In addition, subjects had to abstain from caffeine and alcohol consumption and adhere to regular bedtimes (7 h, from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.) for at least the 3 days/nights preceding study nights. During the study periods subjects were instructed to remain at current altitude and avoid extensive physical exercise. Compliance was tracked with an actimeter with a built-in altimeter and sleep logs. The study protocol was approved by the cantonal ethical committee, and participants gave their written informed consent and were monetary compensated upon completion of the study. The study was registered (clinicaltrials.gov; ID#NCT01130948).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study procedure</title><p>The study was carried out in the sleep laboratory of the Pulmonary Division of the University Hospital Zurich (Baseline, 490 m), at the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos-Wolfgang (1630 m), and at the mountain hostel Davos-Jakobshorn (2590 m), Switzerland.

Consistent with the changes in sleep architecture, we observed a considerable decline in SWA in an altitude-dependent manner together with an increase in spindle power/frequency at moderate altitude. With regards to breathing variables, central AHI and ODI were increased at moderate altitude, SpO<sub>2</sub> was decreased, and EEG power in distinct frequency bands was associated with changes to respiratory signals. SWA was negatively correlated with central AHI and ODI, while fast theta and spindle activity correlated positively with SpO<sub>2</sub>. These findings provide evidence that hypoxia and breathing disturbances affect the sleep EEG even at moderate altitudes frequently visited during recreational mountain travels.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Decrease in SWA and theta activity and increase in spindle activity</title><p>We investigated sleep at three different altitudes to assess the impact of moderate altitude on sleep EEG variables and their relationship to oxygen saturation and breathing disturbances. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased SWA in an altitude-dependent manner. SWA, a marker for sleep intensity and sleep homeostasis, increasing with time awake and dissipating over the course of the night depends on previous sleep-wake history <xref rid="pone.0076945-Borbly1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0076945-Achermann3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A suppression of SWA may signal reduced dissipation of sleep pressure during a stay at moderate altitude and could lead to increased sleep propensity during the following days and in subsequent nights. Support for this hypothesis comes from the slight increases in total sleep time and sleep efficiency observed in the second night at both altitudes as well as the reduction in sleep latency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076945.s003">Table S1</xref>). The limitation of the sleep opportunity to 7 hours may also contribute to these effects on total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Thus, SWA might have been reduced even further without such confounds. On the other hand, the increase in SpO<sub>2</sub> due to acclimatization on the second day at both altitudes may be responsible for the slight increases in total sleep time and sleep efficiency and the shorter sleep latency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076945.s003">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076945.s004">S2</xref>). Nussbaumer-Ochsner et al. <xref rid="pone.0076945-NussbaumerOchsner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> investigated sleep in the first and third night during a 3-day sojourn to 4550 m and showed that SWS was reduced at altitude, but increased from the first to the third night. They reported a positive effect of oxygen saturation on slow wave sleep at altitude after controlling for the AHI. We therefore suggest a similar effect on other sleep measures such as total sleep time and sleep latency. A reduction in SWA by 15% at 2590 m could result in considerable increases in sleep propensity. However, subjective sleepiness as assessed by the Karolinska sleepiness scale did not differ <xref rid="pone.0076945-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Also psychomotor and cognitive performance was not affected at this moderate altitude <xref rid="pone.0076945-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This indicates either that the applied tests were not sensitive enough or our observed altitude related EEG changes are too small to be of functional relevance.</p><p>Our results of a decrease in SWA are in line with Hoshikawa et al. <xref rid="pone.0076945-Hoshikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> who found a 21% decline in SWA at a simulated altitude of 2000 m. This study was, however, non-randomized and performed in a small sample (8 male athletes) under simulated conditions rather than in the field. Athletes performed their training during the day at 22 m altitude, and were only exposed to normobaric hypoxia in a hypoxic room at a simulated altitude of 2000 m for 8 hours during the night. Therefore, the generalizability of these results to real world conditions is limited.</p><p>This is the first study to examine the impact of moderate altitude on REM sleep EEG power spectra. Similar to the changes observed in non-REM sleep, we found a reduction in SWA and theta activity at 2590 m in REM sleep. Therefore, we propose that hypoxia induced changes may have a common mechanism (see hypothesis below).</p><p>In addition, to the decline in SWA and theta activity we found an increase in spindle activity. Sleep spindles are generated in the thalamus resulting from the interaction of thalamic reticular inhibitory neurons and excitatory thalamo-cortical neurons that project to the cortex <xref rid="pone.0076945-Steriade1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Also slow-waves are generated by thalamo-cortical loops, however, at a more hyperpolarized membrane potential than spindles <xref rid="pone.0076945-Steriade1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We hypothesize that a reduced hyperpolarization of thalamic neurons for example due to sympathetic activation at altitude might therefore favor spindles and in turn suppress slow-waves. This could account for both, the decrease in SWA and the increase in spindle activity at moderate altitude. This hypothesis is supported by the negative correlation between spindle peak height and SWA at 2590 m, where we observed a distinct decrease in SWA and an increase in spindle activity, but not at lower altitude or baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Correlation between spectral power and breathing variables/oxygen saturation</title><p>We found a negative correlation between SWA and the central AHI and ODI at 2590 m suggesting a relationship between sleep intensity and respiratory variables. The decrease in SWA may therefore partly be due to disruption of sleep through breathing disturbances. Our findings are in agreement with results from studies in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), where AHI and SWS are negatively correlated <xref rid="pone.0076945-Goncalves1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and SWS, SWA and theta activity are reduced compared to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0076945-Guilleminault1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076945-Ondze1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Frequent central apneas might therefore be one reason for a reduction in SWA at moderate altitude.</p><p>The relationship between sleep quality at altitude and breathing variables has two aspects. The first aspect is the relationship between the increased number of central apneas, as measured by AHI and periodic breathing, and sleep quality. Studies examining this relationship have found weak associations between breathing disturbances and arousals, although both worsen with increasing altitude <xref rid="pone.0076945-NussbaumerOchsner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076945-Khoo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076945-Kinsman2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The current study, which was conducted at a lower altitude than previous studies, is the first to examine the association between AHI and sleep EEG spectral characteristics. We found a correlation between AHI and SWA, indicating that perhaps increased AHI results in subtle sleep disruption.</p><p>The second aspect is the relationship between oxygen saturation and sleep quality. Previous studies reported a positive relationship between these variables <xref rid="pone.0076945-Anholm1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076945-NussbaumerOchsner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

The power of this analysis, however, was reduced due to the smaller sample size in the subgroups. Additionally, participants were only allowed to sleep 7 hours, which may have resulted in a higher sleep propensity during subsequent nights. A further limitation is that men only were investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Tourism to moderate altitude for recreation is common worldwide.

<bold>Randomization into four groups.</bold> The 44 subjects were randomized into four groups with different order of altitude exposure. First, the baseline night in Zurich was either scheduled before or after the four consecutive nights at moderate altitude. The interval between baseline and sessions at altitude was 4 to 10 weeks. Second, the order of the stay in Davos Wolfgang and on the Jakobshorn (two nights each) was randomized.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0076945.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0076945.s003"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
