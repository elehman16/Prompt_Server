The number of patients with diabetes is also increasing in Japan, where the estimated number of patients receiving medical treatment for diabetes was approximately 2.37 million in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, the numbers of Japanese individuals &#x0201c;strongly suspected of having diabetes&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;in whom diabetes cannot be ruled out&#x0201d; were estimated at approximately 8.9 and 13.2 million, respectively, in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The major symptom of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which accounts for approximately 90% of all cases, is chronic hyperglycemia. This leads to microvascular and macrovascular complications, including myocardial infarction and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Previous large clinical trials have emphasized the importance of intensive glycemic control, showing that it could reduce these complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although various types of oral antidiabetic agents are widely used, including sulfonylurea, biguanide, thiazolidine, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, and &#x003b1;-glycosidase inhibitors, inadequate glycemic control is often found in clinical practice with monotherapy or combination treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Several other concerns about these antidiabetic agents have also been noted, such as hypoglycemia, weight gain, and gastrointestinal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. New classes of antidiabetic agents are therefore needed, with distinct mechanisms of action from those of the currently available agents. Ideally, these new compounds should help achieve effective glycemic control and be well tolerated.</p><p>The kidneys contribute to maintenance of normal plasma glucose levels by reabsorbing approximately 180&#x000a0;g of glucose each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], ensuring that less than 1% of filtered glucose is excreted in urine. Most of the glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules via the sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. SGLT1 and SGLT2 are subtypes of this transporter, and SGLT2 reabsorbs 90% of filtered glucose, while SGLT1 reabsorbs the remaining 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Because SGLT2 acts in an insulin-independent manner, it represents an attractive therapeutic target for T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some SGLT2 inhibitors, including ipragliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, show potent and selective SGLT2 inhibition in vitro and reduce plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in diabetes animal models as well as in patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have already been approved by the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and are under review by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan, for the treatment of T2DM.</p><p>Luseogliflozin is a novel SGLT2 inhibitor that is currently under development for the treatment of T2DM. It has been shown to increase urinary glucose excretion (UGE) and to decrease plasma glucose levels in various animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Luseogliflozin has been shown to act as a potent and selective SGLT2 inhibitor, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 2.26 nM, 1,765-fold lower than its IC<sub>50</sub> for SGLT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This potency would enable safer usage of lower amounts of luseogliflozin than of other agents in the same class for the treatment of diabetes. The present studies were conducted to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics by administering single and 7-day multiple doses of luseogliflozin to healthy male Japanese subjects. Here, we report the results of this first-in-human study of luseogliflozin, a novel antidiabetic compound.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The present studies were conducted in accordance with the standards of the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and Good Clinical Practice.

In addition, analysis of the pharmacodynamic effects of 1, 3, and 9&#x000a0;mg luseogliflozin (see below) indicated that a dose of 5&#x000a0;mg would be appropriate for evaluation of food effects. The subjects who received 5&#x000a0;mg luseogliflozin or placebo under fasting conditions were therefore administered a second dose of 5&#x000a0;mg luseogliflozin or placebo under preprandial conditions&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;days after the first administration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

All AEs were mild and no hypoglycemia was observed. Multiple doses of luseogliflozin for 7&#x000a0;days did not increase the frequency or severity of AEs.</p><p>Since SGLT2, especially located at renal proximal tubules, is the target of SGLT2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], renal tubule function was one of our major concerns. However, in these studies, there were no abnormal changes in markers of renal tubule function. An AE related to renal function, increased urinary beta 2 microglobulin, was observed in one subject who received 9&#x000a0;mg luseogliflozin in the SAD study, while no renal AEs were observed in the MAD study. Since this AE was only observed once, was mild in severity, and reversible without treatment, its clinical effect was considered minor. Furthermore, no clinically significant changes were observed in the other renal function test values (blood and urine creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, blood and urinary uric acid, blood cystatin C, urinary &#x003b2;-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and urinary type IV collagen) and no clinically significant changes were observed in blood or urinary electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chlorine, calcium, and phosphorus) in these two studies.</p><p>Because SGLT2 inhibitors cause glucosuria, they could potentially increase the risk for urinary tract or genital infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. An AE related to such infections, urethritis, was observed in one subject who received 25&#x000a0;mg luseogliflozin in the SAD study, while none were observed in the MAD study. This AE was mild and the subject recovered with medication. In addition, quantitative assessment of bacteria in urine did not produce findings suggestive of an increased risk of urinary tract infection in the MAD study. However, an elevated risk of infection cannot be ruled out as clinical studies of another SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, in patients with T2DM showed a higher frequency of urinary tract and genital infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These may not have been observed in the present study owing to a low incidence of these AEs with luseogliflozin use, combined with the small sample size and short administration period employed.</p><p>Reducing postprandial glucose excursion is difficult in patients with T2DM. Our results indicated that luseogliflozin may help solve this problem. Standard deviations of <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> were small at all tested doses, indicating that luseogliflozin may exhibit consistent efficacy, and <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> was short, regardless of dose. These pharmacokinetic profiles indicated that luseogliflozin administration would be expected to provide consistent plasma levels and therefore improve postprandial glucose excursion consistently.</p><p>Our pharmacokinetic analyses also indicated that the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and AUC<sub>inf</sub> were dose-proportional and not affected by food intake. The mean <italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of luseogliflozin after a single administration (9.23&#x02013;13.8&#x000a0;h) was not dose-dependent at doses of 9&#x000a0;mg or less, and was slightly longer at doses of 15&#x000a0;mg and 25&#x000a0;mg. These results may also contribute to a stable treatment effect and improved glycemic control in patients with diabetes.</p><p>Drug metabolism and elimination were not altered by multiple dosing. In the MAD study, examination of luseogliflozin plasma trough concentrations, AUC data on Days 1 and 7, and mean daily urinary luseogliflozin excretion rates indicated that no abnormal accumulation of this drug occurred.</p><p>As expected, a substantial amount of UGE was observed after luseogliflozin administration in healthy subjects. The mean UGE for 24&#x000a0;h in the SAD study increased in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum of approximately 70&#x000a0;g. The mean daily UGE after the last administration of luseogliflozin in the MAD study was about 60&#x000a0;g for both 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg doses. The incremental change in UGE was smaller at higher doses of luseogliflozin than at lower doses. The maximum amount of daily UGE after luseogliflozin administration was comparable to that after administration of other SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ipragliflozin) in healthy subjects, which was approximately 70&#x000a0;g/day after single dose and approximately 50&#x02013;55&#x000a0;g/day after multiple dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Further, the doses of luseogliflozin used in these studies (up to 25&#x000a0;mg for SAD study and 10&#x000a0;mg for MAD study) were lower than those used in previous tests of SGLT2 inhibitors (50&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg at the maximum dose in each study). Luseogliflozin thus possibly had the advantage of producing similar UGE in the presence of lower amounts of compound. However, it is still unclear why luseogliflozin works at lower doses compared to other compounds. A possibility could be that the pharmacokinetic distribution profile of luseogliflozin contributes to its high potency, as observed in an animal study of luseogliflozin that showed higher concentration in the kidney than in the plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Luseogliflozin was expected to suppress postprandial plasma glucose levels by increasing UGE. At most postprandial time points, UGE rate was increased and plasma glucose levels were slightly decreased in subjects who received luseogliflozin, compared to placebo; similar results were observed in the canagliflozin study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Elevated postprandial glucose increased the amount of glucose filtered through the kidneys, resulting in an increase in UGE with less reabsorption in the renal tubules in the subjects treated with luseogliflozin. Therefore, luseogliflozin may be optimal in reducing postprandial glucose levels in patients who have normal renal function.</p><p>The present study indicated that luseogliflozin did not reduce plasma glucose levels significantly in healthy subjects. Fasting plasma glucose levels were comparable in subjects treated with luseogliflozin and placebo. This was consistent with the results of other SGLT2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Normal homeostatic regulation probably maintained stable plasma glucose levels, compensating for the increased UGE by increasing gluconeogenesis. It has been shown previously that glycerol generated by fat decomposition is used preferentially in gluconeogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This may possibly be an explanation for SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated reduction in body fat levels, as well as an indication that SGLT2 inhibitor use may cause fewer hypoglycemic events.</p><p>In addition, a once-daily luseogliflozin dose regimen may provide sufficient UGE. In the SAD study, UGE rates after each food intake were comparable. Furthermore, elevated UGE was also observed the day after administration of luseogliflozin. In the MAD study, the daily UGE during the administration period was stable, and the increased UGE compared to that observed with placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) were sustained for up to 3&#x000a0;days after the last administration. Thus, patient compliance may improve if sufficient efficacy can be obtained using a once-daily dose regimen.</p><p>The above-mentioned findings suggest that a once-daily luseogliflozin dose regimen may have the potential to reduce plasma glucose levels in patients with T2DM, including mild forms of T2DM and impaired glucose tolerance, without increasing their risk for hypoglycemia. However, since this study was conducted in healthy Japanese males, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of luseogliflozin in patients with T2DM remains unclear. Further clinical studies in patients with T2DM may provide further insight into the potential of luseogliflozin for the treatment of T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Luseogliflozin showed good tolerability and safety in a single-dose (1&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mg) and 7-day multiple-dose (5 and 10&#x000a0;mg) study in healthy male Japanese subjects. Luseogliflozin also showed favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, supporting the feasibility of a once-daily administration regimen. Clinical studies to investigate the safety and efficacy of luseogliflozin in patients with T2DM have recently been completed, and the results may provide further insight into the clinical utility of luseogliflozin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12325_2014_102_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 265 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial registration: JapicCTI-132353 and JapicCTI-132354.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The clinical trials described in this study and the article processing charges were sponsored by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.
