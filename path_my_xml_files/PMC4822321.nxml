One of the potential percepts during binocular rivalry is a spatial mosaic of left- and right-eye images, known as piecemeal percepts, which may result from localized rivalries between small regions in the left- and right-eye images. It is known that alcohol increases inhibitory neurotransmission, which may reduce the number of alternations during binocular rivalry. However, it is unclear whether alcohol affects rivalry dynamics in the same manner for both coherent percepts (i.e., percepts of complete left or right images) and piecemeal percepts. To address this question, the present study measured the dynamics of binocular rivalry before and after 15 moderate-to-heavy social drinkers consumed an intoxicating dose of alcohol versus a placebo beverage. Both simple rivalrous stimuli consisting of gratings with different orientations, and complex stimuli consisting of a face or a house were tested to examine alcohol effects on rivalry as a function of stimulus complexity. Results showed that for both simple and complex stimuli, alcohol affects coherent and piecemeal percepts differently. More specifically, alcohol reduced the number of coherent percepts but not the mean dominance duration of coherent percepts. In contrast, for piecemeal percepts, alcohol increased the mean dominance duration but not the number of piecemeal percepts. These results suggested that alcohol drinking may selectively affect the dynamics of transitional period of binocular rivalry by increasing the duration of piecemeal percepts, leading to a reduction in the number of coherent percepts. The differential effect of alcohol on the dynamics of coherent and piecemeal percepts cannot be accounted for by alcohol&#x02019;s effect on a common inhibitory mechanism. Other mechanisms, such as increasing neural noise, are needed to explain alcohol&#x02019;s effect on the dynamics of binocular rivalry.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>binocular rivalry</kwd><kwd>piecemeal percept</kwd><kwd>acute alcohol effect</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">ABMRF/The Foundation for Alcohol Research<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100001443</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000027</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Binocular rivalry refers to perceptual alternations between two different images presented simultaneously to the two eyes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Blake and Logothetis, 2002</xref>). Neural mechanisms mediating binocular rivalry have been the center of debate for many decades. The general consensus is that binocular rivalry is mediated by neural competition that occurs at multiple stages in the visual hierarchy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Blake and Logothetis, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wilson, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alais, 2012</xref>). One of the neural models for binocular rivalry posits that reciprocal inhibition between visual neurons representing left- and right-eye images and self-adaptation in neural signals determine the dynamics of rivalry (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lehky, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blake, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wilson, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Consistent with this model, it has been demonstrated that a higher brain concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was associated with a low alternation rate in bi-stable percepts, including binocular rivalry (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">van Loon et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that visual adaptation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Blake et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Alais et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kang and Blake, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Theodoni et al., 2011</xref>) and attention (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Chong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chong and Blake, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Paffen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hancock and Andrews, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) are critical determinants of binocular rivalry dynamics.</p><p>When two dissimilar images presented to the two eyes are relatively large, in addition to the coherent percepts of the left- or right-eye images, one can also experience piecemeal percepts, in which patches of left- and right-eye images are visible simultaneously (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kov&#x000e1;cs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Polonsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Blake, 2004</xref>). Previous studies show that piecemeal percept rarely occurs if the dissimilar images are smaller than about 7 min of arc in visual angle at fovea (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Blake et al., 1992</xref>), indicating that binocular rivalry occurs at local regions and the perceptual outcome during rivalry depends on local competitions. In other words, the coherent perception of a left- or right-eye image likely requires joint predominance of local rivalries (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fries et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alais and Blake, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Are piecemeal percepts during binocular rivalry also mediated by the same inhibitory/adaptation mechanism as coherent percepts? Despite the extensive efforts devoted to understand the mechanisms mediating perceptual switches between coherent rivalrous images during binocular rivalry, the mechanism for piecemeal percepts is less clear. It has been shown that the principles of Gestalt perceptual grouping, such as feature similarity and good continuation, can affect the joint predominance of local rivalries (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kov&#x000e1;cs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alais and Blake, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stuit et al., 2011</xref>). Besides this grouping-based account, computational models have been developed to account for piecemeal percepts. For instance, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Stollenwerk and Bode (2003)</xref> assumes that multiple neurons represent different spatial zones in the images and those representations of corresponding zones in the two-eye images compete with each other through inhibition and adaptation. When the dominant patterns differ among different zones, piecemeal percepts occur. In addition, piecemeal percepts are considered as a result from the transitional period between the two coherent percepts for the left- and right-eye images and neural noise has been suggested to play a critical role in resolving rivalry during the transition period between two rivalrous percepts (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brascamp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kang and Blake, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Acute alcohol drinking is known to increase inhibition in the central nervous system by increasing inhibitory neurotransmission or by inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Valenzuela, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Grobin et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, acute alcohol administration can be thought as a pharmacological manipulation of the inhibitory system that can affect binocular rivalry dynamics. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption reduces the alternation rate between left- and right-eye percepts during binocular rivalry, consistent with alcohol&#x02019;s increase in neural inhibitory effects (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barany and Hallden, 1947</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly and Miller, 1995</xref>). These studies, however, have focused on coherent percepts only and have not considered the influence of alcohol consumption on piecemeal percepts. This is important as the knowledge of alcohol&#x02019;s effect on the dynamics of piecemeal percepts may provide insights in the mechanisms for the dynamics of binocular rivalry. We hypothesized that if a common (inhibition) mechanism determines perceptual experiences of both coherent and piecemeal percepts during binocular rivalry, alcohol would affect the rivalry dynamics in the same manner for both coherent and piecemeal percepts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We focused on testing young moderate and heavy social drinkers, because this population can tolerate the alcohol dose used in the study without significant adverse effects and they are at risk for alcohol-related harm but have not incurred significant withdrawal or other clinical symptoms that might confound our measurements (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Caetano et al., 1998</xref>). Young moderate-to-heavy social drinkers were recruited via internet advertisements and were screened using online screening questionnaires and interview, which included demographic information, medical information (eye disease, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, mental health, etc.), the Alcohol Quantity-Frequency Interview (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cahalan et al., 1969</xref>) and the Timeline Follow-back calendar (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sobell et al., 1979</xref>) for daily estimates of alcohol drinking. Inclusion criteria were: having normal or corrected-to-normal acuity, not reporting any health and psychiatric problems including alcohol dependence that might interfere with the study procedures, consuming at least 6 or more alcoholic drinks weekly (up to 35) and engaging in binge drinking [consuming 5+ drinks/occasion for men and 4+ for women (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2005</xref>] at least twice monthly up to four times weekly.</p><p>There were 15 participants [six males and nine females, age 25(<italic>mean</italic>) &#x000b1; 2.4(<italic>SD</italic>) years; number of drinking days per month: 11.5 &#x000b1; 5.2; number of standard drinks per drinking day: 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.4; number of binge days per month: 4.4 &#x000b1; 2.2; maximum number of drinks consumed on one occasion: 7.7 &#x000b1; 2.9]. This study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Review Board and was in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall Design and Protocol</title><p>The experiment used a within-subject, double-blinded and placebo-controlled design. Each participant received either an intoxicating dose of alcohol (0.8 g/kg, i.e., equivalent to 4&#x02013;5 standard alcohol drinks (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2012</xref>) or placebo beverage on two separate days. The alcoholic beverage consisted of 16% volume ethanol, which contained 190-proof ethanol mixed with water, grape-flavored drink mix and a sucralose-based sugar substitute. The placebo beverage included 1% volume ethanol as a taste mask to reduce expectancy effects. Participants drank the assigned beverage through a straw from a plastic, lidded cup to help conceal the scent and identification of the alcohol content. Women received 85% of the dose of men as a correction for body water differences (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 1980</xref>). The total beverage volume was (<italic>mean</italic>) 435.3 &#x000b1; (<italic>SD</italic>) 81.6 ml and divided into two equal portions.</p><p>The order of the two beverage administrations was randomized, with a minimum of a 48-hour interval between the sessions. The participants were instructed to abstain from alcohol and recreational drugs for 48 hours prior to each session, and both participant and experimenter were double-blinded to the beverage content. To verify alcohol abstinence, breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) was measured using an Alco-Sensor IV (Intoximeter Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) upon arrival in each experimental session. Following BrAC measurement, the participant was provided with a light snack (non-caffeine, low-fat meal at 15% calories based on body weight) and then taken to a dark room for the binocular rivalry experiment. The participants received a tutorial and practice period in the first session, followed by the pre-beverage assessment. After this assessment, the participants drank the assigned beverage. They had 5 min to consume the first half portion, followed by a 5-min rest period, and then another 5 min to finish the second half portion. Post-beverage measurements of binocular rivalry were conducted 50 minutes after completing beverage intake. BrAC levels were measured before the binocular rivalry experiment during pre- and post-beverage assessments. This beverage administration procedure has been used extensively in previous studies and has shown reliable rising and declining breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) curves across participants (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Brumback et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2015</xref>). The BrAC levels were all zero at baseline for both sessions, confirming recent alcohol abstinence in all participants. Post-beverage BrAC levels, measured right before the binocular rivalry testing, were at 0.071 &#x000b1; 0.011 g/dl in the alcohol session or at zero in the placebo session.</p></sec><sec><title>Apparatus</title><p>Stimuli were generated using an Apple iMac computer and presented on a calibrated NEC cathode ray tube (CRT) display (MultiSync FE 991 SB). The display had 1600 &#x000d7; 1200 pixel resolution and a refresh rate of 60 Hz noninterlaced. Different stimuli were presented to each eye by projection through a mirror haploscope. The positions of the mirrors were adjusted for each participant in order to compensate for the differences in interpupillary distance.</p></sec><sec><title>Visual Stimuli</title><p>As prior studies have examined alcohol&#x02019;s effects on only simple geometric stimuli such as sine-wave gratings, it is unclear whether alcohol affects binocular rivalry with complex recognizable stimuli (e.g., between a house and a face). Such complex recognizable stimuli are perceived longer during binocular rivalry (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hastorf and Myro, 1959</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yu and Blake, 1992</xref>), indicating discrepancy in rivalry dynamics between simple geometric stimuli and complex recognizable stimuli. Thus we used two sets of stimuli in the main experiment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>), including: (1) simple stimuli that consisted of two orthogonal sinusoidal gratings (45&#x000b0; vs. 135&#x000b0;, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>) at the same spatial frequency of 4 cycle/degree, and (2) complex stimuli that consisted of a house and a face (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>). The size of all stimuli was 1&#x000b0;&#x000d7;1.5&#x000b0;. Several thin rectangular lines guided fixation. The mean luminance of all stimuli was 23.5 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The root mean square (RMS) contrasts of all stimuli were kept constant and minimum and maximum luminance were 5 and 42 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, leading to a Michelson contrast of 79%.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Binocular rivalry stimuli and reported percepts in Experiments 1 and 2.

The participants adjusted the mirrors in order to get good alignment of left- and right-eye images. When ready, the participants pressed a button in a Gamepad to start a trial, during which both the left- and right-eye stimuli were presented continuously for 40 seconds. The participants reported their perceptual experience (either one of the coherent percepts or piecemeal percept) by continuously holding a button until the percept changed. Separate buttons were assigned to report three different percepts in the experiment: percept of the left-eye stimulus, percept of the right-eye stimulus, and piecemeal percept (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>, right column). The duration of each percept was measured by taking the duration of holding a designated button. Once a trial was completed, the participants could rest and pressed a button to start the next trial. Each experiment consisted of eight trials (two stimulus types &#x000d7; four repeats), which were presented in a random order. For each stimulus type, the presentation was counterbalanced across the left and right eyes. For example, for the simple stimuli, the 45&#x000b0; grating were presented to the left eye in two trials and to the right eye in the other two trials. Each experiment lasted for approximately 15 min. Each participant completed four binocular rivalry measurements (pre-placebo, post-placebo, pre-alcohol, and post-alcohol).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>To simplify the analysis, the reported percepts were grouped into two categories, coherent percepts (i.e., perceiving the left- or right-eye image) and piecemeal percepts. For each trial, we calculated the time to rivalry onset (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Casanova et al., 2013</xref>), the first percept category and duration, the total number of percepts (coherent and piecemeal percepts combined), and percept-specific total dominance duration (i.e., total time perceiving a specific percept in a trial), the number of percepts and mean dominance duration. The mean dominance duration was computed as dividing the total dominance duration by the number percepts for each category of percepts (coherent and piecemeal). Trials with time to rivalry onset &#x02265;5 s (account for 2.3% of the total number of trials) were removed. For each test condition (Stimulus Type &#x000d7; Beverage Type &#x000d7; Time combination), percepts with the largest 2% and lowest 2% of mean dominance durations were excluded from analyses to avoid percepts with extremely short or long duration.</p><p>The time to rivalry onset, first percept category and duration, the number of percepts and dominance duration were analyzed using Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zeger and Liang, 1986</xref>) models that could account for within-subject correlations among repeated measurements and have a flexibility in fitting data with various distributions. We used a Gaussian distribution for modeling the log-transformed time to rivalry onset and log-transformed total dominance duration, a Binomial distribution for the first percept category and a Poisson distribution for modeling the number of percepts. It has been suggested that the reciprocal of dominance duration instead of the mean dominance durations follows a Gamma distribution (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Brascamp et al., 2005</xref>) and we confirmed this is the case (see <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold> for the pre-beverage rivalry data with the simple stimuli during the placebo session). Therefore, we calculated the reciprocal transformation for mean dominance duration and used a gamma distribution in the GEE modeling. For the time to rivalry onset, first percept category, and the total number of percepts, the GEE model included Stimulus Type (simple vs. complex stimuli), Beverage Type (placebo vs. alcohol), Measurement Time (pre- vs. post-beverage), and their interactions. For percept-specific measures (first percept duration, total dominance duration, number of percepts and mean dominance duration), the GEE models included Stimulus Type (simple vs. complex stimuli), Percept Category (coherent vs. piecemeal), Beverage Type (placebo vs. alcohol), Measurement Time (pre- vs. post-beverage), and their interactions. Following each of the GEE models, we used linear contrast tests to test the model terms (main effects or interactions). We were primarily interested in the significance of several interaction terms in the models, including (1) Beverage Type &#x000d7; Time to test the alcohol effect, (2) Percept Category &#x000d7; Beverage Type x Time to test whether the alcohol effect depended on the perception category, and (3) Stimulus Type x Beverage x Time or Stimulus Type &#x000d7; Percept Category &#x000d7; Beverage &#x000d7; Time to test whether the alcohol effect depended on the stimulus types. In the case that one of the above mentioned interaction terms was significant, we then conducted post-estimation pairwise comparisons to compare pre-beverage and post-beverage values within a session for each stimulus type at the Bonferroni corrected significance level of 0.0125 (i.e., four post-estimation comparisons for each stimulus type).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p><bold>The quantiles of the reciprocal of mean dominance duration <bold>(left)</bold> or mean dominance duration <bold>(right)</bold> versus the quantiles of a fitted gamma distribution for pre-beverage measurement during the placebo session with the simple grating stimuli.</bold> A gamma distribution described the reciprocal of mean dominance duration better than the dominance duration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-00489-g002"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were large individual differences in terms of total dominance duration or mean dominance duration for coherent and piecemeal percepts (see <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold> rivalry data during the placebo session, collapsing stimulus types and measurement time), with some subjects predominantly perceiving coherent percepts while others had a more balanced coherent and piecemeal predominance. Note that the participants in our study were moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinkers (in contrast, typical binocular rivalry studies used normal subjects probably with a light drinking pattern). It is known that chronic alcohol exposure may change the balance of inhibitory and excitatory processes in the brain (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Valenzuela, 1997</xref>), potentially leading to a large individual difference.

These results indicate that alcohol affects coherent and piecemeal percepts differently. That is, alcohol reduced the number of coherent percepts (without changing mean dominance duration) but increased mean dominance duration for piecemeal percepts (without changing the number of piecemeal percepts), leading to a reduction in total coherent percept duration but an increase in total piecemeal duration (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p><bold>The number of percepts <bold>(A)</bold> and mean dominance duration <bold>(B)</bold> measured at Pre- and Post-beverage for Placebo and Alcohol sessions for the two stimulus types, simple stimuli (top), and complex stimuli (bottom).</bold> Error bars are &#x000b1;SEM. <sup>&#x02217;</sup><italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0125 for paired comparisons between pre- and post-beverage measurements in the same session.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-00489-g005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p><bold>Time to rivalry onset <bold>(A)</bold>, first percept category <bold>(B)</bold> and first percept duration for the simple stimuli <bold>(C)</bold> and complex stimuli <bold>(D)</bold>.</bold> Error bars are &#x000b1; SEM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-00489-g006"/></fig><p>It is known that acute alcohol intake impairs contrast sensitivity (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pearson and Timney, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the alcohol&#x02019;s effects on the dynamic of binocular rivalry may be in fact due to the impaired contrast sensitivity and decreased stimulus visibility from alcohol. To test this possibility, we measured binocular rivalry dynamics using the same stimuli while varying the contrasts (79, 59, or 39%, mean luminance at 23.5 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) in 4 lab personnel (one male and three females, age 26.8 &#x000b1; 7.2 years, light drinkers) without alcohol intake. This control experiment showed that for both stimuli types, reducing contrast increased the mean dominance duration for coherent percepts but not for piecemeal percepts (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>), indicating that a decrease in stimulus visibility could not explain the alcohol effects on piecemeal percepts (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p><bold>Mean dominance duration for different percept categories in the control experiment for the simple stimuli <bold>(A)</bold> and complex stimuli <bold>(B)</bold>.</bold> Error bars are &#x000b1;SEM. <sup>&#x02217;</sup><italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0125 for post-estimation paired comparisons.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-00489-g007"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Acute alcohol intake impairs various aspects of visual processing (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Khan and Timney, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kunchulia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Here, we investigated whether acute alcohol intake altered the dynamics of binocular rivalry, including coherent and piecemeal percepts. We hypothesized that if a common mechanism determines perceptual experiences of both coherent and piecemeal percepts during binocular rivalry, alcohol would affect the rivalry dynamics in the same manner for both coherent and piecemeal percepts. Consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barany and Hallden, 1947</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly and Miller, 1995</xref>), the current study also showed that acute alcohol intake slowed down the number of percepts between seeing coherent percepts during binocular rivalry (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref></bold>). However, alcohol affected the dynamics of piecemeal percepts differently from coherent percepts. For coherent percepts, alcohol reduced the number of percepts but not the mean dominance duration, and for piecemeal percepts, it was the opposite (alcohol did not reduce the number of percepts but did increase the mean dominance duration). Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported.</p><p>Based on Levelt&#x02019;s Fourth proposition, increasing stimulus strength (e.g., stimulus contrast) in both eyes while keeping stimulus strength equal between eyes will generally increase the alternation rate or reduce dominance duration (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Levelt, 1965</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Brascamp et al., 2015</xref>). Acute alcohol intake is known to impair contrast sensitivity, leading to a weaker stimulus strength (visibility) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pearson and Timney, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, alcohol could affect the dynamic of binocular rivalry through it&#x02019;s reduction in contrast sensitivity. Our control experiment, however, showed that changing luminance contrast affects mean dominance duration of coherent percepts but not piecemeal percepts, suggesting that it is unlikely that alcohol&#x02019;s increase in piecemeal percept duration was due to alcohol&#x02019;s reduction in contrast sensitivity. <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mueller and Blake (1989)</xref> showed the predominance time of piecemeal percepts did not vary with stimulus contrast in binocular rivalry, similar to our results from the control experiment. Interestingly, using a binocular motion rivalry paradigm (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Platonov and Goossens, 2013</xref>), an increase in random dot coherence led to an increase in dominance duration of piecemeal percepts, a result similar to our observed alcohol&#x02019;s effect, while changing stimulus contrast did not change piecemeal percept duration. Given the random-dot-coherence and contrast manipulations had different effects on rivalry dynamics, it is possible that the random-dot-coherence and contrast manipulations targeted on different mechanisms for binocular rivalry (see next paragraph for further discussion). Further, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brascamp et al. (2006)</xref> showed that a decreasing contrast led to a longer transition duration in which both superimposition (fusion) or piecemeal percepts could occur (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hollins, 1980</xref>). They reported that percepts during transitional period between left- and right-eye images were mainly superimposition (fusion) percepts with low contrast (near threshold) rivalry stimuli; while the transitional percepts were predominantly piecemeal with high contrast rivalry stimuli. In our control experiment as well the main experiment, we used a high contrast (39&#x02013;79%), which were high enough for mainly seeing piecemeal percepts instead of fusion during the transitional period (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brascamp et al., 2006</xref>). In other words, the observed alcohol effects on piecemeal percepts could not be confounded with fusion percepts that we did not ask to report.</p><p>Binocular rivalry research has pointed to the importance of mutual inhibition, adaptation and neural noise in determining rivalry dynamics. Computational modeling indicates that mutual inhibition and adaptation determines the percept choice based on two eye images, while neural noise is critical for transitional period (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brascamp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Huguet et al., 2014</xref>). Acute alcohol drinking is known to increase inhibition in the central nervous system. An increased inhibition between the representations of two images presented to two eyes is expected increase the mean dominance duration of coherent percepts. However, our study showed that the mean dominance duration for coherent percepts did not change significantly by alcohol intake. Therefore, our results could not be accounted for by alcohol&#x02019;s increase in inhibition. Previous studies have shown alcohol-induced slowdown in alternation rates when only coherent percepts were considered (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barany and Hallden, 1947</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly and Miller, 1995</xref>). The current study showed that previous findings may result from the increased piecemeal percept duration rather than from a strengthened inhibition. Instead, the reduced number of coherent percepts might be resulting from the increased duration of piecemeal percepts during the transitional period. As seen in <bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>, both the total predomaince time and the mean dominance duration were increased for piecemeal percepts after alcohol intake. Physiological investigations have shown that alcohol reduces signal-to-noise ratios or increases noise in the primary visual cortex (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Given the importance of neural noise in transitional period of rivalry dynamics, it is likely acute alcohol drinking may affect the dynamics of piecemeal percepts by increasing neural noise (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brascamp et al., 2006</xref>). In sum, our study suggested that acute alcohol intake selectively increased the duration of piecemeal percepts, potentially by increasing neural noise, leading to a reduction in the number of coherent percepts.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>DC and AK conceptualized the alcohol challenge paradigm.
