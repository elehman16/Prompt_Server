Shoulder pain is a significant problem among junior female team handball players and both male and female top-level team handball players in Norway.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>A randomized selection was performed among the best female junior teams (J 16) in the Tr&#x000f8;ndelag region of Norway in the 2014&#x02013;2015 season. Three teams were randomized to the intervention group and three teams to the control group. Players in the intervention group (n=53) participated in a seven-month, three-times-a-week shoulder-muscle strength-training program, while those in the control group (n=53) participated in a comparable handball training, but did not conduct any specific strength training during the season.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A strength-training program had no effect on the prevention of shoulder pain. Overall, the players reported shoulder pain, but graded the pain low on visual analog scale (VAS). Both the intervention group and the control group reported pain under 1 on VAS at baseline and posttest, and there was no significant difference within or between the groups when it came to the intensity of pain reported on VAS. A significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.048) was found between the groups on the sport-specific part of the quick-Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) form, but it did not fulfill the minimal demand to change and the players scored it low, something that indicates little functional problems when it comes to team handball. The intervention group was significantly stronger (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.008) on the push-ups test compared to the control group on the posttest. The intervention group increased the number of push-ups from 3.1 to 6.4, while the control group went from 2.3 to 3.6. Aside from this, there were no significant differences in between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A shoulder-strengthening program had no effect on the prevention of shoulder pain among junior female team handball players.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>shoulder</kwd><kwd>strengthening</kwd><kwd>prevention</kwd><kwd>handball</kwd><kwd>randomized</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>European team handball is among the most popular team sports in Norway and Scandinavia.<xref rid="b1-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Around 100,000 players are registered in the Norwegian Handball Federation, and two-third of the players are under the age of 17.<xref rid="b2-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> European team handball combines aspects of both basketball, American football and baseball.<xref rid="b3-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The shoulder joint of handball players is applied to excessively high stress, mainly caused by overhead throwing.

The throw arm must have a high degree of mobility combined with joint stability. The balance between mobility and stability is often disturbed, which again can lead to injuries.<xref rid="b11-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The repetitive tackles and throwing movements will eventually lead to micro-traumas in the ligament and capsule structures in the anterior aspects of the shoulder.

A MicroFET 2 handheld dynamometer (Hoggan Health Industries, Salt Lake, UT, USA) was used to objectively measure the strength.

In summary, this study showed that a strength-training program had no effect on preventing shoulder pain among junior female team handball players. The mean pain intensity measured on VAS showed no significant difference in or between the groups at baseline or posttest. Young female team handball players do report pain in the throwing shoulder but grade the pain low on VAS. A significant difference was found between the groups on the sport-specific part of the quick-DASH form, but it did not fulfill the minimal demand to change and the players scored it low, something that indicates little functional problems when it comes to team handball.</p><sec><title>Shoulder pain</title><p>No significant difference in pain intensity measured on VAS &#x0201c;today&#x0201d; was found between the intervention group and the control group or within the groups. If everything above 0 on the VAS was accounted as pain, there was a tendency toward a decrease in players reporting pain throughout the season. The intervention group went from 21 players (40.4%) that reported pain at baseline down to eight players (17.4%) at posttest. In the control group, 13 players (24.5%) reported pain at baseline, while 11 players (26.8%) reported pain at posttest. These tendencies are opposite to previous assumptions that shoulder pain will be higher during the season compared to the start of the season, since the load and the stress of the shoulder are thought to increase throughout the season.<xref rid="b29-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Andersson,<xref rid="b18-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> who also found a seasonal variance in shoulder problems, indicated that the load put on the shoulder throughout the season is not as vital for the prevalence of shoulder problems as previously thought.</p><p>If the prevalence of shoulder pain is added up for the intervention group and the control group, it shows that 32.3% (n=34) of the players reported shoulder pain at baseline, while 21.8% (n=19) reported it at posttest. A previous study done on young female handball players (32) reported similar prevalence numbers. Thirty-four percent of the 149 young, female handball players in the age 16 and 18 years reported shoulder pain in that study. Another study of 16 years old female handball players reported that 34% of the players in the intervention group and 23% of the players in the control group reported shoulder pain in the beginning of the season.<xref rid="b15-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Similar numbers are also found in a Danish study where 14% of the players reported pain now, while 33% reported pain previously.<xref rid="b33-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Since the study included both 16- and 18-year-old handball players of both sexes, it is not directly comparable.</p><p>A high prevalence of shoulder pain is also found in senior team handball. Thirty-six percent of the female elite players reported to have shoulder pain on the day of testing, while 58% reported previous or present shoulder pain (31). Among male handball players, 32% reported present shoulder pain, while 75% reported present or previous shoulder pain.<xref rid="b18-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This indicates that shoulder pain is common among both junior female handball players and senior handball players of both sex.</p><p>The mean pain intensity measured on VAS showed no significant difference in or between the groups at baseline or posttest. Both the intervention group and the control group reported pain under 1 on VAS at baseline and posttest. If we just look at the players who reported pain, the tendency was that the intervention group had less players reporting pain at posttest compared to baseline, but they reported more pain. The number of players with shoulder pain went from 13 to 11 players, while the mean pain intensity on VAS went from 2.8 to 2.5.</p><p>A previous study on young female handball players reported a mean pain intensity of 5.2, a much higher number than found that in this study.<xref rid="b30-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The study included both 16-and 18-year-old players. Other studies on younger handball players have not reported pain intensity on VAS, and it is for that reason not comparable.<xref rid="b15-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b33-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Female elite handball players also graded their shoulder pain higher on VAS, with the mean pain intensity on present shoulder pain measured to be 5.6 on VAS.<xref rid="b29-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A plausible reason for this could be that the pain increases with the higher age.</p><p>There could be a number of reasons why so many young female handball players reported to have pain in their throwing shoulder but rated it low on VAS. Pain is subjective, so what one person experiences as painful does not have to be painful for another person. Many factors can influence the experience of pain, and one of them can be the culture a person is a part of.<xref rid="b34-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b35-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Being part of an athletic environment can mean that having pain is part of the expectations a person has as a handball player. In a biopsychological aspect, one will act with the environment so that the pain signals can be modified by a non-pain-related factor,<xref rid="b34-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and because of that the athletes may have graded their pain low because feeling pain might be something that they both accept and expect.</p><p>A potential underestimation of pain intensity could also have appeared. An age of 16 years might lack a reference to both what pain is and when it comes to grading it. Another plausible explanation could be an uncertainty among the players on what is pain and aching in the muscles or delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS).<xref rid="b18-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A previous study showed that only 52% of the junior female handball players in the age group 16&#x02013;18 reported that they had sought medical help for their shoulder pain.<xref rid="b30-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In comparison, 70% of the elite female handball players sought medical help.<xref rid="b36-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A possible explanation could be that older players have a more conscious relationship to pain, and that they have medical support, such as a doctor or physical therapist, within the team.</p><p>There is always a possibility that the selection is not representative for the study population.<xref rid="b37-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> A randomized selection of the players was assured by randomizing and including both inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on personal characteristics of the players were not collected (height, weight, amount of hours of weekly training and so on). This could further have assured that the selection was properly representative for the study population.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Quick-DASH</title><p>A significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) was found between the groups on the sport-specific part of the Quick-DASH. While the intervention group decreased in score, the control group increased.

A similar result was found in a previous study where push-up was one of the strength exercises to prevent shoulder pain among young handball players.<xref rid="b15-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the study, players in the intervention group increased the number of push-ups even more on the posttest and improved the number of push-ups from 2.7 to 8.1. Since the intervention group had been training push-ups throughout the season and a learning effect therefore had been taking place,<xref rid="b38-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> the result was not so unexpected. Another possible element that could explain the increase in the number of push-ups could be maturation and the testing it-self, both of which could be a threat to the internal validity.<xref rid="b37-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>A significant change was not found within or between the groups when it came to testing the strength with a dynamometer. A possible explanation why the groups did not increase their strength could be that they did not practice specific shoulder rotation exercises. The median could have been used as an alternative measure to avoid the result being inflsuenced by potential extreme values.<xref rid="b28-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The ratio number between the internal and external rotators was not significant at baseline or posttest.</p><p>There was no significant difference between or within the two groups when it came to throwing distance. It can be argued that testing the throwing distance still standing is not a natural throwing movement since handball players use both trunk rotation and the lower extremities to increase the speed of the throw.<xref rid="b3-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The thought was that by eliminating a possible co-movement, the shoulder was tested more specifically. A three-step throw, which is more used in handball, could have been an alternative.<xref rid="b39-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation of the study is the lack of compliance. All the coaches in the intervention group got a compliance form in the beginning of the season to fill in every time the training program was completed. None of the coaches handed over the form at the end of the season, so there was no compliance in this study. Low compliance is reported in several other preventative intervention studies,<xref rid="b32-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b40-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and therefore cannot be ruled out in this study either. A monthly collection of the compliance form might have made a difference, even though several preventative intervention studies have reported low compliance despite a frequent follow-up.<xref rid="b40-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>Since the intervention group increased the number of push-ups on the posttest with over 100% (from 3.1 to 6.4), it could be argued that this is a good indication that the intervention group actually might have followed up the intervention routine. Another possible explanation of the increased number of push-ups could, of course, be maturation and the testing itself, both of which could be a threat to the inner validity.<xref rid="b37-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>Another limitation of this study, and an element to take into consideration why so many players reported to have pain but graded it low, is the fact that the players filled in the questionnaires before handball training. It is possible that the answers would have been different if they had filled in after the training, since most handball players have pain related to throwing.<xref rid="b36-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> As there were no clear recommendations in the literature, exercises for the intervention program were chosen among the spare recommendations that existed at the time being. Strength exercises were prioritized in regard to the injury mechanisms for shoulder injuries in overhead sports, and compliance was another important element that was taken into consideration when it came to choosing exercises.<xref rid="b42-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Since compliance is among the challenges in preventative intervention studies,<xref rid="b32-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b40-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> an important focus in this study was to find exercises that were resource and time saving to complete.</p><p>The strength exercises were therefore chosen with the aim of achieving a best possible compliance. It was therefore a conscious choice to use exercises that were easy to do, and that did not demand any extra equipment, since the prevention effect is made up by the exercises, the dosage and compliance. The intervention groups were visited twice in the beginning of the season. More visits throughout the season could potentially have increased the compliance, but studies have reported low compliance despite a considerable effort to motivate the intervention groups.<xref rid="b40-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>No information about the players&#x02019; general characteristics, such as height and weight, amount of weekly handball training, and strength training, was gathered. Having this information could have assured that the selection was properly representative for the study population, so the lack of this information could therefore be seen as a limitation of this study.</p><sec><title>Clinical recommendations</title><p>Future intervention studies with the goal of reducing shoulder pain among young female team handball players should implement recommendations based on new etiological studies.<xref rid="b43-oajsm-8-061" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> A better control of the intervention should be attempted, and an electrical response registration should be used.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A strength-training program had no effect on preventing shoulder pain among junior female team handball players. The mean pain intensity measured on VAS showed no significant difference in or between the groups at baseline or posttest. Young female team handball players do report pain in the throwing shoulder but grade the pain low on VAS. Both the intervention group and the control group reported pain under 1 on VAS at baseline and posttest. A significant difference was found between the groups on the sport-specific part of the quick-DASH form, but it did not fulfill the minimal demand to change and the players scored it low, something that indicates little functional problems when it comes to team handball. The intervention group performed significantly more push-ups on the posttest compared to the control group, and this increased from 3.1 to 6.4. Besides that, no significant differences were found between the groups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of
