All participants raised some form of benefit from attending Lifestyle Matters, including an improved perspective on life, trying new hobbies and meeting new friends.

Participation in meaningful activities can prevent this decline.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Occupational therapy aims to help individuals participate in both necessary and meaningful activities; it has an important role to play in health promotion and disease prevention by supporting engagement in activity and maintenance of occupational balance.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><p>The findings from recent systematic reviews support the use of psychosocial interventions for ageing well.

Lifestyle Matters was inspired by the US Lifestyle Redesign and has been adapted to the UK context.</p><p>Based on an occupational approach to healthy ageing, the manualised Lifestyle Matters intervention is designed to assist participants to improve their well-being and avoid the decline associated with social isolation and poor mental health.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It involves participants meeting in a weekly group of up to 12 people over 4&#x02009;months at a local community venue. Participants are also asked to engage in monthly individual sessions with one of the two facilitators at mutually agreed locations. Session topics can either be chosen from the manualised programme or new topics identified.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The facilitators work with the participants to explore the selected topic through discussion, activities and enactment in the community. The emphasis throughout is on the identification of participants&#x02019; own goals, empowerment through sharing strengths and skills and providing support to enable them to practice new or neglected activities independently, particularly in the community. The intervention was postulated to change behaviour through Bandura&#x02019;s theory of self-efficacy, which theorises that self-efficacy is developed through four main sources&#x02014;performance accomplishments (where success undertaking an activity builds self-belief in efficacy), vicarious experiences (seeing people similar to oneself undertake a task successfully), verbal persuasion that one has the ability to succeed in a given activity and inferences from emotional stimuli indicative of personal strengths and vulnerabilities.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>We undertook the Lifestyle Matters randomised controlled trial&#x000a0;(RCT) to examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Lifestyle Matters, the protocol for which is reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Between August 2012 and April 2013, 288 individuals living in an urban area in the North of England and 12 rural area in North Wales were recruited to the Lifestyle Matters study via general practitioner (GP) mail outs, community engagement and healthcare professional referrals. Individuals recruited to the study were randomised to either the intervention or usual care, in couples (if both individuals consented to participate in the study) or individually. Participants randomised to the intervention received the manualised 4-month Lifestyle Matters intervention, facilitated by NHS band four staff who were provided with preliminary training and supervised by qualified occupational therapists throughout delivery. Both sets of participants were provided with questionnaires at baseline, 6 and 24&#x02009;months. The primary outcome was the mental health component of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey&#x000a0;(SF-36) questionnaire, which was not significantly different between the control and intervention groups at either 6 or 24&#x02009;months.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Participants were also interviewed qualitatively at 6 and 24&#x02009;months to understand their experience of the intervention and any lasting effects.</p><p>Multi-methods research, where qualitative research is undertaken alongside quantitative methods, can be used in RCTs to explore the reasons for the quantitative findings and to explain variations in the effectiveness of an intervention.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Medical Research Council&#x000a0;Framework recommends using qualitative research alongside trials &#x02018;to explain discrepancies between expected and observed outcomes, to understand how context influences outcomes&#x02019;.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We therefore undertook a qualitative study 24 months post-randomisation to understand the long-term effects of the Lifestyle Matters intervention in order to ascertain if changes in well-being which were not identified quantitatively could be identified qualitatively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The reporting of this study conforms to the Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research&#x000a0;(COREQ) guidelines.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Recruitment and data collection</title><p>Interviews were undertaken at 24&#x02009;months postrandomisation (approximately 18 months after intervention delivery had completed) by JR (Female Research Assistant with PhD) and RC (Male Trial Manager), both having experience of undertaking interviews with older adults. Participants were recruited to the study through purposeful sampling from the intervention arm of the study. All intervention participants who had been interviewed at 6 months and had provided 24-month quantitative follow-up data were approached to participate once more (n=13). Potential participants were first approached by JR or RC via a telephone call to ascertain initial interest in the study; no other previous contact was had between the researchers and participants prior to this. If interested, a participant information sheet and copy of the consent form was sent by post, and the participant was telephoned again to confirm that the information had been read, and he/she was happy to participate. Of those approached, nine participated in the substudy. Participants did not participate due to either not being contactable (n=2), not being interested in participating (n=1) or had already withdrawn consent from the main trial (n=1). Six additional intervention group participants were then approached to reflect a range of health-related experiences and abilities (based on their SF-36 scores at 24 months follow-up, age, location (North Wales/Northern England) number of intervention sessions attended and professional background (skilled, non-skilled) and gender). Four of these consented, with participants not participating due to not being contactable (n=1) and not being interested in participating (n=1). In total, 13 participants were interviewed at 24 months. Participant demographics are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. The average age of participants was 73.0 years and ranged from 65 to 88 years. Six males were interviewed and six participants lived alone. The average SF-36 score of the sample was 82.7.

Although sample size was prespecified, data saturation was discussed and confirmed following completion of all interviews; transcripts were read and themes identified to ensure that no new themes were arising in the final few interviews.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Data analysis</title><p>A deductive framework approach was used for data analysis,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> the starting point for which was the theory by which the intervention was postulated to function (as described above). Framework Analysis is a five-stage process of: familiarisation, forming a thematic framework, indexing, charting and mapping and interpretation. Familiarisation was achieved through reading and rereading a selection of interview transcripts. A thematic framework, consisting of major themes and one level of minor themes, was developed by two researchers (JR and RC). A small number of transcripts were coded using the framework, after which the researchers met to discuss the framework and finalise any changes that needed to be made. The same two transcripts were coded by three researchers (JR, RC and OO) to ensure comparable coding; any differences were discussed. All other transcripts were coded by one researcher using NVIVO V.10 software. Matrices were then developed, with one theme per matrix. Themes were derived from the data. Matrices were split into activities, attitudes and personal resources, health, mobility, quality of life (overview), social, family, community and other experiences and effects of Lifestyle Matters. These matrix charts were then examined for cross cutting themes and patterns in the data were mapped to inform the final level of interpretation. In order to report the results in a coherent manner, health, mobility and quality of life matrices were combined to form &#x02018;mental and physical health&#x02019;. Attitudes and personal resources and community were combined to form &#x02018;personal and community resources&#x02019;. New matrices were coded using elements of other charts to form the following new major themes: new skills and knowledge, change in routine, new leisure activities, meeting new people, family commitments and bereavement. We attempted to identify if the intervention increased self-efficacy through any of Bandura&#x02019;s four sources of self-efficacy (verbal persuasion, performance accomplishment, emotional arousal and vicarious experience), using the participant&#x02019;s own words. Participants did not feedback on the findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>All participants gave written informed consent for participation in the study. Participants were telephoned to ascertain their interest in participating, and were sent a consent form and information sheet that explained the purpose of the study. The consent form was then signed in the presence of a researcher (RC or JR) by the participant on the day of the interview, when consent to record the interview was also obtained. Ethical approval for the main trial and this qualitative substudy was granted by the South Yorkshire Research Ethics Committee (reference number 12/YH/0101). Transcripts were anonymised prior to data analysis in order to preserve confidentiality.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>

Many participants described a process of adapting the type of activity they undertook following changes in their circumstance&#x02014;two participants swapped active hobbies for sedentary ones (e.g., walking for cooking) following mental or physical decline; other participants, following a change in community resources, had to find new activities. A few participants had to adapt their activities following bereavement of their partner. Participants displayed self-efficacy to adapt to their new circumstances, although only two of the interviewed intervention participants were able to attribute this adaptability to the intervention. It is significant therefore that these two individuals had recently experienced a challenge in their lives immediately prior to their engagement in the intervention; one had been recently bereaved and the other had recently had to adjust to a reduction in mobility. This finding indicates that the Lifestyle Matters intervention was most meaningful for those at a &#x02018;trigger point&#x02019; in their life which demanded transition and change. The intervention assisted those in the intervention arm who were at this trigger point to adapt to their new circumstances. Lifestyle Matters provided sign-posting to new activities for those individuals whose current activities were no longer available. Self-efficacy was boosted by providing participants with performance accomplishment (where participants succeeded at new activities) and modelling influences (where participants witness their peers undertake activities successfully).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Emotional arousal was provided by improving mental health and participant&#x02019;s outlook on life. It is clear that for two participants, the intervention assisted an increase in self-efficacy, which resulted in change in behaviour and increases in quality of life. For other intervention participants, there are examples described above of their self-efficacy increasing, but this did not result in a major change in their day-to-day activities and resulting quality of life. It is evident that barriers were present which prevented participants from adapting&#x02014;barriers included family commitments, physical and mental health, community resources and bereavement.</p><p>This study has a number of strengths. Interviews were undertaken and analysed by two researchers, ensuring that objectivity was maximised. It should be noted that these interviews were undertaken during the winter at a time of prolonged snow and icy conditions; such weather conditions have previously been shown to reduce physical activity levels in older adults with self-reported limitations in activities of daily living.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Participants were asked to discuss life events covering a 2-year period. Recall may have also been an issue, especially when discussing the impact of an intervention they received 2&#x02009;years previously. Participants experience of the intervention and resulting increases in self-efficacy were linked to Bandura&#x02019;s four sources of self-efficacy through analysing participant&#x02019;s experience of the intervention and associated benefits. It was difficult to determine if possible increases in self-efficacy (e.g., increased confidence) were due to vicarious experience or mastery experiences, as participants did not discuss explicitly which aspect of the intervention led to such changes.</p><p>This qualitative study highlights that in the Lifestyle Matters study, only a small number of participants were at a &#x02018;trigger point&#x02019;. This is in contrast to the US Lifestyle Redesign studies, and the UK feasibility study which was undertaken prior to the RCT, which suggest that all participants gained from the intervention in a meaningful way when assessed in the USA<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 22</xref> and in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, this difference may be explained by the lack of long-term qualitative follow-up in these preceding studies; qualitative work was not undertaken in the US studies, and the UK feasibility study qualitatively followed&#x000a0;up participants directly after the cessation of the facilitated group sessions and therefore did not assess the long-term impact of the intervention.</p><p>The quantitative and qualitative findings from this work did not demonstrate that the intervention had any impact on quality of life at population level. The majority of those recruited to participate reported being busy, active and resourceful, engaged in a diverse range of activities and with established social networks and it can therefore be argued that they had little to gain from the intervention. Inability to identify those at risk of mental decline appears to be a prime reason for the findings obtained through both quantitative and qualitative enquiry. Another issue that may have contributed includes the duration of the intervention (4 months), which was far shorter than for the US Lifestyle Redesign studies (6 months duration) and for the Lifestyle Matters feasibility study (8 months duration).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 22</xref> A longer delivery duration can give those with potentially &#x02018;hidden&#x02019; challenges the time to become sufficiently confident to work with others to explore solutions. In addition, it can be argued that implicit issues such as social desirability and unacceptable disease bias,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> which have been identified in other qualitative studies,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> may mean that the benefit of the intervention was under-reported. One of the aims of the group sessions was to aid participants in moving forward together with all parties taking an active role in organising outings and meet ups. Unfortunately, the majority of participants did not continue in their groups after the cessation of the intervention, often because the person who volunteered to continue to organise the groups did not make contact with the other group members.</p><p>Clinicians and policy makers should consider who is best to facilitate an intervention such as Lifestyle Matters. In the current study, the facilitators were NHS band four therapists, who did not have in-depth training in how to manage such groups (although they did receive study-specific training). More highly trained facilitators, such as occupational therapists, may have improved the delivery of the intervention. In addition, the Lifestyle Matters intervention could be further developed in order to improve the benefit to participants. Although they were not asked specifically, none of the interviewed participants mentioned the one-to-one sessions in their interview or stated they had gained any benefit from them; the intervention could therefore be further developed by increasing the understanding of the purpose of the one-to-one sessions with both the intervention participants and facilitators.</p><p>Future research needs to be undertaken in order to identify how isolated older adults can be identified and recruited to preventative health interventions such as Lifestyle Matters. The fact that only 2 out of 13 intervention participants gained &#x02018;major&#x02019; benefit from the intervention could be due to the recruitment methods used in this study, where participants were recruited, in the majority, via GP mail outs, resulting in a physically and mentally well population. The majority of participants who were interviewed in this study were not at a &#x02018;trigger point&#x02019; in their life when they were in need of a health and well-being intervention such as Lifestyle Matters. Despite the emphasis current guidance places on recruiting isolated older adults to preventative lifestyle interventions, other studies have also discussed issues with identifying such individuals.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 26 27</xref> Future evaluations should be undertaken to assess the viability of other recruitment techniques, such as respondent-driven sampling, which has been used previously to recruit isolated adults with HIV.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
