BCG-vaccinated South African infants were randomized to receive modified vaccinia virus Ankara, expressing the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> antigen 85A (MVA85A), or placebo. MVA85A did not significantly boost the protective effect of BCG. Cryopreserved samples provide a unique opportunity for investigating the correlates of the risk of tuberculosis disease in this population. Due to the limited amount of sample available from each infant, preliminary work was necessary to determine which assays and conditions give the most useful information. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with antigen 85A (Ag85A) and purified protein derivative from <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> gamma interferon (IFN-&#x003b3;) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot) and a Ki67 proliferation assay. The effects of a 2-h or overnight rest of thawed PBMC on ELISpot responses and cell populations were determined. Both the ELISpot and Ki67 assays detected differences between the MVA85A and placebo groups, and the results correlated well. The cell numbers and ELISpot responses decreased significantly after an overnight rest, and surface flow cytometry showed a significant loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Of the infants tested, 50% had a positive ELISpot response to a single pool of flu, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (FEC) peptides. This pilot work has been essential in determining the assays and conditions to be used in the correlate study. Moving forward, PBMC will be rested for 2 h before assay setup. The ELISpot assay, performed in duplicate, will be selected over the Ki67 assay, and further work is needed to evaluate the effect of high FEC responses on vaccine-induced immunity and susceptibility to tuberculosis disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Disease caused by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> continues to be a major global health problem. In 2012, there were 8.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide and 1.3 million people died of the disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG), the only licensed TB vaccine, has variable efficacy, ranging from 0 to 80%, depending on the geographical location and population (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A vaccine which is able to provide universal protection is urgently needed. The lack of a known correlate of protection against disease caused by infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> continues to be a major obstacle for the TB vaccine field, making it difficult to select which vaccines should progress to large-scale efficacy trials and to predict how successful those vaccines will be. Since 2002, more than a dozen candidate vaccines have entered into clinical testing (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), with the aim of boosting the efficacy of BCG or replacing it altogether. Only a few of these candidate vaccines have progressed to large-scale efficacy trials (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The results of the most advanced of these, a phase IIb safety and efficacy trial of modified vaccinia virus Ankara, expressing the <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> antigen 85A (MVA85A) in BCG-vaccinated South African infants, were published in February 2013 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). MVA85A did not significantly improve the efficacy of BCG in this population, despite promising preclinical data from animal models (6&#x02212;9) and the induction of potent and durable T cell responses in earlier phase I/IIa clinical trials (10&#x02013;13). Although enhanced protection was not achieved in this population, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stored pre- and postvaccination provide a unique opportunity to investigate immunological differences between those infants who went on to develop TB disease and those who did not. With limited PBMC available to do this, careful planning was needed in order to select the assays which give the most relevant and diverse information. Prior work using the mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) assay and gene expression analysis demonstrated that high-quality data can be obtained using samples from the same population of South African infants, and these two assays (our unpublished data) will be included in the correlate analysis. The aim of this work was to determine which other assays have utility for inclusion. Here we describe some pilot work carried out to evaluate the optimum time that thawed PBMC should be rested before setting up immunological assays and compare antigen-specific responses to antigen 85A (Ag85A) and purified protein derivative (PPD) from <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> in the gamma interferon (IFN-&#x003b3;) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot) and the Ki67 proliferation assays. The utility of cell surface flow cytometry was also evaluated. This process of assay selection and optimization, prior to the processing of the valuable correlate samples, has relevance for all trials of new vaccines, where the amount of sample available for analysis will always be limited.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Origin of samples. (i) Infant samples.</title><p>Samples used in these pilot experiments were cryopreserved PBMC from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb efficacy trial of the candidate TB vaccine, MVA85A, in BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative South African infants (South African National Clinical Trials Register DOH-27-0109-2654, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> registration no. NCT00953927). Collection of these trial samples was approved by the University of Cape Town Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee, the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee, and the Medicines Control Council of South Africa. The samples used were selected from a subgroup of infants on whom gene expression analysis had already been planned, and the remainder were from those infants who were lost to follow-up. They were not from cases (infants who went on to develop TB disease) nor from matched controls.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>(ii) Adult samples.</title><p>Samples used in this study were cryopreserved PBMC from BCG-vaccinated, United Kingdom adults, 28 days after MVA85A vaccination (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> PFU) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> registration no. NCT01194180).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Experimental design.</title><p>Infants enrolled in this trial were 4 to 6 months old and had received BCG (Danish 1331; Statens Serum Institute [SSI], Denmark) within 7 days of birth. They were randomized to receive an intradermal vaccination with either MVA85A (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> PFU) or placebo (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida</named-content> skin test antigen) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Two subsets of samples were used in this work. The first set consisted of PBMC taken at 0 to 7 days prevaccination and 28 days postvaccination from 30 infants given MVA85A and 30 given placebo. These samples were used for the Ki67 proliferation assay, to quantify the proliferative potential of PBMC when stimulated with mycobacterial antigens, and for the <italic>ex vivo</italic> IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot assay, to quantify the magnitude of the response to mycobacterial and nonmycobacterial antigens. The ELISpot responses were also used to assess the intra-assay variation, comparing responses across either duplicate or triplicate antigen wells. The correlation between the two assays was investigated.</p><p>The second set of samples consisted of pre- and postvaccination PBMC from 15 infants from each group (MVA85A and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida</named-content> placebo). Due to the logistics of processing the large number of case and control samples in the TB correlates of risk study, it is desirable to thaw and rest PBMC overnight. This set of samples was used to compare <italic>ex vivo</italic> IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses when PBMC were rested for 2 h or overnight. A subset of 10 of these samples was used for cell surface flow cytometry to identify cell populations and determine differences between a 2-h and an overnight rest. As a comparison to the infant samples, PBMC from 12 adults at 28 days after MVA85A vaccination were subjected to the same thawing and resting conditions and were used for cell surface flow cytometry and IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot assays.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Cell thawing.</title><p>Two vials of cryopreserved PBMC from each sample were rapidly thawed in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath and transferred to a 15-ml Falcon tube containing 10 ml R10 (RPMI medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate). PBMC were pelleted, supernatants were discarded, and the samples were resuspended in 10 ml R10 with 20 &#x003bc;l Benzonase (25 U/&#x003bc;l) (Merck Chemicals Ltd.) and rested overnight at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For the 2-h versus overnight comparison, PBMC were split into equal volumes; one set was rested for 2 h, and one set was rested overnight. PBMC were counted on a Casy counter (Roche) and split into the appropriate volumes for each assay. In some cases, there were inadequate numbers of cells to perform all assays and use all conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot assay.</title><p>The <italic>ex vivo</italic> IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot assay was performed on both subsets of samples, thawed PBMC from prevaccination and 28 days postvaccination as previously described (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In a 96-well ELISpot plate (Millipore), triplicate wells containing 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PBMC were stimulated with a single pool of Ag85A peptides, consisting of 66 15-mer peptides, overlapping by 10 amino acids (2 &#x003bc;g/ml/peptide) (Peptide Protein Research), BCG from pooled SSI vaccine vials (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml), purified protein derivative (PPD) from <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) (SSI), FEC, consisting of a single pool of flu, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptides (10 &#x003bc;g/ml/peptide) (Peptide Protein Research), and combined TB10.3 and TB10.4 peptides (10 &#x003bc;g/ml/peptide) (Peptide Protein Research). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Sigma) was used as a positive control, and unstimulated wells were used as a measure of background IFN-&#x003b3; production. The results are reported as spot-forming cells (SFC) per million PBMC, calculated by subtracting the mean of the unstimulated wells from the mean of triplicate antigen wells and correcting for the numbers of PBMC in the wells. A response was considered positive if the mean number of spots in the antigen well was at least twice the mean of the unstimulated wells and at least 5 spots greater.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Ki67 proliferation assay.</title><p>PBMC were counted and plated in 24-well plates at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> PBMC/1 ml R10. Plates were incubated for 6 days at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with either 2 &#x003bc;g/ml PPD or 1 &#x003bc;g/ml/peptide of a single pool of antigen 85A peptides. Two wells of PBMC were left unstimulated in R10. After 3 days, PHA was added to one of the unstimulated wells at 0.3 &#x003bc;g/ml. Three days later, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with amine-reactive viability dye (Live/Dead fixable red dead cell stain; Invitrogen). Cells were then permeabilized with Perm/Wash (BD Biosciences) and incubated with monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD3-AF700, anti-CD4-PB, anti-Ki67-phycoerythrin (PE) (BioLegend), and anti-CD8-allophycocyanin (APC)/AF750 (Beckman Coulter). Cells were then washed and acquired on a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Dead cells were excluded from the analysis, while singlet CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were included. Proliferating cells are presented as the percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> T cells out of the total CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

This work used pre- and postvaccination PBMC from a phase IIb efficacy trial of MVA85A in BCG-vaccinated South African infants and showed that high-quality data can be obtained from these cryopreserved samples.</p><p>Cell counts were variable, ranging from 1.1 to 23.3 million (median, 7.7 million) for the 2-h rest and dropping significantly overnight (median, 6.9 million). For most subjects, ample PBMC were available to carry out the desired assays and conditions, suggesting that it is worthwhile to plan to carry out multiple assays on the case versus control samples, as, based on the cell counts in this study, sample sizes will be large enough to make meaningful comparisons within each assay.</p><p>Both the <italic>ex vivo</italic> IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot and Ki67 proliferation assays were able to detect differences in responses to antigen 85A between the placebo and MVA85A-vaccinated groups at 28 days postvaccination. The ELISpot assay was also able to detect a difference between pre- and postvaccination responses to antigen 85A in the MVA85A group, which the Ki67 assay did not, possibly due to a lower number of samples available for the Ki67 assay in the MVA85A group at D0. The baseline responses to the PPD were high due to all infants receiving BCG vaccination at birth, but neither assay detected an increase in response to the PPD after vaccination with MVA85A. This is in contrast to previous findings in BCG-vaccinated United Kingdom adults and South African adults, adolescents, and children, where we see significant increases in responses to both Ag85A and PPD after vaccination with MVA85A (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The lack of an increase in PPD responses in infants may be due to the recency of the BCG vaccination and the fact that the corresponding Ag85A responses are much lower than those we see in adults. There was good agreement between the two assays, with significant correlations for PPD responses at both the baseline and D28 and for antigen 85A responses at D28. The lack of correlation between the assays for antigen 85A responses at baseline is probably due to the very low responses detected at this time point. As a result of these findings and due to the cell-intensive nature and length of time involved in the Ki67 assay, we decided that the IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot assay would be taken forward for the full correlate analysis and the Ki67 proliferation assay would not be performed on further samples from this cohort.</p><p>Intra-assay variability was determined by looking at both duplicate and triplicate repeats in the ELISpot assay. Both numbers of repeats produced excellent ICC values, suggesting that it is sufficient to carry out the ELISpot with duplicate antigen wells, thus saving a considerable number of valuable PBMC for use in other assays.</p><p>Due to the logistical advantage, many trials of new vaccines perform analyses on cryopreserved PBMC. However, the loss of responses and therefore the loss of sensitivity of an assay with the use of cryopreserved samples instead of fresh must be minimized. Logistically, an overnight rest of thawed PBMC is desirable; however, a significant decrease in ELISpot responses for all of the antigens tested for both infant and adult samples was observed when PBMC were rested overnight compared with that when the same samples were rested for only 2 h. Cell surface flow cytometry to determine cell populations in the infant samples showed a significant loss of percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells overnight, which might explain the loss of antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; production in the ELISpot. A loss of monocytes, although not significant, might also result in lower levels of antigen presentation. As a consequence of this result, future assays will be set up after a rest of only 2 h as this will minimize the loss of antigen-specific responses.</p><p>The inclusion of FEC, a nonmycobacterial pool of CD8 epitopes, in the ELISpot assay provided some interesting results. While 50% of infants had no response to these peptides at either the baseline or D28, the remaining 50% had positive responses, with a median of 102 SFC/million PBMC. Infants in this trial were 4 to 6 months old when enrolled, so even at this very young age, a noticeable proportion have immunological memories of exposure to at least one of these viral pathogens. It will be of interest and possibly of relevance to determine which of these pathogens the infants are responding to. As a result, in the study of the correlate samples, separate pools of EBV, CMV, and influenza peptides will be included in the ELISpot panel.</p><p>An immune correlate analysis of the phase III HIV vaccine efficacy trial with RV144 used 6 assays for the primary analysis, selected on the basis of reproducibility, ability to detect postvaccine responses, and uniqueness of responses (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The preliminary work we have shown here has also demonstrated the importance of selecting assays that are reproducible and sensitive enough to detect differences between groups and, importantly, those that measure different aspects of the immune response. This pilot study has been essential in determining the optimal assays and conditions to continue with for the TB immune correlate study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Published ahead of print</bold> 14 May 2014</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the trial participants and their families and the MVA85A 020 trial study team.</p><p content-type="financial-disclosure">This work was supported by the <funding-source>Wellcome Trust, Aeras, Oxford-Emergent Tuberculosis Consortium (OETC) Ltd.</funding-source>, and <funding-source>NEWTBVAC</funding-source> (<award-id>EC FP7</award-id>).
