As an alternative to traditional RP, laparoscopic RP was first performed by Schuessler et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> in 1997 and further developed and subsequently refined by Guillonneau and Vallancien<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> as minimally invasive surgery. Laparoscopic RP had marked strengths including a smaller incision, less surgical site infection, less blood loss, less postoperative pain, and a shorter hospital stay. However, due to the long learning curve resulting from the loss of haptic feedback, natural hand-eye coordination, and dexterity, laparoscopic surgery has not completely supplanted the open approach.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Robotic surgery was developed to overcome these limitations of laparoscopic RP, and since its inception in 2001, RARP has rapidly become a predominant procedure for the surgical treatment of localized prostate cancer in the world. Although they lead to fewer overall complications, a quicker convalescence, and improved potency and continence outcomes, complications of these procedures have been described with the dissemination of minimally invasive RPs. Of these, complications relating to the positioning of the patient have been some of the most discussed issues to date, both in laparoscopic RP and RARP.</p><p id="p0060">RARP requires patients to be placed in a steep Trendelenburg position, which is typically defined as a greater than 30-degree tilt of the bed below horizontal, with the head in the lowest position.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The Trendelenburg position was initially described by a pioneering German surgeon, Freidrich Trendelenburg, in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, and this position has been commonly used to cause the bulk of abdominal viscera to slide toward the diaphragm, providing a more favorable operative field for lower abdominal and pelvic procedures. With the popularization of the Trendelenburg position, many studies have revealed significant negative physiologic effects of this head-down position, particularly when maintained for long periods of time.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In RARP as well, several complications ranging from mild subcutaneous emphysema to devastating ischemic optic neuropathy related to prolonged exposure to the steep Trendelenburg position have been reported.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p id="p0065">The steep Trendelenburg position during RARP increases IOP,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and an elevated IOP decreases the perfusion pressure to the optic nerve,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> which can lead to increased risks of ischemic optic neuropathy and visual loss. Despite theoretical posture-related concerns, the impact of steep Trendelenburg on ocular injuries appears to be applicable to a broad range of patients undergoing RARP. For example, Hoshikawa et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> conducted a prospective study to evaluate the effect on the visual function of RARP patients by increased IOP, and concluded that steep Trendelenburg positioning within 5&#x000a0;hours poses little or no risk from IOP increases in patients without pre-existing ocular disease. Meanwhile, Wen et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> also reported that rates of ocular complications in nonrobotic RP (0.22%) are comparable with those in RARP (0.17%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.110), and discussed that visual complications following RP were because of prolonged surgical time and/or excessive blood loss. These findings may suggest that some of the previously described serious ocular consequences during minimally invasive RP did not result from the increased IOP mainly due to the steep Trendelenburg position itself. However, no study has investigated the effect of the difference in angle of the Trendelenburg position on IOP change during RARP along with several operative variables such as the duration of surgery and intraoperative blood loss. Therefore, we conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled study with the aim of evaluating the effects of 25-degree and 30-degree Trendelenburg positions on IOP change along with several representative operative variables.</p><p id="p0070">In this series, a total of 30 participants were randomly divided into two groups: Trendelenburg position with the head down at 25&#x000a0;degrees, and Trendelenburg position with the head down at 30 degrees. On comparing the two groups, there were no significant differences in preoperative baseline characteristics. In addition, we found no significant difference in several operative variables including the total and console operative times, and estimated blood loss between the 25-degree and 30-degree Trendelenburg positions. These outcomes were inconsistent with the anticipated results, because we hypothesized that increasing the degree of Trendelenburg tilt would ensure a better surgical view, leading to a shorter surgical time and reduced blood loss. These findings suggest that the 25-degree Trendelenburg position can offer excellent endoscopic views and surgical outcomes compared with those of the 30-degree Trendelenburg position. The effects of the 25-degree and 30-degree Trendelenburg positions on IOP at six discrete time points were also analyzed. As shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>, IOP significantly increased time-dependently after Trendelenburg positioning in patients undergoing RARP in both groups (T3&#x02013;T5). These findings agreed with previous series.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> For example, Awad et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> suggested that the IOP increase in the steep Trendelenburg position is time-dependent, and on average, an increase of 0.05&#x000a0;mmHg in IOP per minute was observed while patients were in the Trendelenburg position. We then calculated the change in IOP compared with T1, and we found that the 25-degree Trendelenburg position significantly attenuated the elevation of IOP from baseline values in comparison with the 30-degree position. Collectively, despite being an important issue, there is no definitive evidence showing the correlation between the IOP change and postoperative visual function; however, we believe that the 25-degree Trendelenburg position RARP can reduce the risk of catastrophic ophthalmologic complications after RARP without prolonging the operative time and/or increasing blood loss during surgery, as compared with the 30-degree Trendelenburg position.</p><p id="p0075">There are several limitations of the present study. Firstly, this study included a relatively small number of patients and lacked information on major determinants of IOP, such as aqueous humor flow and the central venous pressure; thus, further analysis with larger prostate cancer cohorts evaluating position-related factors obtained during surgery is needed to draw a definitive conclusion. In addition, if the IOP values at a steep Trendelenburg position before and after intraperitoneal insufflation were measured, this would provide a comprehensive explanation of the effect of the difference in the angle of the Trendelenburg position on IOP change during RARP, considering that pneumoperitoneum has been previously shown to increase IOP.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Secondly, we failed to identify clinical factors significantly influencing IOP at each time point during RARP, hence, it would be of worth to find such factors to avoid potential visual complications following RARP. Thirdly, this study compared the effects of only 25-degree and 30-degree Trendelenburg positions on IOP; therefore, there might be a critical angle, such as 20&#x000a0;degrees, which offers excellent surgical outcomes and mitigates IOP change during RARP. Finally, this study focused on IOP change during RARP alone; however, we should assess other position-related complications such as pharyngeal and laryngeal edema, in order to confirm the safety and feasibility of RARP in the 25-degree Trendelenburg position.</p><p id="p0080">In conclusion, this is the first randomized study to assess the effects of the 25-degree and 30-degree Trendelenburg positions on several perioperative variables, mainly focusing on IOP change during RARP. Representative surgical outcomes in the 25-degree Trendelenburg position were comparable with those at 30&#x000a0;degrees. Furthermore, the 25-degree Trendelenburg position significantly attenuated the elevation of IOP from the baseline in comparison with 30&#x000a0;degrees. Although no ocular complication was observed, these findings suggest that RARP in the 25-degree Trendelenburg position may reduce the risks of position-related ophthalmic complications without increasing the difficulty of the surgical procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0085">All authors declare no conflicts of
