Fibroblasts derived from surgical scar tissue produce high levels of &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA) and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1). However, the molecular mechanisms for this phenomenon is poorly understood. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of HTS and their potential therapeutic implications. Fibroblasts derived from skin HTS were cultured and characterized <italic>in vitro</italic>. The fibroblasts were synchronized and randomly assigned to two groups: cyclic stretch and cyclic stretch pre-treated with SB203580 (a p38MAPK inhibitor). Cyclic stretch at 10% strain was applied at a loading frequency of 10 cycles per minute (i.e. 5 seconds of tension and 5 seconds of relaxation) for 0 h, 6 h and 12 h. Cyclic stretch on HTS fibroblasts led to an increase in the expression of &#x003b1;-SMA and TGF-&#x003b2;1 mRNA and protein and the phosphorylation of p38MAPK. SB203580 reversed these effects and caused a decrease in matrix contraction. Furthermore, HTS fibroblast growth was partially blocked by p38MAPK inhibition. Therefore, the mechanism of cyclic stretch involves p38 MAPK, and its inhibition is suggested as a novel therapeutic strategy for HTS.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no funding or support to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertrophic scars (HTS) are a common clinical pathological state. They are characterized by the proliferation of a large number of fibroblasts, excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and microvascular dysplasia with infiltration of inflammatory cells <xref rid="pone.0075635-Viera1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Histologically, HTS show excess accumulation of collagen fiber bundles, with a high density of endothelial cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (MFB) <xref rid="pone.0075635-Larjava1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Despite advances in our knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of HTS, their mechanism is not yet fully understood <xref rid="pone.0075635-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A constituent of HTS is the invasive growth of fibroblasts; thus, HTS can be a major problem in plastic surgery <xref rid="pone.0075635-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Fibroblasts are an important type of cells that are related to fibrillogenesis and wound healing. In scarless or regenerative healing, fibroblasts are quiescent and do not significantly proliferate, but provide enough ECM synthesis to maintain adequate tissue strength. By contrast, fibroblast activation leads to cell proliferation and ECM synthesis, reducing collagen remodeling.</p><p>MFB, the primary source of ECM contraction, are characterized by an increase in &#x003b1;-SMA and TGF-&#x003b2;1 <xref rid="pone.0075635-Honardoust1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. During the progression of HTS, fibroblasts are activated and transdifferentiated into MFB. Indeed, the fibroblasts that have been transformed to MFB express a much greater level of &#x003b1;-SMA than the parental fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0075635-Ishiguro1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, &#x003b1;-SMA has been established as a representative marker of MFB <xref rid="pone.0075635-Franz1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the process of fibrosis, a large quantity of ECM is synthesized by the MFB and deposited in the tissues and organs that are involved, resulting in structural reconstruction of the junction and functional abnormalities <xref rid="pone.0075635-Varkey1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;1 is believed to play an important role in wound healing and HTS formation <xref rid="pone.0075635-Zunwen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2;1 is a potent regulator of cellular proliferation and ECM interaction, although wound healing and scar formation are also regulated by other growth factors and cytokines <xref rid="pone.0075635-Goldberg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075635-Armour1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. To date, researchers have confirmed that TGF-&#x003b2;1 can lead normal fibroblasts to transdifferentiate to MFB <xref rid="pone.0075635-Varga1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2;1 regulates Smad, an intermediary signaling molecule. Cyclic stretch sends signals from the cell membrane into the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes, resulting in the activation of the TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smad signal transduction pathway <xref rid="pone.0075635-Ishida1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2;1 can regulate the epithelial mesenchymal transition via the Smad signaling pathway in various tissues, including the skin, lungs, kidneys and other tissues <xref rid="pone.0075635-Kawakita1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In recent years, researchers have found that some of the non-Smad pathways, such as the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, may also play a key role in signal transduction. Currently, the MAPK pathway can be categorized into four pathways <xref rid="pone.0075635-Ochicha1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Among these, p38MAPK is involved in the process of cell transdifferentiation <xref rid="pone.0075635-Omori1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. P38MAPK is also an important signal of mechanical transmission. Under cyclic stretch, p38MAPK may affect the transformation of MFB.</p><p>Normal wound healing involves a complex interaction between many cell types and the microenvironment <xref rid="pone.0075635-Gurtner1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. For children with cleft lip and palate, surgical repair may be performed to correct the defect, but the scar formation affects facial appearance and function. The patients usually have to suffer additional operations to remove the facial scar. However, the wound healing process is influenced by multiple factors that compose a complex process. One such factor is mechanotransduction, the cellular event whereby mechanical stimuli are converted into biochemical signals. <italic>In vivo</italic>, cells may experience mechanical forces through the pulsatile nature of blood flow or during the process of wound contraction <xref rid="pone.0075635-Krane1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075635-Nishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Fibroblasts play a key role in granulation tissue formation during the proliferative phase of wound healing. During this phase, fibroblasts migrate into the wound bed to proliferate and synthesize growth factors. In addition, the production of new ECM and other proteins, such as actin, is essential to wound healing <xref rid="pone.0075635-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In two-dimensional cell culture, application of mechanical force in the form of cyclic strain regimes of 6&#x02013;120 cycles per minute (cpm) has been confirmed to influence many aspects of fibroblast physiology, including migration, proliferation, protein synthesis and gene expression <xref rid="pone.0075635-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075635-Nishimura2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, studies have shown that various Rho family members can activate other targets, such as those in the p38MAPK family <xref rid="pone.0075635-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the current study, we examined the <italic>in vitro</italic> effect of cyclic stretch on the p38MAPK signal transduction pathway and transdifferentiation of fibroblasts derived from primary human HTS. Our results demonstrate that p38MAPK is involved in the activation of fibroblasts under cyclic stretch and that specific inhibition of p38MAPK blocks this effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient Inclusion Criteria</title><p>HTS patients were selected according to the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and ranged from a score of 10 to 13 <xref rid="pone.0075635-Baryza1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. HTS tissues were obtained from 10 people (7 males and 3 females, ranging in age from 6 to 38 years; mean age: 22 years), who received scar resection 6&#x02013;12 months following cleft lip and palate surgery. Clinical manifestations of the HTS included scars that exhibited obvious hyperemia, were red in appearance and had obvious hypertrophy. Patients also exhibited pruritus, pain and synesthesia and the scars were all confirmed pathologically to be in the proliferative phase. There were no local infections or ulcerations present and no cases were treated with glucocorticosteroids or radiotherapy. Prior to surgery, all patients were informed of the purpose and procedure of this study and agreed to the collection of their tissue specimens. Written consent was obtained from all participants involved in this study.

At 80%&#x02013;90% confluency, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. The samples were then digested with pancreatin for 1.0 to 3.0 minutes. Cells were observed under the inverted microscope. When their appearance changed from spindle-shaped to round, an equal volume of medium was added to terminate the digestion. Cells on the wall of the culture flask were triturated using a pipette. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm (200 g) for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed, adequate growth medium was added and the cells were triturated. The cell suspension was placed in a new culture flask and treated with growth medium for further culture.

Because of the design of the flexible culture wells, cells grow under constant tensile stress, which varies depending on the seeding position. The center areas of the wells have essentially no tensile stress while the peripheral areas have maximal tensile stress due to a gradual increase in stress from the center to the edge of the wells <xref rid="pone.0075635-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Cells at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>/L were seeded in eight Bioflex 6-well culture plates coated with Poly-L-Lysine Solution (2 ml/well).

Cells were randomly assigned to control, loading and SB203580 groups. In the loading and SB203580 groups, fibroblasts on the 6-well elastic basal membrane culture plate were loaded using an FX-4000T charger.

Transformation from HTS fibroblasts to MFBs is an important step in wound healing. During MFB differentiation, fibroblastic cells lose their migratory phenotype and become sessile. This switch is promoted by the formation of large focal adhesions that enable strong attachments between intracellular stress fibers and ECM proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin <xref rid="pone.0075635-Hinz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Strong contraction and adhesion enable the MFB to remodel tissues, even against the considerable stress arising during tissue remodeling <xref rid="pone.0075635-Hinz2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075635-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that scar fibroblast differentiation relies on &#x003b1;-SMA, TGF-&#x003b2;1 and stress. Transformation from HTS fibroblasts to MFB occurs in response to TGF-&#x003b2;1 and heightens tension in the extracellular environment <xref rid="pone.0075635-Wipff1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. MAPK, a class of highly conserved serine protein kinase within the cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0075635-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, is part of an important biological signal transduction system which participates in the mediation of cell growth, division, differentiation and death, as well as the synchronous function between cells.</p><p>The present study was done to explore the effects of cyclic stretch on the p38MAPK signal transduction pathway and fibroblast transdifferentiation in primary human HTS fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results demonstrate that cyclic stretch can lead scar fibroblasts to undergo MFB differentiation. Cyclic stretch increased the expression of &#x003b1;-SMA, TGF-&#x003b2;1 and p38MAPK in scar fibroblasts. In addition, we also demonstrate that with increased strength, the expression of &#x003b1;-SMA, TGF-&#x003b2;1 and p38MAPK was also increased. These changes were statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075635-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075635-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and suggest a role for p38MAPK in the induction of &#x003b1;-SMA and TGF-&#x003b2;1. The increase in the expression of &#x003b1;-SMA is consistent with the transdifferentiation of scar fibroblasts to MFB in response to cyclic stretch. Additionally, TGF-&#x003b2;1 is a multifunctional growth factor that plays a critical role in cell function, epithelial cell growth and ECM deposition. Overproduction of TGF-&#x003b2;1 is associated with excessive deposition of scar tissue and fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0075635-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2;1 can also activate p38MAPK <xref rid="pone.0075635-Kamaraju1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, as demonstrated in our previous study of human dermal fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0075635-Derynck1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. P38MAPK is a positive regulator of collagen synthesis in dermal fibroblasts and a mediator of TGF-&#x003b2;1, stimulating ECM production. In human dermal fibroblasts, TGF-&#x003b2;1 also has been shown to transduce signals through the p38MAPK pathway to stimulate collagen production <xref rid="pone.0075635-Kolosova1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The MAPK signaling pathway is induced by TGF-&#x003b2;1 and can modulate the outcome of the TGF-&#x003b2;1-induced responses <xref rid="pone.0075635-Javelaud1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In particular, p38MAPK has been shown to mediate Smad-independent TGF-&#x003b2;1 responses <xref rid="pone.0075635-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Thus, we can speculate that TGF-&#x003b2;1 and p38MAPK may be involved in cross-talk.</p><p>Our results show that inhibition of p38MAPK, specifically by the inhibitor SB203580, interferes with the stimulatory effects of cyclic stress on the production of ECM proteins. These findings suggest that stimulation of ECM production by cyclic strength likely results from cooperative effects of multiple signaling including p38MAPK, leading to scar fibroblast transdifferentiation to MFB. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism that mediates the action of p38MAPK on the fibrogenic response has not yet been identified. Using the p38MAPK inhibitor, our experimental results showed that &#x003b1;-SMA and TGF-&#x003b2;1 induction were reduced. Therefore, p38MAPK affected TGF-&#x003b2;1 to a certain extent. p38MAPK has also been reported to be directly required for TGF-&#x003b2;1-dependent stimulation of matrix production by dermal fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0075635-Macfarlane1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075635-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075635-Tsukada1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.
