Ranibizumab (Lucentis&#x000ae;, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) is a fragment, antigen binding (Fab) antibody that binds all forms of active VEGF-A, effectively reducing its actions on vascular endothelial cells. Both the BRAVO trial and the CRUISE trial demonstrated the effectiveness of intraocular injections of ranibizumab in improving best-corrected VA (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT) in BRVOs and CRVOs, respectively. This led to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval for use of ranibizumab for treatment of macular edema following retinal vein occlusions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-7-1377">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-7-1377">9</xref></p><p>Bevacizumab (Avastin&#x000ae;, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd), a full length monoclonal antibody that also binds all forms of VEGF-A, has been used extensively off-label to treat macular edema secondary to BRVOs and CRVOs, as well as diabetic macular edema and neovascular ARMD. A recent review of several trials indicates that intravitreal bevacizumab improves VA and reduces CFT in macular edema associated with BRVOs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-7-1377">10</xref> The Comparison of Age related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT) has demonstrated equal effectiveness of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab for the treatment of neovascular ARMD in terms of VA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-7-1377">11</xref> However, numerous studies have shown that VEGF levels are much higher in eyes with BRVOs, and highest in eyes with CRVOs when compared to eyes with ARMD, indicating a difference in the pathogenesis of the edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-7-1377">Figure 1</xref>). This also explains why macular edema is more difficult to treat in CRVO patients. Despite their similar actions, bevacizumab and ranibizumab are different molecules, with different behaviors and properties. Case reports in the literature have shown that ranibizumab may have a stronger effect in resolving macular edema in RVOs when compared to bevacizumab.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-7-1377">12</xref> Given these differences it is necessary to investigate the use of these drugs in RVOs as a clinical entity separate from neovascular ARMD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the very short-term effects of intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin&#x000ae;) versus ranibizumab (Lucentis&#x000ae;) on reducing central macular thickness (CMT) in patients with RVOs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>An institutional review board approved retrospective chart review was performed at a single center in which the charts of patients who underwent combination therapy using an anti-VEGF agent, bevacizumab or ranibizumab, and dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex&#x000ae;, Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA, USA) during the period of 2009&#x02013;2012, were evaluated. The patients were part of a subset analysis of a combination trial in which patients diagnosed with RVOs received an intravitreal injection of 0.50 mg (in 0.05 mL of solution) for ranibizumab, and 1.25 mg (in 0.05 mL of saline) for bevacizumab at baseline, followed by a scheduled Ozurdex&#x000ae; implant 2 weeks later.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-7-1377">13</xref> Patients met inclusion criteria for analysis if this was their first RVO, or if the previous anti-VEGF therapy was at least 6 weeks prior, and CMT was greater than 300 &#x003bc;m on spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT).

Six weeks after initial injection, a similar evaluation was repeated. The primary outcome measure was the resolution of initial edema as defined by CMT &#x0003c; 300 &#x003bc;m, at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after intravitreal injection of either ranibizumab or bevacizumab; and to examine if the addition of a second medication increases the number of patients who have resolution of their macular edema. Secondary outcomes included CMT reduction from baseline and VA. A two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the outcome measures between the groups at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks (4 weeks after dexamethasone implant). A Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare the number of patients that achieved CMT &#x0003c; 300 &#x003bc;m.

The CATT 2-year results demonstrated that bevacizumab and ranibizumab are essentially equal for treatment of neovascular ARMD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-7-1377">11</xref> However, the VEGF levels found in the vitreous in BRVOs and especially CRVOs are significantly higher than in ARMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-7-1377">Figure 1</xref>). Given these differences, the CATT data cannot be generalized to the macular edema in RVOs. Because of the higher VEGF levels, ranibizumab&#x02019;s higher affinity for the VEGF molecule may help to explain why it proves to be more effective in reducing CMT in this study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-7-1377">14</xref> In addition, our study only looks at very short-term data (2 weeks and 6 weeks), which may have the advantage of evaluating the anti-VEGF molecules at their time of maximum effectiveness as opposed to the cumulative effects of monthly dosing. Some have proposed that dosing every 2 weeks versus 4 weeks may be necessary for bevacizumab in cases with persistent or rebound macular edema due to overwhelming VEGF in the vitreous.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-7-1377">15</xref> This study allows us to compare these two agents at the 2-week interval.</p><p>In the BRAVO and CRUISE trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-7-1377">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-7-1377">9</xref>, ranibizumab was able to decrease baseline retinal edema by a mean of more than 250 &#x003bc;m as early as 7 days after treatment, (the earliest measured time point after injection per protocol) with even more effect at 1 month, continuing to 6 months. In addition, for CRVOs, ranibizumab was able to decrease excess foveal edema from a mean of greater than 300 &#x003bc;m at baseline, to approximately 100 &#x003bc;m at 1 month. In the BRAVO trial, ranibizumab decreased excess foveal edema from a mean of almost 280 &#x003bc;m at baseline, to approximately 150 &#x003bc;m at 1 week, and less than 100 &#x003bc;m at 6 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-7-1377">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-7-1377">9</xref> This data is based on Stratus OCT with an assumed mean foveal thickness of 212 &#x003bc;m.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-7-1377">16</xref> In clinical practice, the physician wants to know &#x0201c;is the macula dry?&#x0201d; The closest numerical surrogate to this is central field thickness measurement. In Stratus, this is commonly considered 250 &#x003bc;m (which is two standard deviations from the mean), and 300 &#x003bc;m in Cirrus. For the purposes of this study in looking at CMT, 300 &#x003bc;m was used as a cut-off for resolving macular edema. The percentage of patients who reached CMT &#x0003c; 00 &#x003bc;m, was 56.3% in the bevacizumab group versus 93.8% in the ranibizumab group at the 6 week interval (4 weeks post Ozurdex&#x000ae;). This difference in the number of patients who reached CMT &#x0003c; 300 &#x003bc;m between the two groups was statistically significant at both the 2 week and 6 week interval. In addition, when looking at overall percent change in CMT, ranibizumab had a statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) greater reduction in CMT at the 2 week and 6 week intervals when compared to bevacizumab. Despite the fact that the ranibizumab group started with a higher overall baseline CMT, more patients in the ranibizumab group (93.8% versus 56.3%) achieved a CMT &#x0003c; 300 &#x003bc;m. In terms of VA, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at baseline and each of the intervals. However, both bevacizumab and ranibizumab showed a statistically significant improvement in CMT and logMAR VA. It is interesting to note that despite the significant difference in CMT reduction between the two treatment groups, the VA was not significantly different at any of the intervals. This may be due to other variables not examined in this study such as duration of edema, degree of ischemia, or anterior segment opacities. Given that Snellen VA has less variation in possible data points when compared to OCT thickness measurements, a larger study with more patients may be more appropriately powered to find differences in VA. In addition, this study was designed to mimic clinical practice using Snellen as opposed to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) refractions and patients were not &#x0201c;pushed&#x0201d; to see as many letters as possible.</p><p>The differences in reduction of CMT when comparing the patients with CRVO versus BRVO further supports the thought that ranibizumab may be more effective in treating macular edema in disease processes with higher VEGF levels. At 2 weeks, in the patients with CRVO, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of percentage reduction of edema but not in number of patients with OCT CMT &#x0003c; 300 &#x003bc;m. However, at 6 weeks, all 8 patients with CRVO in the ranibizumab group had a CMT &#x0003c; 300 &#x003bc;m versus 6/11 patients who received bevacizumab. This may indicate that over time, bevacizumab may not provide as much of a sustained effect in the presence of higher VEGF levels. However, additional studies with larger numbers would be needed to better evaluate these effects.</p><p>As research in this area continues to grow, and more medications are developed for treating macular edema, it will become increasingly necessary to tailor treatments to the specific disease process and patient. Applying appropriate agents, alone or in combination, based on levels of chemical mediators involved in the pathogenesis of macular edema will allow us to achieve the best possible results for our patients.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study including its retrospective nature, smaller sample size, and the fact that it was carried out at a single center. In addition, patients were not randomized, as the agent injected was mostly determined by insurance coverage. This can lead to some confounding variables that may not be taken into account in this study. One other confounder was that all patients received an Ozurdex&#x000ae; implant at the 2 week visit, which may make the 6 week data more difficult to interpret in terms of comparing bevacizumab and ranibizumab. However, this would not affect the 2 week data. In addition, it is interesting to note that even with the combination therapy, the differences noted for the CMT persisted 4 weeks after the dexamethasone implant. Another limitation is that some of the patients in the bevacizumab group were previously treated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-7-1377">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-opth-7-1377">Table 3</xref>). However, less than half of the bevacizumab patients were pretreated (14 of 32), and of those, 50% achieved a CMT &#x0003c; 300 &#x003bc;m. This percentage is actually slightly higher than the overall percentage of all of the bevacizumab patients that achieved a CMT &#x0003c; 300 &#x003bc;m (47%).</p><p>Despite these limitations, we must take into consideration the fact that bevacizumab and ranibizumab are different molecules, and their differences may only become apparent in disease processes with higher levels of VEGF. Based on our study, in RVOs ranibizumab may have a more effective role in reducing CMT when compared to bevacizumab. Further study is needed to clarify longer-term data, and to provide comparison in a prospective, randomized manner. The CRAVE trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-7-1377">17</xref> (bevacizumab versus ranibizumab in treatment of macular edema from vein occlusion) is currently being carried out at other centers with a larger number of patients and will hopefully further answer this question.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>MA Singer is a consultant for Genentech, Allergan, Regeneron, Acucela, Santen, and Thrombogenics, and receives research support from Optos, Neovista, Eyegate, Ohr.
