method to enable exercise while maintaining an exercise load that is set according to an
individual&#x02019;s joint angle-torque using a haptic-based resistance training machine.
[Methods] Five participants (machine group) performed individualized shoulder internal and
external rotation training with a haptic resistance training machine, while another five
participants performed general dumbbell-based shoulder internal and external rotation
training for eight weeks. Internal and external rotation powers of subjects were measured
using an isokinetic machine before and after training. [Results] The average powers of
both shoulder internal and external rotation has been improved after training (25.72%,
13.62%). The improvement in power of external rotation in the machine group was
significantly higher than that in the control group. [Conclusion] This study proposes a
haptic-based individualized rotator cuff muscle training method. The training protocol
maintaining the joint angle-torque profile showed better improvement of shoulder
internal/external rotation than dumbbell training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Rotator cuff</kwd><kwd>Haptic machine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rotator cuff diseases are some of the most common musculoskeletal diseases among adults,
occurring frequently in both the young and the old<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are various causes and symptoms of rotator cuff diseases, and
it is important to implement treatments appropriate for each case. As one ages and the
rotator cuff weakens or tears, it becomes harder to prevent rotator cuff diseases from
occurring<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, various studies
have proposed methods to prevent these symptoms through rotator cuff muscle training
exercises<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The patterns of maximum torque and muscle activity for a given joint angle and velocity are
different for each person. Existing resistance training machines assume the general hill
type muscle model to produce a cam shape that keeps muscle activation consistent during the
exercise process and appropriate for these patterns. However, there is a limit to
maintaining the muscle activity using a cam shape<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. West et al. and Carignan et al. proposed a training machine that
enables exercise that satisfies the individual user&#x02019;s patterns of joint torque and muscle
activation using a haptic device<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. When a haptic device is used, the
individual user&#x02019;s patterns can be measured and registered using a force sensor, and the
exercise load can be adjusted to maintain the muscle activity at a steady level throughout
the exercise process. In fields such as rehabilitation, in which exercise customized to the
individual user is especially effective, various uses of exercise machines using haptic
devices have been attempted<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Because it is hard to effectively train the target muscles in a proper posture using
dumbbells unless the user is experienced in performing resistance training with them,
training using machines is advantageous for beginners. Shoulder joint rotator cuff training
exercise is necessary for athletes who actively use their rotator cuffs, such as
professional golfers, but it is also necessary for the middle-aged and older populations who
suffer from diseases such as frozen shoulder or who want to prevent such diseases. It is
difficult for this population to maintain a correct posture during rotator cuff exercises
using dumbbells or cables without some help of an assistant. However, except for expensive
isokinetic machines, resistance training machines for rotator cuff exercise that are not
easily accessible at general fitness centers. Even the rotator cuff training exercises
suggested by past studies include many routines that use dumbbells or a resistance band or
cable<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study proposed an
individualized resistance training method to enable exercise while maintaining a workload
that is set according to an individual&#x02019;s joint angle-torque using a haptic-based resistance
training machine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was used to develop a haptic-based resistance training machine that enables
exercise using a 2-D arbitrary path and then used the machine for rotator cuff muscle
training. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figure 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Haptic-based resistance training machine and the controlling and measurement
software</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-525-g001"/></fig> shows the haptic-based resistance training machine and controlling software<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Haptic-based resistance training machines
enable exercise and measurement of 2-D force using two electric motors and a force sensor,
and can apply resistance in an arbitrary 2-D direction. This makes it possible to measure
and record an individual user&#x02019;s exercise trajectory and force profile, and to apply a
dynamic exercise load according to a predefined exercise trajectory (PDET) and location
appropriate for each user by position-based impedance control<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. By using this haptic-based resistance training machine, the user
can exercise with a subject-specific dynamic exercise load.</p><p>The experiment was conducted on ten subjects to verify the effects of exercise using the
haptic-based resistance training machine for rotator cuff muscle training. The recruited
subjects were Korean males in their twenties who had no history of shoulder injury and who
had no professional experience in weight training in the year before the experiment
(24.9&#x000b1;1.7 ages, 174.4&#x000b1;4.6&#x02005;cm, 67.3&#x000b1;8.5&#x02005;kg). Before the start of the experiment, the subjects
were given a full explanation of the purpose and experimental procedure, and signed
Institutional Review Board consent forms to comply with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised 1983). They were not allowed any exercise that could
affect the rotator cuff during the training period (e.g., tennis, baseball, golf). Subjects
were placed in two groups at random. The machine group consisted of five subjects who
performed rotator cuff training exercises using the haptic-based resistance training machine
developed in this study, and the control group consisted of five subjects who performed
standard rotator cuff training exercises using dumbbells.</p><p>Before starting training, each subject&#x02019;s 1 repetition maximums (1 RMs) of internal rotation
and external rotation were measured. For both groups, 1 RM was measured using dumbbells. In
the case of the control group, 20 RM, which was calculated based on 1 RM, was set as the
load for the training<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of the machine group, an individual&#x02019;s
exercise trajectory and force-velocity-angle curve were determined in an isokinetic manner
using the haptic device, and was then applied to the haptic-based training machine to set
the load pattern for training. The training load pattern for each subject was set to 20 RM
by scaling down the angle-force profile.</p><p>Training was conducted over an eight-week period, and each exercise session lasted about
one hour and was performed twice per week. The machine group anchored their upper arm to the
support of the haptic device while sitting in a chair, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p> External/internal rotation exercise using a haptic-based resistance training machine

external rotation motions was counted as one repetition, and five sets of twenty repetitions
were executed. The control group executed internal and external rotation motions using
dumbbells while lying on their sides, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.

rotation training using the haptic-based resistance training machine has a larger impact
than conventional training using dumbbells In the case of internal rotation, however,
haptic-based training and dumbbell-based training show similar progresses on average power.
The differences in average power progress of external rotation between the groups are due to
the difference in the joint angle-torque profiles when engaged in exercise using dumbbells
as opposed to exercise using haptic-based resistance training. Each subject&#x02019;s joint
angle-torque profile was measured as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2</xref>, and the resistance of the haptic device was determined based on this
measurement. In contrast, in the case of the control group, the exercise load was determined
by the weight of the dumbbell and the influence of gravity for each joint angle as shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>. In the case of internal rotation, there
was no substantial difference in the impact of the training sessions because the joint
angle-force profiles for the machine group and control group showed similar tendencies.
However, in the case of external rotation, the profiles exhibited opposite tendencies, as
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>, and this was consistent with the
finding that the machine group showed a greater improvement in exercise performance by
maintaining consistent muscle activation throughout the exercise. Many previous studies
mentioned the effectiveness of a training load considering the joint angle-torque
relationship in elbow or knee joint exercises<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There were some limitations of this study. The number of subjects was limited, because we
had only one haptic device and only one subject could use the device at a time. To clarify
the effects of haptic resistance training, studies with more subjects using haptic devices
will be needed in the future. This study focuses on the effect of resistance training in the
beginners; however, the results cannot be applied to older people who need to train rotator
cuff muscles, because the subjects who participated in this study were young, with the mean
age being only 24.9.</p><p>This study proposes a rotator cuff muscle training exercise using a haptic-based resistance
training machine. In the case of existing rotator cuff training exercises using dumbbells,
cables, or rubber bands, it is difficult for beginners or older subjects to effectively
train the target muscles because it is difficult to assume the appropriate postures without
assistance. In the case of the haptic-based resistance training, every subject could
effectively train in a stable posture without assistance, as the machine guides the exercise
trajectory and direction of the force. Furthermore, the impact of exercise can be expected
to be the same as, or greater than, that of the standard rotator cuff training exercise
because the muscle activation levels are kept relatively consistent during the exercise
process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National
