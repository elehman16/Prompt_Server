The essentially stable VA during follow-up in this study contrasts with gains reported in clinical trials such as CATT, HARBOR, and VIEW trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Differences in VA outcomes between RWE studies and clinical trials are not unexpected and most likely reflect the narrow population and significant exclusion criteria in clinical trials. RWE studies would allow inclusion of eyes with a wider range of CNV lesions (for example, larger lesions) as well as those with structural damage at the fovea and may include confounders such as cataract, which would be excluded from clinical trials. Further, visual acuities recorded here are not equivalent to refracted protocol-standardised visual acuity measurements seen in clinical trials and as such may show fewer letters gained compared with a clinical trial-recorded visual acuity measurement.</p><p>There is limited prospective data with which to guide treatment for PEDs and these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and not analyzed as a subgroup. Ranibizumab and aflibercept were equally effective in stabilizing VA over 12 months and with similar efficacy to that in non-PED patients suggesting anti-VEGF therapy is a viable treatment option in PED patients and is in agreement with a further comparative short-term study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup></p><p>Of note is the relatively low proportion of PED eyes identified in this study. At 6% of eyes in the study, this is considerably lower than would be expected. Indeed, PEDs are seen in up to 62% of eyes with advanced AMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> This potential under-representation is likely due to the lack of granularity in ICD-9 coding for PED. The ICD-9 codes 362.42 and 362.43 used to classify PED in this analysis refer only to serous and hemorrhagic PEDs, respectively, and hence other PED subtypes including fibrovascular and drusenoid PEDs, which might be expected to account for ~90% of PEDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> were not necessarily captured. Serous PEDs comprise ~10% of all PEDs in nAMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> and in this context, the 6% rate of PED identification in this study is consistent with expectations for the frequency of this subtype in nAMD. Therefore, while in this study ranibizumab and aflibercept show similar efficacy in PED, their relative efficacy in fibrovascular and drusenoid PED remain to be determined, especially as fibrovascular PED has been demonstrated to be more difficult to treat with anti-VEGF agents and with poorer visual outcomes than serous PED.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup></p><p>It has been hypothesized that the wider binding capacity of aflibercept (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PIGF) coupled to its higher affinity for VEGF compared to ranibizumab might result in improved efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> However, results here suggest that these properties do not translate into improvements in patient-relevant visual functioning as captured by VA in real-world clinical practice. Furthermore, this study highlights that the potential capacity advantage offered by 8-weekly aflibercept compared to monthly ranibizumab does not translate to real-world clinical practice, where treatment patterns with the two agents are similar, crucially with similar visual acuity outcomes.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first comparative US EMR-based retrospective study to compare outcomes and treatment frequency with ranibizumab and aflibercept in nAMD. The standardized EMR database used utilizes data entered as part of routine clinical care, which allowed data evaluation in a detailed and consistent manner from a large number of geographically diverse practices in United States. Although in the study itself, data collection was retrospective (introducing inherent biases such as misclassification, treatment bias, and confounding) data fields were predefined before any data collection started and were entered prospectively and is reflective of real-world daily clinical practice rather than of protocol-driven clinical trials.</p><p>It is important to continue to explore long-term outcomes of anti-VEGF treatment in nAMD given the chronic nature of the disease. However, it is possible that any differences in treatment may not have been manifest at 12 month&#x02019;s follow-up. An extended study with longer follow-up would address this.</p><p>There was a high proportion of eyes lost to follow-up due to both treatment discontinuation and switching anti-VEGF treatment. Discontinuing eyes were generally older with poorer VA at index, which are associated with an increased mortality rate and reduced gains in visual acuity. Possibly patients with poorer visual acuity outcomes might discontinue or switch treatment thus confounding our results. The direction of any confounding would depend both on the differential discontinuation rates between treatments (ranibizumab is higher) and trend in visual acuity at switch (aflibercept has a larger decrease). The high discontinuation rate in this study has been described before in real-world studies of anti-VEGF treatment in nAMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Additional reasons for discontinuation might include inconvenience and/or discomfort associated with intravitreous injection and a perceived lack of benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> or death. Regular intravitreal injections are associated with a significant treatment burden for patients, caregivers, and physicians, which is often unsustainable in clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup></p><p>Visual acuity post-switch for eyes that switched treatment was available but not analyzed in this study. A companion analysis for switchers with 12 months on the switch treatment found a comparable change in VA at 12 months post-switch (mean (SD) VA change &#x02212;1.56 (13.4) ranibizumab to aflibercept switchers <italic>vs</italic> 0.21 (19.2) aflibercept to ranibizumab switchers; <italic>P</italic>=0.55) (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>nAMD generally occurs in those aged 50 or over. However, eyes from patients aged &#x0003c;50 were included in this study (0.2% of those analyzed). This finding raises the possibility of misclassification/miscoding of these younger patients, however, it is unlikely that the study results were impacted.</p><p>Further limitations also include the loss of sensitivity associated with conversion of Snellen vision recorded in this study to ETDRS letters, limited data on choroidal neovascularization classification as well as limited systemic medical history of participants and lack of match-control. The latter could be addressed with larger study cohorts in the future. An additional limitation is the lack of detail in ICD-9 classification for PEDs resulting in potential misclassification and potentially the majority of PED eyes remaining uncaptured.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study represents, to our knowledge, the largest EMR database analysis comparing both treatment patterns and visual outcomes between ranibizumab and aflibercept. Despite differences in their approved treatment regimens, in real-world clinical practice, ranibizumab and aflibercept-treated nAMD eyes receive similar numbers of injections and achieve similar visual acuity outcomes in the first year of treatment. In addition, this study shows that anti-VEGF therapy is effective in maintaining vision in patients with high visual acuity not normally assessed in phase 3 clinical trials and further supports the early detection and treatment paradigm in nAMD to ensure maintenance of visual function of the eye.</p><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="eye2017143i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland funded this study.
