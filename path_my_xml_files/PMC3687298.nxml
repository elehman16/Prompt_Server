These processes combine to ensure the availability of maternal fuels such as glucose, fatty acids, and ketone bodies for fetal use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It is recognized that gestational age, maternal obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), and preeclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) are associated with increases in lipids during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is also associated with abnormalities in maternal lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), which may contribute to the elevated fat mass seen at birth in infants of women with GDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Maternal glucose control and the pharmacological therapies used for treatment of GDM have the potential to influence these changes in maternal lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Insulin suppresses adipose tissue lipolysis and might be expected to reduce circulating triglycerides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Metformin reduces insulin resistance, but it has also been suggested to influence lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), independent of glycemic control. In type 2 diabetes, metformin treatment is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and VLDL cholesterol concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Metformin treatment in type 2 diabetes is also associated with increases in LPL mass level and LDL cholesterol particle size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and with a reduction in the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>We have recently examined maternal lipids in the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) trial and found that maternal fasting plasma triglycerides and measures of glucose control at 36 weeks were the strongest predictors of customized birth weight &#x0003e;90th percentile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Interestingly, triglycerides increased more from randomization to 36 weeks' gestation in women allocated to metformin than in those allocated to treatment with insulin, but there was no difference in customized birth weights or other neonatal anthropometry measures between the groups; there were also no differences in cord blood triglycerides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The aim of this study was to examine the known and putative determinants of maternal triglyceride concentrations and determine whether the difference seen in maternal plasma triglycerides at 36 weeks was due to treatment or other factors that may have differed between treatment groups.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Data were obtained from the MiG trial dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This was a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial at multiple sites in New Zealand and Australia. MiG compared the use of metformin with insulin treatment for the control of GDM in 733 women diagnosed with GDM, who were unable to achieve adequate glucose control after lifestyle intervention. GDM was diagnosed using standard Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Women were not on either metformin or insulin at enrollment and were subsequently randomized to primary pharmacological treatment with one of these agents. Supplemental insulin was used as required in the metformin group to achieve predefined glucose goals, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The trial was approved by the institutional review boards at each participating site, and all subjects gave written informed consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>A total of 432 participants in the MiG study with available measurements of fasting plasma triglycerides at enrollment and at 36 weeks' gestation were eligible for inclusion in the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Seventeen women (insulin, <italic>n</italic> = 8; metformin, <italic>n</italic> = 9) were excluded from these analyses as their ethnicity was unclear or their ethnic category contained &#x0003c;10 individuals. Inclusion or exclusion of these women, through assigning them all to the category of &#x0201c;other ethnicity&#x0201d; did not change the analyses presented here.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Laboratory analyses</title><p>Fasting blood samples were collected from each woman after an overnight fast at baseline (20&#x02013;33 weeks' gestation) and at 36 weeks' gestation. All blood was collected in EDTA and plain tubes and was sent for processing within 10 min of collection or stored on ice for processing within 90 min. Aliquots were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis.</p><p>Plasma glucose and triglycerides were measured by colorimetric enzymatic analysis on a Hitachi 912 automated metabolic analyzer, using commercially available kits (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) was measured as previously described, in local laboratories by methods yielding results that were consistent with those of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS (SPSS Statistics, version 19; IBM, Chicago, IL), using &#x003b1; = 0.05 (two-sided) to determine significance. The smoking variable reflects a history of smoking during pregnancy at entry into the study only. A missing values analysis was undertaken. All variables included had &#x0003c;10% missing data. For pairwise comparisons, missing data were dealt with by pairwise deletion, and for the regression, missing data were dealt with by listwise deletion. Variables showing significant differences at enrollment were analyzed as percentage change from enrollment to 36 weeks' gestation rather than the absolute value at 36 weeks. Continuous variables were described using means and 95% CIs. When not normally distributed, data were logarithmically transformed (log[x]) for analysis, and geometric means and CIs were reported. Paired Student <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare triglycerides at enrollment and 36 weeks within treatment groups. Fisher least significant differences test was used when post hoc analysis was required. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages and analyzed using Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Univariate and multivariable general linear models were used to explore the associations with maternal triglycerides at enrollment and 36 weeks. At both time points, triglycerides required log transformation to provide an appropriately normally distributed outcome variable. Although enrollment triglycerides were significantly correlated with triglycerides at 36 weeks' gestation in univariate modeling, they were not included in the multivariate model because of a high degree of collinearity. The initial multivariate models included those variables that had <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.4 in univariate regression. The model was refined by backward elimination, reducing the variables included to those with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Regression output is reported as geometric mean (categorical variables) or geometric regression coefficient (continuous variables) and 95% CI as appropriate. Treatment allocation and outcomes were examined further to determine the association of treatment with triglyceride concentrations, with the regression model at 36 weeks being stratified by treatment allocation (intention to treat). Regression analysis at 36 weeks' gestation was also performed by treatment received.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s4"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s5"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Of the 733 women in the MiG trial, 432 women (219 metformin and 213 insulin) were included in this analysis.

At 36 weeks' gestation, maternal triglyceride concentration was associated with ethnicity, glucose control, and treatment allocation. In women whose GDM was managed with insulin, 36-week triglycerides were most strongly associated with measures of glucose control, whereas in women whose GDM was managed with metformin, 36-week triglycerides were most strongly associated with ethnicity.</p><p>We found that plasma triglyceride concentrations in women treated with metformin were higher than in those treated with insulin at 36 weeks' gestation. The plasma triglyceride concentrations found in this study irrespective of the treatment arm are similar to or lower than those reported in women with treated GDM (2&#x02013;3.0 mmol/L, managed with diet or insulin therapy) during the late second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and late third trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

Since elevated glucose concentrations are associated with increased triglyceride concentrations, the triglyceride concentrations in this study suggest that the level of glucose control achieved with treatment in the women in this study may have exerted a beneficial effect on triglyceride elevations.</p><p>The fasting plasma glucose assessed concomitant with plasma triglycerides at 36 weeks was higher in the metformin treatment group than the insulin treatment group. In the multivariate analysis, however, plasma glucose did not predict triglyceride concentrations. Therefore, the higher fasting plasma glucose does not provide an explanation as to why triglyceride concentrations were higher in the metformin-treated women. Additionally, other factors known to increase triglyceride concentrations, namely obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), smoking, and preeclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), were also similar between treatment arms. Metformin improves insulin resistance, and it has been suggested that it influences lipids directly. Insulin can directly affect adipose tissue by reducing lipolysis and increasing LPL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), which could explain the lower triglycerides in the insulin arm compared with the metformin arm.</p><p>The subtle differences in plasma triglyceride levels between women allocated metformin and those allocated insulin could contribute to differences in overall fetal nutrition along a continuum of lipid exposure, as previously described for glucose exposure in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Elevated maternal triglycerides have been associated with multiple adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. However, no interventional trials directed at lowering maternal triglycerides have been reported. If it was demonstrated that lowering maternal triglycerides provides beneficial pregnancy outcomes, then the finding that metformin is associated with higher maternal triglycerides compared with insulin at 36 weeks' gestation may alter the choice of pharmacotherapy for women with GDM.</p><p>These analyses showed ethnic differences in the change in triglyceride levels in women on metformin but not in women on insulin. Maternal triglycerides at enrollment did not differ between ethnicities. The examination of ethnicity in the current analyses is a post hoc subgroup analysis and thus needs to be treated with caution. However, ethnic differences in the relationship between insulin resistance, body adipose stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and adipokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) have been reported before, and ethnic differences in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism have also been described in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). It is also possible that there are ethnic variations in the metabolism of or pharmacological response to metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Alternatively, the findings of the current analyses may be due to systematic ethnic differences in diet or glucose and lipid metabolism and require confirmation and further exploration in future studies.</p><p>The strength of these analyses is that the data were collected as part of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Limitations include the use of a subgroup of women from the original trial who are different from those who were not included. Women who did not have blood tests taken at both time points could not be included in this study, and unsurprisingly, these women belong to a lower socioeconomic group. Another potential weakness is that the smoking status in women was documented at enrollment but not at 36 weeks, so there is a possibility that the rates at which women ceased or commenced smoking within the time frame of the study differed between the treatment groups. Given that this was a randomized trial, if that were true, we would have to propose that insulin or metformin had a direct effect on smoking behavior, which we consider unlikely. More detailed and consistent smoking status information would be important to document in future studies.</p><p>The other weakness of this study is a reduced number of observations in the subgroup analyses, increasing the chance for error. With this in mind, the analyses of ethnic differences, while intriguing, require confirmation in future studies. In particular, the issue of maternal diet requires further exploration. The examination of dietary information could account for the apparent differences in the relationship between ethnicity and treatment seen in this study. Although the details of the diet the women in this study were asked to follow are known, their actual diet is not. There may have been differences in diet related to the treatment, which would also account for less weight gain in women treated with metformin. Insulin is frequently associated with increased appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and women treated with insulin may not have restricted their dietary intake to the same degree as women taking metformin, who might have been trying to avoid supplemental insulin. Women taking insulin would have been able to increase their dose of insulin to maintain glucose control, despite eating more. Restrictions to dietary intake in women taking metformin, leading to prolonged fasting by the time of the morning blood sample could have produced increased maternal plasma triglycerides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This has not been reported in the setting of a hypocaloric diet in obese women with GDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), but increased free fatty acids and a trend to increased maternal fasting triglycerides have been reported with the short-term use of a low-carbohydrate diet in women with GDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Future studies examining the impact of metformin and insulin on triglycerides should include detailed dietary assessment to adequately examine this issue.</p><p>In this cohort of metformin- and insulin-treated women in a randomized trial of women with GDM, maternal plasma triglyceride concentrations at 36 weeks were higher during treatment with metformin than treatment with insulin, despite a lower weight gain in women treated with metformin. The differences noted in triglyceride levels between treatments were small, and maternal triglyceride levels were within the reported normal range for pregnancy. Although fasting glucose measured at the same time was higher in women treated with metformin, this did not explain the difference in triglycerides. Glucose control was an important factor in triglyceride levels in women treated with insulin, whereas ethnicity was an important factor in women treated with metformin. These data demonstrate that we have an incomplete understanding about treating GDM and the interactions between glucose, lipids, diet, medication, and ethnicity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2132/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2132/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The MiG trial was supported by grants from the Auckland Medical Research Foundation, the National Women&#x02019;s Evelyn Bond Charitable Trust, the Health Research Council of New Zealand, and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.
