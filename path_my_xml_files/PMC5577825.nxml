This uneven distribution of tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] by socioeconomic status (SES; or its proxies) is also observed in other high income countries. As a consequence of this, proportionally larger reductions in smoking rates are needed among disadvantaged groups if national targets for smoking prevalence are to be achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Tobacco taxation is an effective strategy to reduce smoking rates in low SES population groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, financial stress has been identified as a barrier to successful cessation and a key predictor of smoking relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is a pernicious cycle where tobacco use increases financial pressures (e.g., difficulty paying for bills, food, rent etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which in turn maintains smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], by the use of price-minimization strategies (e.g., by switching to roll-your-own), rather than cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This may mean that price-based interventions will deliver diminishing returns over time with socially disadvantaged smokers because rises in taxation increase financial stress and smoking, and decrease quit success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluation studies have indicated that Australian smokers vary in their SES and motivations, intentions, and timeframes for quitting (e.g., The International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four-Country Study, The National Drug Strategy Household Survey; and the Household, Income &#x00026; Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey). However, these data sources do not bring together detailed information about financial functioning, tobacco use and quitting. This was one of the aims of the Financial Intervention for Smoking Cessation Among Low-income Smokers (FISCALS) Randomised Clinical Trial (RCT). The 1047 FISCALS smokers represent a large sample of Australian daily smokers selected on the basis of their low-income (defined as being in receipt of a means-tested government pension or allowance) and their willingness to quit within one-month of trial enrolment. Their data provides novel insights into the interplay between financial stress, smoking and cessation that are necessary to guide the development and delivery of effective tobacco control interventions for disadvantaged smokers. This is essential if cigarette tax increases provide either diminishing returns in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], or adversely affect low SES smokers who are unable to quit.</p><p id="Par9">The aim of this paper was to describe and investigate associations between the financial functioning, tobacco use and quitting behaviours of low SES smokers on entry to the FISCALS trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">The primary aim of the FISCALS RCT was to evaluate the efficacy of a financial education and support program (FESP) in improving smoking cessation rates among low SES smokers. The detailed protocol of the FISCALS RCT has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This study reports only data collected at baseline. Key eligibility criteria for recruitment into FISCALS were: 1) being aged 18&#x000a0;years or older; 2) being in receipt of a government pension or allowance; 3) smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day; 4) being interested in quitting, and; 5) being willing to make a quit attempt within 1&#x000a0;month of recruitment.

They were also heavier smokers than the Australian smokers in the ITC Four Country Survey (HSI 3.0 c.f. 3.9 respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. FISCALS participants endorsed each financial stress item at twice the rate over the past <italic>month</italic> as those from the lowest income quintile in HILDA in the past <italic>12&#x000a0;months</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. They endorsed the first item of the scale (a single item measure of financial stress) three times more often than low income smokers from Australia, the UK, USA and Canada in the ITC sample (40.5% c.f., 13.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The rate of smoking induced deprivation reported by the FISCALS sample for the <italic>past month</italic> was four times that reported in the ITC survey for a <italic>six-month</italic> period. The data also reveal that over all household types tobacco expenditure accounted for 13.8% of total reported household income, and financial stress and deprivation were significantly associated.</p><p id="Par37">Together these results suggest that heavy tobacco use, financial stress and deprivation are commonplace and interrelated. The data also clearly demonstrate that in our sample of low-income smokers tobacco was used despite an inability to meet financial obligations (e.g., paying bills) and smoking was given priority over other discretionary activities (e.g., leisure activities or holidays). However, high levels of motivation to quit indicated that our participants were seeking to change this situation.</p><p id="Par38">Interestingly, neither (adjusted) financial stress nor deprivation were associated with increased motivation to quit or confidence in future quit attempt success. Thus, the experienced financial pressures and deprivation did not appear to increase cessation motivation or confidence in cessation success in the cohort. However, this may be due to the relatively high levels of financial stress and deprivation in this sample. That is, the lack of association may reflect difficulty in detecting effects due to a relative lack of variation in the sample, rather than to the absence of associations. It is also worth noting that the underlying causes of cessation motivation and confidence are complex, with a range of mechanisms related to both psychological and social factors. A 2010 meta-analysis of theory of planned behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and smoking found that quit intention was most strongly related to perceived behavioural control, which may be associated with financial stress and deprivation. Further work is required to tease apart the complex patterns of associations and, potentially, causal relationships between the various psychological, social and environmental factors at play.</p><p id="Par39">Increasing tobacco taxation is generally considered to be very successful way of reducing smoking in the population in general and in disadvantaged smoking populations in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, our data reveal that financial stress, a potential barrier to successful cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], is highly prevalent in the FISCALS cohort of low income daily smokers. This creates a dilemma for policy makers: raising taxes may increase quit attempts, but the success of these attempts may be undermined if financial stress increases as the price rises. It will be important to put redistributive strategies in place to minimise the impact of cigarette price rises on poor smokers, perhaps by increasing subsidies for smoking cessation.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par40">The main limitation of the study is that it relies upon self-report data collected using a CATI. Self-report data may be affected by exaggeration and or socially desirable responding. However this risk was minimal because the accuracy of responses was potentially verifiable and there was no incentive to respond in a socially desirable way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">A second limitation of this study may be that the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the FISCALS trial means that the smokers are unlikely to be representative of all low-income smokers in Australia. Their financial situation may be worse and their motivation to quit smoking higher. Even so we know that the cessation success rate for low SES smokers is generally low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, many will continue to live in the challenging financial situation described here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">The data from FISCALS study provides a unique insight into the lives of a group of low income smokers who &#x02013; like almost half of all low-income smokers in Australia &#x02013; smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day. They were a group with high financial difficulty and declared motivation to quit, who had previously tried unsuccessfully to give up smoking. These results are consistent with those observed in other high cigarette tax environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and suggest that low-income smokers will face increasingly difficult financial circumstances as tobacco products becomes less affordable. Furthermore, the effectiveness of tobacco price interventions may be undermined by the high prevalence of financial stress and smoking induced deprivation.</p><p id="Par43">Our data reinforce the importance of researching and developing smoking cessation interventions that are responsive to the role that financial stress plays in reducing quit attempts and increasing relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Actively managing the vicious cycle of financial stress and smoking may be required to reduce the increasing socioeconomic gradient in smoking prevalence in Australia and other high income countries.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par70">
