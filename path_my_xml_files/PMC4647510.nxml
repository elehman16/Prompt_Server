However, little is known about SLV-I&#x02019;s cost-effectiveness. The objective of this study is to establish the cost-effectiveness of SLV-I based on a two-year community-based randomized controlled trial (Year 1: 2009&#x02013;2010 vaccination season, an unusual H1N1 pandemic influenza season, and Year 2: 2010&#x02013;2011, a more typical influenza season).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis on a two-year randomized controlled trial of a Western New York SLV-I program. SLV-I clinics were offered in 21 intervention elementary schools (Year 1 <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9,027; Year 2 <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9,145 children) with standard-of-care (no SLV-I) in control schools (Year 1 <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,534 (10 schools); Year 2 <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,796 children (11 schools)). We estimated the cost-per-vaccinated child, by dividing the incremental cost of the intervention by the incremental effectiveness (i.e., the number of additionally vaccinated students in intervention schools compared to control schools).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In Years 1 and 2, respectively, the effectiveness measure (proportion of children vaccinated) was 11.2 and 12.0 percentage points higher in intervention (40.7&#x000a0;% and 40.4&#x000a0;%) than control schools. In year 2, the cost-per-vaccinated child excluding vaccine purchase ($59.88 in 2010 US $) consisted of three component costs: (A) the school costs ($8.25); (B) the project coordination costs ($32.33); and (C) the vendor costs excluding vaccine purchase ($16.68), summed through Monte Carlo simulation. Compared to Year 1, the two component costs (A) and (C) decreased, while the component cost (B) increased in Year 2. The cost-per-vaccinated child, excluding vaccine purchase, was $59.73 (Year 1) and $59.88 (Year 2, statistically indistinguishable from Year 1), higher than the published cost of providing influenza vaccination in medical practices ($39.54). However, taking indirect costs (e.g., averted parental costs to visit medical practices) into account, vaccination was less costly in SLV-I ($23.96 in Year 1, $24.07 in Year 2) than in medical practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our two-year trial&#x02019;s findings reinforced the evidence to support SLV-I as a potentially favorable system to increase childhood influenza vaccination rates in a cost-efficient way. Increased efficiencies in SLV-I are needed for a sustainable and scalable SLV-I program.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>School-located vaccination program</kwd><kwd>Influenza vaccination</kwd><kwd>Community-based randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness analysis</kwd><kwd>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Seasonal influenza poses a substantial disease burden on children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2008, the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended universal annual seasonal influenza vaccination for all children aged 6&#x000a0;months to 18&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This recommendation was designed to protect children because influenza is a common cause of pediatric outpatient visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Further, by reducing spread of disease, influenza vaccination for children can also reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality among adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] as well as school absenteeism among children and teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite these recommendations, vaccination coverage among school-aged children remains far below the most recent version of the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70&#x000a0;% coverage for all children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For the 2012&#x02013;13 influenza season, only 58.6&#x000a0;% of 5&#x02013;12 year olds and 42.5&#x000a0;% of 13&#x02013;17 year olds received influenza vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Vaccinating all children within their primary care practices is a major challenge.</p><p>To attempt to increase vaccination coverage among school-aged children, some communities have implemented school-located vaccination against influenza (SLV-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Cawley and associates conducted a systematic literature review and concluded that SLV-I is a promising option to achieve the expanded ACIP influenza vaccination recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. They highlighted the need for well-controlled trials to establish the cost-effectiveness of specific influenza vaccination strategies. Some experts believe that &#x0201c;<italic>the greatest need for future U.S</italic>.

The demonstration project&#x02019;s design and effectiveness for Years 1 and 2 have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, we have reported the project&#x02019;s cost-effectiveness for Year 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which was the 2009 H1N1 pandemic year, and therefore unusual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Analyzing the project&#x02019;s Year 2 cost-effectiveness, a more typical influenza season than Year 1, could yield unique contributions to the literature. Specifically, the SLV-I program&#x02019;s Year 2 might have been <italic>more</italic> efficient than Year 1 because of increased staff efficiency or program improvements (e.g., due to low utilization of a second clinic at each school in Year 1, only one clinic per school was offered in Year 2). Conversely, Year 2 might have been <italic>less</italic> efficient than Year 1 because of the parent demand in Year 1 being increased partly by the H1N1 influenza pandemic.</p><p>This paper reports on the Year 2 cost and cost-effectiveness of this SLV-I model, and compares these with corresponding values for Year 1. Our hypotheses were that the average cost-per-vaccinated child in SLV-I during Year 2 would be (1) lower than that observed in Year 1 and (2) comparable or lower than that observed in medical practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], when accounting for the costs to deliver vaccines and parents&#x02019; costs to visit medical practices for their child&#x02019;s influenza vaccination.

Component B (project coordination cost) included the cost incurred by coordinating activities, but excluded research and evaluation costs.</p><p>Component C (vendor costs) comprised the vendor&#x02019;s labor (C<sub>1</sub>) and material costs, including broad items such as vaccine purchase, the refrigerator for vaccines and supplies. The vendor&#x02019;s vaccine purchase costs were modeled in two ways. Our primary analysis, from the societal perspective, assigned a vaccine purchase cost (C<sub>2</sub>) of $12.06/dose for Year 2, which is the weighted average prices of federal Vaccine-For-Children (VFC) doses ($10.94 per dose; 52&#x000a0;% of all doses) and non-VFC doses ($13.26; 48&#x000a0;%) as of May 2010, listed on the CDC website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These prices assumed that 80&#x000a0;% and 20&#x000a0;% of doses administered in this demonstration project were TIV and LAIV, respectively, in each year, as was observed in this trial&#x02019;s Year 1. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] Our supplemental analysis, assuming that VFC doses were free, was performed from the alternative perspective of school districts, health departments, and insurers (we included administration costs for private and VFC vaccine). In accordance with the Year 1 trail&#x02019;s observation, the Year 2 analysis assumed that 52&#x000a0;% of students were VFC-eligible and, therefore, there was no charge to the vendor or families for their vaccine. Consequently, the cost item (C<sub>3</sub>) is the weighted average of VFC-dose ($0 per dose; 52&#x000a0;% of all doses) and non-VFC dose ($13.26; 48&#x000a0;%). However, it should be noted that these vaccine doses were not &#x0201c;free&#x0201d; from a societal perspective.

Because some children would have had a medical visit to their primary care practice for reasons other than influenza vaccination during the influenza vaccination season, we took this into account.

Also, these costs (D) do not include any medical expenditure, either paid by parents or incurred at medical practices.</p><p>The costs averted by disease prevention (component E) were derived from the literature. Based on findings from a large controlled clinical SLV-I trial, Schmier et al. estimated the averted medical expenditure as $121.46 and the averted productivity loss as $88.99 (both adjusted to 2010 dollars) per household, comparing the average costs per household between intervention and control schools during an influenza season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

In Year 2 pre-season, an additional four weeks was available for planning leading to more time being devoted to the process. Variation in responsibility for some tasks in Years 1 and 2 among school staff and project administrative staff may have led to changes in Components A and B across years. Because of this, we also compared the sum of Components of A and B -- $35.27 (Year 1) was still lower than $40.58 (Year 2). Given the realities of busy school personnel and the reduction in school nurses nationwide, we believe that for SLV-I to be sustainable, work by school staff would need to be minimized, with the possible exception of a special pandemic season. Thus, it is possible that the costs noted in Year 2 may represent a more generalizable estimate. Regardless of the reasons for the high costs, it is clear that for SLIV to be sustainable and scalable, fieldwork costs outside of the school-based costs would need to be lower than we experienced. Further studies are needed to assess the degree to which fieldwork costs can be reduced, e.g., costs to coordinate five school-districts in our trial which imposed much higher burdens compared a single school-district trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Comparison of year 2 trial with other studies</title><p>Our Year 2 intervention had a moderate impact on influenza vaccination uptake with an improvement of 12 percentage points (pp).

Consequently, the cost estimates from our study are greater than those in other SLV-I trials that did not include vaccine cost and\or the cost to bill insurance or Medicaid for vaccines or vaccine administration.

Using secondary datasets only, White and associates estimated that group-based influenza vaccination was cost-saving, i.e., saving $6.40 and $55.82 per vaccination, as compared to individual vaccination at a medical practice and no-vaccination, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Schmier et al. analyzed their primary data to conclude that SLV-I is cost-saving to society, saving $170.31 on average among all households in intervention schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our study, based upon a real-world demonstration and including billing of third party payers, had higher program costs than most prior SLV-I studies, resulting in lower cost-effectiveness. Our findings regarding indirect parent or societal costs were in line with those of other studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Potential limitations</title><p>There was uncertainty in cost estimates in Year 1 that may affect the comparison with Year 2. As discussed in the paper describing Year 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], it is difficult to accurately allocate the fixed costs between first clinics and second clinics during Year 1 due to the limited available data.</p><p>Another limitation is the potentially limited generalizability of our estimates, which may have been affected by multiple factors. The effectiveness of SLV-I is sensitive to the proportion of local children vaccinated by medical practices prior to the school vaccine clinics. For instance, in an area where medical practices vaccinate a high proportion of children, a SLV-I program may have a smaller impact on vaccination coverage. Hence, our SLV-I effectiveness estimates are likely to be most applicable to other areas where the vaccination rates achieved by medical practices are similar to those in our study site, i.e., less than one-third of children were vaccinated pre-intervention. Second, since influenza vaccination rates may be influenced by a host of seasonal influenza factors (e.g., disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], vaccine availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], media coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]) SLV-I vaccination coverage in school and, consequently, effectiveness estimates could differ from year to year.</p><p>Different methods were used to ascertain the vaccinated status between intervention schools (based on the vendor&#x02019;s records and New York State Immunization Information System (NYSIIS)) and control schools (NYSIIS records only). This difference could affect the effectiveness measure within a year, but would not affect the comparison between Years 1 and 2.</p><p>Finally, we derived indirect costs from the literature, not from our trial. Since we utilized a national-level median hourly wage among working adults for estimating the indirect cost component D, averted parents&#x02019; costs, these estimates are expected to be reasonably generalizable. Since the magnitude of the other indirect component (E, costs saving from disease prevention) might be sensitive to the estimation methods and the seasons analyzed, component E-related results were not presented in Tables. Our analysis excluded some relevant, but unmeasured, indirect costs such as costs due to disruptions of the school day by SLV-I, and cost savings from decreased absenteeism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Policy implications</title><p>Our findings from a real-world demonstration project indicated that while SLV-I is effective in improving influenza vaccination rates in school-aged children, project coordination costs (Component B) remained high during a second project year. High project coordination costs (Component B), driven by a substantial amount of effort needed to obtain informed consent and to manage implementation of the project, more than offset lower school and vendor costs (Components A and C). Project coordination costs (Component B) would need to be reduced through strategies such as an efficient parent consent and communication system. Overall, the per-vaccinated child cost estimates of our SLV-I were higher than those in medical practices and also higher than typical reimbursement rates. While our current cost estimates favor SLV-I over medical practices when we account for averted parental costs to visit medical practices (Component D), such cost-savings to parents may not be considered by health systems responsible for SLV-I. Thus, while costs are not the only consideration in setting up and sustaining SLV-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], the program costs for SLV-I should be lower than practice-located costs, or at least lower than or equal to reimbursement rates for SLV-I to be sustained.</p><p>Finally, achieving higher in-school vaccination coverage would improve cost-effectiveness. For example, in this study a net vaccination rate of 17.6&#x000a0;% (rather than 11.4&#x000a0;% found in Year 2) would lead to SLV-I cost estimates being lower than those in medical practices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our two-year trial&#x02019;s findings reinforced the evidence to support SLV-I as a potentially favorable system to increase childhood influenza vaccination rates in a cost-efficient way, but increased efficiencies in SLV-I are needed for a sustainable and scalable SLV-I program.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AAFP</term><def><p>American academy of family physicians</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AAP</term><def><p>American academy of pediatrics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACIP</term><def><p>advisory committee on immunization practices</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEA</term><def><p>cost-effectiveness analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LAIV</term><def><p>live attenuated influenza vaccine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NYIIS</term><def><p>New York State immunization information system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SLV-I</term><def><p>school-located vaccination against influenza</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIV</term><def><p>trivalent influenza vaccine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VFC</term><def><p>vaccine-for-children</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>For instance, using our primary effectiveness measure (i.e., columns labeled &#x0201c;vaccinated anywhere&#x0201d; in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), the mean ICER estimate based on Total Program Cost 1 was $71.74 per incremental-student-vaccinated in Year 2, which was lower than $71.78 in Year 1.
