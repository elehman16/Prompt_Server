practice groups. The groups were compared in terms of gains in motor performance, mental
imagery vividness, and level of concentration during mental practice. [Results] No
statistically significant difference was found for gains in motor performance among

gains. However, a correlation was found between gains in motor performance and mental

performance. However, a higher degree of concentration during mental practice may improve
motor performance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mental practice</kwd><kwd>Imagery vividness</kwd><kwd>Mental concentration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the rehabilitation of individuals with poststroke hemiparesis, a physical therapist
verbally instructs, guides, and aids in the repetitive practice of movements and motions.
However, when there is a significant reduction in overall physical functioning in addition
to motor function, it has been found that such repetitive practice can be a cause of both
fatigue and reduced motivation for rehabilitation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, research in sports training has shown that combining
mental practice with physical practice enhances the effects of training relative to physical
practice alone<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mental practice is defined as a method of using mental imagery to rehearse the performance
of a task without engaging in observable physical practice<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of mental
practice are determined by factors such as the characteristics of the learner and the task,
practice conditions, learning stage, and type of mental practice<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. From the little research
that has been done on learner characteristics, findings indicate that intelligence does not
need to be above average but that the ability to form mental imagery does affect learning.
As for task characteristics symbolic tasks are more suited to mental practice than motor
tasks, and it has been found that the effect of mental practice is greater for easy tasks
that require small muscle control than for complicated tasks. Research on practice
conditions has shown that the most suitable period for mental practice is only a few minutes
and that the effect of mental practice alone is smaller than the effect of actual physical
practice. However, when combined with physical practice, the impact of mental practice is
greater. As for the stage of learning and the type of mental practice, mental practice is
believed to be more effective in the initial and intermediate phases of learning when the
correct way of performing the task is understood and when appropriate feedback is given.
Advantages of mental practice that have been suggested include the ability to understand
subtle timings not noticed during physical practice, freedom from fear that may accompany
physical practice, the ability to perform it with little fatigue, and the ability to perform
it without limitations as to time and place<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research has also found that combining mental practice with physical practice in the
treatment of poststroke hemiparesis contributes to recovery from paralysis and reduces
physical disability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, integrating mental practice into rehabilitation can
be expected to enhance its effects. However, most of the information regarding the effects
of mental practice is based on studies in which mental practice was performed for periods of
several weeks to several months<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Whether limited mental practice can contribute to motor performance improvement in
poststroke individuals with hemiparesis is still incompletely understood. Thus, this study
explored whether mental practice may improve the rehabilitation of these individuals. We
assigned participants to mental and physical practice groups, in which they had to perform
dart-throwing tasks, and measured the gains in (dart-throwing) motor performance. Further,
the influences of the participants&#x02019; vividness of mental imagery and the degree of mental
concentration during mental practice on the gains in motor performance were studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-three people (40&#x02013;82&#x02005;years of age, 15 males and 8 females) participated in this
study. Participants had paralysis in their dominant hand because of stroke and had no
experience playing darts. Candidates were not included in the study if they had difficulties
with active sitting, higher order brain dysfunction, visual field impairments, or orthopedic
disorders in their nondominant arm.</p><p>The participants were randomly divided into four groups: a no-practice group, a physical
practice group, a mental practice group, and a physical and mental practice group.</p><p>An outline of the dart throwing exercise can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic view of the experimental task.

at a target. The target was a 90 &#x000d7; 90&#x02005;cm Styrofoam board with a black bull&#x02019;s-eye having a
diameter of 10&#x02005;cm surrounded by concentric circles 5&#x02005;cm apart. Subjects were asked to sit on
a four-legged chair with no arms, placing their dominant hand on the table and their legs in
a comfortable position. The target was located 1.3&#x02005;m away from the front of the subject&#x02019;s
knees, and the bull&#x02019;s-eye was positioned 10&#x000b0; downward from the subject&#x02019;s eyes. In a
procedure approved by the Internal Review Board of Hirosaki University, informed consent was
obtained from each participant before the experiment began.</p><p>An outline of the experimental protocol is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Experimental procedure.

throwing procedure. During throwing, subjects sat upright and put the non-throwing hand on
the table. They flexed their shoulder and elbow joints 90 degrees and threw the dart toward
the center of the target. Initially, subjects in all four groups each threw 10 darts without
practice at the target&#x02019;s bull&#x02019;s-eye, and the distances from the bull&#x02019;s-eye were measured and
tallied. This was followed by four rounds of the subjects&#x02019; respective practice conditions
followed by throwing and measurement (practice I &#x02192; measurement I &#x02192; practice II &#x02192; measurement
II &#x02192; practice III &#x02192; measurement III &#x02192; practice IV &#x02192; measurement IV), resulting in four
practices and five measurements.</p><p>Regarding the practice conditions, the control group sat and rested for 2 minutes and 40
seconds (no practice). The physical practice group was asked to practice throwing 20 darts.
The mental practice group had 2 minutes and 40 seconds of mental practice throwing darts.
Finally, the physical and mental practice group had physical practice throwing 10 darts and
1 minute and 20 seconds of mental practice.</p><p>To measure motor performance, 10 darts were thrown one after another. Then, the distance
from each hit to the bull&#x02019;s-eye was measured, and the measurements were tallied for a total
score in millimeters. To measure the subjects&#x02019; degree of mental concentration during mental
practice in the mental practice group and the physical and mental practice group, after each
practice session, subjects were verbally asked to indicate their subjective feelings about
whether they were able to concentrate completely (3 points), for the most part (2 points),
or not at all (1 point). The vividness of each subject&#x02019;s mental imagery was tested with
Betts&#x02019; Questionnaire upon Mental Imagery (QMI) while the individual was seated with his/her
eyes closed<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The data in this study were expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard
deviation, and a two-way factorial analysis of variance was performed followed by a Friedman
test. The significance level was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Although the trend in scores from better to worse was physical and mental practice group
&#x0003e; physical practice group &#x0003e; no-practice group &#x0003e; mental practice group, the
differences between the groups were not statistically significant.</p><p>However, correlational analysis showed that the correlation was not significant. The
subjects&#x02019; scores for vividness of mental imagery were concentrated between 60&#x02013;105, with the
larger portion being 80 or above. Therefore, the data suggested that the subjects&#x02019; imagery
vividness trended relatively high.</p><p>In the mental practice group and the physical and mental practice group, there was a
statistically significant positive correlation between degree of mental concentration and
gains in motor performance (p &#x0003c; 0.05) that is, the higher the concentration during mental
practice, the more gains made in motor performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of this study showed no significant improvement in performance gains in the
motor task after mental practice in the four groups (physical practice, mental practice,
physical and mental practice, and no practice).</p><p>In previous research on mental practice related to upper extremity motor tasks, hemiparesis
patients receiving neurodevelopmental therapy involving the performance of mental practice
twice a week for six weeks showed improved motor functioning compared with those who only
engaged in physical practice<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other
research, it was reported that stroke patients receiving training in hand functions and
performing mental practice for four weeks did significantly better on the Action Research
Arm Test than those who completed physical practice alone<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, research on the effect of mental practice on gait
rehabilitation has shown that individuals suffering from aftereffects of a stroke, who
combined mental practice with walking practice for six weeks, demonstrated better
improvement as indicated by the results of a 10-Meter Walk Test<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research on the use of mental practice in rehabilitation
has mainly employed tasks related to gait and the upper or lower extremities, and the
results have shown that mental practice is effective in improving motor performance,
regardless of the differences in each movement type. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the
lack of a significant mental practice effect in the present study was related to the nature
of dart throwing, a motor task of the upper extremities that entails voluntary movement of
the fingers, hand, wrist, and elbow joints, and stabilization of the trunk in a seated
position while fixing the shoulder joints in a bent position. Thus, it is likely that
influences from differences in the study&#x02019;s motor task requirements relative to other studies
contributed only minimally to the difference in our results.</p><p>In mental practice research, there have also been studies on effective movement as a
function of qualitative factors. According to Gaggioli et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, mental practice was effective in improving coordination and step
accuracy in female basketball players who practiced layup shots for four weeks based on the
researchers&#x02019; video analysis assessment of five factors: fluidity, rhythm, coordination, step
accuracy, and balance landing. However, mental practice was not effective in improving
fluidity, rhythm, or balance landing. Thus, in the present study, the lack of a mental
practice effect may have resulted from the improvement effect being low for one or more of
the underlying factors in the action of dart throwing, such as fluidity, rhythm, or
coordination.</p><p>Furthermore, the absence of a mental practice effect in the present study could be
attributed to the strikingly shorter mental practice period compared with other studies; for
example, four weeks for balance training<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, six weeks for jumping performance in gymnastics<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, six weeks for poststroke patient walking
practice<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, four weeks for sit-to-stand
and reaching-to-grasp movements<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and 90
hours for shooting training<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, the sample in this study was small. One of the reasons for the obtained
insignificant differences may be this small size.</p><p>Vividness of mental imagery is a measure of the extent to which mental images of objects
are as clear as actual experiences of them. Betts&#x02019; assessment of vividness of mental imagery
employs images of ordinary scenes rather than imagery specific to games; however, it is
known that in general, imagery vividness and gains in motor skill improvement are positively
correlated<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in this study, vividness of mental imagery and motor
performance were not positively correlated, perhaps because the subjects&#x02019; imagery vividness
assessments were uniformly high and differences among subjects were small.</p><p>Mental concentration in games is thought to reflect &#x0201c;the ability to focus on a single point
in a state of relaxation, do one&#x02019;s best, and do so continuously&#x0201d;<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, it is reasonable to accept that the
subjects&#x02019; self-reported concentration levels during mental practice were sufficient for them
to be able to relax and focus and do so continuously. It may be that the subjects&#x02019; generally
high abilities to form mental imagery enabled a high level of imagery vividness during their
mental practice. However, although almost all subjects scored high in imagery vividness, it
is reasonable to assume that because the results for the mental practice concentration
levels varied, some subjects were not able to concentrate and, therefore, not able to
imagine the task very well, while other subjects were able to concentrate and imagine the
task clearly. Motor performance decreases with muscle and mental fatigue<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Repetition of dart throwing by subjects
with no experience throwing darts led to muscle and mental fatigue and might have influenced
performance progression and concentration during practice. Marcora et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> and Mehta et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that in the case of fatigue when the level of
mental concentration is low, motor performance declines. The present study suggests that
when the duration of mental practice is short, mental concentration during mental practice
may have a larger effect than vividness of mental imagery.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that limited mental practice may not improve motor
performance. However, increasing the amount of mental practice and concentration level
during mental practice, rather than improving subjects&#x02019; vividness of mental imagery, might
improve motor performance.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Boter</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>M&#x000e4;nty</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Self-reported fatigue and physical function in late
