The National Institutes of Health (NIH) weight categories define overweight people with the body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, obese with BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and severely obese with BMI &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> According to the most recent data, adult obesity rate is close to 38% nationwide,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> exceeding 35% in 4 states, 30% in 25 states, and is more than 20% in all states. Louisiana has the highest adult obesity rate of 36.2% and Colorado has the lowest at 20.2%.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>NIH reports obesity as one of the leading health risk factors for mortality and morbidity. Allison et al<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> reported that an estimated 300&#x000a0;000 deaths are due to the obesity epidemic each year in the United States, which is the second leading cause of preventable death following tobacco use.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Besides morbidity attributed to obesity, most prevalent medical diagnosis, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, are all related to overweight and obesity. Thus, prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity should be one of the top health care priorities in order to improve health care outcomes and save health care dollars.</p><p>Major reasons causing excessive weight gain are availability and abundance of high-calories food,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> along with sedentary modern lifestyle.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Suggested treatments of obesity include dietary therapy, physical activity, combined therapy, behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, surgery, and other interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Today, dietary restrictions and vigorous exercises are the primary means of treating obesity offered by the health care providers. If diet and exercise are not effective, doctors resort to bariatric surgery. Balloon in the stomach or bariatric surgery, which reduces its volume, leads to satiety when less food is consumed.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The sense of hunger is believed to be the main motive of food intake. Many people report that it is the main reason for overeating and resulting excess weight. Physiologically, the senses of hunger and satiety are processed in the central nervous system of animals and humans. Hypothalamus in the midbrain performs an integral function in the formation of these senses, and is recognized as regulator.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr11-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> These 2 senses are referred to as basic behavior motivators. Imbalance between satiety and hunger may lead to food rejection and consequent exhaustion, or overeating and consequent excess weight and obesity.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Some researchers consider hunger as a result of changes in body&#x02019;s biochemistry. Receptors that respond to glucose levels in the blood, certain hormones or metabolism products, affect the hypothalamus, changing feeding behavior.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Pharmaceutical and nutritional dietary recommendations are based on this knowledge.</p><p>Other researchers believe that the senses of hunger and satiety are directly related to pressure on the stomach or intestinal walls.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> For example, the sense of hunger disappears when stomach is stretched and is present with no pressure.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Inflated balloon stretching the stomach walls inhibits feeding behavior in animals. Modern bariatric surgery is based on this principle.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Controlling the sense of hunger is the critical first step in successful dietary therapy, as well as the aim of bariatric surgery to control body weight and treat obesity. However, methods of controlling the sense of hunger without chemicals and surgical procedures would be more beneficial, considering the side effects of pharmaceutical approach and the risks of surgical procedures.</p><p>Acupuncture and Qigong as ancient Chinese traditional medicine have been documented to be effective in treating obesity.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Literature showing that the desire to eat and the feeling of hunger, along with prospective food consumption in patients with obesity can be significantly reduced by acupuncture combined with electroacupuncture and ear point tapping.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="bibr21-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr22-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, there was no significant difference between acupuncture and nonacupuncture groups in gastric fullness feeling.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Zhou<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> summarized Chinese literature, and described an exercise called &#x0201c;yuchan fanlang gong&#x0201d; (&#x07389;&#x087fe;&#x07ffb;&#x06d6a;&#x0529f;) or &#x0201c;frog making waves,&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> which is a hunger suppression exercise from Chinese Qigong (&#x06c14;&#x0529f;), and is often used by monks during their religious fasting. This exercise is documented to be done in supine position (lying down on your back). Knees are bent to 90&#x000b0;. Left hand is placed on the chest, while right hand is placed on the abdominal region. Expand the chest and depress the abdomen while inhaling, and withdraw the chest and bulge the abdomen while exhaling.

Prior to measurements, all research subjects cleaned their bowels by drinking Epsom salt laxative (MgSO<sub>4</sub>x7H<sub>2</sub>O) at a dose of 0.5 g of Epsom salt per 1 kg of body weight. Pressure was measured using Benetech GM510 digital manometer. Foley catheter was attached to a silicone tube connected to the manometer.

Typically, this level corresponds to the upper boundary of the stomach, at the xiphoid process of the sternum.

When fasting for several days, patients did not experience hunger and starting from the second or third day of fasting they often forgot to perform the breathing exercise. What affected the sense of hunger? Based on the current study results, these changes are due to decreased stomach acidity and lowering the intestinal pressure. However, the authors believe that the primary effect is due to decreased intestinal pressure, since stomach pH control with antacid drugs does not affect the sense of hunger.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p><p>The intestinal tube is divided by sphincters (valves) into 4 sections: the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. There is a certain pressure differential between these sections. Valves along with gastrointestinal motility provide movement of food in one direction, its gradual absorption and digestion.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> When the pressure difference on both sides of the valve reaches a certain critical value, the valve opens and the contents moves to the lower section.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> A valve or a sphincter is formed of special muscle tissue (smooth or striated), which allows adjusting the magnitude and/or duration of connection between the segments of hollow organs, preventing pressure equalization.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> During regular breathing, the pressure in the abdominal cavity changes slightly and symmetrically. During inhaling, it is reduced by 1 to 3 mm Hg, while during exhaling it is increased by the same amount.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>Literature suggests that measured pressure in hollow intestine strongly depends on the position of the body, that is, lying or standing.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr45-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Typically, pressure data in body cavities have been obtained from patients in a horizontal position. If these patients were in the upright position, the gauge would have shown higher pressure. This additional hydrostatic pressure is equal to 0 in the upper part of the esophagus, and 35 to 45 mm Hg in the rectum, depending on the patient height (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2156587217707143">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The traditional Chinese Qigong exercise is performed in the supine position, thus the authors modified the Qigong exercise performing position from supine to standing, to achieve a larger pressure change in the body cavities, more specifically between the valves in each gastrointestinal segment. Anatomically, because of the position of the rib cage, the effect of pressure change in colon is significantly reduced with the breathing exercise performed in the supine position. This is another way to explain why the modified breathing exercise performed in standing position is more effective at achieving pressure change in the colon. Abdominal muscle retraction is another distinctive feature of this modified breathing exercise compared with the traditional Chinese Qigong exercise, which is achieved by an isolated transverse abdominal muscles activation (musculus transversus abdominis), which are typically not affected by breathing.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> By contracting abdominal muscles, the abdominal space is actively depressed and the intestinal tubes are also depressed with higher pressure.

This explains why water is sucked into the intestines when performing these exercises in water. However, the phenomenon of pressure reduction is still not explained. Abdominal volume decrease should be accompanied by the intra-abdominal pressure increase in all hollow organs, including the intestines.

This study demonstrated that the sense of hunger can be consciously controlled. It can be significantly reduced or even suppressed. Practical application of the modified breathing experience lies in the fact that any person, who mastered it, can more effectively control their eating behavior, preventing overeating and obesity. Including the modified breathing exercise in therapeutic weight loss programs makes them more effective and attractive. Conducted experiments have demonstrated that the modified breathing exercise reduces stomach acidity, similar to the action of antacid drugs, which suppresses mucosa rejection after prolonged abstinence from food.</p><p>The following conclusions can be drawn:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Subjective sense of hunger was significantly lower in the experimental group, which performed the modified breathing exercise than in the control group, which performed deep breathing exercises.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gastric juice acidity in the experimental group was reduced by 3 (0.2), and remained unchanged in the control group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When performing the modified breathing exercise, the pressure in the colon in the experimental group was reduced by 12 (0.5) mm Hg.

The observed effect may be coupled with a decrease in the intra-abdominal pressure and more rapid movement of the acidic stomach contents into intestines.</p><p>It should be noted that the modified breathing exercise is effective only when feeling hungry. If the patient had food before performing it, the effect was minimal or absent. Proposed breathing exercise is somewhat different from its description in the literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2156587217707143" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Experience has shown that the changes made increase its efficiency by reducing the number of required repetitions from 40 to 60 times per day to 3 to 6 times per day. The authors have observed an association between the suppressed sense of hunger and the conditions of gastric mucosa and oral cavity. The subjects who performed the modified breathing exercise had no fur on the tongue and no bad breath after a few days. Patients with hyperacid gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease felt a significant improvement when performing the modified breathing exercise, even without medications.

Future work requires using more subtle and intelligent methods, integrating digestion physiology, neurophysiology of the subcortical center, and eating behavior psychology. The authors would also like to increase the number of participants in such a study.</p><p>The fact that excessive consumption of food is not required from the biochemical sense, allows creating medical and educational programs, where moderate and adequate nutrition is the result of rational governance of hunger.
