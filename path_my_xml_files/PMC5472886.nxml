Among these, costs due to psychiatric hospitalization are a major burden. Smartphones comprise an innovative and unique platform for the monitoring and treatment of depression and mania. No prior trial has investigated whether the use of a smartphone-based system can prevent re-admission among patients discharged from hospital.

Patients with unipolar disorder and patients with bipolar disorder are invited to participate in each trial when discharged from psychiatric hospitals in The Capital Region of Denmark following an affective episode and randomized to either (1) a smartphone-based monitoring system including (a) an integrated feedback loop between patients and clinicians and (b) context-aware cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules (intervention group) or (2) standard treatment (control group) for a 6-month trial period. The trial started in May 2017. The outcomes are (1) number and duration of re-admissions (primary), (2) severity of depressive and manic (only for patients with bipolar disorder) symptoms; psychosocial functioning; number of affective episodes (secondary), and (3) perceived stress, quality of life, self-rated depressive symptoms, self-rated manic symptoms (only for patients with bipolar disorder), recovery, empowerment, adherence to medication, wellbeing, ruminations, worrying, and satisfaction (tertiary).

Unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder combined account for nearly half of all morbidity and mortality due to mental and substance use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and burden society with the highest health care costs of all psychiatric and neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Although psychiatric treatment internationally, and in Denmark, has shifted more from inpatient treatment to outpatient treatment during recent decades, costs due to psychiatric hospitalization are still a major burden comprising two thirds of all direct costs in the five Regions of Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients with affective disorders are more frequently hospitalized than any other patient group, counting more than 10,800 patients in 2013 among the entire Danish population of 5.4 million people, and 20% of all psychiatric hospitalizations in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The cost of these hospitalizations alone is estimated to be DKK648 million (approximately &#x020ac;8.7 million) per year in Denmark (10,800 hospitalizations with a mean of 20&#x000a0;days&#x02019; stay for a cost of 3000 DKK/day (&#x020ac;400)). The discharge period after hospitalization is a high-risk period with a more than 300 times increased risk of suicide during the first week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and a high risk of re-admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Patients are often afraid of leaving the hospital, feeling alone with the prospect of an appointment with a physician 1 or more months ahead. A pilot study from our group in which 45 patients discharged from psychiatric hospital self-monitored symptoms using a daily computer-based self-monitoring system emphasized the pivotal importance of continued contact with a clinician such as a nurse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Smartphones comprise a unique platform for the monitoring and treatment of depression and mania. Depression and mania are associated with changes in several behavioral components (e.g., reduction in activity level, change in speech) and motivational states (e.g., anhedonia), some of which may be detectable using readily available smartphone sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Prior work done by our group has developed and tested a unique smartphone-based system for the treatment of bipolar disorder (the MONARCA system) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The MONARCA system is capable of collecting subjective self-assessment data and automatically generated objective smartphone data from patients on a daily basis while allowing simple bidirectional communication between clinicians and the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We find it likely that daily contact with a psychiatric hospital nurse using a bidirectional feedback system combined with objective smartphone-based early warning signs, assessed using a smartphone app, will reduce the risk of re-admission and the risk of relapse of depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms.</p><p>Treatment of unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder applies a variety of methods, including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, psychoeducation, and cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (CBT).</p><p>CBT has proven efficacious in the treatment and prevention of depressive episodes in unipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but the effect in relation to bipolar disorder is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Depressive symptoms dominate bipolar disorder as 80% of episodes are depressive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but bipolar depression is difficult to treat as only a few drugs have proven effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and psychological interventions have proven ambient effects on depressive symptoms revealing positive effects in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], but not in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Specifically targeting depressive rumination, rumination-focused cognitive therapy and concreteness training (a facilitated self-help intervention intended to increase specificity of processing in patients with depression) have shown encouraging results in the treatment of residual depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the number of CBT therapists is very low compared with the huge demand for CBT. Internet- and computer-based CBT systems exist and have been proved effective in relation to depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Recently, CBT has been suggested for smartphones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] but the effect has never been tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p><p>In the RADMIS trial we will develop a smartphone-based CBT program that includes methods to relieve depressive ruminations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The smartphone-based system used in the RADMIS trials is inspired by the MONARCA system (see below), and is called the Monsenso system. By using the sensing, computational and communication capabilities of smartphones, it is possible to continuously monitor an individual&#x02019;s context including physical activity, location, and environment. Thus, smartphones hold significant promise as a platform to monitor behavioral and environmental indicators of depression and mania and for treatment, facilitating early intervention and smartphone-based CBT.</p><p>Prior research on using smartphones in the detection of unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder has shown promising but preliminary results. A small study on eight patients with depression (not including a control group) found that sensor data from smartphones could detect social patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Another study found that sensors from smartphones were effective at detecting social and sleep behaviors among patients with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The MONARCA system, developed and tested by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], has been proved highly usable and useful by patients with bipolar disorder with a high self-assessment adherence (87&#x02013;95%), and was considered to help patients to better manage their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A study investigating the effect of the MONARCA system (daily self-monitoring including a two-level feedback loop to clinicians) in a RCT found no overall effect in primary analyses but secondary analyses suggested that the system was able to reduce manic symptoms, but may sustain depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These results are in accordance with the findings that psychological interventions for bipolar disorder in general have more effect on manic than depressive symptoms and more effect on preventing that treating acute depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Consequently, emphasis on depressive symptoms should be a high priority including considerations on mechanisms to reduce the negative processing bias and depressive ruminations in patients with unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Finally, research by our group found that automatically generated objective smartphone data reflect illness activity in patients with bipolar disorder. Data on physical activity (the number of changes in cell tower ID/day), social activity (the number and duration of phone calls/day and the number of text messages/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and voice features collected during phone calls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] correlated significantly with the severity of clinically rated depressive and manic symptoms. Although these findings are encouraging and innovative, there is a need to integrate self-monitored smartphone data with automatically generated objective smartphone data on physical and social activity, as well as speech and sleep, into a composite smartphone-generated electronic measure. This composite measure should be modeled to have a high correlation with depressive and manic symptoms, and a high predictive ability to identify upcoming affective episodes for the individual patient in order to facilitate early intervention.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Using a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system for daily electronic self-monitoring, including an integrated feedback loop, on both subjective and automatically generated behavioral data on measures of illness activity (phone usage, social activity, physical activity, mobility, voice recognition and sleep) and context-aware CBT modules, the Monsenso system, reduces the rate and duration of re-admission more than standard treatment in adult patients with unipolar disorder or bipolar disorder, respectively, being discharged from hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>To investigate in two individual, randomized controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trials whether the use of a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system, including an integrated feedback loop, on both subjective and automatically generated behavioral data on measures of illness activity (phone usage, social activity, physical activity, mobility, voice recognition and sleep) and context-aware CBT modules, the Monsenso system, reduces the rate and duration of re-admissions more than treatment-as-usual in adult patients with unipolar disorder or bipolar disorder, respectively.</p><p>Further, to investigate if the Monsenso system reduces the severity of clinically rated affective symptoms and the number of affective episodes, improves psychosocial functioning, quality of life, severity of self-assessed affective symptoms, recovery, empowerment, adherence to medication, wellbeing, and satisfaction with care, and reduces perceived stress, rumination and worrying more than standard treatment without a smartphone-based system in adult patients with unipolar disorder or bipolar disorder, respectively.</p><p>Data will be collected and analyzed separately according to psychiatric diagnosis (unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The present trial protocol is reported according to the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schedule of enrolment, interventions, and outcome assessments in the RADMIS trials</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2015_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The psychoeducation and mood-monitoring system include strategies for detecting and intervening with early signs of relapse. Patients are encouraged to use the module in an individualized and sequential way according to their condition, affective state, and insight and following guidance from the study nurse if wanted. The behavioral activation module was inspired by Martell et al. (2010) and Lejuez et al. (2001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It includes activity monitoring and activity scheduling and focus on regulation of sleep and daily routines. Several studies have established the efficacy for behavioral activation for treating depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] including a few studies of behavioral activation using smartphones; however, not including a control standard treatment arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Further, regulating patterns of activity and sleep are helpful in reducing both depressive and manic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>The cognitive restructuring includes simple techniques to help patients to identify and modify dysfunctional automatic thoughts. Cognitive restructuring is a key element of CBT and is included in a number of studies that show the efficiency of CBT in the treatment of depression including some studies of Internet-based CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and a few studies including patients with bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>A main purpose of the smartphone-based CBT modules was to help patients to reduce depressive ruminations. Therefore, a specific rumination-focused CBT strategy, based on the theory and practice described by Watkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], was included. Rumination-focused CBT has shown encouraging results in the treatment of residual depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the Monsenso system includes the identification and reduction of unhelpful ruminations.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>The integrated feedback loop between patients and clinicians</title><p>Study nurses with experience with unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder are assigned to the patients allocated to the intervention group of the RADMIS trials. The RADMIS study nurses are responsible for the integrated feedback loop. Patients allocated to the intervention group of the RADMIS trials will have the Monsenso application installed on a smartphone. The smartphone automatically transfers the self-monitored subjective measures and, for some smartphones, also the automatically generated behavioral data on measures of illness activity to servers at the hospital through secure connections (I-suite number RHP-2011-03). By giving informed consent to participate in the RADMIS, the patients allow for the RADMIS study nurses and their health care provider to access the monitored data through a secure web interface. The RADMIS study nurses go through the collected data approximately two to three times a week, or more often on patients where it is deemed necessary. A personal homepage is set up on a server allowing the patients to access all their own data through a similar secure web interface.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The feedback loop on subjective measures: regardless the type of smartphone a feedback loop on the subjective measures is established.

No study investigating the effect of a smartphone-based intervention on rate and duration of re-admissions in both unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder has been published. The RADMIS trials aim to investigate the effect of a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system on the risk of psychiatric hospitalization, clinical function, and wellbeing in randomized, controlled trials with clearly defined clinical outcome measures.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Advantages</title><p>First, the RADMIS trials&#x02019; use a pragmatic design with few exclusion criteria and the results of the trials will be generalizable to patients who are going to be discharged from psychiatric hospitals in general with a diagnosis of unipolar disorder or bipolar disorder and have clinical relevance. The patients are recruited at a critical time point at discharge from hospital at which they still suffer from some affective symptoms and have a need for continued treatment. Following hospitalization, patients often experience a service gap between inpatient and outpatient services, and the RADMIS smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system is developed among others to fill out this gap.</p><p>Second, it is a major advantage that clinical information on the primary outcome will be available for all included patients (100%), regardless of whether they drop out of the RADMIS trials or not, as data on date of re-admission and duration of re-hospitalizations routinely are reported nationwide to the Danish Psychiatric Central Register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Also, the information on re-admissions and duration of re-hospitalizations are collected without the risk of unblinding of the researcher and not based on the patients&#x02019; subjective evaluations.</p><p>Third, information on the secondary outcome measures are based on standardized clinical rating scales often used as the &#x0201c;gold standard,&#x0201d; and are conducted by trained researchers blinded to intervention groups. In contrast to this, the tertiary outcomes are based on the patients&#x02019; subjective and unblinded evaluations and are, thus, at risk of performance bias.</p><p>Fourth, the intervention used in the RADMIS trials is specifically designed to address the needs of the patients when being discharged from a psychiatric hospitalization. During the design phase of the trial the software was designed in a close collaboration between patients with unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder, IT researchers, clinicians, and clinical researchers during an interactive process.</p><p>Fifth, automatically generated behavioral data collected by the smartphones will be combined in an aggregated combined measure of illness activity that will be reported as an additional outcome measure. These data are objective and have been shown to correlate with the severity of depressive and manic symptoms in studies by our group. However, using these data as outcome measures is still experimental and will be developed further during the RADMIS trials. Consequently, the aggregated smartphone-based measure of illness activity is not included as a predefined outcome measure in this study protocol.</p><p>Sixth, the Monsenso system will be available for both Android and iPhones. Thus, patients are not excluded due to preference of smartphone type and/or operating system.

In a previously trial conducted by the authors, an effect of a &#x0201c;placebo smartphone&#x0201d; was most likely not found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Further, during the last years few of the patients participating in our studies have expressed a wish to loan a smartphone free of charge. Thus, we chose not to offer a placebo smartphone in the present RADMIS trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Secondary and tertiary outcome measures</title><p>The secondary outcome measures are differences in clinically rated depressive and manic symptoms as assessed with standardized rating scales. Since the patients are aware of their allocation status these outcome measures are single blinded.
