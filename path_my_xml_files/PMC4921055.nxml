A total of 75 patients scheduled for primary TKA were invited into this study. The patients were aged between 50 to 80 years and had a full understanding of the questions in this study. The exclusion criteria were patients who had previous knee surgery, history of cancer in the process of cancer treatment, and history of nickel allergy. Two patients were excluded from the study because of previous knee surgery and three patients declined to participate in the study. Finally, 70 patients were enrolled in the study and provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board. The procedures in this study were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Patients were randomised into two groups by blocks of four using a computer generated random number.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Opaque sealed envelopes were used for allocation concealment. The random allocation was done in the operative room after subcutaneous stitches were finished. In the first group of 34 patients, the skin on the upper half of the wound was closed with skin staples and the lower half of the wound was closed with simple nylon stitches. In the second group of 36 patients, the skin on the upper half of the wound was closed with nylon stitches and the lower half of the wound was closed with skin staples. The patients were randomised into different suture positions to decrease confounding factors from different soft-tissue conditions between the upper and lower parts of the TKA wound.</p><p>All patients underwent TKA with the same surgical techniques and instruments. Cemented posterior stabilised total knee prostheses (NexGen Legacy posterior-stabilised (LPS-flex), Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana) were used in every patient. Cefazolin was injected 30 minutes prior to starting the operation for prophylaxis against surgical infection. Clindamycin was used for patients with a penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. A single dose of tranexamic acid was injected before inflating a tourniquet. The operations were performed under inflated pneumatic tourniquet throughout the operation. A suction drain was placed in the joint before the joint capsule was closed. For capsule closure figure-of-eight stitches by No. 1 polyglactin 910 (Coated Vicryl Plus, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, New Jersey) were used. For subcutaneous approximation suture 3-0 polyglactin 910 (Coated Vicryl Plus, Ethicon Inc.) with buried knots was used. After subcutaneous suturing, the wound length was measured with a sterile ruler. The skin was then closed with skin staples (Proximate Plus MD 35 W, Ethicon Endo-surgery LLC, Guaynabo, Peurto Rico) for half of the length of the wound and 4-0 nylon (Ethilon, Ethicon Inc.) simple interrupted stitches for the second half of the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2046-3758.55.2000629">Fig. 1</xref>). Skin closure was undertaken in the 45&#x000b0; knee flexion position.

Wound care was performed with a Betadine swab (Betadine, Ids Manufacturing Co., Ltd, Pathum Thani, Thailand) and covered with sterile gauze daily. Aspirin was used as the thromboembolic prophylaxis. The suction drain was removed at 48 hours after the operation. The patients were followed up at day 5, day 14 and six weeks, three months, and six months after surgery. The stitches were removed on post-operative day 14.</p><p>The level of pain was recorded by a verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) immediately after the stitches were removed. Wound complications such as stitch abscess, wound dehiscence, prolonged discharge, and the resuture rate were recorded. In the study design, if a wound developed a generalised infection, we would consider that both the proximal and distal ends of the wound had developed the complication.</p><p>The degree of patient satisfaction with the wound appearance was also evaluated by a VNRS where 10 indicated &#x02018;Most satisfied&#x02019; and 0 represented &#x02018;Least satisfied&#x02019;. The Hollander wound evaluation score was used for wound cosmetic evaluation. The assessor evaluated the wounds on a 0 or 1 point scale in each category for the presence or absence of a step-off, contour irregularities, margin separation, edge inversion, excessive distortion, and overall appearance.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Wound complications and patient satisfaction were recorded on day 5, day 14, six weeks, three months, and six months after surgery. The Hollander wound evaluation scores were recorded at day 14, six weeks, three months, and six months after surgery. Pain upon removal of the stitches and the degree of patient satisfaction were recorded by a trained member of staff who was blinded to treatment allocation. However, wound complications and the Hollander wound evaluation scores were recorded by another member of staff who was not blinded to treatment allocation, as direct wound observation was required for every follow-up visit.</p><sec id="section10-2046-3758.55.2000629"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analyses were performed with R version 3.1.0 software (R Foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria).

Therefore, the authors of this study evaluated the efficacy of skin staples and nylon sutures in the same knee of the same patient.</p><p>This study has a number of limitations. First, we could not blind the patient from the different methods of closure of the patient&#x02019;s knee because it might increase the difficulty in patient care procedures. Furthermore, the patients could see the wound when the dressings were changed, and after they were discharged from hospital. Secondly, the assessor for wound complications and the Hollander evaluation score was also not blinded from the wound closure method because direct observation for the evaluation of the wound was needed. However, a different assessor was blinded from the wound closure method while recording the VNRS for the patient&#x02019;s satisfaction and pain score upon stitch removal. Finally, this study was likely underpowered due to the lower than expected complication rate. However, the results of this study will be beneficial in planning a future study that is sufficiently powered to confirm our findings.</p><p>The wound complication rate in TKA was not different between the two types of wound closure in this study. Similarly, in a randomised study, Hlubek et al<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> found late discharge in 25.6% of fifth post-operative day stapled wounds and late discharge in 30.3% of sutured wounds, and treatment for late discharge was required in 6.1% and 7.7% of sutured wounds and stapled wounds, respectively (no statistical difference). However, in another randomised study by Stockley and Elson,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> skin stapled wounds had a higher rate of wound complications (13.3% marked erythema, 3.3% superficial wound infection) compared with nylon stitched wounds (no outcomes).</p><p>There have been no recent studies that compared the results of patient satisfaction of the wound appearance and cosmesis scores between skin staples and nylon stitches. However, there was one randomised controlled trial study that reported no differences in patient satisfaction and the cosmesis score of skin staples compared with 2-octylcyanoacrylate and monocryl subcutaneous suture in TKA patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This study found that skin staples had comparable results with nylon sutures in terms of patient satisfaction and the cosmesis score.</p><p>The overall mean BMI in our study was relatively low (26.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, standard deviation 6.3) compared with previous studies which reported a range from 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This result was possibly one cause of the lower rate of wound complications compared with previous studies. Therefore, the results from this study should be applied to non-obese patients.</p><p>Pain upon staple removal compared with nylon stitches in TKA patients has been previously reported by others. Stockley and Elson<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> reported more pain upon removal of skin staples than nylon stitches. Another study also found a higher pain score for staple removal compared with suture removal.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2046-3758.55.2000629" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, this study found no differences in the wound complication rate, patient satisfaction of wound appearance, and cosmesis score in TKA wound closure between skin staples and nylon stitches in non-obese patients. The benefit of skin staples over nylon stitches was a decrease in operative time. However, skin staples are more painful upon removal compared with nylon stitches. Based on this, we believe that surgeons can consider either type of skin closure technique which depends on surgeon preferences.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contribution:</bold> V.
