Interventions can increase short-term physical activity (PA), but health benefits require maintenance. Few interventions have evaluated PA objectively beyond 12 months. We followed up two pedometer interventions with positive 12-month effects to examine objective PA levels at 3&#x02013;4 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>Long-term follow-up of two completed trials: Pedometer And Consultation Evaluation-UP (PACE-UP) 3-arm (postal, nurse support, control) at 3 years and Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation-Lift (PACE-Lift) 2-arm (nurse support, control) at 4 years post-baseline. Randomly selected patients from 10 United Kingdom primary care practices were recruited (PACE-UP: 45&#x02013;75 years, PACE-Lift: 60&#x02013;75 years). Intervention arms received 12-week walking programmes (pedometer, handbooks, PA diaries) postally (PACE-UP) or with nurse support (PACE-UP, PACE-Lift). Main outcomes were changes in 7-day accelerometer average daily step counts and weekly time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in &#x02265;10-minute bouts in intervention versus control groups, between baseline and 3 years (PACE-UP) and 4 years (PACE-Lift). PACE-UP 3-year follow-up was 67% (681/1,023) (mean age: 59, 64% female), and PACE-Lift 4-year follow-up was 76% (225/298) (mean age: 67, 53% female). PACE-UP 3-year intervention versus control comparisons were as follows: additional steps/day postal +627 (95% CI: 198&#x02013;1,056), <italic>p</italic> = 0.004, nurse +670 (95% CI: 237&#x02013;1,102), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; total weekly MVPA in bouts (minutes/week) postal +28 (95% CI: 7&#x02013;49), <italic>p</italic> = 0.009, nurse +24 (95% CI: 3&#x02013;45), <italic>p</italic> = 0.03. PACE-Lift 4-year intervention versus control comparisons were: +407 (95% CI: &#x02212;177&#x02013;992), <italic>p</italic> = 0.17 steps/day, and +32 (95% CI: 5&#x02013;60), <italic>p</italic> = 0.02 minutes/week MVPA in bouts. Neither trial showed sedentary or wear-time differences. Main study limitation was incomplete follow-up; however, results were robust to missing data sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intervention participants followed up from both trials demonstrated higher levels of objectively measured PA at 3&#x02013;4 years than controls, similar to previously reported 12-month trial effects. Pedometer interventions, delivered by post or with nurse support, can help address the public health physical inactivity challenge.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registrations</title><p>PACE-UP isrctn.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN98538934">ISRCTN98538934</ext-link>; PACE-Lift isrctn.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN42122561">ISRCTN42122561</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In this follow-up of participants from two completed trials of pedometer-based walking interventions, Tess Harris and colleagues present evidence that increases in physical activity levels seen at 12 months are still present 3-4 years later.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Why was this study done?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Brisk walking for 30 minutes or more daily on most days of the week can help adults and older adults to achieve moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) guidelines for health benefits, yet many do not achieve these levels.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Previous pedometer-based walking studies have shown positive effects on increased step counts and time in MVPA for up to 12 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For sustained health benefits, increased physical activity levels need to be maintained, yet there is a lack of data from interventions assessed using objectively measured physical activity levels beyond 12 months.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>What did the researchers do and find?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We followed up participants from two primary care 12-week pedometer-based walking trials, including both nurse-supported and postal pedometer arms, to establish whether objectively measured physical activity increases seen at 12 months were sustained at 3&#x02013;4 years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>PACE-UP followed up 45&#x02013;75-year-olds 3 years post-baseline and showed that both nurse-supported and postal pedometer interventions continued to have higher physical activity levels compared to the control group (approximately an extra 28 and 24 minutes/week, respectively, of MVPA in bouts and an extra 670 and 630 steps/day, respectively).</p></list-item><list-item><p>PACE-Lift results were very similar.

Primary analyses were conducted using STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp), with a two-step process to estimate change. In step 1, average daily step counts at 3 years (PACE-UP) or 4 years (PACE-Lift) were computed from a random-effects model, allowing for day of the week and day of wearing the accelerometer as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. In step 2, average daily step count at 3 years (PACE-UP) or 4 years (PACE-Lift) was regressed on estimated baseline average daily step count, with treatment group, age, gender, practice, and month of baseline accelerometry as fixed effects and household as a random effect in a multilevel model. Identical analyses were carried out for MVPA in &#x02265;10-minute bouts, sedentary time, and wear time. Changes in PROMs were estimated using step 2 only.</p><p>Primary analyses used 681 (PACE-UP) or 225 (PACE-Lift) participants who provided accelerometry data at 3 or 4 years, respectively. Sensitivity analyses assessed the effect of missingness: (1) multiple imputation methods were used to impute outcome data for those missing at 3 or 4 years, assuming outcomes were missing at random (MAR), conditional on model variables, and using the STATA procedure <monospace>mi impute</monospace>, and (2) missing not at random (MNAR) analyses. The purpose of the MNAR analyses was to assess how extreme the missing data needed to be in order to explain away our positive effect estimates. To do this, we used the Stata module rctmiss (Statistical Software Components [SSC] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/bocode.html">https://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/bocode.html</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Essentially, the rctmiss programme takes as its starting point MAR estimates for all subjects with missing data. It then adds or subtracts steps to the estimates before re-estimating the treatment effects. Thus, we left the control group missing values at their MAR estimates and first subtracted 500 steps/day from the MAR estimates in the treatment groups; we then took a more extreme scenario, in which we subtracted 1,000 steps/day for those in the treatment groups, again leaving the control group missing values at their MAR values.</p></sec><sec id="sec016" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 1,023 PACE-UP participants, 32 withdrew by 12 months, 2 died before the 3-year follow-up, 1 was excluded, and 681 provided &#x02265;1 day of adequate accelerometry data.

Neither PACE-UP nor PACE-Lift showed differences between intervention and control groups at 3 and 4 years for sedentary time or daily wear time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002526.t002">Table 2</xref>). A PACE-UP subgroup analysis demonstrated similar effects for steps/day in 45&#x02013;59- and 60&#x02013;75-year-olds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002526.s011">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>None of the interventions had significant effects on pain, depression, anxiety, or health-related quality of life at 3 or 4 years, consistent with 3- and 12-month findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002526.s009">S4 Table</xref>). In PACE-UP, there was a persistent exercise self-efficacy effect for the nurse group at 3 years (also seen at 3 and 12 months) but not in PACE-Lift at 4 years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002526.s010">S5 Table</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002526.t003">Table 3</xref> presents sensitivity analyses assuming that missing outcome data were MAR, conditional on a variety of predictors; analyses had little impact on the primary outcome step-count effect estimates and do not change interpretation. For the MNAR analyses, we combined both intervention groups in PACE-UP to increase power and simplify presentation; separate analyses give a similar picture. The MNAR analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002526.s012">S2 Fig</xref>) make a bigger impact for both trials but only when we assume there is a strong differential departure between the non-random effects in control and treatment groups (see solid lines in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002526.s012">S2 Fig</xref>). For example, when we assume that the missing data in the treatment groups are 1,000 steps below their MAR values while the control group values are at their MAR values, the treatment effects for PACE-UP are no longer statistically significant; but even then, the confidence interval is still largely positive.</p><table-wrap id="pmed.1002526.t003" orientation="portrait"

Compared to controls, intervention participants followed up from both PACE-UP and PACE-Lift trials showed significant increases in MVPA in bouts at 3 and 4 years of approximately an extra 30 minutes weekly, with no difference between intervention groups in PACE-UP (as was also found at 12 months). PACE-UP showed a significant step-count increase of approximately 650 steps/day; PACE-Lift showed a similar but nonsignificant step-count increase. The increases seen in PA levels were similar to those seen at 12 months. No differences were seen in sedentary or wear time.</p><p>This work&#x02019;s main strength is its documentation of longer-term follow-up results beyond 12 months from trials with objective PA data relevant to guidelines. Both trials were based on population-based primary care samples and achieved good follow-up. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that effect estimates were robust; only extreme assumptions changed interpretation. We presented findings for two trials with overlapping but different age groups and slightly different intervention intensities and follow-up periods. However, the many similarities (recruited postally from primary care; 12-week pedometer-based interventions, including nurse-support arms; accelerometer-assessed main PA outcome measures beyond 12 months) meant there was considerable value in presenting the results together. Age was not an effect modifier in PACE-UP. Despite their differences, both trials show similar consistent long-term increased time in MVPA in bouts for intervention group participants.</p><p>The study also had a number of potential limitations. Long-term follow-up data were provided by 76% of PACE-Lift and 67% of PACE-UP original trial participants. Whilst only a small proportion of participants actively withdrew from each trial, reasons for withdrawal were not systematically collected. Whilst losing between a quarter and a third of subjects at follow-up could reduce the generalizability of the findings, we have directly addressed the risk of attrition bias through sensitivity analyses using appropriate imputation methods, and this gave robust results. Participants and researchers were unmasked to group; however, PA outcomes were assessed objectively by accelerometry, and participants were blind to measurements. Participants might have tried harder with PA when monitored, but this would also have affected controls and would have been reduced by using a 7-day data collection protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Also, the intervention groups increased their MVPA in &#x02265;10-minute bouts, implying that participants made changes as advised. Whilst the Actigraph accelerometer provides valid estimates of time spent in different intensity levels, including MVPA [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], any waist-mounted activity monitor may underestimate upper body movement, such as weight training and carrying heavy loads [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; it also underestimates cycling and did not measure swimming. However, crucially, accelerometers are most sensitive to ambulatory activities such as walking, which was the main intervention component of both trials. A further potential limitation is that minimal interventions were offered to both trial control groups after 12-month follow-up. However, this contamination would tend to weaken intervention effects, so the existence of differences in PA levels at 3 and 4 years is an important positive finding and helps us to understand the additional support required for a successful postal intervention.</p><p>This paper provides novel, important evidence on sustained effects of pedometer-based walking interventions on objectively measured PA levels. A recent systematic review of the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in increasing PA at 12&#x02013;36 months [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] identified two studies that provided objectively measured outcomes beyond 12 months [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We identified two more recent studies using a similar search strategy [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In reviewing these studies, several issues emerge. First, interventions differed dramatically in duration, intensity, and resources needed&#x02014;particularly important when considering cost-effectiveness. Second, studies reported follow-up length post-baseline, not post-intervention; maintenance of effects is defined by the latter. None of the four studies provided outcomes more than 12 months post-intervention: one was 6 months post-intervention [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], two were ongoing at the point of assessment [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the final one was 12 months post-intervention [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our two studies thus provide the first clear evidence of efficacy for pedometer-based interventions at 33 months and 45 months post-intervention, providing the type of evidence from PA interventions recently called for [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The simplicity of our postal intervention makes it likely to be more cost-effective than more intensive interventions, and the PACE-UP trial cost-effectiveness analyses at 12-month follow-up demonstrated this [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Our findings support guidance to promote pedometers alongside support for goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, it is important to consider which factors in pedometer-based interventions are important for success. Both PACE-UP and PACE-Lift included a pedometer, step-count diary, and patient handbook, including BCTs and practice nurse PA consultations [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite PACE-Lift providing a more intensive nurse intervention than PACE-UP, both trials delivered similar effects on PA outcomes at 12 months [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and at 3 or 4 years. Additionally, nurse and postal interventions in PACE-UP achieved similar outcomes at 12 months [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and 3 years. These findings confirm that shorter, simpler interventions can be equally effective [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Systematic reviews suggest that individual tailoring, personalised activity goals, and using a step-count diary are important [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; all interventions from both trials provided these elements. That the minimal postal interventions given to both trial control groups at 12 months were not effective at increasing PA levels suggests that the additional support given to the original PACE-UP trial postal arm (follow-up telephone call after a week and encouragement to return completed PA diary after 3 months) was important for this group&#x02019;s success. The original postal group also had step-count targets set based on baseline blinded pedometer use and received the intervention when they had just been recruited to the trial, so they may have been more motivated. These factors may also have been important to the trial postal intervention&#x02019;s success. PA guidelines stress the importance of increasing time in MVPA [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] rather than just steps. Both of our interventions addressed this: PACE-Lift by nurse feedback on PA intensity from accelerometers [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and PACE-UP by the &#x0201c;3,000-steps-in 30-minutes&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] advice given to nurse-support and postal arms [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both trials were effective at increasing MVPA in bouts for all intervention groups at all outcome assessments: 3 and 12 months [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and now at 3 years (PACE-UP) and 4 years (PACE-Lift).</p><p>We took the effect estimates from the simplest intervention (PACE-UP postal) to estimate long-term health benefits. Based on a systematic review that quantified the strength of association between walking and coronary heart disease [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], a 28 minutes per week increase in MVPA in bouts seen in the postal group at 3 years should reduce coronary heart disease risk by approximately 4% (95% CI: 3&#x02013;5%) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002526.s005">S1 Text</xref>). A cohort study that related pedometer steps to mortality [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] allowed us to estimate that a sustained increase of 627 steps/day in the postal group at 3 years should lead to a decrease in all-cause mortality of approximately 4% (95% CI: 1&#x02013;5%) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002526.s005">S1 Text</xref>).</p><p>Whilst environmental and policy interventions are urgently required to address the global inactivity challenge [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], individual PA behaviour change interventions are also important. The sustained effects seen on objective PA outcomes at 3 years for the lower cost postal intervention suggest that this would be an effective and cost-effective [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] intervention to roll out. Minimal support is also required to check that materials have arrived and to encourage return of completed PA diaries but need not be face to face or delivered by a healthcare professional. We are currently conducting implementation work (PACE-UP Next Steps) exploring reach, retention, and ease of adoption in primary care recruiting via postal and face-to-face routes.</p><p>The use of wearables to monitor personal PA levels has dramatically increased, through smartphones, wrist- or body-worn devices, and mobile apps, offering opportunities for increasing PA. The &#x0201c;3,000-steps-in-30-minutes&#x0201d; message captures intensity and could become an important new public health goal [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], with new, easy ways to measure steps. Small short-term studies in adults and older adults demonstrate that mobile PA apps can increase PA self-monitoring [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and engagement in regular PA [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and that body-worn fitness trackers can increase time spent in MVPA [<xref rid="pmed.1002526.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. PACE-UP Next Steps is currently testing online resources and a mobile app to support the PACE-UP postal intervention. However, despite new PA monitoring opportunities, it is important not to ignore robust, trial-based evidence on effective and cost-effective pedometer- plus paper-based interventions.</p><sec id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We previously reported increased PA at 12 months following 12-week pedometer-based walking interventions for adults and older adults recruited through primary care, delivered either by post with minimal support or through nurse-supported PA consultations. The current paper demonstrates that these findings are still present in participants followed up at 3&#x02013;4 years. The long-term success of these interventions suggests that they could help to address the public health physical inactivity challenge.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002526.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist for PACE-UP 3-year follow-up.</title><p>PACE-UP, Pedometer And Consultation Evaluation-UP.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002526.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002526.s002"><label>S2 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist for PACE-Lift 4-year follow-up.</title><p>PACE-Lift, Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation-Lift.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002526.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002526.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>PACE-UP protocol, including 3-year follow-up.</title><p>PACE-UP, Pedometer And Consultation Evaluation-UP.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002526.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002526.s004"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>PACE-Lift trial protocol, including 4-year follow-up.</title><p>PACE-Lift, Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation-Lift.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002526.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002526.s005"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Details on cardiovascular and overall mortality risk reduction.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002526.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002526.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>PACE-UP and PACE-Lift trial baseline findings.</title><p>PACE-Lift, Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation-Lift;
