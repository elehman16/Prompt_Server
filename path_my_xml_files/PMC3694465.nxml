The marker was lying with the head against the end plate and the laser beam direction adjusted to be parallel to his INL. The hand position was measured using the laser beam at the upper and lower borders of the compressing hands and photographed. Hand position offset was quantified as the distance from the end plate to the center of the compressing hands in the mid-sagittal plane, compared to INL and classified as above or below. Negative offset value indicates hand placement caudal to INL. Hand position caudal to the xiphosternal junction was classified as abdominal. The laser beam was turned off until the participants had placed their hands. The researcher was blinded for the randomization when measuring the hand position from the photographs.

One of the reasons is probably that when sitting astride the arm the distance to the chest is short with a longer distance to the abdomen. Hand placement also varied less when using clear anatomical landmarks (arm and nipple line) compared to the center of the chest, which we think is more open for interpretation.</p><p>Improving hand placement for chest compressions is important since all the various instructions for hand placement used in the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], have resulted in poor hand placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], with a significant proportion of abdominal hand placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><sec><title>Kneeling astride the arm, hand placement between the nipples, or both?</title><p>Both instruction sets comprises two instructions, and both instructions in the intervention instruction set are new. Introducing two new instructions in one intervention raises the question whether it was kneeling astride the arm or placing the hands between the nipples, or both, that resulted in less abdominal hand placements. This study design does not answer this question, as we decided to test a new instruction set, not just a single instruction.</p><p>Development of these new instructions was an iterative process. In a previous simulation study we observed that many participants knelt down by the lower part of torso, when given the instructions &#x0201c;kneel down by the chest&#x0201d;. The majority of these participants also compressed too low on the chest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To prevent this, we used the patient&#x02019;s arm as landmark to position the rescuer better. While sitting astride the arm, the distance to lower half of sternum and to patient airways is short and this allow rescuers to remain in the same position and more easily alternate between compressions and ventilations without moving sideways.</p><p>Neither inter-nipple line nor center of the chest are clearly visible landmarks with three layers of clothing. Test subjects had to use their perception of these landmarks to guide themselves. Yeong reported less variability using internipple line as landmark compared to center of the chest, when identifying the location on a photo of dressed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, we observed participants in our previous simulation study who understood the center of the chest to be the same as the center of the torso. We judged that nipple line is a more specific instruction. To reduce variability and avoid too low hand placement, we selected internipple line as landmark for hand placement.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x0201c;Internipple line is unreliable&#x0201d;</title><p>ERC Guidelines 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] states that internipple line is unreliable based on studies from Shin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Kusunoki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and therefore lower half of sternum should be used in guidance for hand placement. Shin reports that internipple line location varies based on CT scans of adults. Kusunoki compared hand size (width) with lengths of sternum, and found that in overall 50% of the cases, the heel of the hand would extend to the xiphoid process, but only 3 out of 506 female patients had an internipple line crossing the xiphoid process or abdomen. Their validation study also demonstrated that the combination of female rescuer and male patient, which is the most likely combination in out of hospital cardiac arrests, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] gave no cases of hand deviation into epigastrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Using an average female hand palm size of 9.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8&#x000a0;cm, as reported by Kusunoki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], 10/18 participants from our reference group, placed their hands close to the xiphoid process and would overlap with the epigastrium, compared to only 3/18 of the intervention group. Both Kusunoki and Shin reports that the internipple line crosses the lower half of sternum. This justifies that &#x0201c;between the nipples&#x0201d; can be used in instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Time to first chest compression and between compression series</title><p>The time from scenario start until hand placement was not recorded, and it is reasonable to assume that the delay before the first compression might be longer with the intervention instructions than in the control group. Larsen and co-workers estimated a drop in survival by 2.3% per one minute delay to begin CPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. But quality of CPR seems to matter more: In the studies by Gallagher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], Van Hoeyweghen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and Wik [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], patients who received competent CPR were more than three times more likely to survive compared to those who received not-competent CPR. Based on this, it is reasonable to spend some extra seconds in the beginning to help ensure better quality CPR by avoiding abdominal compressions.</p><p>We did not test the effectiveness of kneeling astride the arm if a single rescuer performs both chest compressions and ventilations. This should reduce the need for repositioning between compression and ventilation attempts and thereby decrease time between compression series, but this needs to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The study was performed with only one adult playing the role of the patient, and in a larger study it would be beneficial to include several adults of different size and both genders.</p><p>The optimal hand placement for chest compressions is still unknown. A pilot study by Qvigstad evaluating ETCO<sub>2</sub> as a surrogate marker for cardiac output during CPR on patients indicates that there is no specific hand placement that gives optimal cardiac output for all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The purpose of our study was to test if a new set of instructions would avoid lay people placing their hands in epigastrium.</p><p>The translation of the instructions from one language to another might give semantic differences. To ensure the instructions are effective, they need to be validated, recognizing that culture and language influence our interpretation of instructions.</p><p>We tested instructions for initial hand placement only. It is unknown whether the participants would have maintained their hand placement during chest compressions or if a more cephalad hand placement would cause more shallow compressions. This should be further investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>New pre-arrival instructions where the patient&#x02019;s arm and nipple line were used as landmarks resulted in less caudal hand placements and none in the abdominal region.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Birkenes receive research scholarships provided by the Norwegian Research Council.
