affecting 4% of men and nearly 2% of women between 30 - 60 years of age
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In OSAS the upper airway becomes obstructed during sleep causing
interruptions in breathing or lowered breathing air flow. Obstructed
breathing events may last more than 10 seconds and are called apnea or
hypopnea. In most severe cases the patient can suffer from hundreds of
apnea events during sleep. These events can be followed with a static
charge sensitive bed (SCSB) where different cardio-respiratory functions
are monitored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Sleep apnea can be either obstructive, central or a combination of these
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In OSAS the predisposing factors include obesity, mandibular
retrognathia, tonsillar hypertrophy, nasal obstruction all of which
cause a decreased of posterior airway space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of OSAS includes preventive methods, use of devices that
improve oxygenation of breathing and various surgeries. Weight loss is
essential and may be the most important treatment and prevention. The
continuous positive air pressure device (CPAP) assists breathing by 
maintaining patency of the airways of the OSAS patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Surgical treatment modalities include nose surgery, septoplasty,
spreader grafts and uvulo-palato-pharygo-plasty (UPPP). Advancement of
the mandibular insertion of the suprahyoidal muscles improves
oxygenation and is achieved by means of genioplasty, by the so called
BOX-operation or by means of surgical advancement of the jaws
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The implementation of various surgical treatments is based on the 
Stanford protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] which divides surgery into two phases.</p><p>Phase I includes UPPP and BOX-operations and phase II advancement of
maxilla and mandible, often called bimaxillary advancement surgery
(BAS). According to the Stanford protocol phase II operations are
carried out in those cases where phase I operations do not lead to
positive results.</p><p>An alternative protocol has been used in the Central Hospital of
Satakunta, Pori, Finland, in which phase I is omitted and phase II
surgery is carried out as the initial surgical treatment in selected
cases. The reason for the Pori-team not to follow the Stanford protocol
was the empiric observation that bimaxillary surgery clearly relieves
selected patients&#x000b4; symptoms and that the previous results of UPPP and
BOX-operations were not very promising in treating severe cases of OSAS.
There are reports in the literature that support this notion
and many OSAS patients have occlusal and skeletal disharmonies that 
would require orthognathic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8-10</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to find out how subjective symptoms and
polysomnography findings of OSAS patients are influenced by bimaxillary
advancement surgery as the initial treatment over a 5-year follow-up
period and the outcome of this treatment when used as the initial 
surgical method in treating OSAS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethical Board of Satakunta Health Care
District and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
Helsinki Declaration.</p><p>A total of 17 patients, 15 men and 2 women with mean age of 50.9 (SD
7.9) years, were referred to the Central Hospital of Satakunta in
southwest Finland for the management of OSAS. All patients suffered from
symptoms of OSAS. The pulmonologist was responsible for the 
comprehensive care of the patients.</p><p>All patients were examined at the Pulmonary Department according to a
standard protocol including patient interview, registration of general
medical status, radiographs such as lateral skull X-ray and
polysomnography. Consultations by ear-nose and throat specialists and
orthodontists were also carried out at this stage. The orthodontist
confirmed the occlusal diagnosis based on clinical examination
and radiographic cephalometric analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Those patients who
failed CPAP trials or splint therapy were sent to the Department of Oral
and Maxillofacial Surgery for treatment and treated initially by BAS
thus omitting the phase I of the Stanford protocol. BAS included Le Fort
I osteotomy and sagittal split ramus osteotomy as described in
literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In each case a minimum of a 10 mm
mandibular advancement was carried out. The amount of maxillary
advancement was dependent on occlusal relationship. For example two
patients with normal occlusion received a mandibular advancement of 10
mm and a corresponding or matching maxillary advancement of 10 mm as
well. These patients received bimaxillary advancement surgery as they
were intolerant of both CPAP and splint therapy.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Statistical summary of preoperative characteristics of patients

uneventful without complications.</p><p>After surgery the patients were followed-up to 5 years. Of the 17
patients one died from unrelated causes and three did not appear at
their 5-year follow-up examination. Thus 13 patients were included in
the study illustrating longitudinal results up to 5 years.</p><p>The polysomnography device used was Biomatt<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Biorec, Turku,
Finland) and the data programme was Uniblott<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Unesta, Turku,
Finland). The results were evaluated by the same clinical
neurophysiologist after all tests.</p><p>Three parameters of polysomnography were followed by the
neurophysiologist in this study. These included ODI-4 (oxygen
desaturation index), mean blood oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) and
automatic analysis of static charge sensitive bed (SCSB) evaluation.
ODI-4 illustrated the number of 4% or more oxygen desaturations lasting
ten seconds or more per hour. The apnea-hypopnea index or AHI was
not recorded at the Central Hospital of Satakunta so that the
investigators were dependant on the ODI-4. All patients were confirmed
to have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome without central sleep apnea by 
the attending neurophysiologist.</p><p>SCSB evaluation was given by clinical neurophysiologist based on
different polysomnographic variables and was recorded as: no disease,
mild disease, moderate disease or severe disease. In the analysis the 
patients were divided into two groups:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p>Group A comprised of those patients with OSAS that were confirmed by
polysomnography and in whom ODI-4 index was 5 or more. None of these

orthognathic surgery and with OSAS symptoms but no clear disease on
polysomnography, where the ODI-4 index was less than 5.</p></list-item></list><p>Polysomnography was carried out in the hospital ward during the first
examination, one year and 5 years after BAS. Patients' interviews before
the treatment and at 5-year follow-up were performed with a standardized
questionnaire which was a modification of the Basic Nordic Sleep
Questionnaire (BNSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. BNSQ with 27 different items and 21
questions has been translated into different Scandinavian languages.
Questions from BNSQ have been adapted to routine clinical use in Finnish
Hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This modification was systemically used in the Central
Hospital of Satakunta and included questions such as "How often do you
suffer from daytime tiredness?", "How often do you fall asleep
involuntarily?" and "How often are you bothered by nightly arousals?" In
these questions the patients were allowed to give alternatives on a 5
degree scale: (1) never or less than once a month, (2) less than once a
week, (3) 1 - 2 days a week, (4) 3 - 5 days a week, (5) every day or
nearly every day or always or nearly always while sleeping. Additional
questions "How difficult the actual sleep apnea symptoms are in your
opinion?" and "estimate your sleep quality" were also recorded on a 5
degree scale.</p><p>At the five-year examination an extra question "How would you evaluate
the influence of the BAS treatment over all on your OSAS disease?" was
added. The answers were given similarly on five degree scale where one 
means the best and five the worst outcome.</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis</bold></p><p>The results were tabulated and means and their standard deviations were
determined. Where appropriate one-sided paired samples t-tests,
Fisher's Exact test, Mann-Whitney test, Chi-Square test and Wilcoxon test
were performed to compare pre- and post-operative results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Mean age of the patients was 52.2 (SD 8.3) years in the group A and 44.0

OSAS whether it is evaluated by objective methods or by subjective
experience. The results also show that the positive results are well 
maintained over at least the 5-year follow-up period.</p><p>The number of patients in the study is rather low which is one weakness
of the study. The strength of this study, however, is that the patients
were operated by same surgeons by same methods under a relatively short 
time.</p><p>There are only few previous studies that report on the long-term results
of BAS treatment of OSAS patients. This study describes the long-term
outcome of OSAS patients in whom the Stanford protocol has been omitted 
and BAS has been carried out as an initial treatment.</p><p>In this study we have also been able to follow the outcome of patients
who complained of serious sleep apnea symptoms even though the disease
was not confirmed by polysomnography (group B). Generally the patients
in this group reported satisfaction with the BAS operation. Also blood
oxygenation and polysomnography showed clear improvement. This is a new 
finding in the area of sleep apnea research.</p><p>In group A, which contained patients with a confirmed diagnosis of OSAS,
the ODI-4 index showed a dramatic fall after operation and remained low
or even decreased over the 5 years of follow-up. The authors feel that
the maintenance of the positive result is the most important finding of
this study. The patients' mean preoperative ODI-4 of 17.8 (SD 12) in
group A was lower than reported in some other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].
The postoperative ODI-4 value of 3.5 (SD 3.4) was in accordance
with the previously cited studies.</p><p>In group B the ODI-4 index was low from the beginning and did not fall
further. It is remarkable though, that this index did not become worse 
despite the aging of the patients.</p><p>In group A the oxygen saturation also improved slightly. The
preoperative saturation level of 96.3% (SD 1.2) was relatively high
compared with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The saturation in the mentioned
studies varied between 92% and 93%. The increase of the mean saturation
from 94.3% (SD 1.6) to 96.3% (SD 1.2) in group A and from 96.3% (SD 2.0)
to 97.8% (SD 1.7) in group B are in coincidence with other studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>It is also clear that oxygen saturation in group B increased (P = 0.056
in paired differences t-test) and the patients reported improvement in
their condition. Group B complained of sleep apnea type symptoms
preoperatively but OSAS could not be detected according to ODI-4. Is it
possible that sleep apneas themselves are not the only explanation for
the disease? The authors suspect that low oxygen saturation without
cessation of breathing is one of the reasons for patients' symptoms. The
ODI-4 index does not register falls in saturation of less than 4% and
these patients did not complain of snoring either pre- or
post-operatively.</p><p>The increase of oxygen saturation seems to improve the patient's general
outcome. This is possibly the explanation for the fact the patients in
this group generally felt relief of the disease after the operation.
This cannot be measured by ODI-4, which originally was low, falsely
indicating that there is no sleep apnea disease.</p><p>The influence of increased BMI-value is also very important and should
never be underestimated. All patients, who reported negative subjective
development of OSAS or showed worsened objective results, have gained
weight. This was the fact especially in one patient whose BMI increased
28% (from 30 to 38) during the follow-up and partly explained the
increase of his ODI-4. It should also be recognized that this patient
informed to have experienced only "some improvement" after the 
operation. This patient had the greatest increase in BMI value.</p><p>The patients` own opinions showed clear satisfaction. Subjectively most
patients experienced improvement in their condition or felt that their
disease had even become cured due to surgery. Only patients, whose
weight had significantly increased, reported uncertainty in this
respect. This is in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14-16</xref>].
</p><p>In group A only one patient reported that BAS had given only slight
relief or the situation remained unchanged. In this case the improvement
of ODI-4 was considerable, but there was still residual disease. While
the SCSB evaluations showed that OSAS disease was still present, the
patient`s condition was, however, much better than prior to the
operation. In this case a 24.4 score decrease in ODI-4 could be
observed.</p><p>All patients in group B reported increased satisfaction and only two of
them reported "some improvement". One of these was the patient in whom
the BMI increased by 28%. The patient's SCSB evaluation also showed
progression of OSAS. The other case had OSAS neither prior to or after
the operation according to SCSB evaluation. He had mandibular
retrognathia and subjective sleep apnea symptoms preoperatively. There
was another patient whose preoperative SCSB evaluation showed no
evidence of disease. Also this patient felt, however, that his condition 
had significantly improved.</p><p>In group B there was one patient, who had some signs of OSAS both pre-
and postoperatively. One factor could be that his BMI had increased by 
7%.</p><p>In the group A daytime tiredness and tendency to fall asleep seemed to
have improved. That may be the most important factor for the
satisfaction of these patients. It is paradoxical, however, that one
patient showed worse evaluation post-operatively than preoperatively yet 
his over-all evaluation of the effect of BAS was positive.</p><p>In group B also the improved quality of sleep and diminished nightly 
arousals are to be notified.</p><p>Surgical techniques in this study were uniform being performed by one of
two surgeons. The authors feel that operative technique can influence
the results of this operation and also the sleep apnea parameters. For
example during the operations the height of the maxilla was not
especially taken into account while according to author's later
experiences it has become clear that there is a big difference whether 
maxilla is lowered or elevated in these surgeries.</p><p>By omitting the phase one of the Stanford protocol, the patients`
motivation remains high and results are better accepted as the patients
experience less morbidity. If patients have both occlusal problems and
sleep apnea symptoms, it is justified to perform bimaxillary surgery, to
solve both problems simultaneously. In these cases UPPP and/or Box
osteotomy as initial surgical treatment would be less indicated as
occlusal problems require surgical treatment in any case. Orthognatic
patients who complain of sleep apnea-type symptoms should always be
examined, keeping bimaxillary surgery in mind. The patients should
undergo a polysomnographic examination. In the presence of sleep apnea
symptoms a bimaxillary surgery with approximately 10 mm advancement of
mandible may alleviate OSAS. Also in cases in which the disease is
present even though no occlusal discrepancies are observed the "initial"
BAS is indicated especially when patient's motivation is high. There are
also a great number of OSAS patients who cannot tolerate CPAP treatment
and an alternative treatment such as BAS should be available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].
Professional drivers, for example, are a group where the most efficient
method of treatment should be carried out primarily. This can be
justified for safety and economic reasons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study supports earlier findings and experience that BAS is an
effective and safe treatment modality of OSAS. According to this study
the positive influence of BAS on OSAS as initial surgery is well
maintained over a 5 years period. These results support and strengthen
the idea of BAS as the initial treatment of obstructive sleep apnea
without Stanford Stage I surgery such as UPPP or BOX-operations.</p><p>For some unknown reason the BMI of the patients in this study seemed to
increase over the duration of the follow-up. Some unfavourable changes
in the patients' condition can be explained by an increase of BMI. The
role of weight gain remains essential in accordance with earlier
studies. Patients should receive counselling about the extreme
importance of weight loss and for the long-term support to prevent
future weight gain in order to protect the outcomes of their sleep apnea
surgery.</p><p>The influence of different treatment plans and techniques of BAS on OSAS
requires further research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec sec-type="acknowledgements and disclosure statements"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Palta</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dempsey</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Skatrud</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Badr</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><source>The occurrence of sleep-disordered breathing among middle-aged adults.
