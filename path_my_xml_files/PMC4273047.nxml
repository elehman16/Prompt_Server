for lower extremity rehabilitation in the clinical setting. The purpose of this study was
to evaluate the effects on anaerobic performance and anthropometrical adaptations during
FW and BW on a treadmill. [Subjects and Methods] A convenience sample of thirty healthy
male subjects with a mean age of 20.93 &#x000b1; 2.54&#x02005;years participated in this study. Subjects
were divided into 2 groups, a Forward Walking Group (FWG) (n=15) and a Backward Walking
Group (BWG) (n=15), which performed FW and BW on a treadmill at 10&#x000b0; inclination,
respectively. The training consisted of three sessions per week for 6 weeks. Study
outcomes such as anaerobic performance and anthropometrical body composition were measured
at pre- and post-intervention. [Results] Both FW and BW improved anaerobic performance
significantly, and the BW group showed better performance than FW. However, changes in
anthropometrical body composition were found to be not significant after six weeks of
intervention in both the FW and BW groups. [Conclusions] BW training in rehabilitation can
be considered more effective than FW at improving anaerobic performance. We also conclude
that six weeks of FW and BW training is insufficient for eliciting changes in the body
composition.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Backward walking</kwd><kwd>Anaerobic</kwd><kwd>Body composition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Physical inactivity is being increasingly recognized as a major problem in global health.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.3 million people die around the world
each year due to physical inactivity, making it the fourth leading underlying cause of
mortality<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is not surprising that
physical inactivity has a substantial cost burden in addition to a large health burden. The
current guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention recommend at least 30 minutes of
moderate intensity physical activity on five or more days per week or 20 minutes of vigorous
exercise on three days per week<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical activities of moderate intensity, such as walking, jogging, and running can be
incorporated into everyday life. Walking has been established as a form of endurance
training for injury prevention and has sufficient training effects with little risk of
overstrain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking is a popular,
convenient, and relatively safe form of exercise and also holds great promise for weight
management<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Walking has long been used by both fitness and rehabilitation professionals to improve
cardiovascular fitness and to rehabilitate musculoskeletal injuries. Humans generally learn
to walk and run in a forward direction with little difficulty. This is inherently logical
since our field of view is in the forward direction. Because of its functionality, most
walking studies and clinical protocols have involved forward walking (FW). Backward walking
(BW) reverses leg movement trajectories: the leg not only reverses its direction of
movement, it also travels in the opposite direction along virtually the same path as in
FW<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that BW has
training effects that are different from those of FW<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, running or walking backward is used as a preferred
rehabilitation exercise for some conditions, in particular when the impact of heel strike
needs to be avoided<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
different effects of FW and BW in terms of their physiological aspects are still unknown.
The purpose of this study was to compare forward and backward locomotion training and their
effects on physical performance, such as anaerobic capacity, and anthropometrical body
composition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A convenience sample of 30 healthy male subjects with a mean age of 20.93 &#x000b1; 2.54&#x02005;years, a
mean weight of 59.43 &#x000b1; 5.38&#x02005;kg, and a mean height of 1.69 &#x000b1; 0.05&#x02005;m were recruited on a
university campus for this study. The present study was reviewed and approved by the
institutional ethical committee and written consent was obtained prior to the study from all
the participants. Inclusion criteria for study participation were: healthy young males, aged
between 18&#x02013;28 years, normal BMI and no active exercise/sports participation. Subjects with
any lower extremity injury in the past 6 months, cardiac or metabolic condition, or back,
hip, knee or ankle dysfunctions were excluded. Subjects were selected following the
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and were randomly and evenly divided into 2 groups: the
Forward Walking Group (FWG), and the Backward Walking Group (BWG) (n=15 in each group). FWG
and BWG performed forward and backward walking, respectively.</p><p>Pre- and post-test anaerobic performance was calculated from the results of the
Running-based Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. A warm-up of light jogging for 5 minutes
was followed by 5 minutes rest. Then, each subject performed six sprints over 35 meters with
a 10-second rest between each sprint. The time taken for each sprint along with body weight
was used to calculate RAST.<disp-formula>Power = Body Weight &#x000d7; Distance <sup>2</sup> &#x000f7;
Time<sup>3</sup>; Average Power (AP) = Sum of all six values &#x000f7; 6</disp-formula></p><p>Pre- and post-test anthropometrical body composition measurements were used to calculate
Body Density (Db)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, Percentage Body Fat
(% BF)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, Fat Mass (FM)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, Fat Free Body Mass (FFM)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on anatomical landmarks in the
Anthropometric Standardization Reference Manual, the skin folds of the triceps, subscapula,
and abdomen were used to calculate Db. The average values of the three skin folds sites,
i.e. triceps, subscapula, and abdomen were summed (&#x02211;3SKF) and entered into the equation to
determine Db, which was subsequently used to calculate % BF, FM and FFM.<disp-formula>Db =
[1.0973-(0.000815 &#x000d7; &#x02211;3SKF)] + [0.00000084 &#x000d7; (&#x02211;3SKF)<sup>2</sup>

start of the training of either FW/BW at a self-selected speed, without inclination 3
supervised 10 minute sessions. At the start of the intervention, the treadmill was
calibrated and adjusted to produce a constant speed of 4.0 mph and an uphill inclination of
10 degree<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were given 1
minute of accommodation followed by 6 minutes of training. The purpose of the accommodation
phase was to gradually increase the speed and the inclination of the treadmill to
acclimatize the subjects to the walking pattern and to set the training parameters to the
desired training levels. The FWG performed 6 minutes of forward treadmill walking at an
inclination of 10&#x000b0; and a constant speed of 4 mph, 3 sessions per week, for a period of 6
weeks with one day rest between sessions. The BWG performed backward treadmill walking at
the same speed and inclination with the same training schedule.</p><p>Outcome measures such as anaerobic performance and anthropometrical body composition (i.e.
Db, % BF, FM, and FFM) were measured pre- and post-intervention. The statistical software
package, SPSS version 17, was used for data analysis. The values are reported as mean &#x000b1; SD.
The unpaired Student&#x02019;s t-test was used to examine the significance of group differences for
all the dependent variables and the paired t-test was used to analyze within group
differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Within group analysis of anaerobic performance showed significant differences within both

BW training and greater improvement was shown by BWG than by FWG. In contrast, 6 weeks of FW
and BW intervention elicited no statistically significant changes in the body composition
values of Db, % BF, FM, or FFM.</p><p>There are several possible reasons for the anaerobic improvement. BW is a novel task in
which a larger number of motor units may be recruited, and this may result in increased
energy utilization. Increased motor unit recruitment would result in a greater amount of
skeletal muscle activation than in an equivalent familiar task. Schwane et al. reported that
a relatively new motor task increases motor unit recruitment, thus increasing the metabolic
cost of the activity<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent study
also demonstrated an improvement elicited by Nordic BW training, due to more efficient motor
unit recruitment and as a result of practice<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Others have also suggested that BW imposes a greater burden on the
medial sensorimotor cortices<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and that
BW elicits greater activity in the medial motor cortices than forward walking<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently, greater motor unit
recruitment may increase oxygen demand to the point that the muscle contractile output
requires greater support through anaerobic pathways.</p><p>Vilensky et al. reported that BW was different from FW. They observed that BW was
associated with increased cadence and decreased stride length compared to FW<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that the muscle action
of the knee extensors is largely eccentric and concentric during FW, while it is isometric
and concentric during BW<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Concentric
muscle contraction has been shown to have a higher energy cost than eccentric muscle work,
and a dramatically higher energy cost than that of eccentric resistance was reported in the
performance of concentric cycle ergometry<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is postulated that during concentric contractions, when the
muscle fiber cross bridge has completed its power stroke and produced shortening, ATP is
required for detachment and resetting of cross bridges. Conversely, during eccentric
contractions the cross bridge is forcibly detached and reattached without further ATP
splitting<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been reported
that the work of the knee extensor increases during the stance phase of backward running
when compared with forward running<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Devita et al. reported that total lower extremity muscle work was similar during forward
running and backward running at the same speed despite a significant change in muscle power
and work output<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This could be the
reason behind the anaerobic power improvements observed in both FWG and BWG.</p><p>The body composition changes in the FW and BW groups were found to be not significant
(p&#x0003e;0.05). Similarly, Hinkleman et al. suggested that moderate exercise training alone may
not be sufficient to affect body composition<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walker et al. also observed that normoglycemic women failed to
lose body fat after 12 weeks of exercise in a walking program<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been demonstrated that the joint torque profiles of
the hip and knee in BW are quite similar to those of FW with a reverse sequence, but with
different time durations of flexion and extension<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings are also supportive of the lack of impact on body
composition observed in the FWG and the BWG in the present study. However, it is also true
that the kinetic factors of ankle power and workload are lower during backward walking than
in forward walking. During backward walking plantar flexion plays only a small role in
propulsion, and the propulsive force in backward walking may come from segments other than
the ankle. Possible sources of the propulsive force are strategies involving hip power and
the center of gravity<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking speed
and the mobility improvements have also been observed after backward treadmill walking with
Body Weight Support (BWS) in the early phase of stroke, and it is postulated that BW is
superior to FW at increasing the exercise intensity of muscle activities because it requires
higher energy consumption, even in a short period of time<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Positive correlations have been reported between the acceleration
values of C7 and S2 and the muscular strengths of the hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and
triceps surae, and these muscles contribute to acceleration of the trunk in the backward
stepping reaction<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Though BW has been proven to demand greater metabolic activity than its counterpart,
forward walking, the exercise intensity might not have been sufficient enough to elicit a
change in body composition in our present study. The training duration is a possible reason
for the lack of significant changes observed in body composition in the present study.</p><p>The high levels of blood lactate measured in the study done by Flynn et al. suggest
backward walking relies on a higher percentage of anaerobic metabolism than forward
walking<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, our study results
are supportive of previous findings, and we assume that higher metabolic demand is one
reason for the changes in anaerobic performance observed in the backward walking group in
the present study. However, these aspects need to be further investigated.</p><p>The present study was limited by the inclusion of participants with lower than normal BMI.
We recommend conducting further studies to further explore the effects of forward and
backward walking training on body composition values of overweight and obese groups of
subjects.</p><p>We conclude that both backward and forward walking improve anaerobic performance, but not
anthropometrical body composition values. Also, backward walking is more effective than
forward walking at improving anaerobic performance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors extend their appreciation to the College of Applied Medical Sciences Research
