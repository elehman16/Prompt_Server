The GDM affects a substantial number of pregnancies. The overall incidence of 3-6% has steady increased over time, ranging from 2.2% in South America to 15% in the India.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Maternal hyperglycemia causes a greater transfer of glucose to the fetus, causing fetal hyperinsulinemia and an overgrowth of insulin-sensitive (mainly adipose) tissues, with excessive fetal growth, resulting in more trauma at birth, shoulder dystocia and perinatal deaths.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Carbohydrate is main dietary source for fetal brain development and at least 175 g/day of carbohydrates are recommended in the pregnant women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Carbohydrates intake with a low-glycemic index (GI) result in smaller increase in postprandial glucose concentration than after high GI diet in normal and also type 2 diabetic patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Ingestion of 25 g fiber induces 10-15% reduction in 2 hr postprandial glucose level in impaired glucose tolerance subjects,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and lower dietary fiber intake and higher dietary glycemic load (GL) are positively related to the incident of GDM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is the cornerstone approach to treatment of women with GDM,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and almost up to 80-90% cases of GDM can be effectively managed with MNT.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] However limited information is available to allow evidence-based recommendations regarding specific nutritional approaches such as total calories, nutrient distribution, fiber content, GI and GL to the management of GDM.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of low GI-low GL diet in postprandial blood concentration, specifically the effect of wheat bran on blood glucose of GDM subjects and on reducing the number of women with GDM requiring insulin.

Similarly 2 hrs pp blood concentration reduced by 29.6% and 21.3% in &#x0201c;Fiber&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Without Fiber&#x0201d; group respectively compare to 2 hrs GTT. We found that 7 (38%) of 18 women in Fiber group and 10 (76%) in &#x0201c;Without Fiber&#x0201d; group needed insulin treatment. In similar study conducted in Wollongong city in Australia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Of the 31 women randomly assigned to a low-glycemic index diet, 9 (29%) required insulin, and a significant higher proportion, 19 out of 32 (59%) women who assigned to a higher glycemic index diet underwent insulin treatment. While there were similar a minimum amount of around 175 g/day LGI carbohydrate in both studies, the differences can be explained by different GDM diagnosed and monitoring criteria approached in two studies. In our study GDM diagnosis was according to guideline of the &#x0201c;<italic>Standards of medical care in diabetes</italic>&#x0201d;,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] while in Wollongong study GDM diagnosis was based on the modified Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society (ADIPS) criteria;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] fasting blood glucose level (BGL) &#x02265;5.5 mmol/L (_100 mg/dl), 1 hr BGL &#x02265; 10.0 mmol/L (_181 mg/dl), or 2 hrs BGL &#x02265; 8.0 mmol/L (_145 mg/dl) vs. 92, 181, 152 mg/dl in our study. Also in another study conducted by Louie <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] in comparing LGI diet (GI &#x02264; 50) with high fiber diet (GI ~ 60) among 99 GDM women, 53% of first group vs. 65% in second group required insulin treatment.</p><p>The mechanism behind the fact that the LGL diet plus fiber intake was more effective in blood glucose of GDM subjects is that fiber slows carbohydrate absorption and reducing GI of meal. It is worthy to notice that the most of the GDM women in our study who were candidate for insulin treatment were unwilling to commence insulin treatment and 6 of them in &#x0201c;Without Fiber&#x0201d; group switched to &#x0201c;Fiber&#x0201d; group. Similarly, 47% of the women in the Wollongong study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] in high-GI group who met the criteria for insulin commencement avoided insulin by switching to an LGI diet.</p><p>Our current study has strength and limitation. The strengths are that the LGL with fiber diet is not harsh treatment and is acceptable by patients. The limitation of study is that the LGL diet which contains low carbohydrate percentage is not food habits of patients and food choice limitation may not result in sufficient weight gain that is goal of pregnant women. However the diet will be ideal to GDM women with BMI &#x0003e; 25 which need the minimum of weight gain during pregnancy.</p><p>In summary our finding was consistence with others finding. Low glycemic index diet containing extra added fiber for women with GDM is appropriate, safe and well tolerated and a low GL diet with fiber significantly reduces the need for the use of insulin.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was funded by Qazvin Metabolic Diseases Research Center, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Magon</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Seshiah</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gestational diabetes mellitus: Non-insulin management</article-title><source>Indian J Endocrinol Metab</source><year>2011</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>234</fpage><lpage>53</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22028991</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lapolla</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Dalfra</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Fedele</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Management of gestation diabetes mellitus</article-title><source>Diabetic Metab Syndr Obes Targets Ther</source><year>2009</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>73</fpage><lpage>82</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Food and Nutrition Board.
