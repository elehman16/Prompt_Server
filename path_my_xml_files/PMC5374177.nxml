In three randomized, controlled, phase III trials, fingolimod reduced the annual rate of brain volume loss (BVL) in patients with relapsing MS (RMS) by approximately one-third relative to that in individuals receiving placebo or intramuscular interferon beta-1a. Analysis of brain volume changes during study extensions has shown that this reduced rate of BVL is sustained in patients with RMS receiving fingolimod continuously. Subgroup analyses of the core phase III and extension studies have shown that reductions in the rate of BVL are observed irrespective of levels of inflammatory lesion activity seen by magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and on study; levels of disability at baseline; and treatment history. The rate of BVL in these studies was predicted independently by T2 lesion and gadolinium-enhancing lesion burdens at baseline, and correlations observed between BVL and increasing levels of disability strengthened over time. In another phase III trial in patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS), fingolimod did not reduce BVL overall relative to placebo; however, consistent with findings in RMS, there was a treatment effect on BVL in patients with PPMS with gadolinium-enhancing lesion activity at baseline. The association between treatment effects on BVL and future accumulation of disability argues in favor of measuring BVL on a more routine basis and with a more structured approach than is generally the case in clinical practice. Despite several practical obstacles, progress is being made in achieving this goal.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="FPar1"><title>Key Points</title><p>

On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), brain volume loss (BVL) between two or more time points can be accurately determined by co-registration-based analysis, using algorithms such as &#x02018;Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy&#x02019; (SIENA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patients with MS lose brain volume (BV) at a considerably faster rate than age-matched individuals who do not have MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and data from studies using the SIENA method have shown that the annual percentage BV change (PBVC) among healthy adults is approximately &#x02212;0.1 to &#x02212;0.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], compared with &#x02212;0.4 to &#x02212;1.0% in patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, a threshold annual rate of &#x02212;0.4% can distinguish healthy individuals from patients with MS, with a specificity of 80% and a sensitivity of 65% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. BVL has been shown to correlate with and predict disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], representing a relevant measure of central nervous system damage associated with MS disease progression. As such, BVL is a useful outcome measure for evaluating the relative efficacy of MS therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Fingolimod (Gilenya<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, FTY720; Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator and was the first oral therapy (0.5&#x000a0;mg once daily) available for patients with relapsing MS (RMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In three randomized, double-blind, controlled, phase III studies of fingolimod in patients with RMS (FREEDOMS [FTY720 Research Evaluating Effects of Daily Oral therapy in Multiple Sclerosis] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], FREEDOMS II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and TRANSFORMS [Trial Assessing injectable interferon vs FTY720 Oral in Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]), consistent reductions in the rate of BVL were observed with fingolimod compared with placebo or intramuscular interferon beta-1a (IFN&#x003b2;-1a IM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Reductions in the rate of BVL have also been reported for a number of MS disease-modifying therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Treatment with IFN&#x003b2; or glatiramer acetate reduced the rate of BVL compared with no treatment in patients with relapsing&#x02013;remitting MS (RRMS), and over 5&#x000a0;years BVL was lower with glatiramer acetate than with either low-dose or high-dose IFN&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. More recently, a retrospective analysis of natalizumab therapy in patients with MS showed that although significant BVL occurred during the first year of therapy, the rate was reduced in the second and third years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and compared with subcutaneous IFN&#x003b2;, alemtuzumab slowed the rate of BVL in patients with RRMS over 2 years in the two CARE-MS (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis) trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The precise mechanism by which fingolimod reduces the rate of BVL in patients with RMS has not been fully elucidated, but may be a consequence of direct anti-inflammatory effects and of indirect effects on neurodegenerative processes triggered by inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Data reviewed here will focus on the fingolimod 0.5-mg dose, although significant effects on BVL were also seen among patients receiving the 1.25-mg dose in clinical trials. A substantial proportion of participants in FREEDOMS, FREEDOMS II and TRANSFORMS continued to receive fingolimod in the respective extensions to these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and most continue to be followed up under the umbrella of the LONGTERMS study, a single-arm, open-label extension following up patients with relapsing MS receiving fingolimod, who were enrolled in the various phase II, III and IIIb fingolimod trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The effect of fingolimod in patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS) has also been evaluated in the phase III placebo-controlled INFORMS trial (Oral Fingolimod in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>In this review, we will focus on the effects of fingolimod in reducing the rate of BVL in these studies, and in various patient subgroups, based on demographic, clinical, or MRI characteristics at baseline. We will also discuss the clinical significance of, and factors that may be predictive of, increased rates of BVL in patients with MS. Finally, we will summarize guideline recommendations and challenges for the routine assessment of changes in BV in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Effect of Fingolimod on BVL in Patients with RMS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reductions in BVL with Fingolimod: Evidence from Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Phase III Studies</title><p>The three phase III studies of fingolimod in patients with RMS were FREEDOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], FREEDOMS II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and TRANSFORMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for an overview of the study designs).

Overall, BVL was greater in patients with Gd+ lesions at baseline than in those without; however, fingolimod significantly reduced BVL in both subgroups compared with placebo (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Patients in FREEDOMS and in TRANSFORMS were stratified into three subgroups, which were categorized based on the European approval criteria for fingolimod at the time. Patients in group 1 had had at least as many relapses in the year before enrollment as in the preceding year, and those in group&#x000a0;2 had had at least one relapse in the year before enrollment, and at least either one Gd+ lesion or nine T2 lesions at baseline; patients in both groups had previously received IFN&#x003b2; therapy before enrollment.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Baseline Predictors of On-Study BVL</title><p>In the first of the two analyses discussed in the previous section, demographic variables such as age and sex did not predict on-study BVL, whereas baseline clinical and MRI characteristics such as disability level (MSFC score), disease burden (baseline T2 and T1-hypointense lesion volumes), inflammatory lesion activity (Gd+ lesion count), and NBV all significantly predicted risk of BVL over the 1- to 2-year study period (all <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). The strongest individual predictors were baseline T2 lesion volume and Gd+ lesion count. Notably, T2 lesion volume was a better predictor of BVL than was T1-hypointense lesion volume, perhaps indicating that T2 lesion volume captures evidence of current lesion activity, and hence is more likely to reflect future lesion activity than is T1-hypointense lesion volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In the post hoc analysis of the TRANSFORMS data set, baseline Gd+ lesion count, total T2 lesion volume, disease duration, and NBV were all significant predictors of BVL over the 1-year study period (all <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), and among these, baseline Gd+ lesion count was the strongest predictor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Longitudinal Factors that Correlate with BVL on Study</title><p>During FREEDOMS, FREEDOMS II, TRANSFORMS, and their extensions, the greatest levels of BVL correlated with the most pronounced MRI and clinical activity. For example, the number of confirmed relapses, the number of new/enlarged T2 lesions, and the cumulative number of Gd+ lesions all correlated strongly with the observed BVL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. After 1&#x000a0;year, there was also a significant correlation between the extent of BVL and the increase in EDSS score from baseline in the combined analysis population, and this relationship between BVL and worsening disability strengthened with time during the 4&#x000a0;years analyzed. As described earlier for this analysis, disability at baseline correlated more strongly with baseline NBV than with BVL on study, even though the strength of correlation between disability worsening and BVL was seen to increase over time. The strength of correlation with NBV at baseline may be indicative of the fact that in these studies, the patients enrolled, on average, 7&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years after the appearance of first MS symptoms; hence, NBV at baseline effectively reflects BVL from the time of disease onset to enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Clinical Relevance of BVL and Implications for Fingolimod</title><p>A recent meta-analysis of 13 placebo-controlled studies that included more than 13,500 patients with RMS (treated with alemtuzumab, dimethyl fumarate, cladribine, fingolimod, glatiramer acetate, IFN&#x003b2;-1a IM, IFN&#x003b2;-1b, natalizumab, or teriflunomide) showed that over a 2-year period, treatment effects on BVL and on T2 lesions correlated independently with treatment effects on disability progression. Importantly, treatment effects on BVL and on T2 lesions in combination accounted for a greater proportion of the effect on disability than was accounted for by each parameter in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. If T2 lesions are considered to provide a measure of inflammatory disease burden, this result implies that in addition to those changes related directly to inflammatory disease, global changes in BV may capture other aspects of disease progression in MS, such as neurodegeneration.</p><p>These effects seen at the group level are in accordance with a more recent analysis at the patient level in FREEDOMS, which found the effects of fingolimod on BVL and relapses to be independent of its effect on disability. The analysis set out to examine whether the effect of fingolimod on disability progression was mediated by its effect on lesions, relapses, or BVL. The effect on T2 lesion count and on the number of relapses in year 1 of FREEDOMS accounted, respectively, for 46 and 60% of the overall effect on 6-month confirmed disability progression over 2&#x000a0;years, and the effect on reducing annual BVL accounted for 23% of the overall effect in reducing disability. In a multivariate analysis, relapses and BVL predicted disability progression independently, but T2 lesion count did not, and the effect of fingolimod on relapses and BVL in combination accounted for 73% of the effect on disability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that, in RMS cohorts, fingolimod may reduce BVL via a mechanism that is at least in part independent of any reduction directly attributable to its anti-inflammatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Relationships between individual outcomes and disability progression in the FREEDOMS trial.

</p><p>This hypothesis is supported by a post hoc analysis of the pooled FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II populations, in which the effects of fingolimod on BVL were examined with and without adjustment for relapses and active MRI lesions on study. At month 24 in the unadjusted analysis, there was an absolute difference in BVL of 0.51% favoring fingolimod over placebo, compared with an absolute difference of 0.27% in the analysis adjusted for relapses and lesion activity. The ratio of these effect sizes implies that about half of the reduction in BVL associated with fingolimod treatment occurs independently of its effect on inflammatory disease in MS. This analysis was complemented by an analysis which found that fingolimod reduced BVL relative to placebo by 48.2% (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004) at month 24 in the subgroup of patients in the pooled FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II population who had no Gd+ lesions at baseline and who had experienced neither relapses nor new lesion activity on study. A treatment effect on BVL in this group of patients implies that fingolimod is acting on pathologies affecting non-lesional tissues in the brain or possibly on lesional tissue that is clinically silent or radiologically inapparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Disease Activity and BVL</title><p>The correlation between BVL and disability progression, the association between treatment effects to reduce BVL and the slowing of disability progression, and the evidence that such treatment effects may influence both inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathologies in the brain in MS lend weight to the notion that measurement of BVL might become a useful part of routine patient follow-up. For example, it could provide neurologists with information about treatment response and subclinical disease progression between relapses, before worsening disability manifests clinically. The effect of including BVL in a combination assessment of disease activity has been investigated in a population of patients pooled from the two FREEDOMS trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A four-parameter measure of &#x02018;no evident disease activity&#x02019; (NEDA-4) assessed the presence of relapses, T2 lesion activity, 6-month confirmed disability progression, and annual BVL, and adopted a threshold rate of 0.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], below which annual BVL may be considered to be in the normal range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. At 2&#x000a0;years, 19.7% of patients receiving fingolimod attained NEDA-4 status, compared with 5.3% of patients on placebo (odds ratio 4.41; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Excluding assessment of BVL found that 31.0% of patients on fingolimod and 9.9% of patients on placebo (odds ratio 4.07; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) had no evidence of disease activity, so inclusion of BVL certainly appeared to improve the stringency of the combination measure. The ultimate aim of applying such a combination measure in clinical practice would be to establish that remission from disease progression is complete; such an aspiration for NEDA-4 will require validation in long-term studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>While likely to provide information about rates of disease progression, assessment of BVL relies on waiting for changes in BV (and therefore neurodegenerative damage) to manifest. An alternative, cross-sectional approach has been reported in which patients were categorized based on whether their actual NBV was lower than, similar to, or greater than a value estimated for them based on various demographic and disease characteristics. Regression analysis of patient data from the two FREEDOMS trials that accounted for age, disease duration, sex, disability status, and T2 lesion volume was used to generate a formula to estimate NBV on an individual basis. Patients categorized as having low NBV had the highest risk of 3-month confirmed disability progression over 2&#x000a0;years (hazard ratio 1.75, relative to the high NBV group; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Based on this example from the two FREEDOMS trial populations, the approach could be extended using data from a broad range of patients with MS to produce a generally applicable regression equation.

One example of such challenges is the possibility that physiological variables may confound analysis (e.g., level of hydration and inflammation-related volume changes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], and another is the variation between different centers in the methods used for advanced quantitative imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Challenges to the adoption of BV assessment in routine clinical practice</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Category</th><th align="left">Topic</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Physiological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]</td><td align="left">Age<break/>Body mass index<break/>Diurnal variation<break/>Genotype (ApoE expression)<break/>Hydration state<break/>Menstrual cycle</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Disease-related factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]</td><td align="left">Fluid-level changes attributable to inflammation (edema)<break/>Fluid-level changes attributable to resolution of inflammation (treatment-related pseudoatrophy)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Habits and comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]</td><td align="left">Alcohol consumption<break/>Cardiovascular hypertension<break/>Diabetes mellitus<break/>Obesity<break/>Smoking</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MRI-related factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]</td><td align="left">Changes in acquisition protocols<break/>Changes in scanner type and scanner upgrades<break/>Factors influencing scan quality (head motion, distortions, inhomogeneity artifacts)<break/>Measurement error<break/>Non-standardized quantification methods<break/>Patient repositioning in the scanner</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Logistical factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]</td><td align="left">Reimbursement<break/>Complexity of use (e.g. PACS integration)<break/>Lack of normative data<break/>Methods dependent on real-time data<break/>Poor integration of some image formats</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Issues with Algorithms Used for Estimating BV and BVL</title><p>Cross-sectional algorithms such as SIENAX, NeuroQuant<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and MSmetrix&#x02122; are used to estimate BV in patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. SIENAX is an automated method used by several expert reading centers that measures BV from a single MRI scan normalized to a standard skull [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. NeuroQuant is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved software that automatically segments and measures volumes of brain structures using MRI images obtained in routine clinical practice or in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Finally, MSmetrix is also an FDA-approved automated technique that measures global and local brain atrophy, as well as lesion load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Despite automation, none of these techniques provides accurate assessments every time they are used, and each presents different challenges when correcting measurement errors. A recent comparative analysis of SIENAX with NeuroQuant and MSMetrix in patients with RMS (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;61) or clinically isolated syndrome (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) found that both NeuroQuant and MSMetrix quantified whole BV with an accuracy comparable with that yielded with SIENAX, suggesting that either algorithm could be used for fully automated routine cross-sectional BV estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p>The SIENA algorithm was designed specifically for longitudinal analyses and has an error rate of 0.15% when determining longitudinal changes in BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition to changes in BV, MSmetrix can also measure longitudinal changes in white matter and lesion volume, which is useful for monitoring disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Regional longitudinal assessment of changes in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid volumes can be made using NeuroSTREAM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Neurological Software Tool for REliable Atrophy Measurement), a tool under development that compares individual patient data with a normative database adjusted for age, sex, disease duration, disability level, and MS disease course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p>Other recommendations that begin to address the challenges of conducting longitudinal MRI measurements of BV include (i) acquisition of images using isotropic three-dimensional pulse sequences with multiple image contrasts, to allow for more comprehensive analyses of lesion load and atrophy across time points; (ii) use of robust automated methods that have demonstrated precise BV assessment in scan&#x02013;rescan data; and (iii) creation of a standardized dataset of benchmark results, to facilitate the development, calibration and objective evaluation of the image analysis methods that are used in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Biological Factors that can Confound BV and BVL Measurement</title><p>As mentioned earlier, it is known that hydration levels and inflammation-related volume changes can affect BV, but atrophy rates can also be affected by various other factors. For example, significantly higher atrophy rates have been associated with older age; higher glycated hemoglobin A levels, body mass index, and alcohol intake; severe white matter hyperintensity; and being a carrier of the <italic>APOE epsilon4</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. They can also be confounded by factors such as treatment-induced pseudoatrophy, smoking status, and hydration level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Treatment-induced pseudoatrophy merits particular attention. Anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat MS have often been associated with a paradoxical acceleration of BVL following therapy initiation; this is termed pseudoatrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. It may be attributable to resolution of inflammatory edema, or to other mechanisms that cause changes in the water content of tissues, but to allow for this potentially confounding effect, some studies have excluded the first 6&#x000a0;months of BV measurement from analyses of BVL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Finally, a recent analysis of over 3000 serial scans from 755 patients with MS established that diurnal variations in BV occur, with BV generally being greater in the morning than at other times of day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>BVL as a Biomarker for Regulatory Approval of MS Therapies</title><p>In RMS, relapses, disability worsening, and MRI lesion activity are the measures generally used to determine the therapeutic efficacy of an MS drug in pivotal interventional trials. However, these measures can overlook clinically silent neurodegenerative disease progression. In contrast, BVL measurement captures global changes in the brain, so potentially provides a more sensitive assessment of disease progression than these other measures. There are several aspects to consider before adopting BVL as a biomarker for regulatory approval of MS therapies. Some of these aspects present obstacles but others have been addressed successfully.</p><p>In terms of obstacles, there is currently little precedent for the use of BVL as a primary study endpoint in RMS. It was the primary endpoint in a phase II placebo-controlled trial of riluzole and IFN&#x003b2;-1a IM in early MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], but to date, BVL has not been the primary endpoint in a phase III interventional trial. Also, as discussed earlier, there is a lack of methodological standardization both for BVL measurement and for data processing that allows for confounding factors. One further obstacle to overcome is clinical adoption. If BVL was the primary measure of therapeutic efficacy for MS therapies, more widespread measurement of volumetric MRI within routine clinical follow-up would be needed.</p><p>What is encouraging is that the clinical relevance and the clinical definition of BVL as a biomarker in MS have been investigated and established. The correlation between BVL and disability in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and the association between treatment effects on BVL and on disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], have been demonstrated in post hoc analyses of several large study populations. Furthermore, in terms of a clinical definition, analyses at the patient level have defined a threshold rate of BVL that distinguishes normal from pathological BVL with good specificity and sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is comprehensive evidence from several large phase III studies that fingolimod significantly reduces the extent and rate of BVL in patients with RMS. In these studies, fingolimod reduced annual BVL by approximately one-third relative to that observed in patients receiving placebo or IFN&#x003b2;-1a IM, and this reduced rate was sustained in individuals treated continuously with fingolimod in the study extensions. Subgroup analyses have shown that the ability of fingolimod to reduce BVL is independent of treatment history, baseline disability level, and inflammatory lesion activity both at baseline and on study. Data from post hoc analyses of fingolimod phase III studies have identified a number of predictors of baseline NBV and of changes in BV during treatment, including age, disability level, disease burden, and inflammatory lesion activity; baseline T2 lesion and Gd+ lesion burdens at baseline were particularly strong predictors of BVL in the subsequent 2&#x000a0;years. Understanding changes in BV that occur during the disease course and in response to existing disease-modifying therapies may help to provide neurologists with new insights into their patients&#x02019; prognoses, and to guide them when reviewing treatment. Several obstacles to routine MRI monitoring of BV could be overcome in the near future, but its increased adoption in the wider neurological community is almost certainly reliant on raising awareness of the potential benefits afforded to patients by routine BV assessment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Jeremy Bright of Oxford PharmaGenesis, Oxford, UK, for providing medical writing support (including preparing a manuscript outline based on teleconferences and correspondence with the authors, collating the authors&#x02019; comments during manuscript development, and providing assistance with data checking, figure production, and submission).</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p>Editorial and medical writing support for the development of this manuscript was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.
