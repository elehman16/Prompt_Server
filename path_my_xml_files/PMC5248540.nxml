In line with this result, PG values at 1&#x02009;h after the meal were also statistically significantly lower with faster aspart than with IAsp.</p><p>In addition, the CGM data collected throughout the study indicated that there were improvements in PPG control after all meals. The greatest difference between faster aspart and IAsp in controlling IG over 2 weeks of treatment was observed after breakfast, where the IG increment over 1&#x02009;h was 1.12 versus 2.04&#x02009;mmol/L (20.19&#x02009;mg/dL vs. 36.69&#x02009;mg/dL); there were no statistically significant differences after lunch or dinner. This observation is likely due, in part, to altered meal patterns and the tendency for subjects to consume snacks later in the day. Clinical experience shows that good PPG control after breakfast helps to set the stage for maintaining adequate glucose control over the rest of the day.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The improvement in PPG control was achieved with less time spent with IG in the lower range (&#x02264;3.9&#x02009;mmol/L [70&#x02009;mg/dL]) during the day with faster aspart versus IAsp (with a difference of 25&#x02009;min per day between treatments), which may help to improve control of postprandial hypoglycemia in a real-life setting.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>After 1 week, the SMPG profiles were similar for faster aspart and IAsp. Conversely, the SMPG profiles after 2 weeks were higher for faster aspart compared with IAsp. It should be noted, however, the mean IG results demonstrated no statistical significance in the difference between the two treatments, and this might more accurately reflect actual glycemic control than the limited observations achieved with the two 7-7-9-point SMPG profiles performed during the trial.</p><p>The benefits of a faster onset of glucose-lowering action with faster aspart in CSII may be even greater if combined with CGM systems in both basal&#x02013;bolus and hybrid or fully closed-loop settings. Although currently available closed-loop systems are capable of responding safely to the different bolus-dosing scenarios that may occur in a patient's daily life, a 2014 study of 53 subjects with type 1 diabetes receiving RAIAs through CSII demonstrated that PPG control was compromised, with prolonged time periods spent with PPG levels &#x02265;10.0&#x02009;mmol/L (180&#x02009;mg/dL).<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>In the current study, faster aspart was well tolerated with a similar safety profile to IAsp and no new safety or tolerability issues were identified. The most common TEAEs reported in the trial were in order of frequency: hyperglycemia, headache, nasopharyngitis, and oropharyngeal pain. Due to the very frequent glucose monitoring and recording over the course of the study, an expectedly high frequency of hyper- and hypoglycemic events was observed with both faster aspart and IAsp.</p><p>The strengths of the present study include its double-blinded design with a complete crossover, which enabled subjects to serve as their own controls, and that inclusion criteria required all subjects to use only a MiniMed Paradigm pump (which was widely used at the time of trial initiation). Furthermore, subjects had used one of the pumps selected for this investigation in the previous 6 months and were able to continue using their own pump during the study, thus removing the confounding factor of otherwise having to learn how to use a new device. A limitation of the study was its short duration and the standardized setting of the meal test. However, improvements in PPG with faster aspart versus IAsp were evident in the CGM recordings during daily meals, in which the carbohydrate and protein content of the meals was more representative of everyday practice.</p><p>The findings of this study in terms of greater early glucose-lowering effect are in line with those recently reported by Heise et al.,<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> where faster aspart and IAsp were compared in a CSII setting. While compared with s.c. administration<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> the differences in glucose-lowering effect between faster aspart and IAsp in a CSII setting appear to be more pronounced,<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> the results of the ongoing Phase 3b efficacy and safety pump trial with faster aspart will be important in terms of confirming the clinical utility of faster aspart over the longer term in a CSII setting.</p><p>In summary, faster aspart was well tolerated and associated with improvements in PPG compared with IAsp when in a CSII application. These findings could translate into clinical benefits in both CSII and future hybrid or fully closed-loop systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Data.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1092" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s027" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the people who participated in this study, to Henrik Jarlov, MD, from Novo Nordisk A/S for his review and input to the article, and to Katharine A.
