However, stress ulcer prophylaxis may increase the risk of serious adverse events and, additionally, the quantity and quality of evidence supporting the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis is low. The aim of the SUP-ICU trial is to assess the benefits and harms of stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor in adult patients in the ICU. We hypothesise that stress ulcer prophylaxis reduces the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding, but increases rates of nosocomial infections and myocardial ischaemia.

The primary outcome measure is 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection or myocardial ischaemia, days alive without life support in the 90-day period, serious adverse reactions, 1-year mortality, and health economic analyses.</p><p>The sample size will enable us to detect a 20&#x000a0;% relative risk difference (5&#x000a0;% absolute risk difference) in 90-day mortality assuming a 25&#x000a0;% event rate with a risk of type I error of 5&#x000a0;% and power of 90&#x000a0;%.

Endoscopic studies have shown that gastric erosions are present in up to 90&#x000a0;% of patients by the third day in the intensive care unit (ICU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These lesions are, in the vast majority of patients, superficial and asymptomatic, but some can progress and result in overt and clinically important GI bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Clinically important GI bleeding in the ICU is a serious condition, with an estimated one- to four-fold increased risk of death and excess length of ICU stay of 4&#x02013;8 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been suggested that prophylaxis with acid suppressants reduces the risk of GI bleeding and hence the risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this context, stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) was introduced and is recommended in international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and regarded as standard of care in the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, clinical research has not been able to confirm that SUP improves outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis comprising 20 randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and/or histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) versus placebo or no prophylaxis did not find any differences in patient important outcome measures between the SUP and the placebo/no prophylaxis groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, concern has been expressed about potentially increased risks of side effects in patients receiving prophylactic treatment with acid suppressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The higher gastric pH in these patients may compromise host immunity and increase the risk of pneumonia and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, no meta-analyses of randomised trials have shown a significantly increased risk of nosocomial pneumonia when using SUP compared to placebo/no prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, no trials have assessed the incidence of CDI in an ICU setting, but a recently published large cohort study found a 2&#x02013;4 fold increased risk of CDI in adult mechanically ventilated patients receiving PPIs compared to H2RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Studies conducted outside the ICU have demonstrated similar findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Also, an association between the use of PPIs and an increased risk of cardiovascular events has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, the balance between benefits and harms of SUP is unclear in critically ill patients in the ICU. The aim of the SUP-ICU trial is to assess the benefits versus harms of PPI (pantoprazole) in acutely ill adults in the ICU. We hypothesise that a PPI reduces the rates of GI bleeding, but increases the rates of nosocomial infections and myocardial ischaemia. The effect on overall mortality is, therefore, unpredictable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The SUP-ICU trial is an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, international, multicentre, randomised, blinded, parallel-group trial of SUP with a PPI versus placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Approvals</title><p>The trial is approved by the Danish Health and Medicine Agency (2015030166), the Committees on Health Research Ethics in the Capital Region of Denmark (H-15003141) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (RH-2015-3203695) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02467621">NCT02467621</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>European ICUs admitting adult patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Population</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All adult (18&#x000a0;years or older) patients who are acutely admitted to the ICU with one or more risk factors for GI bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Shock (continuous infusion with vasopressors or inotropes, systolic blood pressure below 90&#x000a0;mmHg, mean arterial blood pressure below 70&#x000a0;mmHg or plasma lactate level 4&#x000a0;mmol/l or above)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Acute or chronic intermittent or continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Invasive mechanical ventilation which is expected to last more than 24&#x000a0;hours</p></list-item><list-item><p>Coagulopathy (platelets below 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/l, or international normalised ratio (INR) above 1.5, or prothrombin time (PT) above 20&#x000a0;s) documented within the last 24&#x000a0;hours</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ongoing treatment with anticoagulant drugs (prophylactic doses excluded)</p></list-item><list-item><p>History of coagulopathy (platelets below 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/l or INR above 1.5 or PT above 20&#x000a0;s within the 6&#x000a0;months prior to hospital admission)</p></list-item><list-item><p>History of chronic liver disease (portal hypertension, cirrhosis proven by biopsy, computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound or history of variceal bleeding or hepatic encephalopathy)</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Contraindications to PPIs (including intolerance of PPIs and treatment with atazanavir (anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medication))</p></list-item><list-item><p>Current daily treatment with a PPI and/or a H2RA</p></list-item><list-item><p>GI bleeding of any origin during current hospital admission</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosed with peptic ulcer during current hospital admission</p></list-item><list-item><p>Organ transplant during current hospital admission</p></list-item><list-item><p>Withdrawal from active therapy or brain death</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fertile woman with positive test for urinary or plasma human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consent according to national regulations not obtainable</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial medication</title><p>Enrolled patients will be randomised to receive either pantoprazole 40&#x000a0;mg (pantoprazole, Actavis, Gentofte, Denmark) or placebo, given once daily intravenously, from randomisation until ICU discharge or death for a maximum of 90&#x000a0;days.

The majority of patients will be temporarily incompetent because of severe illness or as a consequence of the treatment, including sedation. We cannot perform the trial in competent patients because less sick (and thus competent) patients do not suffer from stress ulcers. Patients requiring acute treatment in the ICU, e.g. mechanical ventilation, are in an acute life-threatening condition and it would expose the patient to great risk not to initiate the necessary treatment in order to obtain informed consent. To conduct clinical trials with the goal of improving the outcome for ICU patients at risk of stress-related GI bleeding, it is necessary to randomise and enrol patients before obtaining their informed consent.

Based on this research conducted 15&#x02013;20 years ago, and because of potentially increased mortality and morbidity in patients with clinically important bleeding, SUP is recommended as a standard of care in critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Around 75&#x000a0;% of critically ill patients in the ICU receive an acid suppressant during their ICU stay and PPIs are the most frequently used agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the quantity and quality of evidence supporting a reduction in clinically important GI bleeding and mortality with these agents is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Importantly, it has been suggested that PPIs may increase the risk of pneumonia, CDI, and acute myocardial ischaemia, and SUP may, in the worst case scenarios, increase mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Taken together, SUP with a PPI is standard of care in ICUs worldwide but has never been tested in large high-quality clinically placebo-controlled trials. As a consequence, PPIs have been used as SUP for several years without convincing evidence of improved outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Population</title><p>The population in this trial constitutes adult patients acutely admitted to the ICU with one or more risk factors for GI bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Intervention</title><p>In recent years a PPI has been considered the drug of choice in the management of most acid-related GI disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The superior efficacy of PPIs over H2RAs has been demonstrated in various GI disorders, including peptic ulcer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and randomised trials and meta-analyses have assessed PPIs compared to H2RAs as SUP in the ICU. A recently published meta-analysis by Alhazzani et al. (14 trials, 1720 patients) compared a PPI and a H2RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and found that a PPI was more efficient in reducing clinical important and overt GI bleeding, but no differences were shown regarding mortality, length of stay or incidence of pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>In most countries PPIs are more frequently used as SUP than H2RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since PPIs are considered equally effective, and pantoprazole is the most frequently used PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we chose this as the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Comparator</title><p>As described in the previous section, it has been suggested that a PPI is superior to a H2RA in the prevention of clinically important and overt GI bleeding. However, before comparing different SUP agents we need firm evidence of SUP being superior to placebo. This information is currently not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Outcome</title><p>Assessing mortality as the primary outcome has a number of advantages. First, mortality has not been the primary outcome of previous trials and we are sceptical that previous trials have collected high-quality data on mortality other than short-term mortality (ICU/hospital) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Second, nearly all previous trials assessing PPIs or H2RAs as SUP have high risks of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We know that trials with high risks of bias tend to overestimate benefit and underestimate harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Accordingly, previous trial results might be biased and even though they seem to find a neutral effect on mortality this may be a biased estimate actually concealing excess mortality in the SUP group. Third, meta-analysis of previous trials did not reach a realistic information size so even neutral mortality estimates may be misleading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Fourth, as a consequence of the 6S trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], where we found that bleeding was associated with death and that death was partly mediated by bleeding (and renal insufficiency), it appears less likely that there should be a clinically significant reduction in GI bleeding (if PPIs do prevent GI bleeding) without any effect on mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Consequently, assessing mortality as the primary outcome measure gives the opportunity to weigh up potential benefits and harms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Sample size</title><p>It is difficult to produce reliable sample size estimations according to anticipated effects on GI bleeding because we have no reliable control group data due to the widespread use of PPIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As a consequence, it has been necessary to calculate sample size estimations given that something may change if we stop/avoid using PPIs until GI bleeding actually happens (see <xref rid="Sec71" ref-type="sec">Appendix 3</xref>). The chosen intervention effect of 20&#x000a0;% RRR or RRI of the primary outcome may seem high, but in a population with septic shock or in, e.g. patients after cardiac arrest, a 20&#x000a0;% hazard ratio reduction corresponds to 1&#x000a0;month of extra median survival in patients with a median survival time of approximately 5&#x000a0;months. Furthermore, 3350 patients included in a low-risk-of-bias trial would make a huge contribution to existing evidence, more than doubling the number of randomised patients and providing trial results with low risk of bias on mortality and SAEs. Additionally, trial sequential analysis (TSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] of existing trials (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) has shown that 34&#x000a0;% (1584 patients) of the required information size to detect or reject a 20&#x000a0;% RRR has been accrued; corresponding to a required information size of 4575 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (see <xref rid="Sec77" ref-type="sec">Appendix 5</xref>). Consequently, there is an information gap of around 3000 patients assuming a 20&#x000a0;% RRR in mortality. With the inclusion of an additional 3350 patients it is expected that the pooled effect will cross the boundary for benefit/harm or the boundary for futility.</p><p>However, no single trial, whether large or well-conducted, gives the final answer and the SUP-ICU trial will not be an exception. Thus, existing meta-analyses of SUP should be updated with the SUP-IUC trial results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Strengths</title><p>The SUP-ICU trial is a large multicentre clinical trial designed to provide high-quality data with low risk of bias. The trial is monitored according to GCP standards, and before data analyses a statistical analysis plan will be available. Furthermore, the strengths include concealed group assignment, blinding of the patient, the clinical staff caring for the patient, the investigators, the outcome assessors, the data manager, and the trial statistician. The trial design is pragmatic with routine practice maintained except from prescription of SUP; with resulting high generalisability.</p><p>Prior to designing the trial we have thoroughly described the available evidence in systematic reviews and a meta-analysis with TSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Determining the incidence of GI bleeding in critically ill patients in the ICU is complicated by varying definitions of the outcome, difficulties in measuring the outcome, and differences in case mix. To make sure the available data on GI bleeding and risk factors were valid and up-to-date we conducted a large international observational study assessing the incidence of GI bleeding, risk factors for GI bleeding, and the use of SUP in more than 1000 adult critically ill patients in the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Limitations</title><p>As already described in previous sections the sample size estimation is based on estimates, as we do not have valid data describing mortality among patients with risk factors for GI bleeding not treated with a PPI due to the widespread use of acid suppressants. The power for even major effects on each of the possible side effects (pneumonia, CDI and acute myocardial ischaemia) may be reduced, but it will still make a large contribution to our knowledge on these outcomes that may seriously question, overthrow or confirm what we know so far. Furthermore, assessing the potential side effects as a composite outcome measure will increase the power. Additionally, there is a risk of excluding high-risk patients as patients already receiving daily treatment with a PPI or a H2RA cannot be enrolled in the trial due to the risk of discontinuing a therapy for another indication, e.g. history of peptic ulcer. The definition of overt GI bleeding includes haematochezia which might occur from a lower GI bleeding source not affected by PPI, e.g. colonic bleeding. Finally, we do not assess the use of a H2RA or other SUP agents and will not be able to draw conclusions about these drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Perspective</title><p>The SUP-ICU trial will provide important high-quality data and the results will inform clinicians, guideline committee members and policy-makers on the use of SUP in ICU patients. Together with existing data the trial will establish a more solid evidence base for the use of a prophylactic PPI in critically ill patients in the ICU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting.

If a patient experiences a SAR the patient will be withdrawn from the trial intervention but data collection and follow-up will be continued (see section 4.3.2).</p><p>SARs will be defined as follows:</p><p>Anaphylactic reactions defined as urticaria and at least one of the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Worsened circulation (more than 20&#x000a0;% decrease in blood pressure or more than 20&#x000a0;% increase in vasopressor dose)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased airway resistance (more than 20&#x000a0;% increase in the peak pressure on the ventilation)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clinical stridor or bronchospasm</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subsequent treatment with bronchodilators</p></list-item></list></p><p>Agranulocytosis is defined as any new, acute and severe drop in granulocytes to below 0.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/l requiring active monitoring or treatment.</p><p>Pancytopenia is defined as any new, severe drop in red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets requiring active monitoring or treatment.</p><p>Acute hepatic failure is defined as severe and progressing hepatic failure as judged by the treating physician or the investigator.</p><p>Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are defined as severe dermatological reactions with a skin biopsy confirming the diagnosis.</p><p>Interstitial nephritis is defined as a nephritis affecting the interstitium of the kidneys surrounding the tubules with a kidney biopsy confirming the diagnosis.</p><p>Angioedema (Quincke&#x02019;s oedema) is defined as a vascular reaction involving the deep dermis, subcutaneous or submucosal tissues, resulting in a characteristic localised oedema.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec54"><title>Appendix 2. Charter for the independent Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC) of the SUP-ICU trial</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02467621">NCT02467621</ext-link>.</p><p>Research ethical committee number: H-15003141.</p><sec id="Sec55"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DMSC will constitute its own plan of monitoring and meetings. However, this charter will define the minimum of obligations and primary responsibilities of the DMSC as perceived by the Steering Committee (SC), its relationship with other trial components, its membership, and the purpose and timing of its meetings. The charter will also outline the procedures for ensuring confidentiality and proper communication, the statistical monitoring guidelines to be implemented by the DMSC, and an outline of the content of the open and closed reports which will be provided to the DMSC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec56"><title>Primary responsibilities of the DMSC</title><p>The DMSC will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial patients, assessing the safety and efficacy of the interventions during the trial, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the clinical trial. The DMSC will provide recommendations about stopping or continuing the trial to the SC of the SUP-ICU trial. To contribute to enhancing the integrity of the trial, the DMSC may also formulate recommendations relating to the selection/recruitment/retention of patients, their management, improving adherence to protocol-specified regimens and retention of patients, and the procedures for data management and quality control.</p><p>The DMSC will be advisory to the SC. The SC will be responsible for promptly reviewing the DMSC recommendations, to decide whether to continue or terminate the trial, and to determine whether amendments to the protocol or changes in trial conduct are required.</p><p>The DMSC is planned by protocol to meet physically in order to evaluate the planned interim analyses of the SUP-ICU trial. The interim analyses will be performed by an independent statistician selected by the members of the DMSC (to be announced). The DMSC may additionally meet whenever they decide or contact each other by telephone or e-mail in order to discuss the safety of trial participants. The sponsor has the responsibility to report the overall number of serious adverse reactions (SARs) yearly to the DMSC. The DMSC can, at any time during the trial, request the distribution of events, including outcome measures and SARs according to intervention groups. Further, the DMSC can request unblinding of the interventions if suggested by the data; see section on &#x02018;Closed sessions&#x02019;. The recommendations of the DMSC regarding stopping, continuing or changing the design of the trial should be communicated without delay to the SC of the SUP-ICU trial. As soon as possible, and no longer than 48&#x000a0;hours later, the SC has the responsibility to inform all investigators of the trial, and all the sites including patients in the trial, about the recommendation of the DMSC and the SC decision hereof.</p></sec><sec id="Sec57"><title>Members of the DMSC</title><p>The DMSC is an independent multidisciplinary group consisting of clinicians and a biostatistician that, collectively, has experience in the management of ICU patients and in the conduct, monitoring and analysis of randomised clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec58"><title>DMSC members</title><p>Anders &#x000c5;neman, MD PhD.</p><p>Tim Walsh, professor, MD, PhD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec59"><title>DMSC biostatistician</title><p>Aksel Karl Georg Jensen, Section of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec60"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>DMSC members will fill in and sign a declaration of conflicts of interests. DMSC membership has been restricted to individuals free of conflicts of interest. The source of these conflicts may be financial, scientific, or regulatory in nature. Thus, neither trial investigators nor individuals employed by the sponsor, nor individuals who might have regulatory responsibilities for the trial products, are members of the DMSC. The DMSC members do not own stock in the companies having products being evaluated by the SUP-ICU trial.</p><p>The DMSC members will disclose to fellow members any consulting agreements or financial interests they have with the sponsor of the trial, with the Contract Research Organisation (CRO) for the trial (if any), or with other sponsors having products that are being evaluated or having products that are competitive with those being evaluated in the trial.</p><p>The DMSC will be responsible for deciding whether these consulting agreements or financial interests materially impact their objectivity.</p><p>The DMSC members will be responsible for advising fellow members of any changes in these consulting agreements and financial interests that occur during the course of the trial. Any DMSC members who develop significant conflicts of interest during the course of the trial should resign from the DMSC.</p><p>DMSC membership is to be for the duration of the clinical trial. If any members leave the DMSC during the course of the trial, the SC will appoint their replacement(s).</p></sec><sec id="Sec61"><title>Formal interim analysis meetings</title><p>Two formal interim analysis meetings will be held to review data relating to treatment efficacy, patient safety, and quality of trial conduct. The three members of the DMSC will meet when 90-day follow-up data of 1650 (approximately 50&#x000a0;% of sample size estimation) and 2500 (approximately 75&#x000a0;% of sample size estimation) patients have been obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec62"><title>Proper communication</title><p>To enhance the integrity and credibility of the trial, procedures will be implemented to ensure the DMSC has sole access to evolving information from the clinical trial regarding comparative results of efficacy and safety data, aggregated by treatment group. An exception will be made to permit access to an independent statistician who will be responsible for serving as a liaison between the database and the DMSC. At the same time, procedures will be implemented to ensure that proper communication is achieved between the DMSC and the trial investigators. To provide a forum for exchange of information among various parties who share responsibility for the successful conduct of the trial, a format for open sessions and closed sessions will be implemented. The intent of this format is to enable the DMSC to preserve confidentiality of the comparative efficacy results while at the same time providing opportunities for interaction between the DMSC and others who have valuable insights into trial-related issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec63"><title>Closed sessions</title><p>Sessions involving only DMSC members who generate the closed reports (called closed sessions) will be held to allow discussion of confidential data from the clinical trial, including information about the relative efficacy and safety of interventions. In order to ensure that the DMSC will be fully informed in its primary mission of safeguarding the interest of participating patients, the DMSC will be blinded in its assessment of safety and efficacy data. However, the DMSC can request unblinding from the SC.</p><p>Closed reports will include analysis of the primary outcome measure. In addition, analyses of the secondary outcome measures and SARs will also be reported. These closed reports will be prepared by an independent biostatistician being a member of the DMSC, with assistance from the trial data manager, in a manner that allows them to remain blinded. The closed reports should provide information that is accurate, with follow-up on mortality that is complete to within 2&#x000a0;months of the date of the DMSC meeting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec64"><title>Open reports</title><p>For each DMSC meeting, open reports will be made available to all who attend the DMSC meeting. The reports will include data on recruitment and baseline characteristics, pooled data on eligibility violations, completeness of follow-up, and compliance. The independent statistician, being a member of the DMSC, will prepare these open reports in cooperation with the trial data manager.</p><p>The reports should be provided to DMSC members approximately 3&#x000a0;days prior to the date of the meeting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec65"><title>Minutes of the DMSC meetings</title><p>The DMSC will prepare minutes of their meetings. The closed minutes will describe the proceedings from all sessions of the DMSC meeting, including the listing of recommendations by the committee. Because it is possible that these minutes may contain unblinded information, it is important that they are not made available to anyone outside the DMSC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec66"><title>Recommendations to the Steering Committee</title><p>After the interim analysis meetings, the DMSC will make a recommendation to the SC to continue, hold or terminate the trial.</p><p>Interim analyses will be conducted after patient number 1650 and patient number 2500 have been followed-up for 90&#x000a0;days.</p><p>The DMSC will recommend pausing or stopping the trial if group difference in the primary outcome measure, SARs or SUSARs are found at the interim analyses with statistical significance levels adjusted according to the LanDeMets group sequential monitoring boundaries based on the O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. If an analysis of the interim data from 1650/2500 patients fulfils the LanDeMets stopping criterion the inclusion of further patients will be paused and an analysis including patients randomised during the analysis period will be performed. If this second analysis also fulfils the LanDeMets stopping criterion according to the group sequential monitoring boundaries the DMSC will recommend stopping the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, the DMSC can recommend pausing or stopping the trial if continued conduct of the trial clearly compromises patient safety. However, stopping for futility to show an intervention effect of 15&#x000a0;% RRR will not be an option as intervention effects less than 15&#x000a0;% RRR of all-cause mortality may also be clinically relevant.</p><p>This recommendation will be based primarily on safety and efficacy considerations and will be guided by statistical monitoring guidelines defined in this charter and the trial protocol.</p><p>The SC is jointly responsible with the DMSC for safeguarding the interests of participating patients and for the conduct of the trial. Recommendations to amend the protocol or conduct of the trial made by the DMSC will be considered and accepted or rejected by the SC. The SC will be responsible for deciding whether to continue, hold or stop the trial based on the DMSC&#x02019;s recommendations.</p><p>The DMSC will be notified of all changes to the trial protocol or conduct. The DMSC concurrence will be sought on all substantive recommendations or changes to the protocol or trial conduct prior to their implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec67"><title>Statistical monitoring guidelines</title><p>The outcome parameters are defined in the statistical analyses plan in the protocol.
