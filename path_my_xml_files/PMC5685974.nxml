Anterolateral incision is an alternative approach which preserves the infrapatellar branches of the saphenous nerve and avoids numbness. Studies have compared both incisions, but in different patients. However, different patients may assess the same sensory deficit dissimilarly, because of individual variations in anatomy and healing responses. We compared the two incisions in the same patient at the same time, using an anterolateral incision on one knee and a midline incision on the other knee in simultaneous bilateral TKA. Other surgical steps including medial arthrotomy were idential. We also correlated subjective and objective findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par2">Twenty patients were prospectively randomized. Sensory loss and skin healing were assessed at 6, 12 and 52&#x000a0;weeks. Subjective preference for the knee with less numbness was charted on Wald&#x02019;s Sequential Probability Ratio Test. Sensation scores for touch, vibration, static and moving two-point discrimination were measured. Scar healing was evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Functional scores were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A statistically significant difference favoring knees with anterolateral incision was observed in patient preference at all assessment points and this correlated with sensation scores. A statistically significant difference was observed in POSAS score favoring knees with anterolateral incision at 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks which became statistically insignificant at 1&#x000a0;year.

Lateral flap numbness is a known side-effect resulting from surgical trauma to the infrapatellar branches of the saphenous nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Reports in the literature show a varying incidence (55&#x02013;100%) of postoperative lateral flap numbness at 6&#x000a0;weeks to 8&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This numbness may become permanent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], leading to dissatisfaction with surgical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Muller proposed using an anterolateral incision instead, which spared the infrapatellar division of the saphenous nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Laffosse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], in a prospective randomized study reported significantly less area of numbness with anterolateral incision compared to midline incision, when compared in different patients.</p><p id="Par7">Anatomically, an anterolateral incision preserves the blood supply to flaps on either side unlike a midline incision where the blood supply to the lateral flap is compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">To date, studies in the literature have compared anterolateral versus midline incision on different patients. The anatomy of nerves and blood vessels in individual patients varies, as does the healing of surgical wounds and nerve recovery. Furthermore, the same sensory deficit in different patients may be assessed differently because of individual subjective differences. Comparing the two incisions in the same patient in staged bilateral TKA could again involve variable responses due to the time interval between comparisons. To negate these variable factors, we undertook to compare anterolateral versus midline incision in the same patient undergoing bilateral TKA simultaneously, where medial arthrotomy and all surgical steps remained identical.</p><p id="Par9">Our aims were to (1) identify subjective patient preference with regard to the knee with less postoperative flap numbness, (2) record sensations in the flaps around each incision and see whether they correlate with patient preference, (3) compare wound healing, (4) note scar hyperesthesia, and (5) compare postoperative functional recovery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par10">This was a prospective randomized study. All osteoarthritis patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKA by a single surgeon (RNM) between November 2010 and March 2012 at (Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre &#x00026; Breach Candy Hospital and Research Centre) were given the option of participating. Preoperative assessment was performed after hospital admission. Preoperatively, all sensations were tested and checked to be equal on right and left knees and also equal in the medial and lateral quadrants on either side of the midline over each knee. Patients were excluded if they had (1) a diagnosis other than osteoarthritis, (2) prior trauma or surgery on the knee, (3) peripheral or central neurologic impairment, and (4) peripheral vascular disease. Institutional Review Board clearance from both institutions was given and the study is registered with the Indian Council of Medical Research (registration number 2010/091/001206). Of 30 patients screened, 20 consented as per Council guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. All consenting patients received the allocated treatment and no patient was lost to follow-up. All patients were female and had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. The mean age of the patients was 63.3&#x000a0;years (range 52&#x02013;77&#x000a0;years). All patients had bilateral varus deformity. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.5 (range 19.7&#x02013;40.5). All patients were operated under combined spinal&#x02212;epidural anesthesia. All patients underwent surgery with a midline incision on one side and an anterolateral incision on the other side. The side receiving anterolateral or midline incision was randomized by a junior resident picking a sealed envelope.</p><p id="Par11">The midline incision was started 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;cm proximal to the superior border of the patella and extended over the patella in the midline towards the medial aspect of the tibial tuberosity. The anterolateral incision described by Bauer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and also used by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], began in the midline, 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;cm proximal to the superior border of the patella, extended anterolaterally, 1&#x000a0;cm lateral to the patella, and then distally, ending just lateral to the tibial tuberosity. The starting point and level at which each incision ended remained the same. The deep fascia was incised in line with both skin incisions. Subfascial dissection was performed to expose for medial arthrotomy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Except for skin incision, all surgical steps remained identical including medial arthrotomy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Computer navigation (Kolibri navigation system; Brainlab, Munich, Germany) was used, with array pins placed within the incision for both femur and tibia. It was used to make and verify tibial and femoral cuts and also for balancing. Once alignment was assessed and necessary balancing with trial implants was in place, the navigation arrays were removed. This was followed by preparation for cementing and implantation of final components. All knees were implanted with the same P.F.C.<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Sigma<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Knee System (DePuy, Warsaw, IN, USA) with resurfacing of the patella. All implants were cemented. Closure was carried out in four layers with Vicryl<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> no. 1 for deeper layers, Monocryl<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 3-0 for subcutaneous closure, and staples for skin closure. Epidural anesthesia was continued for postoperative pain relief for a period of 36&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h. No local injections or blocks were given for pain relief. Postoperative pain control (using diclofenac, paracetamol, morphine) and rehabilitation protocol remained the same for all patients.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Photograph of a left knee showing <bold>a</bold> anterolateral skin incision, <bold>b</bold> medial arthrotomy and the raised medial flap, and <bold>c</bold> postoperative radiograph of the same patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10195_2017_444_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The three scores in the three lateral quadrants were then added. In this manner, sensations of touch, pain and vibration were each scored between minimum 0 and maximum 6.</p><p id="Par20">For static and moving two-point discrimination, the sensations were measured in millimetres. Each lateral quadrant was compared against its medial counterpart. A score of 0 was given if the lateral quadrant value was equal to its corresponding medial quadrant, a score of 1 was given if the lateral quadrant value was more than medial but less than twice its recorded value, and a score of 2 was given if the lateral quadrant value was more than twice the medial quadrant recorded value. In this manner, both static and moving two-point discrimination were each scored between minimum 0 and maximum 6.</p><p id="Par21">The total sensation score of each incision was calculated by adding all the scores of touch, pain, vibration, and static and moving two-point discrimination.

Our secondary aims were to compare sensation scores, scar healing, other functional parameters and the presence or absence of scar hyperesthesia.</p><p id="Par44">Limitations are (1) six quadrants of the anterior knee were tested, but the extent of the area over which the numbness existed was not measured. Extent of numbness has been studied previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but different sensations were not quantified as in our study. (2) Spectrum of sensation testing should include hypoesthesia, paraesthesia, dysesthesia and hyperesthesia. We measured hypoesthesia and noted the presence of hyperesthesia, if present. (3) All our patients had varus deformity. Thus, we have been unable to correlate results with the type of deformity. In spite of these limitations, our study is noteworthy because the two incisions were compared in the same patient at the same time, thus eliminating all individual-related and time-related variables. Moreover, except for the skin incisions, arthrotomy and all other steps of surgery remained identical for ideal comparison. Lastly, subjective and objective comparisons were made and correlated.</p><p id="Par45">Subjective patient preference for the knee with less lateral flap numbness and the objective sensation scores in our study were both in favor of anterolateral incision at 12&#x000a0;weeks and at 52&#x000a0;weeks. Our results are similar to those reported by Berg and Mjoberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and Laffosse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and explained by greater preservation of the infrapatellar branches of the saphenous nerve in anterolateral skin incision. Follow-up scores showed that sensations recovered with time in both incisions but the recovery was significantly better with anterolateral incision even at 1&#x000a0;year post-surgery. Laffosse et al. showed that with time, the area of lateral flap numbness becomes smaller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our study further shows that the quality of sensation within the affected area (pain, touch, vibration, two-point discrimination) also improves with time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Scar assessment as judged by the POSAS score signified better healing with anterolateral incision at 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks but no difference at 52&#x000a0;weeks. Blood supply to the anterior knee comes predominantly from the medial side. A watershed area exists on the anterolateral aspect of the knee where circulation from the medial and lateral sides meet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A midline incision would create a lateral skin flap whose medial portion (medial to the watershed zone) has its blood supply compromised. An anterolateral incision would create a lateral flap whose blood supply is not thus compromised. Previous studies have shown reduced blood supply to the lateral flap compared to the medial flap when using a midline incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, on bending the knee, an anterolateral incision causes less stretching of the lateral flap, thereby maintaining better blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Shetty and Shetty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have similarly reported early and better wound healing with an anterolateral incision in their comparative study. In our study, we observed no difference in the scars between the two incisions at 1&#x000a0;year post-surgery.</p><p id="Par47">The average duration of surgery with anterolateral incision was 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;min more than with midline incision. Medial arthrotomy with anterolateral incision involved raising the medial flap and closing as a curved incision which entailed extra minutes of surgical time. This difference was clinically insignificant and may become negligible when anterolateral incision is routinely used.</p><p id="Par48">If revision surgery becomes necessary in future, the anterolateral incision can be reused by raising the medial flap and performing medial arthrotomy.
