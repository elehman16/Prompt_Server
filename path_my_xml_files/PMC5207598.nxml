Although antihypertensive medications are effective at controlling blood pressure, current first-line treatment for hypertension is nonpharmacological lifestyle modifications. Recent studies indicate that isometric resistance training (IRT) may also be effective for assisting with blood pressure management. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of IRT for blood pressure management and the suitability of a low-intensity working control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty hypertensive individuals, aged between 36 and 65 years, conducted IRT for 8 weeks. Participants were randomized into 2 groups, working at an intensity of either 5% or 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Participants performed 4&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;2&#x0200a;minute isometric handgrip exercises with their nondominant hand, each separated by a 3-minute rest period, 3 days a week.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>Blood pressure measurements were conducted at baseline and at the end of the protocol using a Finometer.

In addition, previous studies of 4 to 10 weeks duration have focused on people aged between 20 and 35 years or 60 and 80 years with a sedentary control. Peters et al<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> conducted an isometric handgrip study with 10 participants aged 52&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;5 over 6 weeks.

A 5% MVC was chosen to determine whether the low intensity would elicit reductions in BP, and therefore test suitability for control group allocation in future studies.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>This study consisted of 40 white participants with mild or prehypertension, men (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) and women (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25), aged between 36 and 65 years recruited from Armidale, NSW, Australia. Participants had a resting SBP &#x02265;120&#x0200a;mmHg and/or a resting DBP &#x02265;80&#x0200a;mmHg, or were receiving pharmacotherapy to treat their BP (65%).

Eligible participants were familiarized to all testing equipments and randomized into either a 30% MVC (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20) or a 5% MVC (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20) training group. Participant enrolment and randomization were conducted by D.Carlson. Randomization was conducted before baseline blood pressure measurements using a computer-generated random number assignment, resulting in differences in SBP at baseline.</p><p>Participants were blinded as to which group they were randomized into; only the research team members who conducted the protocol were aware of group assignment. A numbered code system was used to identify participants, which allowed the researchers supervising the exercise protocol to ensure that participants worked at the correct intensity, while blinding participants to group assignment. A specifically designed light box was set up as a feedback mechanism for participants during IRT to prevent them knowing what intensity they were working at. All participants were exposed to the same conditions and equal attention to counteract concerns of disparities between groups owing to the Hawthorne effect.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>IRT training protocol</title><p>Participants trained 3 days per week for 8 weeks using a DHD-3 Digital Hand Dynamometer (Saehan Corporation, South Korea) with their nondominant hand. At the start of each training session, the participants conducted 3 contractions using maximum force, each separated by 30&#x0200a;seconds; these were then averaged to calculate the resistance at which they would perform either 30% MVC or 5% MVC on the day. Participants then completed 4 sets of 2-minute isometric handgrip contractions separated by 3-minute rest periods. Each training session was conducted in the Exercise Physiology Lab at the University of New England, Armidale, under direct supervision of a member of the research team.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Blood pressure measurements</title><p>Baseline and postintervention blood pressure was established using a beat-to-beat Finometer Midi Model-2 (Finapres Medical Systems B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Two minutes of continuous blood pressure measurement were recorded to assess resting SBP, DBP, heart rate (HR), and MAP. The Finometer utilizes an infrared photo-plethysmograph built into a finger cuff based on the Penaz volume-clamp method to enable continuous noninvasive BP measurements.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> To address concerns of the accuracy of the Finometer, raised after commencement of the study, and to gauge consistency with brachial cuff BP, we compared the Finometer measurements with those of a sphygmomanometer in some participants. All baseline and post comparison data were performed with BP measurements, which were conducted using the Finometer. Upper arm cuff measurements were conducted on the last 16 participants at baseline, and 24 participants postintervention. The purpose of this was to assess the coefficient of variation between the Finometer and manual sphygmomanometer measurements.</p><p>All testing was conducted in a quiet, temperature-controlled room, following a 4-hour fast from food and caffeine, and a 12-hour abstinence from alcohol and vigorous exercise. All post-tests were conducted 24&#x0200a;hours after the final day of week 8 IRT and within 2&#x0200a;hours of the initial pretesting time of day, time of medication ingestion was standardized. Blood pressure was measured in the participants&#x02019; dominant arm (right n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;38, left n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2) using the Finometer Midi and sphygmomanometer. Baseline and 24-hour post-IRT blood pressure measurements were conducted with the participant lying supine on a massage table, with their arm relaxed by their side.</p><p>An aneroid Heine Gamma G7 sphygmomanometer, which was calibrated by a technician before use, was utilized for brachial BP measurements. The auscultatory method was conducted by placing the cuff around the dominant arm of the individual and listening for Korotkoff sounds with a Littmann Classic IISE stethoscope, using the recommended blood pressure measurement guidelines.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Three blood pressure measurements were taken, each separated by a 5-minute rest period. After another 5 minutes of rest, the Finometer was used to record 2 minutes of continuous blood pressure measurements.</p><p>The Finometer was calibrated by a technician before commencement of the study, and extensive training and practice were provided to the observers to ensure accuracy of recordings. The finger cuff was placed on the middle finger of the dominant hand and the height correction unit used to correct hydrostatic blood pressure changes for the hand being away from heart level. Use of the height-adjusting component converts finger cuff pressure to brachial pressure, meeting the American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) criteria.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Data analysis</title><p>BeatScope Easy software which records waveforms and beat-to-beat data were used to unpack the Finometer data into an excel spreadsheet. Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) was then used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the last 15, 30, 60, and the entire 120&#x0200a;seconds of baseline and post-IRT recording. Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, repeated measures 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (measure&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;time) with Tukey contrasts, and pair-wise comparisons were conducted to determine the best statistical model to use. Based on this, the entire 120&#x0200a;seconds of baseline and post-IRT data were used for all pre-post calculations. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests and repeated measures 2-way ANOVA (group&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;time) were conducted to evaluate the <italic>P</italic> value for differences in pre-post data.

The reduction in SBP was clinically significant (&#x0003e;3&#x0200a;mmHg). It appears unlikely that 5% MVC elicits significant blood pressure reductions. Instead of a sedentary control, we might therefore consider utilizing a control group for future IRT studies at an intensity of 5% MVC.</p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Blood pressure, MAP, and HR</title><p>Our primary analysis showed that SBP reductions were seen in the 30% MVC group, but not the 5% MVC group.

Although it is unclear whether the size of these reductions is clinically meaningful, it has been previously found that the magnitude of blood pressure reductions following IRT is directly related to pre-training blood pressure levels,<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> which could perhaps be explained by regression to the mean.</p><p>Mean DBPs at baseline in both the 5% and 30% MVC groups in our study were within the normal range with both groups having population baseline mean &#x0003c;85&#x0200a;mmHg. Taking into account the limited potential for further reductions in DBP, we did not expect to see much of a reduction in DBP after IRT intervention in either group. We saw no significant reduction in DBP for both the 5% and 30% groups. Previous studies conducting isometric handgrip training at 30% MVC produced conflicting results. Some small studies have failed to show DBP reductions; Howden et al<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> who had 8 participants conducting 5 weeks of IRT and Taylor et al<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> with 9 participants after 10 weeks of IRT, saw no statistical reductions in DBP with baseline &#x0003c;85&#x0200a;mmHg. In contrast, both single studies<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> and pooled analyses from several studies<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> have shown significant reductions in DBP after IRT. Although baseline DBP may predict significant responses to IRT, again it is unclear whether the size of these reductions is clinically meaningful.</p><p>The significant reduction in MAP in the 30% group saw MAP lowered from 100 to 96&#x0200a;mmHg, which is clinically meaningful. Reductions in MAP at 30% MVC were also seen by Carlson et al<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> and Millar et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> There were no statistically significant changes in HR for either the 5% or 30% MVC groups. The absence of change in resting HR indicates that IRT has a minimal effect on the parasympathetic nervous system. Other analyses have failed to show a reduction in HR with IRT when conducting an isometric handgrip protocol.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>4.2</label><title>Clinical significance</title><p>The risk of adverse health outcomes can be reduced if individuals with grade 1 hypertension can lower their blood pressure, there exists a dose-response.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Despite a 2-mmHg reduction in SBP in the 5% MVC group, this was only statistically significant when baseline blood pressure was used as a covariate.

Although the 5% and 30% MVC groups were matched for equal numbers of participants, there were only 7 nonmedicated participants in each group. Parameters were matched at baseline for both groups; however, the 5% and 30% groups were not matched at baseline for SBP, resulting in the 30% SBP baseline being &#x0003e;5%. Two of the participants (30% MVC group) had to withdraw from the study because of work commitments, one after completing 4 weeks and the other at 5 weeks. As both had informed the researchers with enough notice, their blood pressure was measured on their last day of attending and their 2-minute rest period post-IRT was used as last outcome carried forward for analysis.</p><p>Controversy over the accuracy of the Finometer was mitigated to some extent by a comparative analysis with sphygmomanometer measures, which showed significant correlation. Previous studies looking at variation in the Finapres in relation to intra-arterial pressure indicated variability and bias in SBP and DBP measurements resulting in incorrect measurements.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> We used a more recent Finometer, which supersedes the Finapres; although there was a significant variation in DBP, there was no significant variation in our SBP, and this was also seen by Schutte et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>4.4</label><title>Recommendations for future research</title><p>A larger cohort would enable subanalyses to look at individual variation in response to IRT, such as comparison of males and females and medicated versus nonmedicated participants. Future research would benefit from utilizing the current criterion standard for blood pressure measurement of 24-hour ambulatory monitoring; only 1 study to date has used ambulatory blood pressure. To date there has only been 2 randomized controlled studies of IRT for 10 weeks, the longest study duration.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Future studies should look at the effect of IRT over a period of &#x02265;10 weeks, with a follow-up equivalent to the duration of IRT intervention.
