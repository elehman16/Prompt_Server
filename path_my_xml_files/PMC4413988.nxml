Trials to confirm these findings in healthy term infants, and in a non-West African setting, have not yet been carried out. In addition, a biological mechanism to explain such heterologous effects of BCG in the neonatal period has not been confirmed. This trial aims to address these issues by evaluating whether BCG non-specifically enhances the innate immune system in term Ugandan neonates, leading to increased protection from a variety of infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This trial will be an investigator-blinded, randomised controlled trial of 560 Ugandan neonates, comparing those receiving BCG at birth with those receiving BCG at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age. This design allows comparison of outcomes between BCG-vaccinated and -na&#x000ef;ve infants until 6&#x000a0;weeks of age, and between early and delayed BCG-vaccinated infants from 6&#x000a0;weeks of age onwards. The primary outcomes of the study will be a panel of innate immune parameters. Secondary outcomes will include clinical illness measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Investigation of the possible broadly protective effects of neonatal BCG immunisation, and the optimal vaccination timing to produce these effects, could have profound implications for public healthcare policy. Evidence of protection against heterologous pathogens would underscore the importance of prioritising BCG administration in a timely manner for all infants, provide advocacy against the termination of BCG&#x02019;s use and support novel anti-tuberculous vaccine strategies that would safeguard such beneficial effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN59683017?q=bcg&#x00026;filters=&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=2&#x00026;totalResults=38&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN59683017</ext-link>: registration date: 15 January 2014</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0682-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin</kwd><kwd>Heterologous effects</kwd><kwd>Innate immunity</kwd><kwd>Neonate</kwd><kwd>Invasive infectious disease</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background and rationale</title><p>Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) immunisation, the only currently available tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, is one of the most frequently administered immunisations worldwide with more than 100 million children receiving it per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although it provides protection against severe forms of TB in children, it has variable efficacy against adult pulmonary disease, with protection generally poor in high-risk areas such as sub-Saharan Africa and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are currently concerted efforts in the scientific community to improve anti-TB protection either by enhancing existing BCG immunisation strategies or by developing an alternative vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>However, it has been suggested that BCG may protect infants against a variety of non-mycobacterial pathogens and thus have beneficial effects beyond protection against TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The evidence for such a &#x02018;non-specific&#x02019; effect of BCG is currently in equipoise. It is, therefore, important and pressing to interrogate this possibility further so that any new vaccine or BCG schedule may be evaluated in terms of overall benefit to recipient, rather than in terms of TB-specific protection alone.</p><p>The possibility that BCG may have non-specific beneficial effects on diseases other than TB has been a controversial and highly-debated subject. Observations that BCG may have a greater impact on mortality than can be explained by protection against TB were first made following its introduction more than 80&#x000a0;years ago. Studies including more than 46,500 infants, carried out in the 1940s and 1950s in the USA and UK, showed on average a 25% (95% CI 6 to 41%) reduction in all cause mortality in children receiving BCG compared to those not receiving it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This reduction was noted at the time to be larger than could be attributed to the expected reduction in rates of TB. However, as many of these studies were not strictly randomised or controlled, and this was a period of major public health improvements, the results were assumed to result from confounding effects. Similar arguments have been used to dismiss a number of observational studies carried out more recently, in Guinea-Bissau, which appear to show that infants who receive BCG at birth have lower all-cause morbidity and mortality than infants who do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Good quality, randomised controlled trials evaluating the possibility of non-specific effects of BCG are extremely limited. Only one trial has been conducted to specifically evaluate non-tuberculous mortality as a result of altered BCG vaccination schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this trial of low birth-weight infants in Guinea-Bissau, subjects randomised to receive BCG at birth had a 45% lower mortality rate (MRR 0.55 (0.34 to 0.89)) in the first 2&#x000a0;months of life than infants who had BCG immunisation delayed to, on average, 6&#x000a0;weeks of age. The reduction in deaths was due to protection from all-cause febrile illness, respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea, but not against TB (verbal autopsy data). However, although this study is the only trial designed primarily to investigate the impact of BCG on all-cause mortality, nine other randomised controlled trials have been conducted that delayed BCG vaccination past the neonatal period in high mortality areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. None of these studies reported significant differences in mortality, either during the period when one intervention group had received BCG and the other group had not, or subsequently. Also, in contrast to the Guinea-Bissau trial, three large cohort studies appear to show that infants who receive BCG vaccination at the same time as Diphtheria Tetanus Pertussis (DTP) vaccination (at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age) have reduced longer-term all-cause mortality than those that have received BCG at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, it is currently unclear whether BCG has non-specific beneficial protective effects against diseases other than TB, and if so, what timing of administration would be optimal to induce these effects.</p><p>The possibility that BCG may have effects against non-tuberculous disease has also had limited acceptance in the scientific and public health communities due to the lack of a confirmed biological mechanism. Investigations into the hypothesis that BCG immunisation might skew the adaptive immune response from the T-helper type 2 (Th2) dominant environment of early neonatal life, toward a more protective T-helper type 1 (Th1) environment, have been inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The evidence from the Guinea-Bissau randomised controlled trial, however, shows that any putative immunological mechanism would need to be: 1) effective at birth despite the immature neonatal immune system, 2) rapidly inducible (most protection at&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;week post-immunisation) and 3) active against a range of pathogens. These features would suggest that BCG mediates its non-specific effects by stimulating the innate immune system. This is the hypothesis that we aim to interrogate during this study.</p><p>We plan to investigate three different aspects of the innate immune system. Firstly, we will investigate whether non-specific pro-inflammatory cytokine production is enhanced in infants who have received BCG by using <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with non-mycobacterial stimulants. Few studies exist investigating alterations in cytokine production to heterologous stimulants following neonatal BCG immunisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The few that have been reported have focused on adaptive cytokines, using a 6-day <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation protocol, which is sub-optimal for the quantification of innate cytokine production. No studies exist where samples have been collected prior to 5&#x000a0;months of age, thus early non-specific effects of BCG will have been missed. Lastly, <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulants used in previous studies have been antigens (for example, lipopolysaccharide or tetanus toxoid) and not whole organisms, potentially excluding the effect of other important pattern recognition receptor pathways. As part of this proposed study we aim to address these issues by focusing on the impact of BCG on innate cytokine production, conducting overnight stimulation using non-mycobacterial whole organism stimulants, and by using blood samples taken before 10&#x000a0;weeks of age.</p><p>Secondly, we will investigate whether BCG might mediate any non-specific beneficial effects by inducing a plasma hypoferraemia. Iron supply is critical for the virulence of most pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], with plasma hypoferraemia profoundly inhibiting the growth of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], protozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As part of the innate acute-phase response, plasma hypoferraemia is induced by IL-6-driven release of hepcidin. Guinea pig models reveal that BCG also induces a rapid bacteriostatic hypoferraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], although involvement of the IL-6/hepcidin pathway has never been studied. To our knowledge, no studies exist investigating the influence of BCG immunisation on the human iron-inflammatory pathway. As part of this study we will investigate whether BCG immunisation in neonates induces alterations to the inflammatory iron axis, as a potential effector mechanism for heterologous protection.</p><p>Lastly we will investigate whether BCG induces epigenetic modification at the promoter region of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes, thereby providing a mechanism for &#x02018;training&#x02019; the innate immune system to respond in a persistently amplified manner to challenge by non-mycobacterial pathogens. BCG immunisation of na&#x000ef;ve adults has been shown to produce trimethylation of histone-3 lysine 4 (H3K4) at the promoter region of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; in monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This led to enhanced cytokine production following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with the heterologous pathogens <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>)<italic>, Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> (<italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>) and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<italic>C. albicans</italic>)<italic>,</italic> which persisted to at least 3&#x000a0;months post-immunisation. We will investigate whether BCG immunisation produces similar epigenetic modification of monocytes in neonates.</p><p>Thus, we have designed a randomised controlled trial, comparing BCG administration at birth with administration at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age in healthy Ugandan neonates. We will use this to interrogate the impact of BCG vaccination on the innate immune response, as well on all-cause clinical illness outcomes. We believe this study will add significantly to the current debate regarding the non-specific effects of BCG vaccination as it aims to confirm a biological mechanism to explain such effects. Also, by being conducted in healthy neonates, in a geographical location distant from previous studies and by an independent research group, it will help to understand the global applicability of any non-specific effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aims of our study are as follow:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To determine whether BCG immunisation at birth alters the innate immune response to heterologous pathogens in the short term (within 1&#x000a0;week)</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine whether BCG immunisation at birth alters the innate immune response to heterologous pathogens in the longer term (at 6&#x000a0;weeks)</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine whether BCG immunisation given at age 6&#x000a0;weeks has similar short- and longer-term effects on the innate immune response to heterologous pathogens compared to BCG immunisation at birth</p></list-item><list-item><p>To obtain data upon the effect of BCG on neonatal susceptibility to invasive infections in Ugandan infants</p></list-item></list></p><p>Aims 1, 2 and 3 will be addressed using sub-studies to interrogate 3 different elements of the innate immune system.

They will then have 2-ml venous blood samples collected at 2 time-points between birth and their exit from the study at 10 completed weeks of age. Each sub-study has up to four possible time-points where blood samples are collected, but each infant will only be bled at two of these time-points (randomly allocated) to avoid undue stress for the baby and the mother. The time-points have been selected to enable interrogation of the changes to the innate immune system induced by BCG both acutely following vaccination and in the longer term. The timing of the blood samples in the iron sub-study differs slightly from those in the cytokine and epigenetic sub-studies (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These differences are necessitated by the systemic nature of iron metabolism. As hepcidin is produced mainly in the liver this precludes analysis of iron metabolism following <italic>in-vitro</italic> non-specific stimulation. Thus, the iron sub-study will use routine primary immunisations as <italic>in-vivo</italic> non-specific stimuli and measure the resulting changes to iron parameters.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

An internal study monitor will oversee the day-to-day running of the trial locally, with external oversight and monitoring co-ordinated by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This may include internal audit by the Clinical Trials Quality Assurance Manager and external audits by a third party. A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and an independent DSMB have been set up for this study. The DSMB will look at a number of clinical outcome measures, documented in 'real time' during the study, to assess whether the study needs to be stopped early for safety.</p><p>Safety reporting for this trial will follow standard Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine procedures. This includes notification of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) to the local ethics committee within 24&#x000a0;hours, notification of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) to the sponsor within 7&#x000a0;days if life-threatening or 15&#x000a0;days if non-life-threatening. The manufacturer of the BCG vaccine, Staten Serum Institute, will also be notified of any SAE/SUSAR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Ethics</title><p>As this trial will alter the timing of BCG from the current Ugandan guidelines (BCG at birth) in half of the study infants, a thorough risk-benefit analysis of a 6-week delay in vaccination has been conducted. In summary, we feel that the risks of delay are minimal for the following reasons:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Neonatal TB is rare and the chances of infants in the delayed BCG arm becoming infected during a 6-week delay period are extremely small. At least 7 previous studies have been conducted in areas of high TB prevalence that randomised infants to delayed BCG vaccination past 6&#x000a0;weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. None of these studies showed an increase in TB incidence in the delayed vaccination group either in the period prior to vaccination or during follow-up (cumulative n for delayed BCG vaccination&#x02009;=&#x02009;849, median follow-up time 1&#x000a0;year).</p></list-item><list-item><p>A recent study using an Entebbe based birth-cohort showed a prevalence of latent TB infection of 9.7% in children under 5&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This suggests that in our population, a 6-week delay in BCG administration risks 0.63 infants becoming infected with latent TB. However, the strongest risk factor for latent TB acquisition in Entebbe is a known contact with a TB case (odds ratio (OR) 2.62 (1.29 to 5.30), unpublished data). Thus, the exclusion of infants at risk of TB from mother or a household contact will reduce this risk to negligible. Active weekly follow-up of infants will occur to ensure they remain healthy and the trial will be stopped early if cases of TB are found to be higher in the delayed BCG arm.</p></list-item></list></p><p>There is also evidence that delay in BCG vaccination from birth to 6&#x000a0;weeks may be beneficial for participants because:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The optimal timing of BCG vaccination for immunity against TB is not known. There is some evidence that delaying BCG past the neonatal period may improve the magnitude and duration of anti-TB immunity, thus providing direct benefit to participants in the delayed vaccination arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>The incidence of vaccination-induced complications, including BCG-induced abscesses, suppurative lymphadenitis and osteomyelitis are reduced by approximately one third in infants who receive BCG vaccination after the neonatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>All infants in the study, whether in the early or delayed BCG group will benefit from regular physician reviews and free access to medical review and treatment if participants become unwell. They will also benefit from receiving all other primary vaccinations at the correct time as part of the study. The most recent survey of vaccination rates in Uganda showed that 56% of infants have not received their first set of primary immunisations (diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis/hepatitis B/<italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (HiB) and oral polio vaccine) by 12&#x000a0;weeks of age, with 26% still not having received it by 1&#x000a0;year of age. This produces a substantial risk for those children of contracting serious, preventable illnesses, which participation in the study will negate.</p><p>Thus, we believe the general benefits of taking part in the study will outweigh the extremely small risks from a 6-week delay in BCG vaccination. The full risk-benefit analysis for this study can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><p>This trial has been approved by ethics boards at the Uganda Virus Research Institute on AIDS (Ref: GC/127/13/11/432), the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (Ref: HS 1524), The Office of the President of Uganda and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Ref: 6545). This study will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The primary immunisation schedule imposes a number of constraints on the design of this study, as blood samples need to be timed to limit the potentially confounding influence of non-BCG vaccinations on innate immune responses. This is particularly relevant for comparison of the longer-term non-specific effects of BCG between the Early and Delayed intervention arms at 10&#x000a0;weeks, where BCG will have been given more recently in the Delayed intervention arm. As we are investigating the acute response to non-tuberculous stimulants, we believe that this should not be a problem, as any bystander effect of BCG vaccination itself is likely to be lost by 4&#x000a0;weeks of age. However, we are actively seeking funding for a longer-term follow-up time-point that should help to clarify this issue as well as to provide information about the duration of any non-specific effects of BCG vaccination on the innate immune system.</p><p>Although it is important to understand the biological mechanism underlying any non-specific effects of BCG vaccination, ultimately the impact on all-cause clinical illness episodes and mortality will be the outcome measures that are likely to have impacts on public healthcare policy. This study has limited power to detect differences in such outcomes, due to its small sample size. However, if suggested by the immunological and preliminary clinical data in this study, additional funding will be sought to expand the cohort to allow full interrogation of clinical outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Global acceptance of the hypothesis that BCG immunisation affords non-specific protective effect when given during infancy has been limited due to paucity of randomised controlled trial data and because of a lack of a confirmed biological mechanism to explain such effects in the neonatal period. We aim to address these issues by carrying out this randomised controlled trial in Uganda, providing variety of location and research group from much of the previous work, and investigating the impact of BCG immunisation on the innate immune system in neonates. Interrogation of the possible heterologous protection afforded by BCG immunisation, and the optimal timing of immunisation to achieve beneficial effects, is important to ensure that any new anti-TB vaccine or alteration in timing of BCG administration is evaluated in terms of overall benefit to recipient, rather than solely in terms of TB-specific protection alone.</p><sec id="Sec39"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study commenced recruitment in September 2014.
