It is marked most commonly by clinical episodes of neurologic impairment. The majority of patients with multiple sclerosis have a relapsing and remitting course, so named Relapsing and Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). RRMS is marked most commonly by clinical episodes of neurologic impairment that arise over hours to days, and are not otherwise explained. After an average 15&#x02013;20 years of relapses, these patients enter a progressive phase of disease, Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS). A small subset of patients will present with progressive disease from onset, Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS). There are no effective treatments for progressive MS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jcnsd-4-2012-001">2</xref></p><p>Treatment of RRMS is two-fold: steroids are used to hasten recovery of exacerbations of disease activity, marked by new onset of neurologic deficits; and disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are used to prevent future relapses. Corticosteroids are the first line treatment for exacerbations. Corticosteroids are recommended to hasten recovery of neurologic deficits from MS exacerbations within 2 weeks of symptom onset, though there may be benefit to extending this treatment window. Prior to the 1990&#x02019;s, subcutaneous ACTH was used primarily. However, within the last 20 years, intravenous methylprednisolone has become the preferred medication. IV methylprednisolone is given once daily at doses of 500&#x02013;2000 mg for 3&#x02013;5 days. In exacerbations refractory to steroid treatment, or for severe or multifocal relapses, plasma exchange (PLEX) may be considered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jcnsd-4-2012-001">3</xref> Response rate to PLEX following poor improvement with methylprednisolone was approximately 60% within 6 months if PLEX was initiated within 20 days of symptom onset.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jcnsd-4-2012-001">3</xref></p><p>New guidelines for the diagnosis of MS allow for diagnosis of clinically definite MS after one clinical event, if imaging criteria are met.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jcnsd-4-2012-001">4</xref> Yet, it is not uncommon for patients to present with one episode of demyelination that does not meet criteria for diagnosis. This is referred to as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Risk of progression to clinically definite MS is largely based on presence and appearance of asymptomatic white matter lesions. Early prevention studies have indicated a delayed progression to clinically definite MS among patients treated with DMTs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jcnsd-4-2012-001">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-jcnsd-4-2012-001">8</xref> Treatment of CIS is currently achieved with the same first line medications used for clinically definite MS.</p><p>There are 4 injectable DMTs and one oral DMT approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with clinically definite MS and CIS. These include 3 formulations of beta interferon, glatiramer acetate and fingolimod. The three formulations of interferon beta vary by amino acid sequence, glycosylation, formulation, injection technique and frequency of injections. They each bind to the same heterodimeric receptor resulting in the regulation of hundreds of genes, yet there is no clear relationship between an individual&#x02019;s treatment response and gene expression. In separate pivotal trials, all three formulations decreased annualized relapse rates by approximately 30% over 2 years. They also decreased the development of new inflammatory lesions on MRI by 50%&#x02013;65%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-jcnsd-4-2012-001">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jcnsd-4-2012-001">11</xref> Betaseron<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (interferon beta 1b) was the first interferon to be released to the market in 1993. Since that time, weekly Interferon beta 1a (Avonex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and three times weekly Interferon beta 1a (Rebif<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) have become available. Current dosing allows for either low (22 &#x003bc;g) or high (44 &#x003bc;g) dose Interferon beta 1a (Rebif<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) subcutaneous three time weekly, and one dose of each of Interferon beta 1b (Betaseron) 250 mcg subcutaneous, every other day, and Interferon beta 1a (Avonex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) 30 mcg intramuscularly once per week. As a class, the interferons share similar side effects of worsening depressions, possible liver toxicity, and flu-like symptoms following injections (to name a few).</p><p>Glatiramer acetate (GA) (Copaxone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), released in 1996, is a subcutaneous daily injection that is thought to work by a different mechanism. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a protein comprised of only 4 amino acids, initially developed to mimic myelin basic protein, a major component of the myelin sheath. The exact mechanism of action is unclear. GA is a daily subcutaneous injection that has been shown to have roughly the same efficacy of the interferons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-jcnsd-4-2012-001">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jcnsd-4-2012-001">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-jcnsd-4-2012-001">14</xref> The side effect profile of GA includes injection site reactions including pain and inflammation, and possible lipoatrophy with long term use.</p><p>Until October 2010, all first line therapies for MS were injectable. With similar efficacies, the choice of therapy was often determined by patient tolerance of the medication and side effect profile. Each medication was associated with limited long-term treatment adherence for these issues. In October, 2010, fingolimod (Gilenya<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was approved as a first line treatment for relapsing MS. Fingolimod, a long-anticipated oral medication, is an oral sphingosine-1-phosphate analogue which works to block egress of lymphocytes out of secondary lymphoid tissues. There may also be central effects, as fingolimod is lipophilic and able to cross the blood-brain barrier. In the phase III, placebo controlled trial of fingolimod, there were significant relative reductions in relapse rates, sustained disability progression and new and enlarging T2 lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-jcnsd-4-2012-001">15</xref> When compared to intramuscular interferon beta 1a, there was a significant relative treatment benefit with fingolimod, but no effect on disability over the 12 month study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-jcnsd-4-2012-001">16</xref> Two fatalities associated with disseminated VZV and HSV infections were reported. Other common malignancies were reported. It is unclear whether these can be associated with fingolimod exposure. Thus, fingolimod has been approved as first line therapy, yet concerns about its safety profile may limit its use until more post-marketing information about adverse events becomes available.</p><p>Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the alpha 4 subunit of alpha 4 beta integrins, and thus limits migration of lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier. A phase III randomized, placebo controlled, double blind trial of natalizumab for patients with RRMS, showed large reductions in relapse rates, sustained disability progression, new or enlarging T2 lesions, and gadolinium enhancing lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jcnsd-4-2012-001">17</xref> Enthusiasm for natalizumab waned in February 2005 when the FDA removed natalizumab from the market after 2 patients developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) while on the drug. In 2006, the drug was reintroduced with national surveillance of adverse effects. To date, approximately one hundred and seventy patients treated with natalizumab have developed PML. Risk of PML appears to be linked with prior exposure to the JC virus, and prior exposure to immunosuppression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jcnsd-4-2012-001">18</xref> The risk is further increased with duration of therapy. After two years of therapy, the risk is 1/1000.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-jcnsd-4-2012-001">19</xref> A serum assay for antibodies to the JC virus is now available. With the foreknowledge of JC virus exposure status, use of natalizumab may change from that of second line therapy only, to first line therapy among patients who are JC virus antibody negative. Currently, natalizumab remains a second line therapy.</p><p>Several oral medications for treatment of RRMS are under investigation. Laquinimod, a novel oral agent (quinoline-3-carboxamide) alters the balance of Th1 to Th2 cells, resulting in fewer CD8 T cells and NK cells. Phase III trials have been promising.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-jcnsd-4-2012-001">20</xref> Laquinimod is expected to be approved in 2012.</p><p>Teriflunomide is an active metabolite of leflunomide, a drug approved for rheumatoid arthritis since 1998. Teriflunomide decreases T cell proliferation by altering pyrimidine synthesis. Phase III study of terifluonimide showed a 30% reduction in annualized relapse rate (ARR) with 2 doses of the drug when compared to placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-jcnsd-4-2012-001">21</xref></p><p>BG 12, an oral formulation of dimethyl fumarate inhibits expression of pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules and cytokines. The phase III study of BG12 compared to placebo showed that 240 mg of BG-12, administered either twice or 3 times daily, met the primary study endpoint, demonstrating a highly statistically significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) in the proportion of patients with RRMS who relapsed at 2 years compared with placebo. The benign side effect profile of BG-12 (similar to that of placebo) suggests that this may be the best tolerated DMT for the treatment of RRMS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-jcnsd-4-2012-001">22</xref></p><p>Cladribine has been pursued as another possible oral treatment for RRMS. Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxy-adenosine, 2-CdA) is a purine nucleoside analog that has been used in the US for the treatment of several neoplasms, including acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia and non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-jcnsd-4-2012-001">23</xref> Cladribine works preferentially on lymphocytes and monocytes by disrupting cellular metabolism resulting in cell death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-jcnsd-4-2012-001">24</xref> Long lasting lymphocyte suppression has been investigated as a means of disease modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jcnsd-4-2012-001">25</xref> Indeed, the history of investigation of cladribine for the treatment of multiple sclerosis is long and fraught with many disappointments. The recent (June 2011) Merck decision withdraw regulatory applications filed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reflects the most recent event along the path.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jcnsd-4-2012-001">26</xref></p><p>The purpose of this article is to review recent efficacy and safety data that might be of help in cases of off-label use of cladribine for the treatment of MS patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of Action, Metabolism and Pharmacokinetic Profile</title><p>Cladribine enters cells via purine nucleoside transporters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jcnsd-4-2012-001">27</xref> Cladribine is resistant to the action of adenosine deaminase, an enzyme required for adenosine breakdown and the turnover of nucleic acids within the cells. Adenosine deaminase is found in most body cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages. In these cells cladribine is phosphorylated into the active triphosphate deoxynucleotide, CdATP. In cell lines with high concentrations of 5&#x02032;-nucleotidase, CdATP is metabolized. However, lymphocytes, when compared to other cell lines, have high levels of deoxycytidine kinase, and low levels of 5&#x02032;-nucleotidase and so are unable to metabolize CdATP. CdATP accumulates in the cell and disrupts DNA synthesis and repair, which subsequently leads to apoptosis. Thus, cellular toxicity is limited primarily to lymphocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-jcnsd-4-2012-001">28</xref> Reduced lymphocyte counts are observed 4&#x02013;6 weeks after administration, and effects are maintained for at least 6&#x02013;12 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jcnsd-4-2012-001">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-jcnsd-4-2012-001">28</xref></p><p>One study of cladribine for the treatment of progressive MS showed a dose-dependent decrease in mean levels of CD4+, CD3+, CD8+ and to a lesser degree, CD19+ lymphocytes. Transient decreases in CD16+ and CD56+ cells were also observed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jcnsd-4-2012-001">25</xref> Another study found that at doses of 0.7&#x02013;2.1 mg/kg a dose-dependent reduction in mean CD4+ T cell counts was sustained for at least 12 months, whereas mean B cell counts decreased during the first 2&#x02013;7 months, and recovered to near baseline after 10 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jcnsd-4-2012-001">29</xref> The same study showed that mean natural killer (NK) cell counts dropped during the first months of cladribine treatment, but recovered after 7 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jcnsd-4-2012-001">29</xref> Cladribine may also impair cellular migration into the CNS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-jcnsd-4-2012-001">30</xref> Using an in vitro Boyden chamber and fibronectin layer, Kopadze et al, studied the effect of cladribine on the migratory capacity of immunocompetent cells in both MS patients as well as controls. Fibronectin has previously been identified as a stimulus for migration of mononuclear cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jcnsd-4-2012-001">31</xref> The group found a significant reduction in migratory capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after treatment with cladribine in both groups. MMP 2 and MMP 9, two metalloproteinases required for cell migration, were noticeably reduced in the study, a potential explanation for decreased migration capacity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-jcnsd-4-2012-001">30</xref></p><p>Cladribine may also have effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) promotes the proliferation and function of antigen-specific T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jcnsd-4-2012-001">32</xref> Significantly lower IL-2 levels were reported in patients with progressive MS 12 months after treatment with cladribine compared to baseline <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jcnsd-4-2012-001">33</xref> Moreover, reduced levels of CXCL8 (IL-8) in the CSF and CCL5 (RANTES) have been reported in the serum and CSF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-jcnsd-4-2012-001">34</xref> In vitro studies indicate that cladribine markedly down-regulates secretion of cytokines by human T cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-jcnsd-4-2012-001">35</xref> Further study is required to determine whether this effect exists in vivo, or if the decreased inflammatory profile is the result of reduction of total number of lymphocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jcnsd-4-2012-001">32</xref></p><p>Cladribine&#x02019;s efficacy possibly extends beyond its well-known cytotoxic effects as demonstrated by its ability to turn on or off critical genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell signaling and cellular proliferation. Specifically, cladribine may act as a hypomethylating agent through its inhibition of S-adenylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase. By this mechanism, cladribine indirectly inhibits DNA methylation by decreasing the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio through its inhibition of SAM formation. This is achieved by blocking the activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which leads to the accumulation of SAH. SAH excess, coupled with a deficiency of SAM, prevents further DNA methylation. By inhibiting donation of methyl groups, cladribine may also inhibit methylation of proteins, such as histones. Histone methylation has recently been shown to have an important role in gene silencing in cancer cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-jcnsd-4-2012-001">36</xref></p><p>After administration, cladribine is not extensively metabolized.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jcnsd-4-2012-001">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jcnsd-4-2012-001">32</xref> Oral bioavailability of cladribine varies between 37% and 55% whereas bioavailability of subcutaneous injection is 100%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jcnsd-4-2012-001">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-jcnsd-4-2012-001">37</xref> Oral bioavailability is not significantly influenced by food intake; although time to reach maximum plasma concentrations may be delayed in the fed state.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jcnsd-4-2012-001">32</xref> Cladribine is metabolized in the liver and is 20% protein bound.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-jcnsd-4-2012-001">37</xref> Cladribine has biphasic half-life elimination.

Initial studies focused on treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis, either primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) via intravenous routes. As understanding of cladribine improved, trials changed to focus on efficacy, tolerability and safety of oral formulations for treatment of relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).</p><p>An early randomized double blind trial of cladribine for treatment of chronic, progressive MS administered 4 monthly courses of either 0.7 mg/kg cladribine or placebo through a surgically implanted central line.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-jcnsd-4-2012-001">38</xref> For the first year, cladribine was administered by continuous 7 day intravenous infusion at the rate of 0.1 mg/kg daily. Fifty one patients with clinically definite or laboratory-supported definite chronic progressive MS for more than 2 years were examined by blinded physicians monthly. Disability scores, as measured via Kurtzke and Scripps scales, and demyelinated volumes on MRI improved in the group receiving cladribine, and continued to decline in the untreated group. At 12 months, the mean paired differences (placebo minus cladribine) in EDSS scores were 1.3 (0.3) with 95% confidence interval 0.6&#x02013;2.

However, there was a rapid deterioration thereafter. The patients who received placebo in the first year of the study showed disease progression during that time. There was stabilization of disease for a brief, 8 month period, following infusion of the lower cumulative dose (1.4 mg/kg) of cladribine. This group also had lower occurrence of enhancing lesions on MRI scans. In contrast to the 7 patients who had thrombocytopenia with higher doses of cladribine in the first year, there was only one person with low platelet count in the second year, at the reduced dose. There were no other significant adverse events recorded during the second year of the study, supporting a possible dose-related correlation to adverse events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-jcnsd-4-2012-001">39</xref> The results of this small, early study provided incentive for future studies of the efficacy of cladribine and information about dosing, while also raising awareness of safety issues (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jcnsd-4-2012-001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Further knowledge about the safety and efficacy of cladribine for the treatment of progressive MS was gleaned from a double-blinded, placebo controlled study in 159 patients with either PPMS or SPMS and a baseline median Kurtzke&#x02019;s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jcnsd-4-2012-001">25</xref> The primary outcome measure was disability as measured by the EDSS.

Although the gadolinium enhanced T1 lesions and the mean volume and number of such lesions on MRI was significantly less in the cladribine groups, there was no significant change in disability between the placebo and the treatment groups.

The mean relapse rate per year at the initiation of therapy was 2.67 &#x000b1; 0.75. Parenteral cladribine was given at 0.07 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days monthly. All patients had a slow but sustained recovery in clinical disability following cladribine therapy.

MRI showed a decrease in the number of gadolinium enhancing lesions in 4 patients. Four patients had repeated courses of cladribine ranging from 0.7 to 1.4 mg/kg after relapses between 10 and 24 months after initial dose. In the mean follow-up period of 49.33 &#x000b1; 39.66 months (range 6&#x02013;102), the mean relapse rate per year was reduced to 0.71 &#x000b1; 0.55 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Interestingly, all six patients were young (range 15&#x02013;38 years) at the time that therapy was initiated. No conclusions can be reached from such a small sample size (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jcnsd-4-2012-001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The overall promising results of parenteral cladribine lead to the development of an oral formulation. The 96 week CLARITY (Cladribine Tables Treating MS OrallY) study was the first phase III placebo-controlled, double blind, multicenter trial of an oral formulation of cladribine for RRMS. 1326 patients were assigned to one of 3 groups to assess not only efficacy, but also dosing and safety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-jcnsd-4-2012-001">42</xref> The study population was divided randomly into a placebo arm, low dose, and high dose regimen. In the first 48 week treatment period, patients received either two courses of cladribine followed by two courses of placebo (total cumulative dose 3.5 mg/kg), four courses of cladribine (total cumulative dose 5.25 mg/kg), or four courses of placebo. In the second 48 week period, both cladribine groups received two courses of cladribine, and the placebo group received 2 courses of placebo. After week 24, rescue therapy with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a was available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-jcnsd-4-2012-001">43</xref> The primary end point was rate of relapse at 96 weeks. Secondary Outcome Measures were to assess the effect of cladribine on progression of disability in subjects with RRMS.</p><p>The ARR was significantly reduced in both cladribine groups as compared to placebo. Relative reduction of relapse rate, proportion who remained relapse free at 96 weeks, time to first relapse (Hazard ratio), and risk of 3 month sustained progression of disability were all significantly improved in the cladribine treatment groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jcnsd-4-2012-001">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>When the study subjects were selected for <italic>Nonresponders</italic>: those who had discontinued interferon beta or GA due to lack of efficacy or suboptimal treatment effect, or disease modifying drug (DMD) <italic>Intolerance</italic>: those who recorded a history of adverse reaction or intolerance to interferon beta or GA, similar results were found. Cladribine tablets effectively reduced mean ARR in patients with a history of failed prior disease modifying therapy by 56.1% at high dose, and 41.5% at low dose, and increased the proportion of patients remaining relapse-free over 96 weeks. A significant treatment effect of low dose (3.5 mg/kg) cladribine tablets on EDSS progression was seen in the nonresponder group.

Three cases of severe neutropenia were reported. Infections were reported in 47.7% of the patients in the low dose cladribine group, 48.9% of those in the high dose cladribine group and 42.5% of those in the placebo group. Twenty patients developed herpes zoster infections: 8 patients in the low dose group and 12 in the high dose group. The occurrence of neoplasms (benign, malignant or unspecified) was reported in 1.4% of patients in the low dose cladribine group and 0.9% of those in the high dose group. There were no cases of neoplasm in the placebo group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jcnsd-4-2012-001">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Both dosing regimens of cladribine were associated with clinical and radiographic improvement compared to placebo.
