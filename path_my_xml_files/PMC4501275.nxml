Less than half of patients suffering from depression can achieve remission after adequate antidepressant treatment. Another promising treatment option is cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). However, the need for experienced therapists and substantive dedicated time prevent CBT from being widely disseminated.</p><p>In the present study, we aim to examine the effectiveness of switching antidepressants and starting a smartphone-based CBT program at the same time, in comparison to switching antidepressants only, among patients still suffering from depression after adequate antidepressant treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted since September 2014. The smartphone-based CBT program, named the &#x0201c;Kokoro-App,&#x0201d; for major depression has been developed and its feasibility has been confirmed in a previous open study. The program consists of an introduction, 6 sessions and an epilogue, and is expected to be completed within 9 weeks by patients. In the present trial, 164 patients with DSM-5 major depressive disorder and still suffering from depressive symptoms after adequate antidepressant treatment for more than 4 weeks will be allocated to the Kokoro-App plus switching antidepressant group or the switching antidepressant alone group. The participants allocated to the latter group will receive full components of the Kokoro-App after 9 weeks.</p><p>The primary outcome is the change in the total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire through the 9 weeks of the program, as assessed at week 0, 1, 5 and 9 via telephone by blinded raters. The secondary outcomes include the change in the total score of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, change in side effects as assessed by the Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating, and treatment satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>An effective and reachable intervention may not only lead to healthier mental status among depressed patients, but also to reduced social burden from this illness. This paper outlines the background and methods of a trial that evaluates the possible additive value of a smartphone-based CBT program for treatment-resistant depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>UMIN-CTR: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows&#x00026;action=brows&#x00026;type=summary&#x00026;recptno=R000015984&#x00026;language=E">UMIN000013693</ext-link> (registered on 1 June 2014)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Behavior therapy</kwd><kwd>Cognitive therapy</kwd><kwd>Computer-assisted therapy</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trials</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Major depression is the second leading cause of deterioration of quality of life in humankind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The economic loss due to depression is estimated at approximately 2 trillion yen per year in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Approximately 30,000 people a year die due to suicide in Japan. Half of these suicide victims are estimated to suffer from depression immediately before committing suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The first-line treatment for depression in clinical settings is pharmacotherapy, especially antidepressant treatment; however, less than 50&#x000a0;% of patients receiving acute-phase antidepressant treatment for 2 to 4&#x000a0;months can achieve remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Other effective treatment options for depression include cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT); this has been shown to be as efficacious as pharmacotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and to be more efficacious when combined with pharmacotherapy than pharmacotherapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. CBT can, therefore, be a viable treatment option not only for patients preferring CBT to pharmacotherapy but also for patients still suffering from depression after an adequate trial of antidepressant treatment.</p><p>However, patients willing to receive CBT can rarely do so even in developed countries, because a typical course of CBT consists of sixteen 1-hour face-to-face sessions led by an experienced therapist. On the other hand, CBT delivered via the Internet or computers has been recently provided in Western countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden. The efficacy of computer-based or Internet-based CBT has been examined in previous systematic reviews. A systematic review and meta-analysis, combining results from 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 645 participants, estimated an effect size of computer-based CBT to be 0.78 (95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI): 0.59 to 0.63) in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU) or waiting-list controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Another systematic review combining results from 16 RCTs with 2807 participants showed that computer-based CBT led to a greater proportion of dropouts but to better efficacy at an effect size of 0.48 (0.33 to 0.63) in the short-term follow up than those in control conditions, whilst to neither superiority nor inferiority in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the wake of recent developments in information and communication technology (ICT), CBT delivered via smartphones can be a better treatment option for depression than a computer-based one in terms of accessibility and portability. A clinical trial involving 52 participants in the community has shown that smartphone-based CBT was not inferior to computer-based CBT at 3-month follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Given the vast number of patients with depression and the still very limited accessibility of effective CBT for them, it will be very meaningful and helpful to develop a CBT program taking advantage of this rapidly evolving ICT. In the present study, we aim to examine the effectiveness of adding a smartphone-based CBT program to switching antidepressants in comparison to that of switching antidepressants alone, for patients still suffering from depression after adequate antidepressant treatment. Among antidepressants, a systematic review and multiple-treatment meta-analysis evaluating the comparative efficacy of 12 newer antidepressants has suggested that escitalopram and sertraline are the most favorable in terms of efficacy and acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We aim to examine the effectiveness of switching from the previous antidepressant to escitalopram or sertraline and starting a smartphone-based CBT program at the same time, in comparison to switching to escitalopram or sertraline only, among patients still suffering from depression after adequate antidepressant treatment. We hypothesized that adding a smartphone-based CBT program to switching antidepressants could lead to greater improvement in depression symptoms among patients with treatment-refractory depression than switching antidepressants alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>A multi-center, parallel-arm, rater-blinded RCT has been planned.

The primary outcome is the slope of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) through 0 to 9&#x000a0;weeks. The secondary outcomes include the slope of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) through 0 to 9&#x000a0;weeks; treatment satisfaction at 9&#x000a0;weeks; continuation of antidepressant pharmacotherapy up to 9&#x000a0;weeks; and the slope of the Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER) through 0 to 9&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Smartphone-based CBT program: &#x0201c;Kokoro-App&#x0201d;</title><p>The smartphone-based CBT program the &#x0201c;Kokoro-App&#x0201d; for iPhones and iPads (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) has been developed, based on an empirically supported CBT manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and pilot tested for feasibility and acceptability.

Participants will be informed that they can withdraw their consent at any time without stating the reason and that their withdrawal will not affect the medical services they receive. The written informed consent will be obtained along with the mobile phone number of the participant, with which the central trial office can contact him or her to assess the outcomes.</p><p>Immediately after consent, all participants will install the Kokoro-App onto his or her smartphone with an assistance of the site CRC. After successful installation, the server will provide a password specific to each participant via an Email to the participant. The participant will be able to proceed to the introductory section of the Kokoro-App by entering the password. In the introduction, the participant will practice entering some sentences into the smartphone and fill in a self-report measure of psychological distress (K6). All participants will receive an interview using the PHQ-9 and the FIBSER at the clinic via telephone from the central trial office.</p><p>The attending physician of the participant will start switching the previous antidepressant at week 0 to either 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mg/day of escitalopram or 25&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg/day of sertraline. The patient will take escitalopram if he or she has taken sertraline for the current episode, and vice versa. If the patient has taken neither escitalopram nor sertraline for the current episode, one of these two will be selected by the attending physician. The maximum dosage of escitalopram was set at 10&#x000a0;mg/day because: 1) the efficacy of 20&#x000a0;mg/day of escitalopram has not been proved to be superior to that of 10&#x000a0;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; 2) the tolerability of the former has been proved to be inferior to that of the latter in terms of dropout rates due to side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; and 3) a dose response has been reported between dosage of escitalopram and prolonged QT interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

At week 1, the participant will receive an electrocardiogram and an interview, using the PHQ-9 and the FIBSER, via telephone from the central trial office. Based on these results, the participant will be classified into either of the following two groups: A) primary comparison set: those who have not responded or only partially responded to escitalopram or sertraline (defined by the total score of the PHQ-9 of 5 or more at week 1), are tolerant to escitalopram or sertraline (defined by item 1 of the FIBSER of 3 or more and items 3 and 4 of 3 or less at week 1, which means that the participant has been able to take the antidepressant for 3&#x000a0;days or more and the intensity and the interference with daily functions due to side effects of the medication is mild or less), and have no problems in using the smartphones and the Kokoro-App; B) secondary comparison set: those who have not satisfied any of the above criteria.</p><p>Within each group, the participants will be randomly allocated to either the combined smartphone-based CBT and antidepressant switch group (intervention group) or the antidepressant switch alone group (control group) at 1:1 ratio with a minimization method using the electronic data-capturing web program (EDC) at the central trial office. Random allocation will, therefore, be concealed. Clinics, number of antidepressants previously prescribed for the index episode (3 or more versus 2 or less), and a total score of the PHQ-9 (10 or more versus 9 or less) at week 1 will be used as stratification variables.</p><p>If the participant is allocated to the intervention group, he or she will be provided with a password to proceed to Session 1 of the Kokoro-App. If the participant is allocated to the control group, he or she will be informed that the Kokoro-App can be resumed if the participant is willing to do so after week 9.</p><p>With regard to antidepressants, if the participant is intolerant of escitalopram or sertraline prescribed at week 0 (defined by scores of 4 or more on either item 3 or 4 of FIBSER), the physician will suggest stopping the antidepressant and starting previous or new antidepressants other than escitalopram and sertraline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial period: from week 1 through week 9</title><p>For all the participants, an appointment with the attending physician will be scheduled at least every 4&#x000a0;weeks.

Considering the high dropout rate of computer-based CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], smartphone-based CBT may offer a more accessible option because patients can access it anywhere and anytime they have a chance and are willing to do so. Only fewer than 50&#x000a0;% of patients receiving acute-phase antidepressant treatment can achieve remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], so that easily accessible CBT may offer some additional benefits in the treatment of depression. The present study focuses on patients with antidepressant-resistant depression, so that targeted population may be those in most need. If the efficacy of a smartphone-based CBT program in this population is confirmed, applicability of the program in real clinical settings is quite promising.</p><p>The present study is, however, not without some methodological limitations. First of all, not all patients who are interested in and willing to do the Kokoro-App have a smartphone. This may undermine the applicability of the results from this trial to all patients with antidepressant-resistant depression. Especially, the results might not be applicable to patients in developing countries and to patients with poor ICT literacy.</p><p>Second, we selected a wait-list control as the comparator due to the feasibility and ethical considerations, but the nocebo effects of the latter condition can play an important role in the estimation of the efficacy of the smartphone-based CBT. In a network meta-analysis of CBTs, waiting-list controls and no treatment controls, the odds ratio of response for no treatment over waiting-list was statistically significant at 2.9 (95&#x000a0;% CI: 1.3 to 5.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, in the present trial we planned to switch a previous antidepressant treatment to a newer drug for each patient (e.g., sertraline or escitalopram) for all participants at entry to the study, thus raising expectation across the intervention and control arms. This might lead to decreasing nocebo effects of the waiting-list control.</p><p>Third, one may consider that results from the primary comparison set are those of an efficacy trial not of an effectiveness trial, because we would only include patients who are able to tolerate the trial antidepressant for 1&#x000a0;week and are accustomed to using a smartphone. This decision was made a priori because the trial is the first one of this kind. However, we will include patients who had failed to meet these conditions in our secondary comparison set, and results from these analyses can be utilized in future effectiveness trials.</p><p>Fourth, although the effect size of 0.5 used for calculation of sample sizes was estimated from results of the previous studies on the efficacy of computer or Internet-based CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], one may think that the effect size is too optimistic because the present study focuses on patients with treatment-refractory depression. In addition, a majority of the control conditions used in trials included in previous systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were waiting-list, which might have led to plausibly large effect sizes. However, our previous clinical trial comparing the efficacy of a telephone-based CBT program added to the employee assistance program with that of the latter alone showed an effect size of 0.69 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The smartphone-based CBT program in the present study was based on this telephone-based program, and we considered that the estimated effect size of 0.5 in the present study was reasonable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Trial status</title><p>The randomized trial, which commenced in September 2014, is currently in the phase of participant enrollment and follow up.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BDI-II</term><def><p>Beck Depression Inventory-II</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRC</term><def><p>Clinical research coordinator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive-behavior therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM</term><def><p>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSMB</term><def><p>Data and Safety Monitoring Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDC</term><def><p>Electronic data capturing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FIBSER</term><def><p>Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICT</term><def><p>Information and communication technology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHQ-9</term><def><p>Patient Health Questionnaire-9</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRIME-MD</term><def><p>Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QTc</term><def><p>Heart-rate corrected QT interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIADH</term><def><p>Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSL</term><def><p>Secure Sockets Layer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Norio Watanabe and Toshi A.
