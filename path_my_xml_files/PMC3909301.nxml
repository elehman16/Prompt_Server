The following new results are reported: cause-specific first and recurrent cardiovascular hospital admissions including myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, coronary revascularization and angiography; non-cardiovascular hospitalization; days in hospital; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); costs of pravastatin treatment, treatment safety monitoring, and hospital admissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Five years treatment of 1000 patients with pravastatin (40 mg/day) saved the NHS &#x000a3;710 000 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), including the cost of pravastatin and lipid and safety monitoring, and gained 136 QALYs (<italic>P</italic> = 0.017) over the 15-year period. Benefits per 1000 subjects, attributable to prevention of cardiovascular events, included 163 fewer admissions and a saving of 1836 days in hospital, with fewer admissions for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and coronary revascularization.

Here, we have analysed in detail healthcare resource utilization (cause-specific hospital admissions, length of stay and need for coronary investigations, procedures and operations), with the consequent impact on the quality of life, additional healthcare costs resulting from a change in disease status after a hospital admission (referred to herein as &#x02018;incremental costs of events&#x02019;) and cost effectiveness. We focussed on cardiovascular admissions involving myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary angiography, any coronary cause (including CABG, PCI, or coronary angiography), and heart failure. Myocardial infarction and stroke events were considered outcomes whether or not they were the reason for admission. Other coronary or heart failure codes had to be the primary discharge diagnosis to be counted. Each admission could be represented more than once across the various outcomes. For the length of stay and cost of the acute admissions, each continuous period of in-patient stay was categorized under the most significant included event, defined hierarchically as a stroke if the period of stay involved a stroke, otherwise as a myocardial infarction, otherwise as heart failure, and otherwise as a coronary event if it involved another coronary reason. The composite of these hospitalizations is described as cardiovascular. Other hospitalizations are classed as non-cardiovascular. Because of recent concerns about increased incidence of diabetes in statin-treated individuals, we specifically identified hospitalizations where diabetes or its complications was given as the reason for admission or as a complicating factor. Because of the reduction in cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with statin use, we analysed diabetes-related admissions overall and within hospital admissions with non-cardiovascular causes.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Cumulative incidence functions, accounting for the competing risk of death from other causes, were used to describe the incidence of events. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models were fitted including the treatment group and baseline risk factors as described previously<sup><xref rid="EHT232C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> [age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, log-transformed triglyceride level, nitrate use, history of angina, history of diabetes, history of hypertension (all yes or no), smoking status (current, former, never), and a social deprivation score].<sup><xref rid="EHT232C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Effects of randomized treatment assignment (pravastatin versus placebo) were expressed as HRs with 95% confidence intervals and corresponding <italic>P</italic> values. Although it was plausible that the proportional-hazards assumption would not be valid over the full period of follow-up, we concluded that the estimated HRs would still reflect an average effect over the period.</p><p>For the hierarchical groupings of continuous periods of hospital stay, total days of admission and lengths of stay for those admitted to hospital were compared between treatment groups using re-randomization <italic>t</italic>-tests. Re-randomization <italic>t</italic>-tests were used as a precaution because of the highly non-Normal distribution of these data, particularly the large numbers of zero values.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>We evaluated the costs and benefits of the initial 5 years treatment with pravastatin over the full available follow-up period of &#x0223c;15 years in a cost-utility analysis, as this allows a comparison with other uses of health care resources. We used the perspective of the NHS for costs and savings, and health benefits [measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the follow-up period of 15 years] for patients; this is consistent with health technology assessments carried out by NICE.</p><p>NHS Scotland staff, blinded to randomized treatment, assigned Health Resource Grouping codes to each acute hospital episode, to enable costing with NHS Scotland Tariff costs.<sup><xref rid="EHT232C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We used current (2012) costs of &#x000a3;9.07<sup><xref rid="EHT232C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> for a 3-month prescription for 40 mg pravastatin and calculated drug costs from the months of pravastatin used in the trial. In the post-trial period, the 3% excess of statin treatment in the pravastatin group was extrapolated throughout the follow-up. We assumed two liver function and cholesterol tests at the initial consultation, repeated annually whilst on statin treatment (&#x000a3;1.34/test, plus &#x000a3;31 for the initial doctor consultation and &#x000a3;10/annum for nurse consultations).</p><p><italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHT232TB1">1</xref></italic> shows the incremental costs of events for care after discharge from hospital and was based on a previous Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report<sup><xref rid="EHT232C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and updated to 2011 costs using the Hospital and Community Health Services Index.<sup><xref rid="EHT232C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The incremental costs of events reflect out-patient follow-up, primary and community services and reduce after the first year.

Here, the added cost per 1000 patients was &#x000a3;112 000, and the added cost per QALY gained (&#x000a3;112 000/136) was &#x000a3;824.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cardiovascular effects</title><p>We have significantly extended the results reported previously that show that 5 years of treatment with a statin, in middle-aged hypercholesterolaemic men without a history of myocardial infarction, leads to long-term benefit by reducing coronary and all-cause death and coronary events. The current analysis of health care resource utilization indicated that these benefits were accompanied by a reduction in the risk of a first hospital admission for a cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and hospitalizations involving PCI, CABG, or angiography or any other coronary cause). Recurrent cardiovascular events of all such types were reduced with substantially fewer days spent in hospital. To put this in perspective, we estimate that treatment of 1000 WOSCOPS-eligible patients for 5 years would prevent 163 cardiovascular inpatient stays (involving 1836 days in hospital), including 35 myocardial infarctions, 11 strokes, 17 heart failure admissions, and 100 involving other aspects of coronary heart disease (including 14 PCIs, 17 CABGs, and 35 coronary angiograms), over a period of 15 years. The resulting acute cardiovascular hospitalization savings (per 1000 treated with pravastatin) to the NHS are estimated to be &#x000a3;771 881 with additional healthcare costs savings of &#x000a3;388 199, all at a cost of &#x000a3;219 283 for pravastatin treatment (at 2012 prices) and monitoring costs (undiscounted figures), giving the net undiscounted savings of &#x000a3;941 397.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Non-cardiovascular effects</title><p>We found no evidence of any increase in hospitalization for non-cardiovascular causes, or in the associated costs.

After discounting, there was a net saving to the NHS over 15 years with an associated gain of QALYs. Analysis of subgroups according to the baseline risk did not identify heterogeneity of these effects across subgroups. The suggestion of longer-term benefits in preventing strokes and heart failure admissions is interesting, possibly as a consequence of preventing earlier coronary events and slowing disease progression and hints at the potential for even greater cost savings and better quality of life in the pravastatin-allocated group with longer follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Results in a broader context</title><p>Interest in the cost-effectiveness of statin treatment, particularly in the primary prevention context, shows no signs of waning. Our analysis adds to existing knowledge in two ways.</p><p>First, previous analyses have focussed on model-based extrapolations from trial results, and none had access to actual long-term follow-up data. In WOSCOPS, we had the opportunity to link electronically to comprehensive national databases of hospital discharges and deaths, providing information on estimated costs and benefits over a meaningful period of time, and we were able to derive evidence of cost savings and patient benefits without extrapolating results into very old ages where the complexities of multi-morbidity make typical unvalidated modelling assumptions open to question. Second, our analyses suggest that statins are even more cost-effective in primary prevention than had previously been suspected. While most economic evaluations have concluded that the cost per QALY is within acceptable limits, previous evaluations have not suggested that statin prescribing in this patient group could be cost saving. This, in combination with our risk-based sub-group analyses, raises the prospect that statin treatment could be cost saving at lower levels of risk than was previously suspected.</p><p>For example, a previous WOSCOPS economic evaluation,<sup><xref rid="EHT232C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> based on a model that extrapolated lifetime benefits only via the prevention of within-trial coronary events, estimated an added cost per life-year gain of &#x000a3;20 375 (1996 prices), which is a much less favourable estimate than that indicated in our current analysis. More recently, an economic evaluation in a low-risk population,<sup><xref rid="EHT232C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> was based on a review of trial and Canadian registry data. In a &#x02018;low-potency statin&#x02019; versus &#x02018;no statin&#x02019; comparison, the authors predicted an added cost per QALY of Can$30 000 (about &#x000a3;20 000) using a lifetime perspective; low risk was defined as a 10-year risk of &#x02264;20% for cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI. For this type of endpoint, the WOSCOPS 10-year placebo risk is 12.8% overall and 7.7, 10.8, and 20.0% in our low-, medium- and high-risk subgroups defined by baseline ASSIGN risk. Their QALY estimates were similar to ours. The difference between our results and those of the Canadian registry study is in the hospital admissions and consequent savings from reducing these over time: the actual rates in our data are much more favourable to statin treatment.</p><p>Our results are based on the treatment with pravastatin 40 mg, a drug that is well tolerated but is recognized as being less potent than widely used agents such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. It is likely that more potent statins, particularly at higher doses, would confer greater benefits in reducing the cardiovascular risk. However, there are safety issues associated with using more potent statins at the highest doses, and higher doses of statins have been linked recently with an increased risk of new-onset diabetes.<sup><xref rid="EHT232C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In the context of treating younger, lower risk individuals with a statin for a lifetime, the drive to improve a patient's cardiovascular risk profile would have to be balanced against issues of tolerability and safety. In WOSCOPS we have reported previously a lower rate of new-onset diabetes in the participants randomized to pravastatin over the 5 years of randomized treatment.<sup><xref rid="EHT232C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The meta-analysis of incident diabetes risk in statin trials,<sup><xref rid="EHT232C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> although suggesting a modest overall increase in the risk of diabetes with statin treatment, also suggested an interaction with participant age, with oldest participants having the greatest increase in the risk of diabetes on statin treatment. WOSCOPS participants had the lowest mean age in the meta-analysis. In combination with the fact that we found no suggestion of an increase in diabetes-associated hospital admissions over 15 years of follow-up, we believe that this evidence provides reassurance about the long-term safety of treating middle-aged subjects for 5 years with pravastatin at a dose of 40 mg.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Limitations of our analysis</title><p>While there are undoubted strengths in our approach, there are also limitations. Our follow-up spans a period during which the management of cardiovascular events (e.g. the increase in use of coronary revascularization) and even event definitions (myocardial infarction) changed. We have avoided the issue of trends in hospital length of stay by using a cost per event reflecting current practice in many countries. Record linkage is subject to error, and there is a possibility that some events have been missed and some wrongly assigned and that coding variation may have mis-assigned reasons for admission. However, we believe that these issues are minor and if anything would add noise and serve only to reduce any treatment effects detected. In any case, these factors will apply equally to both treatment arms. WOSCOPS patients have not all been followed up to death and hence we cannot, without extrapolation, project to lifetime benefits. Nevertheless, it is all the more remarkable that we were able to demonstrate cost savings over a finite time period. In fact, this could be seen as an advantage as we avoid the need for extrapolating benefits to the complex situation at the end of life in the very old. While the events, hospital admissions, and deaths are observed, we had to estimate costs and quality-of-life impacts retrospectively. For acute costs, we selected national tariff rates and for utilities and incremental costs of events from a previously published independent health technology assessment report. We also subjected these assumptions to sensitivity analysis and have shown that if the figures are changed by 25% in a direction that reduces the cost-effectiveness of statin prescribing then our conclusions would be unchanged. Although an increase in the costs of pravastatin treatment and monitoring by a factor of 5 removed the cost savings in our analysis, this scenario is particularly unlikely given the fact that monitoring of patients is much less common in practice than we have assumed in the model and likely to become even less so because of recent FDA advice not to carry out long-term routine liver function monitoring. Our sub-group analysis by baseline risk is possibly underpowered. Nevertheless, if anything, there was a trend to greater cardiovascular cost savings in the lowest risk subjects.</p><p>Finally, our findings are limited to randomized allocation to placebo or pravastatin over 5 years. It seems inevitable that longer treatment with a statin, for instance lifetime treatment, which would be normal clinical practice, would yield greater cardiovascular health gains. However, we cannot say with certainty that this would be more cost-effective. In addition, although in this population of middle-aged men treated with pravastatin 40 mg/day, we found no evidence of increased risk of diabetes within the trial or of risk of hospital admission associated with diabetes or its complications in the 15 years of follow-up, we cannot extrapolate these safety findings to patients treated for much longer periods.

Quality adjusted life years lived were significantly increased. There was no evidence of any increase in non-cardiovascular admissions or associated costs. These effects, seen across a range of underlying cardiovascular risks, suggest that treatment of even lower-risk individuals would still be economically efficient and deliver significant public health benefits. Our results add to and support a recent call for expanded use of statins.<sup><xref rid="EHT232C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, there remains uncertainty in relation to the potential for increased risk of diabetes with treatment of more than 5 years duration.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>I.F. obtained funding.

analyses. Estimated difference (pravastatin&#x02014;placebo, with 95% CI) between those originally randomized to receive pravastatin or placebo for the cumulative mean costs (per 1000 people treated) and QALYs after 15 years, under alternative scenarios. Costs include all cardiovascular hospitalizations and associated additional healthcare costs, plus pravastatin treatment and monitoring costs. Alternative scenarios are: hospitalization costs &#x000b1;25%; additional healthcare costs &#x000b1;25%; 50% reduction; and two- and five-fold increase in treatment/monitoring costs; QALY decrements &#x000b1;25%. All costs and QALY decrements are discounted at 3.5%. Costs are given in units of &#x000a3;1 million.
