<bold>Background</bold>
&#x02003;The open preperitoneal repair offers the benefits of placing the mesh in the preferred position while avoiding the disadvantages of laparoscopic repair.
</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>
&#x02003;A total of 60 patients with bilateral inguinal hernias were randomized to undergo either the standard Lichtenstein meshplasty or the modified iliopubic tract repair in a teaching hospital. Outcomes measured were immediate postoperative pain, return to activity, and delayed neurological complications.
</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>
&#x02003;Patients who underwent the iliopubic tract repair walked out of bed faster than the Lichtenstein group (6.3 hours vs 7.4 hours,
<italic>p</italic>
&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and experienced significant lower pain as charted by visual analogue scale scores (3.28 vs 2.71 on day 1, 2.16 vs 1.71 on day 2, 1.92 vs 1.08 on day 3;
<italic>p</italic>
&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Delayed complications like chronic inguinal pain and numbness were not seen in the iliopubic tract group. However, this difference was not statistically significant (

</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion</bold>
&#x02003;The iliopubic tract repair offers an excellent alternative to the Lichtenstein meshplasty, and is associated with lower postoperative pain, earlier return to work, and lower delayed neurological complications.

A few surgical conditions can boast of such a multitude of management options as inguinal hernias. The surgeon of today has a vast range of surgical techniques at his disposal, ranging from anatomical repairs to the modern laparoscopic repairs. Among these, the modified Lichtenstein meshplasty remains the most popular. This popularity can be attributed to its ease of learning, safety, and low recurrence rates.
<xref rid="JR1700065oa-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p><p>
This technique is not without its drawbacks. Postoperative pain, numbness, and chronic groin pain continue to plague patients following meshplasty. The former can be attributed to the greater number of nerves encountered during the anterior approach used in the Lichtenstein technique.
<xref rid="JR1700065oa-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
These complications are magnified in cases of bilateral and recurrent inguinal hernias. The difficult anatomy encountered in cases of recurrent hernias raises the need for extensive and complicated dissection, which consequently increases rates of postoperative complications. This highlights the need to consider other surgical techniques when faced with bilateral or recurrent inguinal hernias.
</p><p>
The open preperitoneal approach has the advantage of placing the mesh in the preferred location, namely, the preperitoneal space, while eschewing the problems associated with laparoscopy.
<xref rid="JR1700065oa-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
This approach also minimizes dissection in the inguinal canal, resulting in lesser manipulation of inguinal nerves and potential damage to the vital structures, as well as the other complications of operating in a nonvirgin field.

Patients in Group B underwent the modified iliopubic tract repair, wherein the preperitoneal space was accessed using a lower midline incision, extending from below the umbilicus to the pubic symphysis. The hernia sac was then identified. In case of indirect inguinal hernia, the sac was ligated and divided at the level of the deep ring, with the distal part of the sac remaining within the canal. In case of a direct hernia, the sac was inverted with a running purse-string suture. Repair was then done by approximating the arching fibers of the transversalis fascia superiorly to the iliopubic tract (
<xref rid="FI1700065oa-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
) inferiorly with interrupted Prolene sutures (
<xref rid="FI1700065oa-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
). A small mesh (3&#x0201d;x 6&#x0201d; lightweight Prolene mesh cut in half) was then sutured placed over the repair, and secured superiorly to the transversalis arch, and inferiorly to the pectineal ligament, thus eliminating possibility of future femoral hernias as well (
<xref rid="FI1700065oa-3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>
). The contralateral hernia was similarly repaired through the same incision. The incision was then closed in layers over a suction drain.

It would be technically simple to perform, and easy to learn, would have a low rate of complications and recurrence, and would require only a short period of convalescence.</p><p>Most modern studies compare the standard Lichtenstein meshplasty to laparoscopic techniques, and few directly compare it to open preperitoneal methods. This makes it difficult to assess the impact of the posterior approach itself in the surgical outcome, factoring in the minimal trauma caused by laparoscopic methods. The present study design makes it possible to directly study the role of the posterior approach alone in outcome of hernia repair by comparing it to the current gold standard.</p><p>
The results can vary widely among different centers, and the results from specialized centers are often good. For example, very low recurrence rates have been reported from the Shouldice Hospital using their eponymous technique, even &#x0003c;1%,
<xref rid="JR1700065oa-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
with some authors suggesting it be used as a gold standard when evaluating new herniorrhaphy techniques.
<xref rid="JR1700065oa-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
However, there exists a steep learning curve for the technique,
<xref rid="JR1700065oa-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
which has resulted in other centers failing to reproduce the Shouldice Hospital's stellar recurrence rates.
<xref rid="JR1700065oa-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
Our study was conducted in a general surgical teaching center, which far better mimics clinical reality.
</p><p>The Nyhus repair is considered the standard open preperitoneal repair. Our study focused on our modification of the same, tailored specifically to bilateral inguinal hernias. This choice was also relevant as it considered the cost of the repair, which is sensitive in a developing country like ours.</p><p>
The iliopubic tract repair showed significantly shorter time taken to walk out of bed among patients as compared with the Lichtenstein meshplasty (6.33 hours vs 7.4 hours). Multiple studies also demonstrated the same, clearly giving the open preperitoneal approach the advantage.

Lower pain in the iliopubic tract group might probably explain the same.
</p><p>The most significant advantage for the iliopubic tract group was in terms of postoperative pain. Mean VAS scores for the iliopubic tract repair group following surgery were significant lower than those for the Lichtenstein group in the immediate postoperative period, until the third postoperative day (3.28 vs 2.71 on day 1, 2.16 vs 1.81 on day 2, 1.92 vs 1.08 on day 3). Mean VAS scores showed no statistical difference toward the end of day 4 and on day 5.</p><p>
Postoperative pain following hernia repair has extensively been studied, and most reports show a distinct advantage with the posterior preperitoneal approach, as employed by the iliopubic tract repair. A meta-analysis of over 500 patients showed significantly higher pain following Lichtenstein repair as compared with preperitoneal repair.
<xref rid="JR1700065oa-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
Other studies by Liu et al, Koning et al, Nienhuijs et al, Ray et al, and Sajid et al also found significantly lower pain scores in patients following open preperitoneal repair as compared with the Lichtenstein meshplasty.

</p><p>Late complications are a bane of hernia repair. Our study assessed patients for groin numbness, chronic pain, recurrence, and late infection at 3 monthly intervals for a maximum period of 2 years. Long-term pain was measured based on a history of analgesic use, and restriction of daily activities. While other indices are available, we found their application difficult with our patients, who mostly are illiterate and come from poor backgrounds. Late complications were encountered more in the Lichtenstein group, with five patients reporting numbness, one each reporting chronic groin pain and recurrence. None of the patients who underwent the iliopubic tract repair suffered any delayed complication. However, this was not statistically significant, and a more extensive study would be required to confirm statistical advantage.</p><p>
Our findings, however, were in contrast to others, who have reported significantly higher rates of groin numbness and chronic inguinal pain among patients undergoing the Lichtenstein meshplasty as compared with preperitoneal repairs. It has been postulated that this may be due to the greater chances of nerve damage in the anterior approach employed by the Lichtenstein repair.

Immediate postoperative complications were on par with the high standards set by the Lichtenstein meshplasty.</p><p>For surgeons who prefer an open approach, the modified iliopubic tract repair is a stellar alternative to the Lichtenstein meshplasty, especially for bilateral and recurrent hernias.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="d30e142" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="JR1700065oa-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Paajanen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Varjo</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ten-year audit of Lichtenstein hernioplasty under local anaesthesia performed by surgical residents</article-title><source>BMC Surg</source><year>2010</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>24</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20684783</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="JR1700065oa-2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nienhuijs</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Staal</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Keemers-Gels</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosman</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Strobbe</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pain after open preperitoneal repair versus Lichtenstein repair: a randomized trial</article-title><source>World J Surg</source><year>2007</year><volume>31</volume><issue>09</issue><fpage>1751</fpage><lpage>1757</lpage>, discussion 1758&#x02013;1759<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17510766</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="JR1700065oa-3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beets</surname><given-names>G L</given-names></name><name><surname>Oosterhuis</surname><given-names>K J</given-names></name><name><surname>Go</surname><given-names>P M</given-names></name><name><surname>Baeten</surname><given-names>C G</given-names></name><name><surname>Kootstra</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Longterm followup (12-15 years) of a randomized controlled trial comparing Bassini-Stetten, Shouldice, and high ligation with narrowing of the internal ring for primary inguinal hernia repair</article-title><source>J Am Coll Surg</source><year>1997</year><volume>185</volume><issue>04</issue><fpage>352</fpage><lpage>357</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9328383</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="JR1700065oa-4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>J-M</given-names></name><name><surname>Boudet</surname><given-names>M-J</given-names></name><name><surname>Fingerhut</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><etal/><article-title>Shouldice inguinal hernia repair in the male adult: the gold standard?
