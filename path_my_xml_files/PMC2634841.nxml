Body composition (DXA) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) over 14-days by doubly labeled water (DLW) and activity related energy activity (AREE) were measured after 3 (M3) and 6 (M6) months of intervention. Weight changes at M6 were &#x02212;1.0&#x000b1;1.1&#x00025; (Control), &#x02212;10.4&#x000b1;0.9&#x00025; (CR), &#x02212;10.0&#x000b1;0.8&#x00025; (CR&#x0002b;EX) and &#x02212;13.9&#x000b1;0.8&#x00025; (LCD). At M3, absolute TDEE was significantly reduced in CR (&#x02212;454&#x000b1;76 kcal/d) and LCD (&#x02212;633&#x000b1;66 kcal/d) but not in CR&#x0002b;EX or controls. At M6 the reduction in TDEE remained lower than baseline in CR (&#x02212;316&#x000b1;118 kcal/d) and LCD (&#x02212;389&#x000b1;124 kcal/d) but reached significance only when CR and LCD were combined (&#x02212;351&#x000b1;83 kcal/d). In response to caloric restriction (CR/LCD combined), TDEE adjusted for body composition, was significantly lower by &#x02212;431&#x000b1;51 and &#x02212;240&#x000b1;83 kcal/d at M3 and M6, respectively, indicating a metabolic adaptation. Likewise, physical activity (TDEE adjusted for sleeping metabolic rate) was significantly reduced from baseline at both time points. For control and CR&#x0002b;EX, adjusted TDEE (body composition or sleeping metabolic rate) was not changed at either M3 or M6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>For the first time we show that in free-living conditions, CR results in a metabolic adaptation and a behavioral adaptation with decreased physical activity levels. These data also suggest potential mechanisms by which CR causes large inter-individual variability in the rates of weight loss and how exercise may influence weight loss and weight loss maintenance.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00099151?idNCT00099151&#x00026;rank1">NCT00099151</ext-link>

Respiratory chambers enable the measurement of sleeping metabolic rate, the energy cost of arousal, the thermic effect of food and the energy cost of spontaneous physical activity <xref rid="pone.0004377-Ravussin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However the confined space within a respiratory chamber compromises the level of habitual and/or voluntary physical activity. Activity thermogenesis is the most variable component of daily energy expenditure and includes energy expended during both voluntary physical activity and all other non-exercise activities <xref rid="pone.0004377-Zurlo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The latter, recently termed NEAT (<underline>n</underline>on-<underline>e</underline>xercise <underline>a</underline>ctivity <underline>t</underline>hermogenesis) includes the energy cost of sitting, fidgeting, maintaining posture, muscle tone and leisure activities such as playing guitar and shopping etc <xref rid="pone.0004377-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Caloric restriction (CR) is the most robust non-pharmacological intervention known to increase maximum lifespan. One of the most popular proposed theories by which CR promotes lifespan extension is the rate of living theory <xref rid="pone.0004377-Sacher1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We hypothesized that caloric restriction will reduce energy metabolism in excess of the loss of metabolic mass (metabolic adaption) and therefore will reduce oxidative damage to tissues and organs by lowering the production rates of reactive oxygen species <xref rid="pone.0004377-Sohal1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. CR is indeed associated with robust decreases in energy metabolism, including a lowering of resting metabolic rate (or sleeping metabolic rate), reduced thermic effect of meals and a decrease in the energy cost and/or the level of physical activity. However, it is debated whether or not the decrease in total energy expenditure is proportional (or larger; metabolic adaptation) to the loss of metabolic tissues (fat-free and fat mass: FFM and FM). Furthermore, it is not clear if the metabolic adaptation persists once a new stable body weight is reached. Previously we reported that both 24-hour sedentary energy expenditure and sleeping metabolic rate measured in a respiratory chamber were reduced &#x0223c;6&#x00025; beyond what was expected for the loss of metabolic mass (FFM and FM) <xref rid="pone.0004377-Heilbronn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This metabolic adaptation was also observed in RMR measured by a ventilated hood indirect calorimeter <xref rid="pone.0004377-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A portion of the reduction in sedentary energy expenditure was due to the reduced energy intake itself (thermic effect of food), and a reduction in the energy cost of spontaneous physical activity. The majority however, was due to the decline in the size of the metabolizing mass and a lowering of the rate of metabolism per mass unit of tissues and organs.</p><p>Essential to the study of the changes in energy expenditure with CR is an objective assessment of physical activity. Not only is the contribution of physical activity to daily energy expenditure quite variable, it is also likely that in an attempt to conserve energy during CR, individuals volitionally or non-volitionally decrease their level of physical activity <xref rid="pone.0004377-Keys1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In our study of 25&#x00025; CR in overweight humans, we observed no change in spontaneous physical activity in a respiratory chamber <xref rid="pone.0004377-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> consistent with earlier reports of no alterations in spontaneous physical activity <xref rid="pone.0004377-Ravussin2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> or posture allocation in obese individuals following weight loss <xref rid="pone.0004377-Levine2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These findings are not surprising if the current hypothesis that spontaneous physical activity is biologically determined and not altered by perturbations in body weight, is true <xref rid="pone.0004377-Zurlo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004377-Levine2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Combining the doubly labeled water method and indirect calorimetry allows us to disentangle sedentary metabolic adaptation from behavioral responses in physical activity. The objective of the current study therefore was to determine if CR induces a reduction in <underline>free-living</underline> energy expenditure that is larger than what can be explained by changes in body weight and body composition (i.e. metabolic adaptation). Furthermore we wished to examine whether CR induced a change in energy expended in physical activity <xref rid="pone.0004377-Heilbronn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. As a secondary analysis we determined if metabolic adaptation occurred only during weight loss or if it persisted after the lower body mass reached stability. We hypothesized that similar to sedentary energy expenditure, total daily energy expenditure would be reduced by CR partly due to metabolic adaptation and partly due to decreased physical activity. Such metabolic and behavioral adaptation can explain the variability in the rates of weight loss even in well controlled studies as well as the propensity of relapse after weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of Helsinki.

First the physical activity level (PAL) was calculated by the widely accepted method of dividing TDEE by SMR (PAL&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;TDEE/SMR). Because of the inherent problem of using ratios when the two variables have an intercept not equal to zero <xref rid="pone.0004377-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we also expressed physical activity as the residual value of the regression between measured TDEE and measured SMR <xref rid="pone.0004377-Frisard1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This value we termed Activity Related Energy Expenditure (AREE), is positive for subjects with higher physical activity than average and negative for subjects with lower physical activity than average independent of metabolic body size. Because AREE is adjusted for metabolic body size (SMR), this value is directly proportional to the amount of physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Psychological testing</title><p>Psychological testing included an assessment of health related quality of life.

Whether the decline in energy expenditure is equal or larger, than the reduction in metabolic mass is still debated. Several reports suggest that despite weight stability, the reduction in energy expenditure can be lower than one would expect for the new metabolic weight and composition <xref rid="pone.0004377-Leibel1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0004377-Rosenbaum2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This &#x02018;physiological adaptation&#x02019; is postulated to be an integral factor contributing to protection against excessive weight loss during caloric restriction and importantly predisposing to weight regain in post-obese individuals <xref rid="pone.0004377-Leibel2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It is unclear if only some or all, of the components of daily energy expenditure contribute to the disproportionate decline or &#x02018;adaptation&#x02019; in energy expenditure in response to caloric restriction. Additionally the role of exercise on the metabolic adjustments to CR interventions is not known.</p><p>Recently we reported a reduction in sedentary energy expenditure (24h-energy expenditure; 24h-EE) with 25&#x00025; CR that was 6&#x00025; lower than the change expected for the loss of metabolic tissues <xref rid="pone.0004377-Heilbronn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Now for the first time, we objectively characterized the response in all the components of daily energy expenditure to caloric restriction by combining doubly labeled water and indirect calorimetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004377-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In response to caloric restriction (CR/LCD) we observed a true metabolic adaptation at months 3 and 6 of the intervention. To exclude the contribution of sedentary energy expenditure (the largest component of daily energy expenditure), we adjusted TDEE for sedentary energy expenditure (24h-EE and SMR) and observed that measured TDEE was significantly less than predicted at both month 3 and month 6 of CR. Interestingly no metabolic adaptation was observed in CR&#x0002b;EX. Together, this data indicates that TDEE is reduced with caloric restriction and is likely the result of a metabolic adaptation in the sedentary state accompanied by a reduction in activity-related energy expenditure and reduced levels of physical activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004377-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, this study supports a &#x02018;metabolic adaptation&#x02019; in response to weight loss in humans and demonstrates for the first time a reduction in all components of daily energy expenditure with dietary-induced weight loss, including the level physical activity. Importantly, CR in combination with exercise (CR&#x0002b;EX) did not result in metabolic adaptation while inducing similar changes in body composition as with CR alone.</p><fig id="pone-0004377-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004377.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The effect of caloric restriction (CR, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12) on all components of daily energy expenditure (Top Panel).</title><p>Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is measured by doubly labeled water over a 2-week period whereas sedentary 24-h energy expenditure (24h-EE) is measured in a respiratory chamber.

It was estimated that reduced physical activity accounted for 58&#x00025; of the decreased total energy expenditure whereas RMR accounted for 32&#x00025; and the thermic effect of food for only 10&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0004377-James1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Studies in obese individuals have also reported a metabolic adaptation (measured by RMR adjusted for body composition) with weight loss <xref rid="pone.0004377-Fricker1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0004377-Vansant1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Furthermore, in other landmark studies, a 10&#x00025; weight loss in lean subjects <xref rid="pone.0004377-Leibel2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> resulted in a 10&#x02013;15&#x00025; lower energy requirement for weight maintenance even after adjustment for fat-free mass <xref rid="pone.0004377-Leibel2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004377-Rosenbaum2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. These adaptations in metabolic rate could be explained by an improved metabolic efficiency of the skeletal muscle or as also postulated, due to a reduction in physical activity with weight loss <xref rid="pone.0004377-Rosenbaum3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>The energy cost of physical activity is proportional to body weight. Therefore, this component of energy expenditure decreases with weight loss even in the absence of a reduction in physical activity. A decrease in spontaneous physical activity has been reported in some <xref rid="pone.0004377-deGroot1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> but not all weight loss studies <xref rid="pone.0004377-Ravussin2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004377-Levine2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004377-Leibel2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> including our own caloric restriction study <xref rid="pone.0004377-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. With regard to free-living energy expenditure, two studies of CR in non-obese humans suggest that after accounting for changes in body energy stores, a reduction in TDEE was partly due to lower levels of physical activity (PAL) or improved energy efficiency of physical activity at the new body weight and body composition <xref rid="pone.0004377-Heyman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004377-VelthuisteWierik1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our data supports the concept that in addition to the metabolic adaptation, reduced energy expenditure with CR is also due in part to lower physical activity level, i.e. a &#x0201c;behavioral adaptation&#x0201d;. Consistent with our study of CR, male rhesus monkeys undergoing 30&#x00025; CR had reduced physical activity in comparison to control animals after 1 year of CR <xref rid="pone.0004377-Kemnitz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Despite the observed decline in physical activity, self-assessed physical functioning by the quality of life measure (SF-36) was significantly improved in the CR group at month 3 and in all intervention groups at month 6. Physical functioning has been shown to be related to physical activity level <xref rid="pone.0004377-Frisard2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> therefore the observed reduction in physical activity in response to CR maybe an unconscious phenomenon used by individuals to conserve energy during energy deficit.</p><p>Interestingly, despite similar body mass and composition changes, CR in conjunction with exercise (CR&#x0002b;EX) did not result in a metabolic adaptation. If weight relapse does occur in part as a result of a reduced metabolic rate in the weight reduced state, then perhaps the combination of CR and exercise may be the best choice of intervention to prevent weight regain in overweight and obese individuals. Certainly, more than 20 years ago, Pavlou observed that exercise during a CR-induced weight loss program was essential for success of weight loss maintenance <xref rid="pone.0004377-Pavlou1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Since then others have shown with doubly labeled water studies that weight stability following weight loss is sustained by higher levels of activity related energy expenditure and free-living physical activity <xref rid="pone.0004377-Schoeller2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004377-Weinsier1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. To our knowledge no studies have prospectively studied the energetic adjustments of CR only versus CR in conjunction with exercise during weight loss and weight loss maintenance.</p><p>Whether or not an individual responds to weight loss with a metabolic adaptation has long-term importance for weight maintenance because there is recent data indicating that the metabolic adjustments occurring as a result of CR and weight loss are maintained for up to 6 years following the weight loss <xref rid="pone.0004377-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. As an alternative hypothesis it would be reasonable to assume two metabolic phases occur in response to CR; an &#x02018;adaptive phase&#x02019; when energy expenditure is adjusting to compensate for the reduced availability of energy sources, followed by a &#x02018;maintenance phase&#x02019; when energy balance has been re-established and the metabolic and behavioral compensations are therefore complete <xref rid="pone.0004377-Weinsier2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The individual group data for CR and LCD in our study may support this viewpoint since we observed a metabolic adaptation early (M3) but a return towards baseline values after an additional 3 months (M6) of weight loss (CR) or weight stability (LCD). We could also conclude that failure to detect a statistically significant adaptation at month 6 however, may be due to limitations in sample size. Considering our sample size of 12 in CR, and the observed mean change in TDEE at 6 months (CR group) adjusted for changes in FFM and FM (&#x02212;209&#x000b1;114 kcal/d), we would have required 22 volunteers to detect a significant change from baseline with 80&#x00025; power. This is probably why we did observe a significant metabolic adaptation at both 3 and 6 months of intervention when combining the CR and LCD groups.</p><p>In this study, we combined two state of the art methods (indirect calorimetry and doubly labeled water) for quantifying precisely the complete energy expenditure response to caloric restriction in non-obese individuals. We identified reduction in sedentary energy expenditure that was 6&#x00025; larger than what could be accounted for by the loss in metabolic size <xref rid="pone.0004377-Heilbronn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, i.e. a &#x02018;metabolic adaptation&#x02019;. This report provides further evidence that a metabolic adaptation in response to CR can be found in the free-living situation as well. This adaptation comprises not only a reduction in cellular respiration (energy cost of maintaining cells, organs and tissue alive) but also a decrease in free-living activity thermogenesis. These observations are of importance to understand the progressive resistance to weight loss seen in so many studies in which weight plateaus after 6&#x02013;12 months of caloric restriction despite self-declared adherence to a hypocaloric dietary prescription. Furthermore, our data shed some light on lifestyle change interventions that combining diet <underline>and</underline> physical activities are probably more successful in maintaining weight loss longer term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004377.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Consort checklist</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004377.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004377.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Study protocol</p><p>(0.36 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004377.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the remaining members of Pennington CALERIE Research Team including: Steven Smith, Enette Larson-Meyer, Steve Anton, Julia Volaufova, Marlene Most, Tuong Nguyen, Frank Greenway, Emily York-Crow, Catherine Champagne, Brenda Dahmer, Andy Deutsch, Paula Geiselman, Jennifer Howard, Jana Ihrig, Michael Lefevre, Darlene Marquis, Connie Murla, Anthony Alfonso, Sabrina Yang, Robbie Durand, Sean Owens, Aimee Stewart and Vanessa Tarver.
