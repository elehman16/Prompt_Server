Obesity can lead to metabolic syndrome, in which, an individual has a clustering of three or more of the following: hypertension, low HDL, hypertriglyceridemia, high fasting glucose, and abdominal obesity. Collectively, obesity has been implicated in reproductive dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus it is important to understand the mechanisms by which obesity impacts the reproductive axis.</p><p id="P7">We have previously shown that pituitary LH and FSH secretion is impaired in women with obesity (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Subjects with obesity had a reduction in mean serum LH and FSH, and LH pulse amplitude, compared to women of normal weight included as study controls, and a blunted pituitary response to exogenous gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These data imply that metabolic changes due to obesity result in a functional impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis at the level of the pituitary, impacting LH and FSH synthesis and/or secretion (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Numerous studies have implicated insulin and free fatty acids in the regulation of LH and FSH synthesis and secretion. However, results have often been contradictory and interpretations frequently are made in the context of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and/or frank type 2 diabetes. Elevated insulin levels have been shown to suppress LH in sheep (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) but appeared to have no effect in rhesus monkeys (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It is, however, difficult to separate effects of insulin from those of hypoglycemia in animal models in which insulin is infused. In hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp (HEC) studies of women, circulating LH levels are slightly reduced in women undergoing insulin infusion, as well as those with worsening insulin resistance (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In vitro studies are no more consistent. Insulin was found to stimulate LH and FSH release from cultured pituitary cells(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), while free fatty acid administration induced LH&#x003b2; mRNA but suppressed that of FSH&#x003b2; (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The latter study did not examine hormone release. To date, studies have not addressed the combinatorial effects of both insulin and triglycerides (TG)s/free fatty acids on gonadotropins under euglycemic conditions in metabolically healthy human subjects.</p><p id="P9">We hypothesized that the reproductive milieu of women with obesity includes both insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, and that both factors together might be responsible for the pituitary impairment we have observed in such women. We further hypothesized that if our notion were correct, we should be able to reproduce a similar reproductive defect in individuals characterized as healthy and non-obese by induction of insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. To test this hypothesis, we investigated serum LH and FSH profiles in women and men of non-obese weight, during a lipid or saline infusion in the presence or absence of hyperinsulinemia with euglycemia using a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp (HEC). We measured LH and FSH across the infusions to determine whether a short-term mimicking of the metabolic changes of interest (elevated lipids and hyperinsulinemia) impacted the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, inducing the impaired gonadotropin secretion that is characteristically observed in obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects" id="S7"><title>Participants</title><p id="P10">This study was performed as a secondary analysis of an ongoing study.

History, physical exam and laboratory testing confirmed good health status, defined as absence of exclusionary comorbid conditions including hypertension, pregnancy, impaired glucose tolerance (75g oral glucose tolerance test with 2hour glucose &#x02265;140mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (&#x02265;100mg/dl), overt diabetes, TG &#x0003e;250mg/dl, liver or kidney disease, pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory conditions, coagulopathy, anemia, abnormal cardiac function or evidence of ischemic heart disease. Additional exclusions included: use of medications known to impact insulin production or sensitivity, the presence of soy or egg allergies (due to possible reaction to the lipid infusate), any type of tobacco use, and use of any medications or supplements that would impact reproductive hormones, including systemic hormonal contraception. All women were premenopausal, with a history of regular menstrual cycles, and underwent study only during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Male participants were without reproductive complaints and not taking reproductive medications. Detailed sexual function information and genital examinations were not performed.

Heparin was co-administered with lipid infusion to enhance liberation of free fatty acids. Visits were at least one week apart and for women, restricted to days 5-10 of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle to control for potential confounding effects of the menstrual cycle on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Randomization of visit order was performed by Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) bioinformatics personnel using a CTRC randomization program and stratified by gender. All study visits were preceded by three days of a prescribed and provided diet (50% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 20% protein) during which time participants were required to abstain from moderate to vigorous exercise. Subjects were provided with breakfast at the time of infusion start. Breakfast composition was adjusted for the saline and lipid infusion visits such that cumulative morning caloric intake was constant across all visits. Blood samples, for measurement of hormones, were obtained at regular intervals, beginning immediately prior to the start of each 6-hour infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The combinatorial effect of the infusion of lipid plus insulin induced a 20% or greater reduction in LH secretion in both women and men, relative to saline-control. A similar pattern was observed with the administration of lipid plus insulin on FSH levels. Thus, the acute manipulation of the metabolic milieu created by lipid plus insulin significantly impaired net pituitary gonadotropin secretion in both sexes. Alternatively, gonadotropin clearance could have been increased by the intervention. However, we have previously shown that endogenous LH clearance does not differ by body size among normally cycling women, and others have reported a prolonged half-life of endogenous LH in women of obese BMI with PCOS (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These findings provide support for the notion that the metabolic challenges of obesity translate into circulating factors that adversely affect pituitary function, and support our previous findings that obesity related reproductive function is, at least in part, linked to pituitary dysfunction (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Effects of hyperinsulinemia on the pituitary gland are unclear, in part because it is not known whether or not the pituitary gland is capable of acquiring the characteristic insulin resistance observed in liver and muscle of individuals with obesity. Studies using the pituitary insulin receptor knockout (pitIRKO) mouse indicate that the pituitary likely remains insulin sensitive in the face of obesity and its metabolic challenges (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that excess insulin action in the pituitary, when exposed to increased free fatty acids, causes their rapid incorporation into the cell, thereby inducing a lipotoxic endoplasmic reticulum stress and induction of the unfolded protein response (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and pausing gonadotropin gene translation.</p><p id="P29">Although our sample size is too small to draw firm conclusions, these findings suggest a possible sexual dimorphism in HPG axis function between women and men when exposed to a high fat environment. Lipid infusion was associated with a short-term, but small, increase in testosterone in men, and a trend for a small decrease in estradiol in women. It is possible that the reduction in gonadotropins in males undergoing lipid plus insulin infusion may have been a result of negative feedback of this small increase in testosterone. However, all testosterone levels remained within the normal range. Nonetheless, the short-term effect of this infusion did not recapitulate hypogonadism in men or women, as neither testosterone nor estradiol were acutely lowered. An effect of lipid or insulin on testosterone would not be expected to be observed in women, because of the overriding effect of estradiol on the female HP axis and the much lower circulating testosterone levels. However, reduction of androgen activity in women with flutamide has been shown to improve the lipid profile in women with PCOS (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Regardless, the high, supraphysiologic concentrations of insulin and lipid provided in this study are far more likely than the modest elevation of testosterone to have accounted for the negative feedback we observed in men. Unsurprisingly, SHBG, which has a long serum half-life, was unaltered in concentration over the course of these short-term infusions.</p><p id="P30">Strengths of our study include the carefully controlled conditions of each infusion with excellent achievement and stability of elevated insulin and NEFA levels during each infusion. The repeated nature of the study design, with the same subjects participating in up to 4 treatment arms is also a strength. Weaknesses of our study include its relatively small sample size, multiple comparisons, a lack of very frequent blood sampling (q 10 minutes) required to allow assessment of pulsatile gonadotropin secretion, and the fact that not all participants were able to complete all infusion types.</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, the combination of acute exposure to elevated fatty acids and hyperinsulinemia acutely down regulates pituitary gonadotropin levels in both women and men. Thus, mimicking metabolic syndrome in individuals characterized as healthy and non-obese, can induce the reproductive phenotype characteristic of obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ack
