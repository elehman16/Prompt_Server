It is the gold standard in the rapid sequence induction and intubation, but it is not without adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Succinylcholine can produce bradycardia, myalgia, hyperkalemia, raised intracranial, intraocular, and intragastric pressures among others. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs are without many of these side effects. However, these drugs have a slow onset of action making the patient vulnerable to regurgitation and aspiration between induction and intubation. Various methods have been used to shorten the onset time of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs which include use of higher dose, priming, improving cardiac output and thereby muscle blood flow, use of magnesium sulfate, etc.</p><p>Use of higher doses of neuromuscular blocking drugs and MgSO<sub>4</sub> hastens the onset of neuromuscular blockade at the risk of prolonged duration of action and delayed recovery.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Priming is a popular technique to facilitate the faster onset of neuromuscular blockade for endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Ephedrine, a synthetic noncatecholamine sympathomimetic, increases the cardiac output and muscle blood flow and hence shortens the onset of action.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In a meta-analysis of pharmacological interventions for acceleration of the onset time of rocuronium, it was found priming technique and pretreatment with MgSO<sub>4</sub> or ephedrine was found to be effective.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, similar studies on vecuronium, one of the most commonly used nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, are few, and the results are not consistent. This study was an attempt to compare, the effects of priming, and pretreatment with ephedrine on the onset time of vecuronium for endotracheal intubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After obtaining the Institutional Ethical Committee approval and written informed consent, sixty patients of either gender, aged 18&#x02013;60 years, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status Class I/II, weighing 40&#x02013;70 kg, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia, were recruited for the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups of thirty each based on group assigned by a random number generating software. Sample size selection was done from a previous study by power analysis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Patients with difficult airway or having history of any drug intake, which are likely to interfere with the action of neuromuscular blocking agents were excluded from the study. Patients were warned of possible symptoms of muscle weakness, after priming doses of vecuronium, which includes difficulty in breathing and swallowing, double vision, and decreased hand grip strength.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with intravenous glycopyrrolate 5 &#x003bc;g/kg, midazolam 50 &#x003bc;g/kg, morphine 0.1 mg/kg, and ondansetron 10 &#x003bc;g/kg. Standard monitoring included heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse oxymetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and neuromuscular transmission monitor. For elicitation of train of four (TOF), the ulnar nerve contralateral to the intravenous fluid administration was selected. After adequate preparation of the area, surface electrodes were applied over the volar aspect of the wrist along the course of ulnar nerve. The negative electrode was placed about one centimeter proximal to the proximal wrist crease, and the positive electrode was placed about 3&#x02013;4 cm proximal to the first one. Control TOF was recorded with a supramaximal stimulus of 0.2 ms duration administered at a frequency of 2 Hz. Baseline HR and MAP were recorded before the induction of anesthesia.</p><p>After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, patients received either 70 &#x003bc;g/kg of ephedrine or priming dose of vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg), prepared by an anesthesiologist who was not involved in the further assessment of patient. Induction of anesthesia was done with intravenous propofol 2 mg/kg over 20 s. The depth of anesthesia was maintained using oxygen and isoflurane (0.6%&#x02013;1%). Three minutes after ephedrine or priming dose, intubating dose of vecuronium (0.09 mg/kg) was given. The response of adductor pollicis (AP) stimulation using TOF was recorded every 30 s until the response to the same became zero. Patients were then intubated.</p><p>The time taken to obtain zero response to TOF stimulation after intubating dose of vecuronium was taken as the duration of onset of vecuronium. Intubation was done with 7&#x02013;7.5 mm internal diameter (ID) endotracheal tube for females and 8&#x02013;8.5 mm ID endotracheal tube for males. The clinical intubating condition was assessed by Cooper's criteria using three parameters, namely, jaw relaxation, vocal cord movement, and gross response of the patient to laryngoscopy and intubation [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Patient's HR and MAP were recorded immediately before intubation, and then after intubation, at 1 min interval up to 5 min for any hemodynamic disturbances. A variation of 20% from the baseline was considered as statistically significant.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Cooper's scoring for grading intubation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-421-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Statistical analysis was done using PASW Statistics 18 (Chicago, SPSS Inc.).

Hence, securing the airway at the earliest is of prime importance in all patients, especially in those who have delayed gastric emptying or impaired function of the lower esophageal sphincter.</p><p>Suxamethonium has long been used as the neuromuscular agent of choice for rapid onset of intubating conditions. However, it has many undesirable adverse effects because of its depolarizing mechanism of action and its muscarinic action. Its use is either contraindicated or is controversial in patients with raised intracranial pressure, increased intraocular tension, hyperkalemia, recent burns, penetrating eye injuries, abnormal pseudocholinesterase activity, and in those with history of malignant hyperpyrexia. The alternatives to suxamethonium in such situations are the nondepolarizing muscle relaxants such as rocuronium, vecuronium, or atracurium. However, these drugs have slow onset of neuromuscular blockade. The priming technique produces acceptable intubating conditions with rocuronium with a rapidity, which approaches, if not equal to that of suxamethonium.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The recommended priming dose of nondepolarizing blocker is 10% of the intubating dose (or 20% of ED95) to minimize possible adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The rate of onset of neuromuscular blockade in any one individual is influenced by several factors, such as the potency of the drug, the dose administered, and the cardiovascular status, including cardiac output and muscle blood flow.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thus, an increase in cardiac output and muscle blood flow at the moment of induction could lead to faster onset of neuromuscular blockade. Ephedrine is a weak, indirect, and direct-acting sympathomimetic agent that produces venoconstriction to a greater degree than arteriolar constriction, which improves venous return and increases cardiac output.</p><p>The present study supports the effect of ephedrine in shortening the onset time of neuromuscular blocker vecuronium. The use of ephedrine did not produce tachycardia or hypertension in our study, probably due to the obtunding effect of induction dose of propofol on the sympathetic nervous system.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This finding is consistent with earlier studies where ephedrine 70 &#x003bc;g/kg shortened the onset time of vecuronium and atracurium without hemodynamic effects.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Higher doses of ephedrine caused tachycardia and hypertension.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Hypotension and bradycardia that may occur with propofol induction were also not found in the current study. Ephedrine pretreatment may effectively counter the hypotensive effect of propofol induction.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, in another study of 100 patients, pretreatment with ephedrine, either 75 or 100 &#x003bc;g/kg improved the intubating conditions during rapid tracheal intubation using propofol and rocuronium, but contrary to the above-mentioned studies, it was not effective in preventing the hypotension which follows induction of anesthesia with propofol.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>All the patients in the current study had clinically acceptable intubating conditions. In a previous study, clinically acceptable intubating conditions were produced in 100% of cases with low-dose ephedrine along with priming when attempted 1 min after loading dose of atracurium, whereas it was only in 52% when ephedrine or priming technique was used alone.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The fact that we monitored TOF at AP, which has a slower onset time compared to central muscles orbicularis oculi (OO) or corrugator supercilii (CS), might have contributed to 100% of cases giving the clinically acceptable intubation grades.</p><p>TOF at AP, OO, and CS do have variability with respect to clinical intubating conditions.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The laryngeal muscles have a faster onset and early recovery compared to AP with neuromuscular blocking drugs.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Monitoring the onset of neuromuscular block in the CS can predict the presence of good or excellent intubating conditions earlier than the use of AP. Though OO monitoring showed the shortest onset time, it was not clinically useful as there was an unacceptable incidence of inadequate intubating conditions. CS provide the best balance by shortening the onset time as well as maintaining the 100% incidence of good or excellent intubating conditions.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The CS and not the OO has a sensitivity similar to that of the laryngeal adductor muscles because of the similarity in their muscle fiber types.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Another study also found OO monitoring predicting good intubating conditions when compared with AP after vecuronium in children.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Cardiac output monitoring was not done in our study to correlate the faster onset rendered by ephedrine compared to the priming technique. It was demonstrated that the increase in cardiac output with ephedrine facilitated the faster onset of rocuronium when compared with esmolol.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, in another study, the improved cardiac output by ephedrine failed to demonstrate a faster onset of intubation time of vecuronium.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The authors have even concluded that the onset of the vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block is primarily determined by factors other than cardiac output. This may be because of their method, administration of vecuronium after 11 min of stable propofol anesthesia to standardize the duration of ulnar nerve stimulation, which might have caused depressed hemodynamic conditions. Further studies may be done with cardiac output monitoring and our findings, the effect of ephedrine pretreatment on the onset time of vecuronium, may be reestablished.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Pretreatment with ephedrine 70 &#x003bc;g/kg shortens the onset time of vecuronium for endotracheal intubation and is superior to the priming technique.
