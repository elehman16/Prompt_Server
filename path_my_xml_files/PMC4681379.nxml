Another licensed vaccine would reinforce MMR supply. This study assessed the immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine (<italic>Priorix</italic><sup>TM</sup>, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines [MMR-RIT]) when used as a first dose among eligible children in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this exploratory Phase-2, multicenter, observer-blind study, 1220 healthy subjects aged 12&#x02013;15 months were randomized (3:3:3:3) and received 1 dose of 1 of 3 MMR-RIT lots with differing mumps virus titers (MMR-RIT-1 [4.8 log<sub>10</sub>]; MMR-RIT-2 [4.1 log<sub>10</sub>]; MMR-RIT-3 [3.7 log<sub>10</sub>] CCID50) or MMRII co-administered with hepatitis A vaccine (HAV), varicella vaccine (VAR) and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7).

Maintenance of high vaccine coverage rates remains an essential component of efforts to control these diseases. A 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule is recommended in the United States. Children receive dose-1 at 12&#x02013;15 months concomitantly with other recommended vaccines, including hepatitis A vaccine (HAV), varicella vaccine (VAR), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) [<xref rid="PIU081C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIU081C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. MMR dose-2 is administered at age 4&#x02013;6 years to induce immune responses in those who fail to respond to the initial dose. Two-dose catch-up schedules, with a minimum 4-week interval between MMR doses, are recommended for children and adolescents who miss the first dose [<xref rid="PIU081C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As Merck's <italic>M-M-R</italic><sup>TM</sup>II (MMRII), a human serum albumin-free vaccine, is currently the only MMR vaccine licensed in the United States, any interruption in its availability would pose a critical public health risk. Therefore, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines is currently evaluating its trivalent MMR vaccine <italic>Priorix</italic><sup>TM</sup> (MMR-RIT) for use in the United States. MMR-RIT is routinely given in over 100 countries from the second year of life onwards [<xref rid="PIU081C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The formulation of MMR-RIT used in this study does not contain human serum albumin, thereby minimizing any theoretical risk of microbial contamination as compared to previous formulations [<xref rid="PIU081C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This formulation is also consistent with the recommendation from the European Medicines Agency to eliminate the use of blood-derived products of human origin [<xref rid="PIU081C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="PIU081C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>This Phase-2 exploratory study assessed immunologic responses to 3 lots of MMR-RIT (containing a range of mumps virus titers) and to MMRII used as a first dose in 12&#x02013;15-month-old children in the United States. The study was used as a preliminary evaluation of the minimum effective mumps virus titer for the candidate vaccine to allow planning of a Phase-3 study, and was used also to generate preliminary data on the safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of MMR-RIT with routine childhood vaccines: VAR, HAV, and 7-valent PCV (PCV7).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This randomized, observer-blind, Phase-2 study was conducted at 51 centers in the Unites States in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study was approved by a national, regional, or investigational center institutional review board or independent ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians before enrollment. The study consisted of an active phase (immediate post-vaccination interval; Days 0&#x02013;42), an extended safety follow-up phase (Days 43&#x02013;180), and an antibody persistence phase ending approximately 2 years post-vaccination. Only the results of a planned analysis conducted for immunogenicity and safety data from the active phase are reported here.</p><p>Eligible healthy 12- to 15-month-old male and female subjects had not been previously immunized against (and had no previous history of) measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and hepatitis A, and had received 3 doses of PCV7 within the first year of life (third dose administered &#x02265;30 days before enrollment). Other key exclusion criteria included: exposure to measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella &#x02264;30 days before study start; previous (&#x02264;30 days before study start) or planned administration of investigational products during the study; administration of other vaccines (except influenza and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b) &#x02264;30 days before study vaccination until Day 42; chronic immunosuppressants/immune-modifying drugs, polyclonal immunoglobulins, or blood products received &#x02264;6 months before study vaccination; immunosuppressive or immunodeficient conditions; contraindication to vaccination; a history of neurologic disorders or seizures; acute disease at enrollment; and severe chronic illness or major congenital defects.</p><p>Subjects visited the study site at Days 0, 42, 180, 365, and 730. At Day 0 (Visit 1), subjects were randomized using a blocking scheme (3:3:3:[1:1:1] ratio) to 1 of 4 parallel treatment groups: 3 groups received a single dose of 1 of 3 MMR-RIT lots (containing either high [MMR-RIT-1], medium [MMR-RIT-2], or low [MMR-RIT-3] RIT 4385 mumps strain titers); the fourth group received a single dose of 1 of 3 commercial lots of MMRII (Merck &#x00026; Co Inc. [<xref rid="PIU081C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PIU081TB1">1</xref>). The randomization list was generated at GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals using <italic>SAS</italic><sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software. Treatment allocation was performed at the investigator site via a central internet-based randomization system. Subjects concomitantly received a single dose each of HAV (<italic>Havrix</italic><sup>TM</sup>, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines [<xref rid="PIU081C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), VAR (<italic>Varivax</italic><sup>TM</sup>, Merck &#x00026; Co.

Immune response against measles, mumps, and rubella viruses was assessed at Day 42 (Visit 2). MMR-RIT or MMRII were administered subcutaneously into the upper right arm, VAR subcutaneously into the upper left arm, and HAV and PCV7 intramuscularly into the left and right thighs, respectively. A second HAV dose was administered at Day 180 (Visit 3). Vaccine recipients, parents/guardians, and those responsible for evaluation of study endpoints were blinded to study treatment. Vaccine reception, storage, preparation, reconstitution, and administration were performed by study personnel who did not participate in outcome evaluation.

Sera were stored at -20&#x000b0;C until assayed in a blinded manner at a central laboratory (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium). Mumps virus antibody response was determined using an in-house plaque-reduction assay (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals [<xref rid="PIU081C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="PIU081C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) via neutralization of wild-type virus (Mu90LO1) in the presence of complement and anti-human globulin. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to measles, rubella, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) were measured with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Enzygnost, Dade Behring, Marburg GmbH, Germany); antibodies to hepatitis A virus were determined in a randomized subset of 50% of subjects. Antibodies to PCV7 pneumococcal serotypes were measured in the remaining 50% with an in-house ELISA (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals [<xref rid="PIU081C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Assay seronegativity cut-off values for antibodies to vaccine viral antigens were: measles &#x0003c;150 mIU/mL, mumps &#x0003c;24 ED<sub>50</sub>, rubella &#x0003c;4 IU/mL, VZV &#x0003c;25 mIU/mL, hepatitis A &#x0003c;15 mIU/mL, and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 &#x000b5;g/mL. The seronegativity cut-offs evaluated in this study were determined empirically as part of the assay validation protocol and were accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Post-vaccination seroresponses for MMR vaccine viral antigens in initially seronegative subjects were defined as antibody concentrations/titers of: measles &#x02265;200 mIU/mL [<xref rid="PIU081C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; mumps &#x02265;51 ED<sub>50</sub> (no known correlate of protection threshold) and rubella &#x02265;10 IU/mL [<xref rid="PIU081C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Safety analysis was performed on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC), which included all vaccinated subjects.</p><p>The primary endpoint was seroresponse rates for antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses at Day 42; the proportions of subjects with antibody concentration/titer at or above specified assay cut-offs were calculated with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) both pre- and post-vaccination. Secondary endpoints included pre- and post-vaccination (Day 42) antibody concentration/titers, summarized by geometric mean concentrations/titers (GMC/Ts) with 95% CI. Exploratory analyses included standardized asymptotic 2-sided 95% CIs calculated for group differences (MMR-RIT group minus MMRII) in Day-42 seroresponse rates for antibodies to MMR viruses. In addition, 95% CIs for GMC ratios (MMR-RIT:MMRII) for antibodies to hepatitis A virus and PCV7 pneumococcal serotypes were obtained using an analysis of covariance model on the logarithm<sub>10</sub>-transformed Day-42 concentrations. For the safety analysis, the number and percentage of subjects reporting a symptom were calculated with exact 95% CIs. Symptoms were categorized according to intensity and relationship to study vaccine. All data processing and analyses were performed using SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Measles or rubella-like rashes were reported in MMR-RIT-1 (n = 6), MMR-RIT-2 (n = 7), MMR-RIT-3 (n = 5), and MMRII (n = 9) recipients; varicella-like rash was reported for MMR-RIT-2 (n = 4) and MMRII (n = 2) subjects. Overall incidence of parotid-gland swelling was low (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PIU081TB5">5</xref>). There were 2 cases of febrile convulsion during Days 0&#x02013;42. One MMR-RIT-2 recipient experienced a simple febrile convulsion at Day 29. This was not considered vaccine-related by the investigator since the peak prevalence of vaccine-related fever, and hence febrile convulsions, occurs in the second week following vaccination with measles-containing vaccines [<xref rid="PIU081C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>One MMRII recipient had a complex febrile seizure on Day 0, which led to hospitalization and the mother's withdrawal of the subject from the study; this event, classified as an SAE, was considered to be related to the study vaccine.</p><p>Of 15 SAEs reported in 11 subjects (Days 0&#x02013;42), 2 SAEs were considered to be related to study treatment: febrile convulsion in a 12-month-old female MMRII recipient (described above), and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (onset at Day 20) in a 13-month-old female MMR-RIT-2 recipient who was hospitalized for treatment and discharged after 3 days.

Rates of antipyretic medication use were the following: MMR-RIT-1 (65.1%), MMR-RIT-2 (59.2%), MMR-RIT-3 (64.1%), and MMRII (57.5%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This Phase-2 multicenter exploratory study assessed immune responses to the first dose of MMR-RIT with 3 differing mumps virus titers and to commercially available MMRII when concomitantly administered with HAV, VAR, and PCV7 in healthy children in the United States, aged 12&#x02013;15 months. The results indicate that a single dose of any 1 of the 3 MMR-RIT lots elicited an acceptable immune response with respect to seroresponse rates to MMR viruses, 42 days post-vaccination. Previous randomized comparative studies have shown that MMR-RIT administered as a primary vaccination to children in the second year of life produced similar seroconversion rates for antibodies to MMR vaccine viruses compared to those seen with MMRII [<xref rid="PIU081C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIU081C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The current formulation of MMR-RIT used in this study, when co-administered to young children with other recommended vaccines (HAV, VAR, and PCV7), elicited measles and rubella virus antibody concentrations meeting the predefined threshold for seroresponse in &#x02265;97.5% MMR-RIT recipients, and in &#x02265;99.6% MMRII recipients when co-administered with the same vaccines.</p><p>Day-42 mumps virus antibody titers after vaccination with all 3 MMR-RIT lots met the seroresponse threshold in 90.7%, 90.6%, and 89.7% recipients, respectively, and no obvious dose&#x02013;response relationship was observed. Of note, 13.8% of subjects were seropositive for mumps at baseline. This high baseline seropositivity rate is likely attributed to complement enhancement of the mumps PRN assay rather than prior exposure to mumps or persistence of maternal antibodies. Complement-enhanced mumps PRN assays have been shown to have higher seroresponse rates than unenhanced assays [<xref rid="PIU081C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and this may also be reflected in the baseline seropositivity. Rubella seroresponse rates across all 4 groups were high (97.5&#x02013;100%) and GMCs for antibodies to rubella virus following all 3 MMR-RIT lots were substantially higher than the cut-off level of &#x02265;10 IU/mL and would provide effective immunization. Long-term follow-up in this study will allow the evaluation of antibody persistence until approximately 2 years post-vaccination.</p><p>The immune response to vaccines routinely co-administered with MMR dose-1 in the United States (HAV, VAR, and PCV7) was also assessed. Observed seroresponse rates for antibodies to VZV were consistently high (&#x02265;95.8%) across all 4 treatment groups, and hepatitis A virus antibody response rates to HAV dose-1 were &#x02265;83.0% in each group. Furthermore, Day-42 baseline-adjusted GMCs for antibodies to hepatitis A virus and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> serotypes appeared comparable when these vaccines were administered with MMR-RIT or MMRII in this exploratory analysis of between-group GMC ratios.</p><p>MMR-RIT had an acceptable reactogenicity profile when co-administered with HAV, VAR, and PCV7. Injection site symptoms at the MMR injection site occurred in all 4 treatment groups within 4 days of vaccination, although the incidence of severe symptoms was low. Consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="PIU081C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIU081C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], vaccination with MMR-RIT or MMRII was associated with fever (rectal temperature &#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C) during the first 2 weeks, which peaked during days 5&#x02013;12 after vaccine administration. MMR-RIT, which contains the Jeryl Lynn&#x02013;derived RIT 4385 strain, has demonstrated a good reactogenicity profile in previous clinical trials [<xref rid="PIU081C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIU081C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="PIU081C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Accordingly, in this study, a low incidence of other solicited general symptoms, including measles/rubella- or varicella-like rash, parotid gland swelling, and febrile convulsions, was reported among both MMR-RIT and MMRII recipients during the follow-up period.</p><p>Strengths of this study include use of a computer-generated randomization list and blinding of study vaccines, thereby addressing potential biases in study conduct, and comparing the immune responses to the study vaccine with the US-licensed standard of care (MMRII). Furthermore, the MMR-RIT formulation used in this study was free of human serum albumin, thus eliminating the theoretical risk of microbial contamination associated with human serum albumin&#x02013;containing vaccines [<xref rid="PIU081C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, omitting a human blood&#x02013;derived component from the MMR-RIT formulation might make it more socially acceptable. Lastly, concomitant administration of routine vaccines (HAV, VAR, and PCV7) did not affect the immunogenicity of MMR-RIT and vice versa.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the relatively small study population that is consistent with a Phase-2 planning study. Larger Phase-3 clinical trials are required in future to substantiate the immunogenicity and safety profile of MMR-RIT. Furthermore, extended follow-up studies are important to evaluate the long-term protection offered by MMR-RIT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This Phase-2 study demonstrated an acceptable immune response to 3 candidate MMR-RIT lots containing differing mumps virus titers with respect to seroresponse rates to all 3 MMR virus components. There was no obvious dose&#x02013;response relationship for the 3 mumps virus titers evaluated; based on the current results, all 3 lots would provide effective immunization, with an acceptable reactogenicity profile. MMR-RIT can be given concomitantly with HAV, VAR, and PCV7 without interfering with the immune response to these co-administered vaccines, as was shown for MMRII. Confirmatory Phase-3 studies to support licensure of MMR-RIT on the basis of immunogenic noninferiority to the licensed comparator are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title/><sec disp-level="2" id="s6a"><title>Trademark Statement</title><p>MMRII is a registered trademark of Merck &#x00026; Co.
