Indeed, pathogenic microorganisms adhere to the intestinal mucosa, weaken cellular tight-junction function, and reduce transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER).

Stool production (number in the previous 24 hours), with mucus and/or blood, was recorded, as was stool consistency, according to the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS): e.g., type 6 refers to diarrhea with soft stools; type 7 refers to watery stools, no solid pieces, and entirely liquid [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

However, 48 patients were excluded for the following reasons: early discharge from hospital (n=6); loss of contact with patient after discharge from hospital (7); duty physician not familiar with the study (20); patients received additional antidiarrheal medication (8); patients refused to take oral medication (4); and increased severity of vomiting or diarrhea (3). Thus, 203 patients completed the study (gelatin tannate plus ORS, n=103; ORS alone, n=100) and received at least 1 dose of study medication (per-protocol population). Results were recorded and data analyzed for the per-protocol population. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-medscimonit-23-2029">Table 1</xref> shows demographic and clinical characteristics for these patients.

Approximately 60% of patients had accompanying nausea at baseline and 50% had abdominal pain. More than one-third of patients (36.2%) received antibacterial therapy during the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects on symptoms of acute diarrhea</title><p>At all study assessment timepoints from 24 hours onwards, the incidence of nausea was significantly lower in the gelatin tannate plus ORS group than in the ORS group alone (at 24 hours: 11.7% <italic>vs.</italic> 26.0% of patients; p=0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-23-2029">Figure 1A</xref>).

In this way, complications and risks can be avoided, such as serious dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and altered nutrient absorption and digestion with worsening nutritional status. Such complications can lead to increased requirements for enteral or parenteral rehydration and nutrition, and hospitalization [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, treatments such as gelatin tannate, with the potential to enhance efficacy of oral rehydration therapy and obviate the need for enteral or parenteral intervention, clearly warrant detailed investigation.</p><p>In the present study, gelatin tannate plus ORS was significantly more effective than ORS alone in reducing symptoms (e.g., nausea, abdominal pain, fever, and watery stools) and stool frequency in children hospitalized with acute diarrhea. The symptom reduction was particularly evident for nausea and abdominal pain at 24&#x02013;72 hours of hospitalization, and for watery stools after 12&#x02013;72 hours of treatment.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of the present trial is that average direct costs per patient (e.g., total costs of drugs, diagnostic tests, and consultations) were approximately 40% lower in the gelatin tannate plus ORS group than in the ORS-placebo group (229.26 <italic>vs.</italic> 386.56 Turkish lira). This creates significant scope for future, more-detailed cost-utility analyses of gelatin tannate in children with acute diarrhea.</p><p>A potential limitation of the trial is that the exact proportions of patients who completed the 72-hour study period in hospital or at home were unclear. Clearly, patients in the hospital environment are more likely to have adhered to the gelatin tannate plus ORS schedule than patients in the home setting. In addition, we did not manage to include the anticipated number of children during the study period. However, this was not materially important since the numbers were sufficient to demonstrate both clinically and statistically significant differences between the 2 treatments.</p><p>Altogether, our results are consistent with findings from other clinical trials of mucoprotective agents. For example, in an observational study involving 239 children (aged 3 months to 12 years) with acute diarrhea, gelatin tannate plus ORS versus ORS alone significantly reduced stool frequency at 12 hours post-treatment [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In a randomized study in adults with acute diarrhea, another mucoprotective agent, xyloglucan, was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of diarrhea and to have faster onset of action than diosmectite or <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other well-controlled studies of gelatin tannate are ongoing: for example, this mucoprotective agent is currently being compared with placebo in up to 158 children aged &#x0003c;5 years with acute gastroenteritis; the primary study endpoint is duration of diarrhea, and study results are soon expected to be released (study number NCT02280759) [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> findings also endorse the mucoprotective activity of gelatin tannate, which is considered to adhere to apical epithelial cells in the intestinal mucosa and interact favorably with tight junctions, strongly increasing TEER, and thereby maintaining intestinal wall integrity [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-23-2029" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Overall, it appears that sufficient data now exist to clearly endorse the use of film-forming, mucoprotective agents, such as gelatin tannate or xyloglucan, in combination with ORS to stop diarrhea, especially in the pediatric population with acute diarrhea. This is particularly pertinent given the significantly favorable action of gelatin tannate on symptoms other than diarrhea (e.g., abdominal pain, fever, and nausea) in the current trial. Potentially, amelioration of these additional symptoms was also due to the beneficial effect of gelatin tannate on the intestinal mucosa. No adverse events were reported during the current trial, thereby further corroborating the positive safety profiles of mucoprotective agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Administration of gelatin tannate in combination with ORS is an effective and safe option for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children. Significant symptom relief is evident 12 hours after starting treatment. Clearly, results from this trial validate the use of gelatin tannate as an addition to ORS in children with acute diarrhea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors
