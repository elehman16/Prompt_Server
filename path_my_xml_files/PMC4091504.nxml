While the use of internet-delivered cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy programmes has been consistently shown to have small-to-moderate effects in the management of chronic pain, there is a paucity in the research regarding the effectiveness of an internet-delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) programme among people with chronic pain. The current study will compare the clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an online ACT intervention with a waitlist control condition in terms of the management of pain-related functional interference among people with chronic pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Participants with non-malignant pain that persists for at least 3&#x02005;months will be randomised to one of two study conditions. The experimental group will undergo an eight-session internet-delivered ACT programme over an 8-week period. The control group will be a waiting list group and will be offered the ACT intervention after the 3-month follow-up period. Participants will be assessed preintervention, postintervention and at a 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be pain-related functional interference. Secondary outcomes will include: pain intensity, depression, global impression of change, acceptance of chronic pain and quality of life. A qualitative evaluation of the perspectives of the participants regarding the ACT intervention will be completed after the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study will be performed in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and is approved by the National University of Ireland Galway Research Ethics Committee (12/05/05). The results of the trial will be published according to the CONSORT statement and will be presented at conferences and reported in peer-reviewed journals.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN18166896.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pain Management</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic pain is a common condition that affects between one in three<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and one in six adults.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It is a major public health problem that often runs a relapsing and recurrent course and is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described by the patient in terms of such damage which persists for a period in excess of 3&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> While chronic pain can be associated with a number of progressive or degenerative conditions, it most commonly occurs in people with benign medical conditions such as musculoskeletal problems. For many people, the presence of chronic pain has adverse effects on their daily functioning, employment, relationships and emotional functioning.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Considering its associated direct and indirect expenditures, chronic pain is also a costly social phenomenon.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A recent estimate of the cost of chronic pain in Ireland was &#x020ac;5.34 million, or 2.86% of the gross domestic product per year.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT) is the standard psychological treatment for people with chronic pain<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;11</xref> and it underpins many of the interdisciplinary pain management programmes. However, it is apparent that some people who experience chronic pain do not benefit from CBT interventions.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref> Therefore, clinicians and researchers continue to examine alternative forms of psychological treatment for this large clinical population. The primary aim of CBT is to control and minimise pain-related distress; however, in recent years, there has been a shift towards strategies that promote the acceptance of pain. The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> treatment model consists of awareness and non-judgemental acceptance of all experiences, both positive and negative; identification of valued life directions and appropriate action towards goals that support those values.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The aim of ACT is to increase functioning and decrease interference of pain with value-driven action.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The empirical support for ACT has increased considerably in recent years. Until now, there are at least eight randomised controlled trials in support of the efficacy of ACT programmes in the management of chronic pain.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;23</xref> A wide array of methods of programme delivery have been evaluated, including variations of duration of treatment sessions, method of delivery of ACT sessions (group, one-to-one, internet-delivered or self-help) and length of ACT intervention (ranging from 4 to 10 sessions). The results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature demonstrated that acceptance-based therapies have small but consistent effects on physical and mental health among people with chronic pain (standardised mean differences (SMD's) 0.37 to 0.41),<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which are comparable to those of CBT (SMD's &#x02212;0.15 to &#x02212;0.21).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Traditional multidimensional rehabilitation for people with chronic pain requires expensive specialised clinics.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Access to ACT treatment programmes and other psychological treatment programmes is often limited due to various individual and systemic barriers including direct and indirect costs, mobility limitations, long waiting lists and insufficient numbers of appropriately trained health professionals.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> One approach that aims to increase access to psychological intervention which has received increased attention in recent years is internet-delivered psychological therapy.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;30</xref> Such internet-delivered programmes provide standardised evidence-based psychological treatment at minimal cost and interference for people with chronic pain.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Recently, one randomised controlled trial has examined the clinical-effectiveness of a guided internet-based ACT intervention among 76 people with chronic pain.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The results demonstrated that participants who received the ACT intervention demonstrated significant improvements regarding activity engagement and willingness to experience pain symptoms at both postintervention and at 6-month follow-up, compared with people who partook in a moderated online discussion forum. Furthermore, the authors called for future investigation of the costs and cost-savings of an online ACT intervention for people with chronic pain.</p><p>The significant cost of chronic pain internationally<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and in Ireland<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> provides a clear rationale for the current study to focus on the economic evaluation of an internet-delivered ACT intervention. A thorough understanding of the economic cost of chronic pain is crucial to inform decision-making regarding health service resource allocation, especially for high-intensity service users.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This aspect of the study will be conducted with a view to giving more affordable alternative options to the current chronic pain management services in Ireland.</p><p>Given the limited number of randomised controlled trials of ACT interventions for chronic pain and specifically internet-guided ACT interventions, the present study aims to examine the clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an internet-delivered ACT treatment programme among a sample of people with chronic pain. It is hypothesised that people in the ACT treatment group will report significant improvements on measures of pain intensity, physical functioning, emotional functioning and rating of overall improvement, relative to a waitlist control group.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>The design is a single-blind randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of an internet-delivered ACT intervention with a waiting list control condition in the management of chronic pain. Any modifications to the protocol which may impact on the conduct of the study will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be agreed on by the Irish Health Research Board Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhancement Award, grant number (ICE/2011/19) research group, and approved by the relevant ethics committee prior to the implementation of the modifications. Minor administrative changes to the protocol will be agreed on by the Irish Health Research Board Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhancement Award, grant number (ICE/2011/19) research group, and will be documented in a memorandum.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment, participants and randomisation</title><p>Recruitment of the participants will be conducted via advertisements about the trial on websites which offer information and services to people with chronic pain and via advertisements in local general practitioner and physiotherapy clinics. People who are interested in taking part in the trial will be invited to contact the Centre for Pain Research via phone or email, wherein they will be given an opportunity to ask questions about the trial. When contacted, the researcher will explain the study in detail. Interested people will be directed to the trial website where they will be encouraged to read additional information about the trial (see online supplementary appendix 1) and apply to participate. Selection criteria are: aged 18&#x02005;years or more, the presence of pain for at least 3&#x02005;months duration, resident of Ireland, regular access to a computer and to the internet, not currently undergoing any other form of psychological intervention for chronic pain, not currently experiencing a psychotic illness (screened with a Health Problems Questionnaire),<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> not experiencing chronic pain due to malignancy and adequate English language ability. Participation in any other form of psychological intervention for chronic pain in addition to the study intervention is prohibited during the trial. All participants will provide full informed consent. Participants will be randomised to the intervention or waiting list control group using random permuted blocks to ensure that the groups are balanced periodically. The randomisation process will be performed by a web-based password secured and encrypted data management system designed specifically for the randomisation of participants into clinical trials. Once the randomisation procedure has been completed, the participants in the online ACT intervention group will begin the intervention. The statistician involved in the analysis of the data will be blinded to group allocation. As the study involves a psychological intervention with a waitlist control group, blinding of the participants will not be possible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Treatment regimens</title><p>The internet-delivered ACT intervention will consist of eight sessions over an 8-week period and is based on an unpublished manual used in a previous study of people with chronic pain.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Other relevant resources and literature were also used in designing the online ACT programme.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The programme will be delivered via the interactive online platform <italic>Lifeguide</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifeguideonline.org/">http://www.lifeguideonline.org/</ext-link>). It will consist of information, homework assignments, relevant ACT metaphors and mindfulness exercises. This treatment protocol is focused on the promotion of acceptance, present-focused awareness and engagement in value-based action. Detailed information about the content of the treatment programme is outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014005092TB1">table 1</xref>. The current ACT intervention has been developed into an online format by a postdoctoral clinical psychologist who has experience in psychological and behavioural treatment of chronic pain (HD) and a postdoctoral physiotherapist (SH) under the supervision of a licensed clinical psychologist specialising in pain management (BM) and a psychologist with expertise in the ACT approach (MH). In addition, qualitative one-to-one interviews will be conducted with an opportunistic sample of individuals with chronic pain to explore their perception of the main problems posed by chronic pain to functioning and participation in important areas of their lives. Following content analysis, the insights gained from the qualitative data will be incorporated into the ACT intervention. Each of the sessions will be subjected to as many reviews as necessary, by both the research team and individuals with chronic pain, to ensure that both interface and content are understandable, engaging and have the potential to achieve the aim of the internet-delivered ACT intervention, that is, increase functioning and decrease interference of pain with value-driven action. To maximise participant engagement and experiential learning, all aspects of this programme will include audio and visual presentations. Each lesson will begin with a summary of previous lessons and an introduction to the contents of the current lesson. Summaries of key points will be outlined in each lesson, and concepts and skills described in earlier lessons will be repeated and combined in later lessons. Weekly emails will be sent to participants, wherein they will be notified of new content and reminded about the course material that they have not accessed.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Participants will also receive weekly phone calls from a member of the research team throughout the duration of the intervention. The phone calls will be structured and will aim not only to motivate and encourage the participants but also to give them the opportunity to ask questions about the intervention. However, the phone calls are not intended to form part of the therapy per se. Adherence to the trial intervention will be monitored automatically via the online delivery platform (Lifeguide) and adherence to the trial assessments will be monitored automatically via the online survey provider. If a participant wishes to discontinue their assigned intervention, access to the intervention will be withdrawn from the participant and this will be reported as attrition. However, in an attempt to enable follow-up data collection and prevent missing data, the study participant will be retained in the trial whenever possible.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2014005092TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Overview of the internet-delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention programme</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Summary of content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The study will be analysed using the principles of intention-to-treat analysis. Suitable graphical (eg, box plots, labelled scatter-plots and case profile plots) and numerical summaries (means, medians, SDs and quartiles) will be provided for all variables at baseline and for corresponding change scores. As the primary outcome measure, BPI, is measured on an 11-point scale, it will be treated as a continuous variable. The change in the primary response over time (baseline vs postintervention vs 3-month follow-up) will be analysed using a linear mixed model adjusting for baseline, treatment group and within-subject correlation while further adjusting for demographic and clinical explanatory variables as necessary. Model selection will be based on the Akaike Information Criterion<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> and the underlying assumption through suitable plots of the residuals. A similar approach will be used when analysing the change in those secondary outcome measures recorded on a continuous scale while a non-linear mixed model will be used to compare the changes in the proportions of the ordinal PGIC variable.

In terms of estimating costs, we will include costs falling on the health and social care sector including medication use using data collected as part of the CSRI. Once we have information on the quantity of use, we will translate these into costs using unit cost data available for Ireland for each of the services/products.

These will include expenditure on any treatment not paid by the state, the costs of travelling to, and wait times at, the various healthcare services. We will also record the opportunity cost of work by gathering information on the costs associated with taking time off work or reduced employment for the person with chronic pain or for family members who care for the person with chronic pain. To determine these costs, information on wages will be collected where possible to value these costs. If this is not available, other information such as income, marital status, age and education will be used to provide a proxy for the wage.
