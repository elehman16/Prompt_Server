In humans, errors in this process are a leading cause of birth defects, mental retardation, and infertility. In most organisms, crossing-over, or exchange, between the homologous partners provides a link that promotes their proper, bipolar, attachment to the spindle. Attachment of both partners to the same pole can sometimes be corrected during a delay that is triggered by the spindle checkpoint. Studies of non-exchange chromosomes have shown that centromere pairing serves as an alternative to exchange by orienting the centromeres for proper microtubule attachment. Here, we demonstrate a new role for the synaptonemal complex protein Zip1. Zip1 localizes to the centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes in pachytene and mediates centromere pairing and segregation of the partners at meiosis I. Exchange chromosomes were also found to experience Zip1-dependent pairing at their centromeres. Zip1 was found to persist at centromeres, after synaptonemal complex disassembly, remaining there until microtubule attachment. Disruption of this centromere pairing, in spindle checkpoint mutants, randomized the segregation of exchange chromosomes. These results demonstrate that Zip1-mediated pairing of exchange chromosome centromeres promotes an initial, bipolar attachment of microtubules. This activity of Zip1 lessens the load on the spindle checkpoint, greatly reducing the chance that the cell will exit the checkpoint delay with an improperly oriented chromosome pair. Thus exchange, the spindle checkpoint, and centromere pairing are complementary mechanisms that ensure the proper segregation of homologous partners at meiosis I.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division that halves the chromosome number and results in the production of gametes. In humans, meiosis normally produces gametes containing exactly one copy of each chromosome. Meiotic errors lead to gametes with incorrect chromosome numbers, a major cause of birth defects and infertility. A key step in meiosis (meiosis I) is the separation of homologous chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes first become physically linked by recombination, which keeps them together until they attach properly at their centromeres to the apparatus that will pull them to opposite sides of the cell. In this study we have used budding yeast to identify processes, beyond recombination, that contribute to meiotic fidelity. We have found that a protein, Zip1, mediates the pairing of chromosome centromeres in a way that greatly enhances the chance they will be properly separated in meiosis, thus preventing the formation of gametes with incorrect chromosome numbers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proper segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I depends upon the ability of the partners to attach to microtubules that radiate from opposite poles of the spindle. These microtubules will mediate the separation of the partners at anaphase I. Crossovers promote bipolar attachment of homologous chromosomes to the spindle by creating a link between the partners, allowing them to attach to the spindle as a unit. Recombination is accompanied by assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure that tightly aligns chromosomes from end-to-end. Later in meiosis (diplotene) the SC is lost and the homolog pair (termed a bivalent) remains tethered by chiasmata, the connections formed by the crossovers (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Gerton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). Proper attachment of the homologous kinetochores to opposite poles of the meiotic spindle creates tension across the bivalent; this tension serves to stabilize kinetochore-microtubule interactions (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Pinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). Bivalents in which only one kinetochore has attached to microtubules, or in which both kinetochores have attached to the same spindle pole, can undergo cycles of microtubule release and re-attachment until a proper spindle orientation has been achieved. During this process, the spindle checkpoint promotes a meiotic delay that blocks anaphase until all the chromosomes are properly attached. However, the meiosis I delays that are triggered by the spindle checkpoint do not always provide sufficient time to allow proper spindle attachment of errant chromosomes. In both mice and yeast, meiotic cells sometimes proceed to anaphase even if one chromosome pair has failed to become properly oriented <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Cheslock1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1000771-LeMaireAdkins1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Thus, mechanisms that act to promote a correct initial attachment of microtubules to homologous kinetochores, that will not require re-orientation, should reduce the demand for spindle checkpoint mediated delays and promote meiotic segregation fidelity.</p><p>At the time of microtubule attachment, homologous partners are typically linked by chiasmata, which can often be a considerable distance from the kinetochores. If these chiasmata were the only connections between the homologs then the kinetochores of the bivalent might be expected to have rotational freedom such that they could at times face the same spindle pole, which could result in monopolar spindle attachments <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Stewart2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, early observations of the microtubule attachment process demonstrated that the initial attachments of microtubules to kinetochores are usually correct (bipolar). This led &#x000d6;stergren to suggest that the homologous kinetochores must not behave independently, but be arranged, or interact in some way, that orients them toward opposite spindle poles <xref rid="pgen.1000771-stergren1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>One opportunity for communication between the homologous kinetochores is during synapsis. Here the homologous centromeres are juxtaposed, but whether they are actively paired has been hard to establish. The most compelling evidence for active pairing of homologous centromeres has come from studies of non-exchange chromosomes (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Stewart2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> females, fission yeast and budding yeast, the centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes pair late in meiotic prophase in a manner that promotes proper disjunction at meiosis I, even in the absence of any obvious interactions along the chromosome arms <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Dernburg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In budding yeast, centromeres also undergo a period of centromere pairing early in meiotic prophase before homologs become aligned with their partners. This pairing is dependent upon the protein Zip1 <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Tsubouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which is a major component of the synaptonemal complex that zippers homologs together after the initiation of homologous recombination <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Sym1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Like the later stage of centromere pairing in pachytene, which promotes the disjunction of non-exchange partners, this early stage of centromere pairing is homology independent; the pairing process appears to be driven by interactions between proteins at the centromere regions rather than DNA homologies. How the early and late periods of centromere pairing relate functionally is unclear. Also unknown is whether the pairing that can be observed between the centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes reflects a process that also occurs between the centromeres of exchange chromosomes. The fact that non-exchange chromosome pairs are rare in budding yeast <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kaback1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> has suggested that the centromere pairing observed to drive their segregation might be a process that is used in every meiosis to orient the centromeres of exchange partners <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Stewart2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Here we show that pairing of centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes, in late meiotic prophase, requires Zip1, to promote their bipolar attachment to the meiosis I spindle. Moreover, Zip1 was also found to pair the centromeres of exchange chromosomes in pachytene and to persist at centromeres until they begin attaching to microtubules. The results support the model that centromere pairing acts early in the microtubule attachment process to promote an initial, bipolar, attachment of homologous centromeres to the meiosis I spindle, while the spindle checkpoint and exchanges act later to mediate reorientation of any improperly attached partners. Meiotic centromere pairing, exchanges, and the spindle checkpoint appear to act as independent mechanisms that together promote segregation fidelity in meiosis I.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Zip1, Zip2, and Zip3 are required for pairing centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes in pachytene</title><p>Centromere pairing occurs at two stages of yeast meiosis. In both stages, centromere pairing is homology-independent. In an early stage of meiotic prophase, before the synaptonemal complex (SC) has been formed <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Tsubouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, centromeres engage in a period of pairing with apparently random partners. Later, at pachytene with full SC <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> when the centromeres of homologous chromosomes lie next to each other, the centromeres of non-exchange chromosome partners pair in a homology-independent fashion. The early stage of centromere pairing requires the SC protein, Zip1 <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Tsubouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Here, we used a centromere pairing assay to determine whether the pairing of non-exchange chromosome centromeres in pachytene is also dependent on Zip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to obtain cells with a non-exchange chromosome pair, one copy of chromosome <italic>V</italic> was replaced with a homeologous chromosome <italic>V</italic> from <italic>S. carlsbergensis</italic>. These homeologous partners almost never experience crossovers yet disjoin in about 75&#x02013;90&#x00025; of meioses <xref rid="pgen.1000771-MaxfieldBoumil1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; their disjunction driven by homology-independent pairing at their centromeres in meiotic prophase <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Each of the non-exchange chromosome <italic>V</italic> partners had an array of lac operator sequences inserted near its centromere, and the cells expressed a lacI-GFP hybrid protein that could localize to the array, providing a GFP-tag that marks the position of that centromere in fluorescence microscopy experiments <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Chromosome spreads prepared from wild-type and <italic>zip1</italic> mutant strains were screened, using DAPI staining of the DNA, to identify those with the highly condensed chromosomes typical of late meiotic prophase. These spreads were then scored for the pairing of the GFP-tagged non-exchange chromosome centromeres. Wild-type cells exhibited about 60&#x00025; pairing of the non-exchange chromosome centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with earlier studies <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In <italic>zip1</italic> mutants the level of pairing was significantly reduced, to the baseline level of about 20&#x00025; typical of this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This baseline value of 20&#x00025; cells with one GFP focus is also the level of pairing observed between two heterologous GFP-tagged chromosomes, each with its own homologous partner <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This background level of apparent centromere pairing (one GFP dot) might result from the persistence of centromere clustering from meiotic entry <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> or low levels of pairing promoted by the weak dimerizing properties of GFP-lacI protein <xref rid="pgen.1000771-AragonAlcaide1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Chromosome spreads with a single GFP focus might also reflect loss of, or failure to detect, the second <italic>lac</italic> operator array. Control experiments (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) were performed to test this. In both wild-type and <italic>zip1</italic> strains the GFP-tagged chromosomes were found to be undetectable in about 5&#x00025; of chromosome spreads. Thus about 10&#x00025; of the chromosome spreads scored as &#x0201c;paired&#x0201d; probably had an undetectable GFP tag. This suggests that the <italic>zip1</italic> mutant chromosome spreads have a baseline of about 10&#x00025; pairing. Whether this reflects biologically meaningful Zip1-independent pairing of the centromeres or an artifact of the approach is not clear.</p><fig id="pgen-1000771-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000771.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Zip1p, Zip2p, and Zip3p are required for non-exchange chromosome centromere pairing and segregation.</title><p>(A,B) Isogenic strains carrying a GFP-tagged non-exchange chromosome <italic>V</italic> pair was induced to enter meiosis at 23&#x000b0;C.

If centromere pairing of the non-exchange partners promotes their disjunction, then mutations that disrupt the centromere pairing should reduce the levels of disjunction as well. To test this, we assayed the segregation of the GFP-tagged non-exchange chromosomes in cells that had completed meiosis I. The wild-type strains exhibited about 25&#x00025; non-disjunction in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This is slightly higher than the non-disjunction frequency observed for this non-exchange chromosome pair in our previous experiments <xref rid="pgen.1000771-MaxfieldBoumil1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and is likely due to the reduced incubation temperature (S.

Thus the absence of late prophase centromere pairing in <italic>zip1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>3</italic> mutants is correlated with a nearly complete loss of segregation fidelity of the non-exchange partners. The fact that all three mutants show slightly less than random segregation could reflect a limitation in scoring properly every non-disjunction, or could hint that there are factors beyond the Zip1 proteins that can promote the disjunction of non-exchange partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Zip1 localizes to paired and unpaired non-exchange chromosome centromeres at pachytene</title><p>Cells that are engaged in the global, homology-independent, pairing of centromeres in early meiosis exhibit punctate Zip1 foci, some of which localize to paired centromeres &#x02013; suggesting that the required function for Zip1 in this process is at the centromeres <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Tsubouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This raises the question of whether Zip1 is at the centromeres in late prophase to mediate the pairing of centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes. Evaluating the co-localization of Zip1 to specific loci in pachytene cells is complicated by the abundance of Zip1 on the chromosomes and the failure of a particular chromosome to separate from the others in a given spread. Nonetheless, in some chromosome spreads the non-exchange chromosomes are somewhat separated from the bulk of the chromosomes and it is possible to evaluate whether the non-exchange chromosome centromere regions (marked by GFP tags) co-localize with Zip1. For both paired and unpaired non-exchange chromosomes, the centromeres normally were associated with a line of Zip1 staining. However, the Zip1 staining in the area of the GFP-tagged non-exchange chromosome centromeres was not usually as intense as the bright, well-defined lines of Zip1 marking synapsed homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000771-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000771.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Zip1p localizes to both paired and unpaired non-exchange chromosomes.</title><p>A strain (DD728) carrying a GFP-tagged non-exchange chromosome <italic>V</italic> pair was induced to enter meiosis at 23&#x000b0;C.

In <italic>zip2</italic>, <italic>zip3</italic>, and <italic>zip4</italic> mutants the centromeres of some non-exchange chromosomes are clearly associated with a clear Zip1 focus while others are not. It is difficult to conclude too much from these experiments due to the variability of the Zip1 signal intensity across the <italic>zip2</italic>, <italic>zip3</italic> and <italic>zip4</italic> spreads, the difficulty in identifying non-exchange chromosomes that are completely separated from all other chromatin, and the limitations in ascribing a precise chromosomal position to a Zip1 focus observed in a chromosome spread. To more precisely probe the association of Zip1 with the centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes in meiosis we turned to a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Meluh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. To test first whether Zip1 can be detected at the centromere regions of chromosomes with ChIP, we prepared extracts from meiotic cultures at a time point with maximal levels of pachytene cells. These were used in ChIP experiments with antibodies raised against Zip1. DNA isolated from immunoprecipitates was used as a template in PCR reactions to probe for the association of Zip1 with centromere regions. As a first test of this approach we probed Zip1 association with <italic>CEN5</italic> of exchange chromosomes in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Zip1 association with <italic>CEN5</italic> could first be seen at four hours after the induction of meiosis and gradually increased as cells reached pachytene (12&#x02013;13 hours post induction in this strain background). The assay was then used to monitor Zip1 association with the centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes in wild-type and <italic>zip1</italic>, <italic>zip2</italic> and <italic>zip3</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>).

The observation of pairing between the centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes is reasonably straight-forward: the pairing stands out because the arms of the non-exchange chromosomes are not aligned <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. But this is not the case for exchange chromosome partners, which are aligned along their lengths in pachytene. Thus, in pachytene, the centromeres of homologous chromosomes are side-by-side, but whether they are actively paired cannot be determined by simple observation. If Zip1 acts to keep homologous (exchange) centromeres paired in pachytene, then in <italic>zip1</italic> mutants, the centromeres of homologous partners and their associated kinetochores, should be free to separate (within the constraints of flanking links such as chiasmata or SC associations, between the homologous partners). To test this we monitored the number of kinetochore foci in chromosome spreads of wild-type strains and <italic>zip1</italic> mutants. The gene encoding the kinetochore component, Mtw1, was modified to produce a functional, epitope-tagged Mtw1-13XMYC protein that could be used to detect the kinetochores in indirect immunofluorescence experiments. To allow the identification of chromosome spreads in which homologous chromosomes were paired, both copies of chromosome <italic>I</italic> were tagged with GFP at the centromere. Isogenic wild-type and <italic>zip1</italic> mutant versions of this strain were induced to enter meiosis and chromosome spreads were prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Chromosome spreads with condensed chromosomes typical of late prophase, and with paired <italic>CEN1's</italic> (side-by-side or overlapping GFP foci) were then scored for the number of Mtw1-13XMYC (kinetochore) foci. The average number of Mtw1 foci increased significantly (unpaired t test, p&#x0003c;0.0001) from 16.0 (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.4) in wild-type spreads to 23.0 (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.4) in <italic>zip1</italic> spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In the <italic>zip1</italic> spreads, we frequently observed doublet Mtw1-13XMYC foci that would be predicted if the kinetochores could separate slightly but remain tethered by flanking crossovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, arrowheads). In cases where the GFP-tagged centromeres had separated, the two GFP-foci co-localized with the two foci of an Mtw1-13XMYC doublet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This observation suggested that the observed increase in kinetochore foci might be due to an increase in slightly separated homologous centromere pairs in <italic>zip1</italic> strains. To test this notion, we assayed the pairing of a specific GFP-tagged pair of homologous centromeres (<italic>CEN4</italic>), in isogenic wild type and <italic>zip1</italic> mutant strains. These strains were modified to carry a <italic>tet</italic> operator array on the arm of both copies of chromosome <italic>VII</italic> (<italic>AMS1</italic>) and express a tetR-13XMYC gene fusion. Chromosome spreads were prepared from meiotic cultures of these strains. The chromosome spreads were first screened to identify those with condensed chromosomes and paired chromosome <italic>VII</italic> arms (one MYC dot). In these spreads we then measured the distance between the <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP dots. The <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP dots were categorized as being &#x0201c;paired&#x0201d; (0&#x02013;0.6 &#x000b5;m), &#x0201c;close&#x0201d; (0.6&#x02013;2.0 &#x000b5;m), or &#x0201c;far apart&#x0201d; (&#x0003e;2.0 &#x000b5;m). Representative spreads are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g005">Figure 5C</xref>. The <italic>zip1</italic> mutation resulted in a significant increase in spreads with <italic>CEN4</italic>-GFP dots that were separated but close together (8.3&#x00025; versus 23.7&#x00025;; p&#x0003c;0.005). This is the predicted result if Zip1 normally links the centromeres, and if in the <italic>zip1</italic> mutant the centromeres can separate within the constraints of the flanking crossovers, and is similar to an observation made previously by Tsubouchi and colleagues <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Borner1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Tsubouchi2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. If the &#x0201c;close&#x0201d; centromeres in the <italic>zip1</italic> mutant are being prevented from further separation by crossovers, this would predict that in the absence of flanking crossovers to keep the centromeres close together, the loss of Zip1 would be predicted to cause an increase in the &#x0201c;far apart&#x0201d; category rather than the &#x0201c;close&#x0201d; category. We tested this by repeating the experiment, this time monitoring the behavior of GFP-tagged centromeres of a non-exchange chromosome pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In this case the &#x0201c;far&#x0201d; category increased significantly (from 20&#x00025; to 60&#x00025;, p&#x0003c;0.005) when Zip1 was absent.</p><fig id="pgen-1000771-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000771.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Zip1 promotes the association of exchange chromosome centromeres in pachytene.</title><p>The association of homologous kinetochores was evaluated in chromosome spreads from wild-type and <italic>zip1</italic> strains.

The average number of Mtw1 foci dropped slightly as cells proceeded from linear to discontinuous SC (from 12.2 foci/spread, SD 2.4, to 11.3 foci/spread, SD 3.4) then dropped to a significantly lower number in cells with dotty Zip1 (5.6 foci/spread, SD 3.5, unpaired t test, p&#x0003c;0.0001), consistent with a clustering of the kinetochores concomitant with SC disassembly. In most dotty spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), one or a few of the Mtw1 foci overlapped, or were immediately adjacent to, the single Spc42 focus. Therefore as the clustering of Mtw1 signals is taking place, some of the kinetochores are becoming associated with the side-by-side SPBs. To test whether the clustering of the kinetochores indicates directed movement towards the SPBs as opposed to aggregation of the kinetochores independent of directed movement towards to SPBs, we tested whether the average Mtw1-to-SPBs interval size is reduced as the centromeres cluster. The distance between each kinetochore (Mtw1) focus and the SPBs was measured in chromosome spreads with clustered (fewer than twelve) or dispersed Mtw1 (more than twelve) foci from the &#x0201c;dotty&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;linear&#x0201d; chromosome spreads respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, and the average Mtw1-to-SPBs distance, normalized for the size of the spread, was determined.

In budding yeast, the spindle checkpoint provides a short metaphase delay when the cell is faced with chromosomes that have not achieved a stable bipolar spindle attachment <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Cheslock1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Shonn1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

If Zip1 acts to ensure that most initial microtubule attachments of exchange bivalents will be of a bipolar orientation, then loss of Zip1 should result in an increase of improperly attached bivalents and an increased need for the spindle checkpoint. We tested this prediction by monitoring the segregation of an exchange chromosome pair in cells deleted for the spindle checkpoint gene, <italic>MAD2</italic>, in <italic>zip1</italic> mutants, and in <italic>zip1 mad2</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

This 90&#x00025; level of correct spindle attachment exhibited by chromosome <italic>IV</italic> in a <italic>mad2</italic> mutant background is similar to the segregation fidelity of a non-exchange chromosome pair in wild-type cells and suggests that for both exchange and non-exchange chromosomes, in about 90&#x00025; of meioses, the initial attachment of the centromeres to the spindle is in a bipolar configuration. In <italic>zip1</italic> mutants (with a functional spindle checkpoint) we observed about 10&#x00025; non-disjunction. This result suggests the possibility that bivalents in <italic>zip1</italic> mutants experience elevated levels of improper microtubule attachments and the presence of a functional spindle checkpoint allows all but 10&#x00025; of the improper attachments to be corrected.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that the non-exchange disjunction process in budding yeast, like that in other model organisms, includes a period of centromere pairing that persists until just before the non-exchange partners disjoin on the metaphase spindle <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The experiments presented here begin to provide clues to the molecular basis of this centromere pairing. The synaptonemal complex component, Zip1 is shown here to be required for both the pairing of centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes, and for their disjunction. This result is in contrast to our earlier observations of the role of Zip1 in non-exchange segregation behavior using tetrad dissection. In that study we saw no large impact on non-exchange disjunction when <italic>ZIP1</italic> was deleted <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The explanation is that in <italic>zip1</italic> mutants, meioses in which the test chromosome non-disjoined did not produce tetrads as efficiently as those with proper segregation, resulting in an under-representation of non-disjunction tetrads. Similar observations have been reported by others <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Unlike the tetrad dissection approach, the approach used here, the observation of chromosomes in meiotic cells, directly measures the anaphase outcomes and is not biased by the viability of the meiotic products.</p><p>Two other proteins that are required for organization of Zip1 into a synaptonemal complex, Zip2 and Zip3, were also found to be important for centromere pairing and non-exchange chromosome disjunction. These proteins are not required for the period of homology-independent pairing of centromeres that occurs in early prophase (<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Tsubouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and unpublished observations), nor are they required for Zip1 to associate with centromeres according to our ChIP assays. We do not know how the centromeric association of Zip1 detected by ChIP corresponds to the Zip1 foci observed in immunofluorescence experiments. It may be that the ChIP approach identifies the centromeric association of small numbers of Zip1 molecules that might not produce the striking Zip1 foci seen by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>If Zip1 is able to localize to the centromeres in <italic>zip2</italic> and <italic>zip3</italic> mutants, then why do these mutants exhibit a defect in centromere pairing of the non-exchange chromosomes? One possibility is that Zip2 and Zip3 are required for the transition from the early stage of homology-independent centromere pairing (before pachytene) to the alignment of centromeres with their homologous partners and the initiation of synapsis as cells move towards pachytene. By this model, in <italic>zip2</italic> and <italic>zip3</italic> mutants, the centromeres of the non-exchange chromosome <italic>V</italic>'s (and all the other chromosomes) pair with random partners in early prophase, but are unable to release from those partners as cells proceed into pachytene. Indeed, Zip3 has recently been shown to block the initiation of synapsis at centromeres in the absence of recombination <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Macqueen1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In <italic>zip3</italic> mutants, precocious SC formation between non-homologous centromere pairs in early meiosis could be imagined to lock the centromeres of the non-exchange chromosomes to their early prophase pairing partners, possibly preventing the non-exchange chromosome centromeres from aligning with one another in pachytene.</p><p>The finding that Zip1 is at the centromeres of non-exchange chromosomes and mediates their disjunction raises the question of the nature of the structure that Zip1 forms at the centromeres. Electron microscopy was used previously to examine chromosome spreads from a strain carrying one non-exchange chromosome pair <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Loidl1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.

How the axial elements of the non-exchange partners were linked was not clear, but our demonstration of a requirement for Zip1 in the pairing of non-exchange partners suggests that Zip1 might promote the association of the non-exchange chromosome cores.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Centromere pairing and microtubule attachment</title><p>The centromere pairing of non-exchange partners in late meiotic prophase promotes their disjunction <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Consistent with this, at metaphase we did not detect any Zip 1 associated with the chromosomes suggesting that by that stage most Zip1 has been released from the centromeres.

As the SC is being disassembled, the numbers of kinetochore foci are considerably reduced suggesting an aggregation of the centromeres. This aggregation could in part be due to centromere-centromere associations (which have been reported in late meiotic prophase in many organisms, <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Stewart2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) but the fact that the kinetochores are moving closer to the SPBs suggests that some of the aggregation is by concentration at the SPBs. These findings are congruent with early observations of meiotic progression using electron microscopy <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Goetsch1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. These studies led to the conclusion that microtubules, emanating from side-by-side spindle pole bodies, begin establishing contacts with the chromosomes as cells exit pachytene.</p><p>By the time spindle poles separate to yield even very short bipolar spindles, the centromeres are concentrated at the two poles. Thus, most attachment of kinetochores to microtubules has occurred before the spindle pole bodies separate sufficiently to yield two foci (greater than 0.5 &#x000b5;m) in our fluorescence microscopy assays. Zip1 remains at centromeres as cells are in the process of forming kinetochore-microtubule attachments, and loss of most Zip1 from the centromeres occurs concomitant with, or just prior to, the formation of clear bi-polar spindles. The signal for the removal of the final centromere-proximal Zip1 remains unsolved. Zip1 could be released from centromeres as each one attaches to a centromere or the release could be global, as cells progress towards metaphase.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Zip1 mediates pairing of exchange chromosome centromeres</title><p>Though most easily evaluated with non-exchange chromosomes, the greater impact of Zip1-mediated centromere pairing likely lies in the behavior of exchange chromosomes. In the absence of Zip1, the centromeres of exchange chromosomes are often separated in chromosome spreads consistent with the notion that Zip1 can actively pair the centromeres of exchange chromosomes just as it can with non-exchange chromosomes. Recent observations by Tsubouchi and colleagues (2008) have led the to the similar conclusion that Zip1 acts to promote the association of the centromeres of exchange chromosomes, and this pairing activity can occur independently of SC assembly. This centromere pairing appears to promote proper bipolar spindle attachments of exchange chromosome pairs. The fact that the non-disjunction frequency of exchange chromosome pairs is only about 10&#x00025; in spindle checkpoint (<italic>mad1</italic> and <italic>mad2</italic>) mutants <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Shonn1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> demonstrates that alternative mechanisms beyond the spindle checkpoint can promote the establishment of a bipolar attachment of homologous centromeres to the meiotic spindle. The random segregation of exchange chromosomes in the <italic>zip1 mad2</italic> mutants reveals that Zip1 is a necessary component of at least one such alternate mechanism. These results suggest that the spindle checkpoint and a centromere orientation mechanism that includes Zip1 provide redundant opportunities for achieving bipolar spindle attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000771-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). By this model, Zip1 acts to promote the initial attachment of microtubules to partner centromeres in the correct, bipolar, configuration for about 90&#x00025; of chromosome pairs (the frequency of proper attachment for non-exchange pairs that presumably cannot benefit from a spindle checkpoint dependent re-orientation process). Those few bivalents that are improperly attached to microtubules then depend upon the spindle checkpoint for correction. These two steps probably occur only in this order. When the centromeres are first attached to the microtubules, the SPBs are side-by-side. It is probably not until the SPBs fully separate to produce a metaphase spindle that there is a sufficient interpolar distance to generate tension at the kinetochores of properly attached bivalents, thus stabilizing kinetochore microtubule attachments <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Lacefield1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>Whether centromere pairing is a widely conserved mechanism for promoting disjunction of exchange chromosomes is unclear.

Whether SYCP3, like Zip1, is contributing to bipolar attachment of the centromeres in mouse spermatocytes is not known. What is clear, primarily from studies of the segregation of achiasmate chromosomes from a wide array of model organisms, is that the recruitment of components of the SC to provide either linkage or centromere orientation of chromosome partners is a recurring theme in meiotic biology (for examples see, <xref rid="pgen.1000771-delaFuente1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Rasmussen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1000771-Page2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000771-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>).</p><p>Any process that reduces the workload of the spindle checkpoint could have significant implications for human chromosome segregation fidelity.

Because the radii of the chromosome spreads are variable the average Mtw1 to SPB distance for each spread was normalized by dividing by a factor that reflected the size of the spread. The following methods were used. Measurements were determined for twenty five nuclei with clustered Mtw1 foci (dotty Zip1 staining and fewer than 12 Mtw1 foci) and for twenty five nuclei with dispersed Mtw1 foci (linear Zip1 and over 12 Mtw1 foci). For each spread the distance from each Mtw1 focus to the SPB was determined (using Axiovision software) these Mtw1-SPB interval lengths were averaged. Next, the area covered by the spread was determined (using Axiovision software). The radius that would give a circle of that area was then calculated. The average Mtw1-SPB distance for each chromosome spread was then normalized to the size of the spread by dividing by the radius. The normalized Mtw1-SPB distances for the twenty five chromosome spreads in each category were averaged and the standard deviation determined. Note that for the clustered chromosome spreads, some Mtw1 foci contain multiple kinetochores yet the Mtw1-SPB interval for these foci is not weighted to represent this.
