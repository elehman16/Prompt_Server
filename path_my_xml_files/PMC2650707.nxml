But a major achievement has been the development of total mesorectal excision (TME) as a surgical standard and the recognition that the surgeon is the predominant prognostic factor. The benefit of preoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy (SCRT; five fractions each of 5 Gy), initially established by the Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial, has been demonstrated in conjunction with TME by the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group. The concept of combined neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (conventional radiation of about 50 Gy with chemotherapy) has not been compared over surgery alone with TME. However, the German Rectal Cancer Study Group recently demonstrated that preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) was better than postoperative radiochemotherapy in terms of local control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>Patients with histological proven rectal cancer staged T2N+ or T3 are randomized to receive either SCRT (25 Gy in five fractions of 5 Gy) plus TME-surgery within 5 days or RCT (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy, continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil) plus TME-surgery 4&#x02013;6 weeks later. All patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy (12 weeks continuous infusional 5-FU) and are followed up for 5 years. TME-quality is independently documented by the surgeon and the pathologist. Hypothesis of the study is that RCT is superior to SCRT in terms of local recurrence after five years. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, disease-free survival, complete resection rate (R0 resection), rate of sphincter saving resection, acute and late toxicity (radiation related side effects), and quality of life (including long term bowel function).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Similar long-term survival, local control and late morbidity have been reported for both concepts of preoperative therapy in non-comparative studies. In addition to other ongoing (and recently published) comparative trials we include a larger number of patients for adequate power, apply quality-controlled TME and try to avoid the adjuvant treatment bias by mandatory adjuvant chemotherapy in both groups. Further more, stratification of the initially planned surgical procedure and sphincter-preservation will generate valid evidence whether RCT will allow a less aggressive (sphincter saving) surgical approach.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent malignant disease in western countries. In Germany, more than 70,000 new cases occur yearly and approximately 40% are located in the rectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite major efforts in prevention/screening and significant improvements in surgical, radiation and medical therapy CRC is still one of the leading causes of cancer mortality.</p><p>Besides survival, a major problem in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is the thread of local recurrence, not only because of the limited therapeutic options but especially because of the impaired quality of life due to the intense pain and uncontrolled soiling (caused by faecal incontinence and/or mucus/blood from the tumour).</p><p>The last decade has brought advances in multimodality treatment of LARC. After the endorsement of postoperative adjuvant radiochemotherapy by a National Cancer Institute Consensus Conference in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], several randomized studies reported lower rates of local failure with preoperative radiotherapy than with surgery alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial, evaluating preoperative short-course radiotherapy (SCRT), found an advantage in overall survival compared to surgery alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The recently published results from the CAO/ARO/AIO-94 trial report that preoperative combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) is superior to postoperative RCT in terms of outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A major achievement in the treatment of LARC has been the development of total mesorectal excision (TME) as a surgical standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. So far, the only study evaluating preoperative therapy together with a documented quality controlled TME-surgery is the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group study. SCRT with TME was superior to TME alone in terms of local recurrence, whereas overall survival was similar in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The EORTC 22921 trial, already started in the late nineties of the last century and published recently, showed a similar reduction in local recurrence whether 5FU/leucovorin chemotherapy was given with pre-operative radiotherapy, after preoperative radiotherapy plus surgery, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In Europe, there is still much debate about the two different approaches to preoperative therapy &#x02013; SCRT and "long-course" RCT. Although having undoubted weakness, a recently published study of the Polish Colorectal Study Group comparing the two approaches reported no superiority for RCT in terms of either overall or local control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Even in the U.S., there is now increasing demand in considering the use of SCRT in order to better stratify for adjuvant therapy, because of the low probability of downsizing and therefore "unchanged" initial TN-staging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Our study, the Berlin Rectal Cancer Trial (BRCT) was planned in 2003 and enrolled the first patient in 2004. After initiation of the polish trial and the BRCT in Europe, a comparative trial very similar to the BRCT was conducted in Australia. This TROG/AGITG trial recently closed recruitment after enrolling some three hundred patients. In addition to the recently published polish trial we include a larger number of patients for adequate power, applied quality-controlled TME and tried to avoid the adjuvant treatment bias by mandatory adjuvant chemotherapy in both groups. Further more, stratification of the initially planned surgical procedure and sphincter-preservation will generate valid evidence whether RCT will allow a less aggressive (sphincter saving) surgical approach.</p><p>Hypothesis of our study is that RCT is superior to SCRT in terms of local recurrence after five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a two-arm prospective randomised multicentre trial.

The primary outcome measure is local recurrence after a follow up of five years. The secondary outcome measures are overall survival, disease-free survival and quality of life (including long term bowel function) after a median follow-up of five years. Further more, secondary endpoints are the complete resection rate (R0 resection) and the rate of sphincter saving resection, both analysed after surgery of the last patient recruited. Acute and late toxicity (radiation related side effects) will be observed after a median follow-up of five years.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial organization</title><p>BRCT has been designed by the Department of Surgery and Surgical Oncology (Charit&#x000e9;, Campus Berlin-Buch) in cooperation with the Department of Radiotherapy (Charit&#x000e9;, Campus Berlin-Buch and Campus Mitte), the Department of Haematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology (Charit&#x000e9;, Campus Berlin-Buch) and the Institute of Medical Informatics and Biometry (Charit&#x000e9;), Berlin, Germany.

The reference dose is defined in accordance to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurement report 50/63. All patients are irradiated in a prone position on a belly board with a CT-planned three-field technique with megavoltage photons &#x02265; 6 MV. An individual field shielding is obligatory by using a multileaf collimator. SCRT consists of single doses of 5.0 Gy in five fractions within one week up to a total dose of 25 Gy.

With the present trial (with 476 patients already enrolled and an interim analysis to be performed at the end of 2008), we aim to definitely clarify the role of the different preoperative therapy regimen in rectal cancer concerning local control as well as long-term toxicities and overall survival. Especially together with the so far unreleased data from the recently closed TROG/AGITG trial with some more than 300 patients (and an almost identical study scheme) our trial will help to finally decide on the efficacy to increase local control, so further investigation can concentrate on improving survival by selecting and modifying adjuvant therapy regimen.</p><p>Metastasis free survival and overall survival are mainly influenced by adjuvant chemotherapy in high risk patients. Because of the fact that the histopathological staging after RCT seems not to be a useful indicator for adjuvant chemotherapy due to downstaging, adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU is performed in both groups independent of the histopathological staging to avoid an adjuvant treatment bias.</p><p>In case local control will be equally influenced by both therapy regimens, further follow-up with long-term toxicities and overall survival could help to determine the best protocol in rectal cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RS and SB wrote the manuscript and are study coordinators.
