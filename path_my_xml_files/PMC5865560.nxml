LMWHs have reduced inhibitory activity against thrombin (FIIa) compared to factor Xa (FXa), a more favorable benefit&#x02013;risk ratio than heparin, and superior pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) properties.<xref rid="b1-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Enoxaparin is one of the most widely used LMWHs and is obtained by alkaline depolymerization of heparin benzyl ester derived from porcine intestinal mucosa. In contrast to UFH, enoxaparin has a higher ratio of anti-FXa to anti-FIIa activity, more consistent release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), weaker interactions with platelets, and less inhibition of bone formation; enoxaparin also has higher and more consistent bioavailability after subcutaneous (SC) administration compared with UFH and longer plasma half-life, and is less strongly bound to plasma proteins. These properties translate into a more reliable anticoagulant effect without the need for laboratory monitoring, and safety and efficacy have been well established in a wide range of both arterial and venous thromboembolic conditions.<xref rid="b2-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The currently approved originator LMWHs differ in their PK/PD properties. Because of difficulties in physical detection of LMWH, conventional PK studies cannot be performed. LMWH absorption and elimination are instead studied using PD surrogate markers, most importantly anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activity. To compare the biosimilar/generic version to the reference LMWH, both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend measurement of these PD activities;<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> moreover, measurement of the ratio of anti-FXa to anti-FIIa activity and the TFPI activity are also recommended by the EMA as secondary parameters.<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These PD properties should be investigated in a randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover and preferably double-blind study in healthy volunteers using SC administration. Accordingly, this article reports the design and main results of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing the PK/PD properties of a new biosimilar enoxaparin and its originator.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study conducted at the PRA Health Sciences&#x02019; Clinical Research Unit, Zuidlaren, the Netherlands. The clinical study protocol and the informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by the national competent authority and the independent ethics committee of the Foundation &#x0201c;Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch Onderzoek&#x0201d; (Assen, the Netherlands). The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC.</p><p>All subjects provided written informed consent before study participation. They were screened up to 30 days before first administration of the study drug and were admitted to the clinic on Day 1 of Period 1 for baseline assessments. Subjects were subsequently randomized to one of the treatment sequences (test&#x02013;reference or reference&#x02013;test). The test drug was enoxaparin sodium 100 mg (10,000 IU anti-FXa/1.0 mL), manufactured by Rovi, Madrid, Spain; the reference drug was enoxaparin sodium 100 mg (Clexane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 10,000 IU anti-FXa/1.0 mL), manufactured by Sanofi, Maison Alfort, France. Both drugs were similar in appearance and were supplied as pre-filled syringes containing a sterile, clear, colorless-to-pale yellow aqueous solution for SC injection. To ensure blinding, an unblinded pharmacist was responsible for dispensing the study drug, and a dedicated, unblinded team member administered the study drug.</p><p>On Day 1 of Period 1, subjects were given, in fasting conditions, a single SC injection of the test or the reference drug. Subjects returned to the clinic after a washout period of at least 7 days, and on Day 1 of Period 2, they were crossed over to receive a single SC dose of the reference or the test drug. Blood samples to assess PD parameters were collected in both study periods at the following time points: pre-dose, and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 36 hours after dosing on Day 1.

Subjects had no clinically significant abnormalities based on medical history, clinical laboratory results, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and physical examination findings. Exclusion criteria included body weight below 45 or 57 kg if female or male, respectively; calculated (Cockroft &#x00026; Gault formula) creatinine clearance &#x0003c;80 mL/minute; history of or positive test result for alcohol abuse or drug addiction; history of relevant drug and/or food allergies; any prescription drugs (with special attention to antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs) or over-the-counter medications that could affect coagulation within 4 weeks of dosing; administration of any investigational drug within 60 days of the first dose of the study drug; a positive test for the human immunodeficiency virus (1 or 2) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody; a positive fecal occult blood test at screening; history and/or current conditions of bleeding tendency; history of thrombocytopenia, including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; known history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a chemical structure similar to enoxaparin sodium (eg, UFH, LMWH) or to pork products.</p></sec><sec><title>PK/PD assessments</title><p>Due to difficulties in measuring plasma LMWH levels, the following plasma PD surrogate parameters were calculated for anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activity, and baseline-adjusted TFPI levels using noncompartmental analysis: area under the effect curve (AUEC) from time 0 to infinity (AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>); AUEC from time 0 to the last measured activity (T) (AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>); maximum activity (A<sub>max</sub>) observed for anti-FXa and anti-FIIa, and baseline-corrected TFPI levels; time to observed maximum measured plasma activity; ratio of AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub> of anti-FXa to anti-FIIa (R<sub>AUEC</sub>); apparent first-order terminal elimination half-life, apparent plasma clearance after extravascular administration (CL/F), and mean residence time (MRT), were also estimated (only if appropriate data permit it). PK/PD parameters were calculated using Phoenix Win-Nonlin Version 6.3 (Certara Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA).</p><p>The analytical method for the PD assays was developed and validated (good laboratory practice [GLP] compliant) at Anapharm Europe (Barcelona, Spain). Blood samples were collected into blood collection tubes containing citrate, theophylline, adenosine, and dipyridamole to assess anti-FIIa and anti-FXa activity, or with sodium citrate (3.2%) for TFPI assessment. Anti-FXa activity was determined by a chromogenic method using a commercial kit (Biophen Heparin Anti-Xa, ref no A221010, Aniara, West Chester, OH, USA); the anti-FXa calibration curve ranged from 0.075 to 0.481 IU/mL, with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.075 IU/mL. The inter-run accuracy and precision of 3 levels of quality controls ranged between 94.3%&#x02013;99.8% and 8.3%&#x02013;10.7%, respectively. Anti-FIIa activity was measured by a chromogenic method using a commercial kit (Biophen Heparin Anti-IIa, ref no A221025, Aniara); the anti-FIIa calibration curve ranged from 0.050 to 0.481 IU/mL, with an LLOQ of 0.050 IU/mL. The inter-run accuracy and precision of 3 levels of quality controls ranged between 96.3%&#x02013;103.0% and 14.5%&#x02013;17.3%, respectively. TFPI levels were measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Human TFPI ELISA kit, ref no Ab108904, Abcam PLC, Cambridge, UK); the TFPI calibration curve ranged from 0.156 to 10.000 ng/mL, with an LLOQ of 0.156 ng/mL. The inter-run accuracy and precision of 3 levels of quality controls ranged between 91.2%&#x02013;98.4% and 8.9%&#x02013;14.1%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>All adverse events (AEs) were coded using the MedDRA classification system, and frequency of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) was listed by system organ class and preferred term.

An analysis of variance with fixed effects for sequence, period, and treatment, and random effect for subject nested within sequence was performed on the natural logarithms of AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>, and A<sub>max</sub> for anti-FXa and baseline-adjusted TFPI levels, and the natural logarithms of AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub> and A<sub>max</sub> for anti-FIIa activity, to assess the differences between the test and reference treatments. The geometric mean ratio and 95% CI for AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>, and A<sub>max</sub> for anti-FXa and TFPI, and for AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub> and A<sub>max</sub> for anti-FXa of both treatments were calculated by the antilog of the mean difference and 95% CI of the log-transformed values. Since TFPI levels can be physiologically detected in human blood, for PD assessments in each period, the value of the baseline TFPI measurement (on Day 1) was subtracted from the Day 1 pre-dose and all post-dose measurements of TFPI; these were the baseline-adjusted values used in the analysis, with the exception that any negative result was set to zero.</p><p>PD equivalence would be concluded if the 95% CI of the ratio of the geometric least squares means (95% CI RGLSMs) between the test and the reference treatments for AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>, and A<sub>max</sub> of anti-FXa activity, and the AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub> and A<sub>max</sub> of anti-FIIa activity were completely within the standard 80.00%&#x02013;125.00% interval.</p><p>In addition, AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>, and A<sub>max</sub> of baseline-adjusted TFPI activity, as well as the ratio of the AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub> of anti-FXa activity to anti-FIIa activity, were considered as supportive secondary PD parameters for the biosimilarity assessment. Therefore, it was also assessed whether the 95% CI RGLSMs between the test and the reference treatments fell within the 80.00%&#x02013;125.00% interval.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 subjects were screened, of whom 46 were randomized and dosed in the study. Mean (SD) age was 26 (6) years (range, 18&#x02013;44 years), and mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) was 23.8 (2.8) kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 19.0&#x02013;31.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Thirty-three (72%) subjects were male and 39 (85%) Caucasian. Forty-four subjects participated in both treatment periods (2 subjects received only 1 of the study drugs), 43 subjects completed the study according to the protocol and 3 subjects were withdrawn during the study: 1 withdrew consent, 1 because of a protocol deviation and 1 due to AEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-12-575">Figure 1</xref>). The latter one presented syncope, dizziness, headache, pharyngitis, and pyrexia the day before study drug administration of period 2, and all these AEs were considered by the investigator not to be related to the study drug. The PD analysis set consisted of 43 subjects.</p><p>Following administration of a single SC dose of either the test or the reference enoxaparin compounds, mean peak anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activities were seen after ~4 and 5 hours respectively. Thereafter, mean plasma anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activities showed an initial rapid drop from peak activity followed by a slower decline. Mean peak baseline-adjusted TFPI levels were reached within ~1 hour after both treatments. Mean plasma TFPI levels subsequently showed an initial rapid drop from peak levels, followed by a slower decline. The shapes of plasma anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activity, and the profiles of plasma TFPI levels were similar for both enoxaparin compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-12-575">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-12-575">3</xref>).</p><p>When the test and reference drugs were compared, results showed that the 95% CI RGLSMs of anti-FXa activity for the PD parameters A<sub>max</sub>, AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>, and AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> were 94.6%&#x02013;105.9%, 99.8%&#x02013;108.0%, and 100.0%&#x02013;108.6%, respectively, and were therefore well within the equivalence interval of 80.00%&#x02013;125.00% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-12-575">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, the 95% CI RGLSMs of anti-FIIa activities for A<sub>max</sub> and AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub> were 94.7%&#x02013;112.6% and 90.9%&#x02013;117.9%, respectively.

It was designed in accordance to the relevant EMA guideline<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and consisted of a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 2-way crossover study in healthy volunteers using SC administration. Anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activity was selected as the primary PD endpoint, and the ratio of anti-FXa to anti-FIIa activity, and TFPI activity were secondary endpoints. The FDA guidance on enoxaparin sodium<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> was also taken into consideration for some aspects of the study protocol. The bioanalytical methods for quantitative measurement of anti-FXa, anti-FIIa, and TFPI activity in human plasma were duly validated and fully GLP compliant.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. Its double-blind design decreases potential bias during dosing, data collection, and evaluation of safety variables. The washout period of at least 7 days between study drug administrations in each period is an adequate margin to avoid any carry-over effect, considering the known elimination half-life based on anti Xa activity and the &#x0201c;five half-lives&#x0201d; criterion. The 80%&#x02013;125% interval is also appropriate because this is the most widely accepted interval for investigation of bioequivalence, not only for chemical medicines<xref rid="b8-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> but also for enoxaparin.<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Moreover, bioequivalence had to be concluded considering the more stringent 95% CI RGLSMs between the test and reference treatments, as requested by the EMA.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The 95% CI RGLSMs between the test and reference drugs for all PD parameters were within an even narrower interval, from 87.9% to 117.9%. Moreover, all 3 PD parameters of anti-FXa activity (AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>, and A<sub>max</sub>) fell within the tighter margin recommended for &#x0201c;narrow therapeutic index drugs&#x0201d;, that is, 90%&#x02013;111.11%,<xref rid="b8-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> which is very relevant because anti-FXa activity is the main factor that correlates with the expected efficacy and safety of enoxaparin. It should also be noted that bioequivalence was reached in both primary and secondary parameters. By contrast, in the pivotal PD bioequivalence study of 2 new biosimilar medicinal products of enoxaparin recently authorized by the European authorities, the secondary endpoints AUC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, and A<sub>max</sub> of TFPI did not meet the equivalence criteria,<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which were the same as established in our study. Similarly, in a previously reported bioequivalence study with a generic version of enoxaparin, the CI of the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub> (75%&#x02013;140%) exceeded the limits at both ends of the accepted criterion of 80%&#x02013;125%.<xref rid="b7-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> TFPI indicates biological activity in the vascular endothelium, which is different for each LMWH, and this secondary parameter may therefore add information on the effect of the tested product, as differences in TFPI release/activity may result from structural differences in higher molecular weight saccharide chains.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, these differences do not seem to have an impact on the proposed dose regimen of those biosimilar LMWHs, probably because regulatory authorities consider more clinically relevant the anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity.</p><p>On the other hand, our study may have some limitations. Several previously reported bioequivalence studies of generic/biosimilar enoxaparin compounds used lower dose strengths.<xref rid="b6-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, a 100 mg dose of enoxaparin has been found to have effects independent of changes in body weight<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b11-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and provides a significant number of measurable plasma samples above the LLOQ, which allows for accurate characterization of the terminal elimination characteristics of the molecules; therefore, the dose selected was in the sensitive part of the dose-response curve, as stated in European guidelines.<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Besides, the 100 mg strength is the enoxaparin dose recommended by the FDA for PD bioequivalence purposes.<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In addition, the intravenous route was not tested, despite the fact that enoxaparin may be used to treat acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, SC administration covers both LMWH absorption and elimination, and SC PD data are therefore considered to be more sensitive. This is the reason why both European and US health authorities do not require additional pharmacological studies for intravenous or intra-arterial use.<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Another interesting point to be discussed here is the clinical and regulatory implications of this study. Both European and US health authorities currently support the demonstration of biosimilarity/bioequivalence of a biosimilar/generic LMWH based on a strong and convincing physicochemical and functional data package and on comparable PD profiles. A dedicated comparative efficacy trial is therefore not considered necessary.<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b12-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Indeed, efficacy trials do not seem to have enough sensitivity or statistical power to detect differences in clinical endpoints, as they have never been able to detect differences between different LMWHs with evident differences in PK/PD and anti-FXa activity.<xref rid="b13-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This PD/PK study has therefore been used as pivotal clinical evidence for requesting marketing authorization in Europe of the biosimilar enoxaparin manufactured by Rovi through a decentralized procedure, which has recently ended with a positive outcome.<xref rid="b14-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Finally, it is worth commenting about the current debate on switching from an original biological medicine to its biosimilar. The FDA has approved several generic versions of enoxaparin under the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) pathway, which implies that the interchangeability of the branded enoxaparin with its generic version is fully allowed in the USA.<xref rid="b15-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Conversely, EMA considers LMWHs as biological medicines and does not regulate interchangeability, switching, and substitution of a reference medicine by its biosimilar, leaving this decision at the national level.<xref rid="b16-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Up to now, several national regulatory authorities, including the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board, the Finnish Medicines Agency, Healthcare Improvement Scotland, the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority, and Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany, have already taken national positions to endorse the interchangeability of biosimilars under the supervision of the prescriber.<xref rid="b17-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Indeed, a recent questionnaire-based survey, conducted between November 2016 and January 2017 among experts from several Central and Eastern European countries, showed that substitution and interchangeability of original biologic drugs and their corresponding biosimilars were generally allowed, although in most countries that decision was taken at the discretion of the physician after a clinical assessment and the biosimilars were usually in the same homogeneous group, and internal reference pricing was usually employed.<xref rid="b18-dddt-12-575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this clinical trial conclusively showed that the enoxaparin manufactured by Rovi is equivalent to the reference enoxaparin in all primary (anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activity) and secondary (ratio of anti-FXa to anti-FIIa and TFPI activity) PK/PD parameters, as required by the EMA to authorize commercialization of a biosimilar LMWH. The overall safety and tolerability profiles of both medicinal products were similar.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Laboratorios Farmac&#x000e9;uticos Rovi, S.A., Madrid, Spain.
