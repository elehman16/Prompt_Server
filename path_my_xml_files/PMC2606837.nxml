PKC&#x003b2; activation in diabetes is associated with loss of key protective trophic factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>), and with expression of proinflammatory mediators such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Much less is known about the role of PKC&#x003b2; activation in the pathogenesis of renal hemodynamic and molecular abnormalities in human diabetes.</p><p>Accordingly, in this pilot study, we hypothesized that ruboxistaurin would reverse the hemodynamic effects of diabetes and blunt the response to clamped hyperglycemia. In a post hoc analysis, we analyzed subjects on the basis of the presence of renal hyperfiltration during clamped euglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). We also examined the effect of ruboxistaurin on the excretion of the urinary biomarkers MCP-1 and EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>).</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>After giving informed consent, subjects (Table A1, with inclusion/exclusion criteria, is available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-1609">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-1609</ext-link>) adhered to a diet that was Na replete and moderate in protein for 7 days before each experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Euglycemic (blood glucose 4&#x02013;6 mmol/l) and hyperglycemic (blood glucose 9&#x02013;11 mmol/l) conditions were maintained on two consecutive days using a modified glucose clamp technique, and renal hemodynamic function was measured using inulin and para-aminohippurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Urinary biomarkers were measured by ELISA (Quantikine; R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) before and after treatment with ruboxistaurin or placebo, normalized for urinary creatinine. Subjects were then randomized (2:1) to ruboxistaurin (32 mg daily for 8 weeks) or a placebo in a double-blind fashion. All subjects were taking an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or a combination throughout the study. The University Health Network Research Ethics Board approved the protocol.</p><p>The primary analysis examined hemodynamic responses during clamped euglycemia and hyperglycemia before and after treatment with ruboxistaurin or the placebo. In a post hoc analysis, we analyzed subjects on the basis of filtration status (hyperfiltration, glomerular filtration rate &#x0005b;GFR&#x0005d; &#x02265;135 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; normofiltration, &#x0003c;135 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Between-group comparisons of all parameters at baseline were made using parametric methods (unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test). Within-subject and between-group differences in the response to PKC&#x003b2; inhibition were determined by repeated-measures ANOVA. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 14; SPSS, Chicago, IL).</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Baseline clinical characteristics are shown in online appendix Table A2. At baseline, mean &#x000b1; SEM arterial pressure was higher in the ruboxistaurin group (96 &#x000b1; 1 mmHg) than in the placebo group (81 &#x000b1; 4 mmHg) during clamped euglycemia. In the primary analysis, during clamped euglycemia, ruboxistaurin was associated with a reduction in mean arterial pressure (96 &#x000b1; 1 to 91 &#x000b1; 2 mmHg; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.032) but did not influence renal hemodynamic function. During clamped hyperglycemia (online appendix Table A3), ruboxistaurin was associated with declines in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and renal blood flow and a rise in filtration fraction (all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Ruboxistaurin did not change MCP-1, EGF, or the EGF&#x02013;to&#x02013;MCP-1 ratio in urinary excretion.</p><p>When analyzed on the basis of filtration status, hyperfiltration (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4) and normofiltration (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9) subjects were similar at baseline (data not shown). In hyperfiltration subjects, ruboxistaurin was associated with a decline in GFR that was significant compared with the response in normofiltration subjects (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). When analyzed on the basis of filtration status, ruboxistaurin was associated with a decrease in MCP-1 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.041) and a rise in the EGF&#x02013;to&#x02013;MCP-1 ratio (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.041) in hyperfiltration versus normofiltration subjects (online appendix Figures A1&#x02013;A3).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine the role of PKC&#x003b2; inhibition in humans with diabetes. Our major findings were that <italic>1</italic>) during clamped hyperglycemia, ruboxistaurin lowered ERPF and renal blood flow, and <italic>2</italic>) in a post hoc analysis based on filtration status, ruboxistaurin partially corrected hyperfiltration during clamped euglycemia, while MCP-1 decreased and the EGF&#x02013;to&#x02013;MCP-1 ratio increased in hyperfiltration versus normofiltration subjects.</p><p>Renal hemodynamic complications, including hyperfiltration, occur early in the natural history of diabetes and may in part be due to a hyperglycemia-mediated increase in PKC&#x003b2; activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Our first major finding was that during clamped euglycemia, ruboxistaurin did not significantly affect renal hemodynamic function. In contrast, during clamped hyperglycemia, ruboxistaurin lowered ERPF but there was no effect on GFR. Although from this experiment we could not determine why ruboxistaurin failed to lower GFR during hyperglycemia, the explanation may involve activation of redundant hemodynamic pathways, such as endothelin or cyclooxygenase-2, leading to the maintenance of GFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>).</p><p>We have previously reported that baseline GFR during clamped euglycemia is a determinant of renal hemodynamic responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). Our second major finding was that ruboxistaurin was associated with reductions in GFR and filtration fraction without affecting ERPF in hyperfiltration subjects but was not associated with such reductions in normofiltration subjects. Furthermore, the change in the urinary biomarkers in hyperfiltration subjects was consistent with protection against renal injury (a decline in MCP-1 and a rise in the EGF&#x02013;to&#x02013;MCP-1 ratio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Although we cannot determine the precise pathway responsible for these hemodynamic and molecular effects, we favor the theory that ruboxistaurin may have inhibited the effects of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilatation and a fall in GFR. The responsible mechanisms for these observations require further investigation in animal studies because these parameters cannot be assessed in humans.</p><p>This study has important limitations. We attempted to minimize the effect of the small sample size with homogeneous study groups, careful prestudy dietary preparation, and a study design that allowed each subject to act as his or her own control. We were also prevented from studying the independent effect of ruboxistaurin because of ethical concerns about discontinuing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in this proteinuric cohort of subjects. Therefore, the effect of ruboxistaurin may have been blunted by a preexisting renin angiotensin system blockade.</p><p>In conclusion, PKC&#x003b2; appears to play a role in the maintenance of hyperfiltration in patients with type 1 diabetes, and its inhibition results in a decrease in GFR and proinflammatory urinary biomarkers. The role of PKC&#x003b2; may be enhanced in hyperfiltration patients, suggesting that the impact of ruboxistaurin depends on filtration status.</p></sec>
