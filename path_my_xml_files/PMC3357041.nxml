Dental plaque is solely responsible for the initiation and progression of gingival diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The methods available for the maintenance of oral health are mainly mechanical and chemical. Tooth brushing is the most common mechanical method used to control plaque.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, toothbrushes are rare in many third-world countries, where locally available chewing sticks are commonly used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The most common type of chewing stick, miswak, is derived from <italic>Salvadora persica</italic>, a small tree or shrub with a spongy stem and root, which is easy to crush between the teeth. Pieces of the root usually swell and become soft when soaked in water.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Miswak is a chewing stick used in many developing countries as a traditional toothbrush for oral hygiene.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Reports on the oral health of miswak users are contradictory; several studies have claimed that chewing sticks are effective in reducing plaque and gingival inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] When used properly, the miswak is reported to be as effective as a toothbrush.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] It was found that the chewing stick removed plaque from interproximal sites to virtually the same extent as from other more accessible sites.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The conventional tooth brushing has been reported to be relatively ineffective for the removal of interproximal plaque.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The value of chewing sticks is believed to be in their mechanical cleansing action. The use of miswak has also been reported to inhibit the formation of dental plaque chemically and exert antimicrobial effect against many oral bacteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>However, some studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] have reported more plaque formation and gingival bleeding in individuals who used chewing sticks in comparison with toothbrush users. In few studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] it has been found that the toothbrush was more efficient as an oral hygiene aid than the miswak.</p><p>Surprisingly, despite the widespread use of miswak since ancient times, relatively little scientific attention has been paid to its oral health beneficial effects. In 1987, World Health Organization encouraged the developing nations to use miswak for oral hygiene because of tradition, availability, and low cost.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Recently, various authors have concluded that chewing sticks or its extract has therapeutic effect on gingival diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Thus, a study was designed to clinically evaluate the effect of miswak stick as an adjunct to tooth brushing on plaque levels and gingival health in subjects diagnosed with mild to moderate chronic generalized marginal gingivitis in comparison with those of toothbrush users.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty subjects diagnosed with mild to moderate chronic generalized marginal gingivitis were selected randomly from the out patient department (OPD) presenting to JSS Dental College and Hospital, Mysore.

Photographic images were analyzed by computer software (UTH SCSA Image Tool [IT version 2]) for the percentage of plaque coverage. The total labial teeth surfaces and the area covered by plaque were directly counted in pixels. The plaque area was then calculated in percentage of the total labial teeth surfaces.

The selection of miswak from the <italic>Salvadora persica</italic> tree for the present study was based on number of factors. The use of miswak is most common in the Middle East region and in the Indian subcontinent, its taste is acceptable,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] it is inexpensive, and has been reported to have anti-plaque and many therapeutic pharmacological properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>There are studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] on the comparison of toothbrushes and miswak for plaque removal. Reports on the oral health of miswak users are contradictory and published literatures suggest that its therapeutic role in oral health needs to be verified before implementing into general practice of dentistry.</p><p>Current dental literature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] describes several clinical indices and methods for measuring plaque and gingival inflammation, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The indices used to measure the accumulation of dental plaque and gingival inflammation are usually based on subjective estimations of the plaque-covered areas of the tooth surface and inflammatory changes of gingiva.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] However, these indices on an ordinal scale are visual determinations resulting in data of less sensitivity. Photogrammetric techniques giving measurements in an interval scale have therefore been used to obtain more accurate measurements of the plaque area.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study showed that there was a significant reduction in plaque score and improvement in gingival health after the use of miswak as an adjunct to tooth brushing method. The miswak stick when not used as adjunct to tooth brush was not effective as the conventional toothbrush in reducing plaque until 4<sup>th</sup> week. Later at the 6<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> week, there was significant difference in plaque score in toothbrush user compared to miswak user. This initial reduction in the plaque score among the miswak users could be due to Hawthorne effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The Hawthorne effect is a form of reactivity, whereby subjects improve or modify an aspect of their behavior being experimentally measured simply in response to the fact that they are being studied, but not in response to any particular experimental manipulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The effect might have resulted from subject's initial excitement of using a new product (miswak) and trying to get a good result out of their use. After some time, as the weeks progressed, there could be a probability that the subjects lost their interest in using the miswak effectively. On the other hand, toothbrush is a part of routine oral hygiene procedure and is being practiced by individuals since the eruption of first dentition in the oral cavity. The subjects under toothbrush group used it effectively until the completion of the study.</p><p>Various controversial reports on the mechanical cleansing efficacy of the miswak have been published. Previous studies have revealed that higher plaque and gingival bleeding in chewing stick users as compared with toothbrush users.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Studies have also revealed that poor oral hygiene with those using chewing sticks may be a reflection of poor techniques.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Furthermore, the difference in topographic design of handles and bristles of miswak stick might be other reason of poor plaque control in miswak users. Studies have revealed that miswak bristles are not similar to the toothbrush bristles that are used to remove plaque from the tooth surfaces mechanically.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Unlike a conventional toothbrush, the bristles of the miswak lie in the same long axis as its handle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The angulations in the toothbrush enable it to adapt more easily to the distal tooth surfaces, particularly on the posterior teeth. However, the techniques employed for removing plaque mechanically from outer surface and interproximal sites are similar with the toothbrush and the chewing stick, e.g., vertical and horizontal brushing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] These techniques primarily depend upon the people's attitudes, knowledge, and manual dexterity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] These mechanical differences were evident in our result also, and miswak bristles were not as effective as tooth brush bristles on outer surface area as well as interproximal area. These findings suggest that mechanically, miswak when not used in conjunctions to tooth brushes is not as effective as toothbrushes in cleaning the tooth surfaces.</p><p>In the present study, a standardized design was developed to minimize the effects of other variables, which could affect plaque control, including type of toothbrush and/or chewing stick (miswak), frequency of tooth brushing and/or miswak, and the technique of tooth brushing and/or miswak. The study condition was standardized by instructing all subjects on how to use the identical conventional toothbrushes and chewing sticks under direct supervision of investigator. Furthermore, all participants were issued with identical conventional toothbrushes and fresh chewing sticks of fairly uniform length.</p><p>Digital image analysis of plaque coverage was done for anterior region of dentition. Studies have revealed that in anterior region, the strokes and bristle angulations remain the same in both toothbrush and miswak stick and differ to great extent in posterior dentition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Thus, an attempt was made to measure the covered plaque area from matched mechanical cleansing procedure in anterior dentition, which was not possible in posterior dentition.</p><p>Our result showed a beneficial effect of miswak on gingival health when used as an adjunct to tooth brushing method. This change could be attributed to the effect of different therapeutic components reported in the extract of miswak. Mentioned therapeutic components have been shown to beneficially influence the gingival health and plaque inhibition in various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>Silica in miswak acts as an abrasive material to remove plaques and stains.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Tannins (tannic acid) exert an astringent effect on the mucous membrane, thus reducing the clinically detectable gingivitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Alkaloids exert a bactericidal effect and stimulatory action on the gingiva.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Essential (volatile) oils possess characteristic aroma and exert carminative, antiseptic action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] The sulphur compounds have a bactericidal effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Vitamin C helps in the healing and repair of tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, has mild abrasive properties and has a mild germicidal action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] High concentrations of chloride inhibit calculus formation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] These therapeutic findings of previous studies could be the reason for improved gingival health in the present study.</p><p>In the present study, subjects were advised to use freshly prepared miswak stick at indicated time interval. Previous studies have revealed that freshly prepared miswak sticks have no cytotoxic effect on periodontal tissue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] However, the same plant used even after 24 hours does contain harmful cytotoxic components and has potential to damage periodontal cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Based on these findings, we recommended cutting the used portion of the miswak after it has been used for one day and preparing a fresh part for the next use.</p><p>In the present study, miswak stick was used instead of miswak extract in mouthwash or toothpaste form assuming that miswak stick will provide both the mechanical and chemical effect supported by previous published literatures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] Our results showed beneficial chemical therapeutic action of miswak stick juice on gingival health, which was extracted on chewing miswak stick. No mechanical beneficial effect was observed when compared with toothbrush. Our results are in agreement with a controlled study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] where it was reported that powdered miswak if used with a mechanically proper device i.e. toothbrush, will give better results than miswak sticks alone or commercial toothpowder on gingival health. Presently, many commercial preparations are available in market as toothpaste, but no preparation presently exists in the form of mouthwash or in-office therapeutic medicament in the market. Thus, in future, well-controlled studies are required to evaluate miswak based therapeutic medicament, which can be used in treatment of mild to moderate gingival diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our results showed significant improvement in plaque score and gingival health when miswak was used as an adjunct to tooth brushing. Our findings clearly indicate that miswak cannot replace the toothbrush, but can be used an adjunct to toothbrush, utilizing the mechanical efficacy of toothbrush and chemical effects of miswak. Henceforth, in future, a well-designed study is required to ascertain the efficacy of miswak or miswak extract in the treatment of gingival diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil,</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Page</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Kornman</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The pathogenesis of human periodontitis.An introduction</article-title><source>Periodontol</source><year>2000</year><volume>1997</volume><issue>14</issue><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>11</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Theilade</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Experimental gingivitis in man</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1965</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>177</fpage><lpage>87</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14296927</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fischman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The history of oral hygiene products: How far have we come in 6000 years?</article-title><source>Periodontol</source><year>2000</year><volume>1997</volume><issue>15</issue><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>14</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Darout</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name><name><surname>Skaug</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chewing sticks: Timeless natural toothbrushes for oral cleansing</article-title><source>J Periodontal Res</source><year>2001</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>275</fpage><lpage>84</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11585114</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Almas</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Miswak (chewing stick) and its role in oral health</article-title><source>Postgraduate Dentist</source><year>1993</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>214</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khoory</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The use of chewing sticks in preventive oral hygiene</article-title><source>Clin Prev Dent</source><year>1983</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>11</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6607809</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akhtar</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ajmal</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Significance of chewing sticks (Miswak) in oral hygiene from a pharmacological viewpoint</article-title><source>J Pak Med Assoc</source><year>1981</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>89</fpage><lpage>95</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6785501</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Farooqi</surname><given-names>MIH</given-names></name><name><surname>Srivastava</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The toothbrush tree (<italic>Salvadora persica</italic>)</article-title><source>Quart J Crude Drug Res</source><year>1968</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>1297</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref9"><label>9</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>El-Mostehy</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Jassem</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Yassin</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name><name><surname>El-Gindy</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Shoukry</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Miswak as an oral health device.
