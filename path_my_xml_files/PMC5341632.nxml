The circulatory perturbations consist of elevation in heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (BP) (Stoelting, 1978), pulmonary arterial pressure (Sorenson <italic>et al</italic>. 1977), and cardiac arrhythmias (anesthesia by Ronald D. Miller, 5<sup>th</sup> Edition, Vol. 1) which occasionally lead to myocardial ischemia, heart failure, and cardiovascular catastrophes (Fox <italic>et al</italic>., 1977) in susceptible patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In healthy patients, these responses are generally well tolerated.

No single agent has been established as the most appropriate drug of choice. Many studies have been done using a combination of drugs to suppress the pressor response to laryngoscopy. In our study, we used lignocaine and nifedipine separately to observe the cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>The use of lignocaine hydrochloride intravenous (IV) in treating arrhythmias after myocardial infarction is well established. Use of IV bolus followed by IV infusion of lignocaine hydrochloride to control ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmias both intraoperatively and intensive therapy is well known. It is a local anesthetic with membrane stabilizing action on cardiac muscle and thereby decreasing the cardiac excitabilities.</p><p>Nifedipine is a widely used calcium channel blocker with profound smooth muscle relaxant properties thereby reducing BP. It is rapidly absorbed by sublingual route which is simple, economical, noninvasive method of controlling BP.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The present study was done to evaluate the efficacy of IV lignocaine and sublingual nifedipine against each other and against placebo in attenuating stress response induced (rise of BP and HR) during direct laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>Sixty patients undergoing noncardiac surgeries of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) health status Class I and II between the age groups of 18&#x02013;60 years and comparable height and weight were selected for this study.
