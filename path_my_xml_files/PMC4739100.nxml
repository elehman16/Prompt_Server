Women allocated to standard care received midwife-led care with varying levels of continuity, junior obstetric care, or community-based general practitioner care.

In the caseload model women are cared for by a primary midwife throughout pregnancy, birth and the early postpartum period. We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing caseload midwifery care with standard care and found that women allocated to caseload midwifery were less likely to have a caesarean birth, analgesia during labour, and an episiotomy; that fewer infants were admitted to the special care nursery; and that mother and infant safety outcomes did not differ statistically between the study groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These findings confirm those of other RCTs of midwife-led care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], suggesting that these models reduce interventions without jeopardising health outcomes.</p><p>Many of the RCTs of midwife-led care report increased satisfaction associated with being allocated to the midwife-led care trial arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, a lack of consistency in measuring women&#x02019;s satisfaction means that the Cochrane review <italic>Midwife-led versus other models of care for childbearing women</italic> was only able to report on satisfaction outcomes using a narrative approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While nine studies reported on maternal satisfaction, there was ambiguity around the concept of satisfaction, and inconsistency in the tools used to measure satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Overall, although the included studies showed a higher level of satisfaction among women who had midwife-led care compared with those who did not, the reviewers could not identify which aspects of care increased women&#x02019;s satisfaction. Other studies have reported associations between positive ratings of satisfaction and different aspects of care, such as conveniently located care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], safe care with skilled professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], positive staff attitudes and behaviours (e.g. respectful, kind, empathetic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], being remembered between visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], having an active say in decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], having enough information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], perceiving care providers as helpful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and a consistent philosophy of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Both team midwifery models (that include four to 12 midwives) and caseload midwifery models (where women are allocated a primary &#x02018;known&#x02019; midwife) have been shown to increase women&#x02019;s satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The type of continuity that matters to women has been extensively discussed; whether it is seeing the same care provider at each visit (continuity of carer) that is important, or if it is continuity in a broader sense, including the same team of midwives during all episodes of care, staff sharing the same philosophy of care, or consistency regarding guidelines, information and advice. The Cochrane review included ten trials in which midwife-led care was provided by teams, and only three trials of caseload midwifery, where there is a higher degree of continuity of carer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The difference between team midwifery and caseload midwifery relates to the question of continuity of carer, and whether or not it is important to women.</p><p>A review by Green et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found no difference in satisfaction between women who had a known care provider during labour compared with those who had not. This review suggests that there is no evidence that women who are cared for in labour by a midwife they have already met are more satisfied than those who have not. The authors argue that other aspects of care, such as trust and consistent advice, may be more important to women than being cared for by a midwife with whom a relationship has developed over time. They also argue that although most of the schemes that aimed to achieve continuity of care did so, there should be caution in assuming that continuity is the specific component that explains the higher rates of satisfaction observed in the new models. Their concerns were based on the inconsistencies regarding the definitions of continuity; that studies evaluated packages of care rather than continuity as such; that while results showed that, as a group, women in models with higher continuity were more satisfied with their care, these results had not been analysed to examine whether the women who were more satisfied were also the ones who received higher levels of continuity; and finally, the potential bias caused by disappointment with the randomisation outcome in women allocated to standard care. A critical review by Freeman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] found that the content of care was a higher priority for women than continuity of carer, and Waldenstr&#x000f6;m found that continuity of carer was less important in a birth centre setting, where satisfaction was more likely to be associated with the attitudes of carers, the philosophy of care, and the environment, as opposed to knowing the individual midwife well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In contrast to these findings, a summary of the literature by McCourt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] pointed to qualitative studies which all found continuity of carer to be important to women, particularly in labour.</p><p>Although evaluations of a &#x02018;package&#x02019; of care such as caseload midwifery do not allow conclusions about which specific aspects of care contribute to the outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], secondary analyses of the data can contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the significance of continuity of carer, and whether or not it is associated with satisfaction.</p><p>The primary aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of caseload midwifery on women&#x02019;s assessment of their satisfaction with antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care in hospital and at home. We investigated overall satisfaction with these episodes of care, as well as specific aspects of care, such as perception of emotional support, information and decision making, and whether care was provided in a competent way. A secondary aim of this paper was to explore the association between continuity of carer &#x02013; being one of the key components of the caseload midwifery model &#x02013; and satisfaction with care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population</title><p>The study used a two-arm, randomised controlled design, stratified by parity (first or subsequent birth), to compare caseload midwifery care with standard maternity care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The primary study aim was to explore the effect of caseload care on the percentage of women giving birth by caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This paper addressed one of the secondary study aims &#x02013; to explore the effect on women&#x02019;s satisfaction with care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Women were recruited from the Royal Women&#x02019;s Hospital (the Women&#x02019;s), a public tertiary women&#x02019;s hospital in Melbourne, Australia, which has over 7,000 births per year. All eligible women booking to have a baby at the Women&#x02019;s between September 2007 and June 2010 were approached to participate, except on occasions where no recruitment midwife was available (e.g. due to sick leave) or when all caseload midwifery places for the month had been already allocated. Inclusion criteria were: able to speak, read and write in English; singleton pregnancy; less than 24 completed weeks&#x02019; gestation and assessed as being at low obstetric risk at recruitment (more detail elsewhere) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Women who had had a previous caesarean section were excluded. Caseload midwifery was not available to women outside the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size calculations for the trial were based on 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a reduction in the caesarean section rate from 19 to 14&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,008) (with 95&#x000a0;% confidence). Given the rising caesarean rate, the data monitoring committee reviewed the sample size after two&#x000a0;years of recruitment to check if the study remained adequately powered, and recommended an increase to 2290 (1145 women in each arm). In total 2,314 women were recruited. To detect a 10&#x000a0;% difference in the proportion of women satisfied with an overall episode of care (a pre-specified secondary outcome of the RCT) from (52 to 62&#x000a0;% or 52 to 42&#x000a0;%, using 52&#x000a0;% as a baseline estimate from our previous study in a similar population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) required 410 per group (with 80&#x000a0;% power and 95&#x000a0;% confidence); therefore the trial sample size was sufficient for this difference to be detected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedures</title><p>Women were recruited to the study by research midwives when attending their booking visit at the antenatal clinic, and randomised after written consent was obtained and the background questionnaire (collecting demographic data) completed. Randomisation was undertaken using an interactive voice response system activated by telephone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ctc.usyd.edu.au/">http://www.ctc.usyd.edu.au</ext-link>) using stratified permuted blocks of varying size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Caseload care</title><p>Women allocated to the intervention received the majority of their care from a &#x02018;primary&#x02019; caseload midwife. If complications developed, the primary midwife collaborated with obstetricians and other health professionals and continued to provide caseload midwifery care. During pregnancy, women saw an obstetrician at the booking visit, 36&#x000a0;weeks and postdates (if required), and usually had one or two visits with a &#x02018;back-up&#x02019; midwife. The primary midwife was on call for the woman&#x02019;s labour and birth except in designated circumstances such as annual leave, sick leave, having already worked more than 12&#x000a0;h in a 24&#x000a0;h period, having more than one woman in labour, or if it was on one of the two&#x000a0;days per week that the midwife was scheduled not to work or to be on call. Care was then provided by a back-up midwife, or on occasion, by non-caseload midwives. The primary midwife (or a back-up) attended the hospital on most days to provide some postpartum care and provided domiciliary care following discharge from hospital. All care was provided according to hospital guidelines and protocols. During the trial there were 10 (at commencement) to 14 midwives employed in caseload, equating to 7.5 to 12 full-time equivalent midwives. Midwives self-selected into the model. They were recruited from within the hospital and externally &#x02013; and had to apply for a position. The only specific criterion was to have had two years experience post-registration, however other characteristics such as skills and midwifery philosophy were taken into account during the interview process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Standard care</title><p>For women allocated to standard care, options included midwifery-led care with varying levels of continuity, obstetric trainee care and community-based care &#x02018;shared&#x02019; between a general medical practitioner (GP) and the Women&#x02019;s, where the GP provided the majority of antenatal care. In the midwife- and GP-led models women saw an obstetrician at the booking visit, 36&#x000a0;weeks and postdates if required, with other referral or consultation as necessary. In all standard care options, women were cared for by whichever midwives and doctors were rostered for duty when they came into the hospital for antenatal, labour, birth and postpartum care. Care was provided according to the same hospital guidelines and protocols as for the women in caseload care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention fidelity</title><p>At trial commencement, the caseload midwives attended information sessions emphasising the need to adhere to the Women&#x02019;s clinical guidelines and to provide caseload care as defined in the study protocol. Adherence to intervention protocols was measured via interviews with caseload midwives at the beginning and end of the trial; regular meetings between caseload midwives and research team members; and data collected from the medical records. Intervention exposure measures included assessing the extent to which care was provided by the primary midwife (medical record data) and women&#x02019;s recollection of having had a known care provider during pregnancy, labour, birth and the postpartum period (women&#x02019;s survey data two months postpartum).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data collection</title><p>A postal questionnaire was mailed to all women two months after the birth, with the exception of those who had withdrawn, miscarried, had a perinatal death, or if either mother or infant had a serious medical problem. Reminder letters were sent to non-responders two and four weeks after the initial mail out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The questionnaire was largely based on previous studies of models of care conducted in Victoria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Likert-type scales (where &#x02018;1&#x02019; signified &#x02018;disagree strongly&#x02019; and &#x02018;7&#x02019; signified &#x02018;agree strongly&#x02019;) were used for a range of specific and global questions regarding women&#x02019;s satisfaction with antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care. Women were also asked about the presence of known care providers for labour, birth, postpartum hospital care and domiciliary care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Measures of continuity</title><p>Medical record data were obtained to describe intervention exposure. All other continuity variables (e.g. women&#x02019;s recollection of having previously met the midwife caring for her in labour) were obtained from the two month questionnaire (i.e. self-reported). Continuity in labour and birth was measured by the number of midwives who looked after the woman during labour and birth, and by the number of times a woman had met the best-known of these midwives before. Given that many women had a number of midwives caring for them in labour, it was decided that the midwife they had &#x02018;met most often before labour&#x02019; would be used to quantify a &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of known care provider. This dose variable was explored in single increments up to having met a midwife six times previously, then the remainder grouped as having previously met a midwife &#x02018;seven times or more&#x02019;. A further question on labour care was included &#x02013; &#x0201c;Would you have liked to get to know the midwife attending the birth better before you had the baby?&#x0201d; Continuity was not explored for in-hospital postnatal care, but women were asked whether they had previously met any of the midwives providing postnatal care at home (domiciliary care).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>STATA 10.0 and 11.2 were used for all data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The primary analyses were by intention to treat, that is, data were analysed by randomised group regardless of care received or of any protocol deviations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Where women were asked to rate their care by responding to statements on a seven-point scale, responses were compared by trial arm using the &#x02018;ologit&#x02019; command in STATA to undertake ordinal logistic regression (to make use of all the data on the scale). The results are presented as proportional odds ratios (ORs) and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs). Comparison of means was undertaken for continuous variables, using t-tests where data were normally distributed; otherwise medians were compared using Mann&#x02013;Whitney U tests. In the secondary analyses of satisfaction with labour and birth care related to continuity of carer in labour, binary logistic regression was used, and ORs 95&#x000a0;% CIs presented.</p><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the Royal Women&#x02019;s Hospital (Project 07/01) and La Trobe University Human Research Ethics Committees (Project 07/04).

In both trial arms, women had additional specialist obstetric care as required, and in both, a few women birthed elsewhere after having all their care at the Women&#x02019;s (e.g. preterm births while away from home).

During labour and birth, the primary midwife provided care for 58.4&#x000a0;% (573/981) of the respondents allocated to caseload care, and the back-up midwife for 49.0&#x000a0;% (481/981) of the women. Overall, 90.6&#x000a0;% of respondents allocated to caseload care were cared for in labour by either their primary and/or back-up midwife. Reasons women did not receive any care from their primary or back-up midwife during labour and birth included the midwife not being called or not being called in time, or that neither the caseload midwife nor her back-up midwife were available (e.g. if both had already worked the total hours permitted). A small number of women transferred care away from the hospital. In the postnatal period, 94.4&#x000a0;% (926/981) of respondents in the caseload group received some care in hospital by their primary and/or back up midwife. This included one to two&#x000a0;hours of postnatal care per day from the caseload midwife, with core staff providing other care as required. Most (92.8&#x000a0;%; 910/981) received postnatal domiciliary care by their primary and/or back up midwife. Again, these data are similar to those reported for the overall COSMOS sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Respondents at two&#x000a0;months postpartum</title><p>Of those who responded at two&#x000a0;months, background characteristics were similar between the trial arms (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Compared with the characteristics of the overall sample in the COSMOS trial, responders to the postal survey were slightly less likely to have a low family income (caseload 8.3&#x000a0;% of women responding to the two-month to the survey vs 10.8&#x000a0;% of the sample overall; standard care 7.6&#x000a0;% of women responding to the two-month to the survey vs 12.1&#x000a0;% of the sample overall); and to be receiving government benefits as the main family income (caseload 2.4&#x000a0;% vs 3.7&#x000a0;%; standard care 3.0&#x000a0;% vs 5.9&#x000a0;%). Responders to the survey were also slightly more likely to be born in Australia (caseload 60.4&#x000a0;% vs 58.4&#x000a0;%; standard care 63.0&#x000a0;% vs 57.7&#x000a0;%) and to have English as a first language (caseload 79.8&#x000a0;% vs 78.0; standard care 82.3&#x000a0;% vs 78.1&#x000a0;%) than those in the overall sample.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Participant characteristics of women responding to questionnaire two months postpartum</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="2">Caseload</th><th colspan="2">Standard care</th></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="2">

These findings are in keeping with many of the RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and the Cochrane review of midwife-led care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The ratings of care reported by women allocated to caseload midwifery were generally higher than those we have reported in RCTs of team midwifery care in similar populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Many of the studies included in the Cochrane review did not identify what aspects of care increased women&#x02019;s satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this trial, we evaluated a &#x02018;package&#x02019; of care, and cannot draw conclusions about which specific aspects of care contributed to women&#x02019;s increased satisfaction outcomes, given there were a number of aspects of care likely to have been different, including known care provider, shorter clinic waiting times, continuous support in labour, and more postnatal home visits. We did not seek to identify any one measure associated with satisfaction, but have presented comprehensive data on a range of aspects of care that together have contributed to women&#x02019;s increased overall satisfaction, as well as data on individual factors associated with increased satisfaction.</p><p>In terms of exploring if continuity of carer increases women&#x02019;s satisfaction, it may be that it is individual providers&#x02019; approaches to care rather than a known care provider that lead to increased satisfaction, as suggested by Green et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this study, as in all trials in the Cochrane review of midwife-led care, midwives self-selected to caseload and may have differed in some ways to standard care midwives; the caseload midwives might have had different personal attributes or philosophies of care. The secondary analyses we presented here on continuity of carer contribute to the debate, however these analyses were not conducted by intention to treat, so the results should be interpreted with caution. In the standard care group there was no association between knowing the intrapartum care provider and satisfaction with care, however this may be due to small numbers; only 9.0&#x000a0;% of women in standard care reported having previously met a midwife who provided labour care. We also explored the &#x02018;dose response&#x02019; to continuity of carer during labour and birth in the caseload care group. The sample size in each category was inadequate to provide sufficient statistical power for comparisons, however there was a suggestion that the more times a woman has previously met a midwife providing labour care (compared to not having met any of the midwives), the higher the overall satisfaction with care, up to a point where the woman has met one of the midwives four times previously. After this point there appeared to be no increase in satisfaction; however the study is underpowered to reach a conclusion on this.</p><p>On balance it seems reasonable to conclude that continuity of carer helps in part to explain the increased satisfaction in the caseload arm; however group allocation had a stronger effect than having a known care provider in the analysis we presented on overall rating of labour and birth care. Other factors are also likely to have an impact, for example women&#x02019;s views and experiences of any interventions, and caseload midwives&#x02019; personal attributes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The study findings need to be interpreted in context. This was a single site trial, including English-speaking women who were low risk at the time of pregnancy booking. The women in the study were more likely to be married or living with a partner or expecting their first baby and less likely to be born in Australia than the overall Victorian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The survey responders were also slightly less likely to have a low family income and to be receiving government benefits as the main family income than the trial sample overall, and slightly more likely to be born in Australia and to have English as a first language.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p>For women at low risk of medical complications, caseload midwifery increases women&#x02019;s satisfaction with antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care. Further work could explore the complex issue of the &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of continuity of carer that is required to affect women&#x02019;s satisfaction with care, at the same time ensuring the sustainability of the model from the workforce (midwife) perspective.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>COSMOS</term><def><p>COmparing Standard Maternity care with One to one midwifery Support</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>general medical practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHMRC</term><def><p>National Health and Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>the Women&#x02019;s</term><def><p>Royal Women&#x02019;s Hospital (Melbourne)</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HM, DF, MAD, TF, LG originally conceived the study and HM, DF, MAD, TF, LG, LA, UW contributed to the initial grant application.
