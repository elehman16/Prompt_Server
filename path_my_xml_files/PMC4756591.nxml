At the beginning of the app, participants selected the program in English or Spanish with or without audio narration. The educational content was presented in easily understood terms through multiple interactive media, including audio, video, pictorial, and textual information written below a sixth grade reading level. Eight chapters presented the following topics: Why protect against the sun? What is skin cancer? What is the chance of a KTR getting skin cancer? How do people get sun exposure? ABC rule for sun protection, frequently asked questions about sunscreen, and personal recommendations for you from the doctor. Each screen had graphics or images, for example, skin cancer occurring in non-Hispanic white (white), non-Hispanic black (black), and Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) KTRs.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Audio testimonials from KTRs recounted their experiences in the sun, and videos demonstrated effective sun protection strategies. Recipients engaged in 2 interactive quizzes with answers provided to reinforce recognition of skin cancer and the amount of sunscreen needed to cover the body. Recipients selected their usual activities with daily sun exposure and their customary sun protective behaviors. Recipient responses were incorporated in a tailored sun protection message that was given to the user at the end of the program. SunProtect was created in collaboration with the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies at Northwestern University.</p></sec><sec><title>KTR Sample and Recruitment</title><p>Recipients were eligible to participate if they: (1) had a history of kidney transplantation within the past 2 to 24 months; (2) spoke and read English or Spanish; (3) were between the ages of 18 and 85 years old; (4) could see to read a newspaper; (5) lived in the greater Chicago area; and (6) self-identified as white, black, or Hispanic. Recipients were excluded from the study if they had a previous history of skin cancer as self-reported or noted in their medical record, received education about sun protection or participated in our previous educational sun protection study, experienced kidney rejection, if they were visually impaired, or comorbid diseases prevented participation.</p><p>Recruitment for the randomized control trial was performed at Northwestern Medicine (NM) and the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System (UIC). At NM, a list of adult KTRs was created from a database of patients who had received a kidney transplant within the past 2 to 24 months. At NM, 3 letters were mailed to potentially eligible subjects explaining the research study and inquiring about their interest in participation. Two weeks after mailing each letter, research coordinators called recipients to inquire about their interest in the study. At UIC, the research coordinator identified potential participants from nephrology appointments in the previous year. The potential UIC recipients were called to inquire about their interest in the study. Accrual was purposefully stratified to obtain representation of all 3 ethnic/racial groups in both arms of the study (control vs intervention).</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>From May 30 to July 15, 2014, participants were randomized either to receive SunProtect, the educational intervention, or usual education (control). Customary sun protection education consisted of 2 to 3 sentences in the binder provided at the time of transplant surgery, and during the summer, some clinicians gave verbal reminders to wear sunscreen. During the participant's baseline visit, 1 of 4 research coordinators&#x02014;1 Hispanic woman, 1 Hispanic man, 1 white woman, and 1 black woman&#x02014;reviewed the informed consent with the participant. The research coordinators gave participants a brief tutorial about operating the tablet, which was used to obtain baseline measures before randomization. Randomization was performed using stratified random blocks using R Core Team<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> to assure equal allocation to groups over the accrual period, in total, as well as within ethnic/racial groups. The research assistants were available to assist if the program failed to launch and to observe the participants as they used the tablet in the doctor's office. The duration of program use was recorded by the program, which made it possible to assess compliance with use of the program.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>During the next 5 weeks, 2 reminders were provided to intervention group participants as telephone calls, text messages, or email messages depending on the participant's preference. Control and intervention participants received reminders about the upcoming visit.</p><p>The follow-up visit was scheduled 6 weeks after the baseline visit. Participants received US $30 gift cards after completing the baseline visit and US $50 gift cards after the follow-up visit in appreciation of their time. The Institutional Review Boards of Northwestern University and UIC approved the study, and written informed consent was provided by all participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Participants completed the same self-reported survey in either English or Spanish at the baseline survey and 6 weeks later. At baseline, participants also responded to demographic questions and health literacy items. At both baseline and follow-up, the validated self-reported measures<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> assessed: (a) knowledge of skin cancer and sun protection (10 items; range, 1-10), (b) concern about developing skin cancer (2 items; range, 1-10), (c) recognizing personal skin cancer risk (1 item; range, 1-5), (d) confidence in sun protection preventing skin cancer (2 items; range, 2-10), importance of and confidence in using regular sun protection behavior (10 items; range, 10-50), (e) willingness to change use of sun protection (20 items; range, 20-100), (f) use of sun protection (sunscreen, shirt, sunglasses, and shade) (20 items; range, 20-100), (g) painful sunburn or skin irritation from the sun in the prior week (2 items; range, 1-10), and (h) daily hours outdoors (1 item; range, 0.5-6 hours). The higher score in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior items (items a-f) indicated better knowledge, attitudes, and sun protection behavior. For the number of sunburns or skin irritation and daily hours outdoors (items g and h), the lower number indicated better protection.</p><p>At baseline, the following demographic information was obtained: race/ethnicity, sex, age, marital status, skin type (ease of sunburn/skin irritation and tanning/getting darker after sun exposure, which are grouped into categories I, II-IV, V-VI), education, annual household income, months since transplant, and history of sun-related work.</p><p>At each visit (preintervention and postintervention), the melanin index, a measure of skin pigmentation, was obtained in the following locations: (1) right forearm in sun exposed skin; (2) right midcheek below the cheekbone in sun exposed skin; and (3) right upper inner arm in sun protected skin, which was the natural or constitutive skin tone. Noninvasive skin pigmentation measurements were taken using a spectrophotometer, using the area under the intensity curve along the 450- to 615-nm wavelength interval of reflected light having a range of 1 to 1000 with the lower range associated with light skin color and higher range with dark skin color.

The primary finding was that KTRs, who used SunProtect, improved their knowledge, concern about getting skin cancer, recognition of the personal risk of getting skin cancer, confidence in sun protection preventing skin cancer, and willingness to change sun protection. A secondary finding was that KTRs with skin types that have sunburn/skin irritation from the sun and can tan or get darker after sun exposure (II-IV) changed their use of sun protection after receiving the educational program and reduced the number of sunburns/skin irritation in the prior week and the daily number of hours outdoors.</p><p>A threshold UVI of 3 or more was exceeded on 118 of 123 days of this study; therefore, there was sufficient ambient sunlight to darken skin.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Forearm skin pigmentation was significantly reduced in the intervention group with skin types II-IV, which confirms the self-reported increase in participants' use of sun protection. Forearm pigmentation did not achieve a significant difference between the intervention and control groups for those with skin types V to VI. Sun exposure was restricted in this low income urban group of black KTRs, who had less than 1 hour of daily sun exposure. In comparison, in the general US adult population the norm for outdoor exposure is 2.4 hours per day.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> At baseline, 24% of KTRs in this study reported sunburn and an additional 17% reported irritation of the skin after sun exposure. Thus, the 41% of KTRs in this study with skin reacting to the sun was comparable to the general US population in which 42% of white adults, with a subset of the white adults who self-identify as Hispanic (20%), sustaining at least 1 sunburn annually.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Although black and Hispanic KTRs have greater photoprotection due to their increased epidermal melanin, there are individuals in these groups who have sun sensitivity which is a risk factor for skin cancer.</p><p>Sun sensitivity, which in whites is expressed as sunburn with the skin becoming pink or red after exposure to 1 hour of noonday sun without using sunscreen may be expressed in people with skin of color (Hispanics and blacks) as skin irritation after sun exposure.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Race/ethnicity is a poor proxy for sunburn and skin cancer risk because of the range of skin pigmentation in racial/ethnic minority people with skin of color and other individual risk factors for skin cancer (eg, immunosuppression, personal or family history of skin cancer, occupation and recreational sun exposure, and residence in tropical locations). The range of sun sensitivity in Hispanics is similar to the range in whites.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Hispanics, who have considerable diversity in the amount of pigment in the skin, have a misconception that their skin pigment protects against skin cancer.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Although darker skin pigmentation has some protective effect, ultraviolet radiation (sunlight) is linked to DNA damage and skin carcinogenesis across all skin types.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>This study has strengths in including recipients across the health literacy spectrum and recipients from racial/ethnic minorities, but it also has some limitations. Participation among recipients from racial/ethnic minorities was low. Generalization among KTRs with skin of color will be limited by normative beliefs regarding the relevance of getting a skin cancer and importance of sun protection. Barriers to recruitment of Hispanic and Black KTRs were normative beliefs and transportation to the medical center, which resulted in lower participation than among whites. Some of these urban participants had very limited outdoor exposure, which made sun protection irrelevant to them. Program limitations made it impossible to know if subjects opened the text or email reminders. It was not feasible to offer SunProtect online during the 6 weeks of the study because most minority KTRs lacked home Internet access.</p><p>Skin cancer risk among KTRs can be modified by shifting KTRs to lower levels of sun exposure. English and Spanish delivery of SunProtect by tablet with audio narration made it possible for KTRs to access the culturally sensitive program. SunProtect enabled sun protection self-management by KTRs. Future research will provide sun protection education to KTRs with unlimited access to a mobile app, seek ways to enhance the relevance of sun protection behaviors for those with skin of color, and evaluate the sustainability of sun protection by KTRs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Mary J.
