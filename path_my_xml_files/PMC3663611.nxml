Paliperidone ER has demonstrated efficacy in the reduction of acute schizophrenia symptoms in 6-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials and clinical benefits were maintained in the longer-term according to extension studies of up to 52 weeks in duration. Compared with quetiapine, paliperidone ER was associated with a more rapid symptom improvement. In addition, it was more effective than placebo in the prevention of symptom recurrence. Paliperidone ER is generally well tolerated with a predictable adverse event profile. Like risperidone, it is associated with a dose-dependent risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin elevation. Short- and longer-term studies have indicated a low liability for paliperidone ER to cause metabolic (ie, weight gain, hyperglycaemia and lipid dysregulation) or cardiovascular adverse effects. Available safety data from elderly patients appear to be promising. Due to negligible hepatic biotransformation, paliperidone ER is unlikely to be involved in clinically significant metabolic drug-drug interactions. Additional active comparator trials evaluating efficacy, tolerability and cost-effectiveness are required to better define the role of paliperidone ER in the treatment of schizophrenia in relation to other currently available second-generation antipsychotics, particularly risperidone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>paliperidone</kwd><kwd>risperidone</kwd><kwd>antipsychotics</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>tolerability</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia is a relatively common, severe and debilitating mental illness. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by positive and negative symptoms and often associated with cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms. The course of the illness is generally chronic, with relapses in psychotic episodes, cognitive reduction, social decline and poor quality of life. The aims of schizophrenia treatment are rapid symptom elimination, relapse prevention and reduction of illness severity, as well as improving social functioning and relationships. Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay for the treatment of schizophrenia and include &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;first-generation&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;atypical&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;second-generation&#x0201d; compounds.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jcnsd-3-2011-027">1</xref> During the last decade, second-generation antipsychotics have become the treatment of choice due to the perception of a more favourable tolerability profile and a broader spectrum of clinical activity involving not only the positive psychotic symptoms, but also the negative and cognitive aspects of schizophrenia as compared to first-generation agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jcnsd-3-2011-027">1</xref> Indeed, with respect to safety, newer antipsychotics, including clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole and amisulpride, have represented clear progress in their low propensity to produce acute extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jcnsd-3-2011-027">2</xref> On the other hand, the promise of efficacy of newer antipsychotics against negative and cognitive symptoms has not been borne out.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jcnsd-3-2011-027">3</xref> Additionally, atypical antipsychotics have been associated with differential risk of metabolic (weight gain, hyperglycaemia and lipid dysregulation) and cardiovascular adverse effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jcnsd-3-2011-027">2</xref> Two large, non-commercial clinical trials have called into question the degree to which second-generation antipsychotics represent a significant advance in therapeutic effectiveness compared with traditional compounds in schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jcnsd-3-2011-027">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jcnsd-3-2011-027">5</xref> In particular, the results of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study demonstrated that partial and non-adherence is still very common among patients treated with antipsychotics, often leading to high rates of treatment discontinuation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jcnsd-3-2011-027">5</xref> For these reasons, an advance in pharmacological therapy of schizophrenia is required, focusing on novel agents with potential benefits not only in terms of improved tolerability and efficacy, but which may also improve patient compliance.</p><p>Paliperidone or 9-hydroxyrisperidone is the most recently available atypical antipsychotic and the primary active metabolite of risperidone, a well-established second-generation antipsychotic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jcnsd-3-2011-027">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-jcnsd-3-2011-027">10</xref> Paliperidone has been developed as an extended-release (ER) tablet formulation that uses an osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system (OROS) technology, allowing once-daily administration and constant drug delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jcnsd-3-2011-027">11</xref> This formulation consists of an osmotically active trilayer core, composed of two distinct drug layers and an osmotic push layer, surrounded by a subcoat and a semipermeable membrane. Paliperidone ER is approved in the US and EU for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults. In the US, paliperidone ER is also indicated for the acute treatment of schizoaffective disorder, as monotherapy or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants. Paliperidone is also available in the US as a long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone palmitate which is outside the aim of this review.</p><p>Over the past few years, several reviews have been published covering the pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy and tolerability of paliperidone ER in the management of schizophrenia and other related psychotic disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jcnsd-3-2011-027">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-jcnsd-3-2011-027">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jcnsd-3-2011-027">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-jcnsd-3-2011-027">19</xref> This article provides an updated overview on the safety and efficacy profile of paliperidone ER in the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of Action</title><p>Paliperidone and its parent drug risperidone possess a similar pharmacological profile in vitro. Like risperidone, the therapeutic effects of paliperidone are thought to be mainly related to its antagonism at both dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and serotonin 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, with a higher affinity for 5HT<sub>2A</sub> (Ki 0.22&#x02013;0.25 nM) than D<sub>2</sub> (Ki 4.6 M).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-jcnsd-3-2011-027">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-jcnsd-3-2011-027">21</xref> Paliperidone is also an antagonist at H<sub>1</sub>-histaminergic receptors, &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, which may explain weight gain, orthostatic hypotension or sedative side effects, while it is devoid of significant interaction with cholinergic muscarinic receptors and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors. Paliperidone is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, ie, (+)- and (&#x02212;)-paliperidone, which have comparable pharmacological activity in vitro.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-jcnsd-3-2011-027">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-jcnsd-3-2011-027">23</xref></p><p>Brain imaging studies in patients with schizophrenia have suggested that dosages of paliperidone ER between 9 mg/day provide an estimated level of D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy of 70%&#x02013;80%, a range which is associated with optimal efficacy, with no significant difference between the striatum and the temporal cortex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-jcnsd-3-2011-027">24</xref> A study using in vitro models with human cloned D<sub>2</sub> receptors in tissue cultures has documented that the offrate for dissociation from D<sub>2</sub> receptors is faster for paliperidone (60 sec) as compared to risperidone (27 min).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jcnsd-3-2011-027">25</xref> Theoretically, due to the more rapid dissociation from the D<sub>2</sub> receptors, paliperidone should be associated with a reduced risk of EPS than its parent drug.</p><p>An in vivo electrophysiological study in rats has documented a differential effect of risperidone and paliperidone on the firing activity of serotonin and noradrenaline neurons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jcnsd-3-2011-027">26</xref> Paliperidone reversed the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced inhibition of noradrenaline neuronal firing, without interfering with the effect of SSRIs on serotonin neuronal activity, suggesting that paliperidone may be an effective adjunct in SSRI-resistant depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolism and Pharmacokinetic Profile</title><p>Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the formation of paliperidone from risperidone is catalyzed by CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jcnsd-3-2011-027">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jcnsd-3-2011-027">29</xref> The pharmacokinetic profile of paliperidone, administered by itself as an immediate- or extended-release formulation, has been investigated in studies in healthy volunteers or patients with schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-jcnsd-3-2011-027">30</xref> Some of the available information results from abstracts and from the US FDA manifacturer&#x02019;s prescribing information and EU summary of product characteristics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-jcnsd-3-2011-027">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-jcnsd-3-2011-027">23</xref></p><p>The single-dose pharmacokinetics of three different paliperidone formulations (1 mg paliperidone IR solution, 3 mg paliperidone ER or 1 mg paliperidone intravenous infusion) were initially investigated in a cross-over study in 20 healthy volunteers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jcnsd-3-2011-027">31</xref> The paliperidone ER formulation had a slow ascending concentration-time profile with a time to maximum plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) reached around 24 hours in contrast to the paliperidone IR formulation for which t<sub>max</sub> was reached 1&#x02013;2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of the ER formulation was 28%, compared with 106% for the IR formulation. The lower bioavailability of the ER formulation was attributed to its release characteristics with reduced absorption in the colon.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of paliperidone ER after single and multiple 3 mg doses and single 6, 9 or 12 mg doses were investigated in healthy volunteers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jcnsd-3-2011-027">32</xref> The plasma concentration-time profile of paliperidone ER after a single dose exhibited a gradual ascending increase in plasma concentrations over a period of 24 hours. Paliperidone was eliminated with a terminal half-life of approximately 24 hours. The pharmacokinetics of paliperidone ER displayed dose-proportionality over the dose range of 3&#x02013;12 mg/day. After multiple-dose administration, steady-state was achieved after 4 daily doses. Paliperidone ER provided minimal fluctuations in plasma concentrations and the mean steady-state peak-to-trough ratio was 1.7 with a range of 1.2&#x02013;3.1.</p><p>Paliperidone is rapidly distributed in humans with an apparent volume of distribution of 487 L.

Few studies are currently available on metabolic drug interactions with paliperidone ER. A randomized, crossover study has examined the effect of paroxetine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, 20 mg/day, on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of paliperidone ER 3 mg in 60 healthy male subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-jcnsd-3-2011-027">41</xref> The mean peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of paliperidone were slightly higher and its clearance was slightly lower following coadministration of paliperidone ER with paroxetine. The increase in total exposure to paliperidone was not considered clinically relevant. Coadministration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of various CYP isoforms, 200 mg twice daily, was found to decrease the mean steady-state C<sub>max</sub> and the AUC of paliperidone by approximately 37%, mostly due to a 35% increase in the renal clearance of paliperidone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-jcnsd-3-2011-027">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-jcnsd-3-2011-027">23</xref> This was likely due to induction of renal P-glycoprotein by carbamazepine.

However, as no direct clinical comparison between paliperidone ER and risperidone is currently available, it is not possible to verify if the lower fluctuations of plasma drug levels and the subsequent more stable D<sub>2</sub>-receptor occupancy associated with the innovative formulation may confer to paliperidone ER a reduced EPS liability than oral risperidone.

However, the clinical relevance of increased serum prolactin levels is still poorly understood, partly related to methodological limitations of the available paliperidone ER studies. With regard to this, data on prolactin-related adverse events were collected through spontaneous reporting, possibly leading to an under-recognition. Moreover, with the exception of the open-label 52-week trials, the duration of most studies was too short to evaluate more deeply long-term prolactin-related adverse effects such as menstrual irregularities, breast enlargement or decreased bone mineral density/osteoporosis. Direct comparison between paliperidone ER and risperidone in terms of prolactin elevation is still lacking. This may be of interest also in view of the increasing evidence suggesting that paliperidone and not risperidone might be the main contributor to the increased serum levels of prolactin observed in many patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-jcnsd-3-2011-027">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-jcnsd-3-2011-027">55</xref> As the potency to stimulate prolactin secretion is comparable between risperidone and its metabolite, this effect has been attributed to the higher plasma levels of paliperidone, to its lower brain-to-plasma ratio (anterior pituitary is located outside the blood-brain barrier) and longer half-life compared to parent drug.

Moreover, the gradual and continuous paliperidone release should increase the possibility to achieve stable D<sub>2</sub>-receptor occupancy. Theoretically, the use of this formulation should ensure an efficacious relapse prevention and should minimize the risk of adverse effects presumably related to peak concentrations, including those occurring in the first few days of treatment with rapidly increasing doses, ie, acute dystonia and postural hypotension. With regard to pharmacokinetic properties, paliperidone is characterized by negligible hepatic metabolism. As a consequence, paliperidone ER should be associated with a lower potential for metabolic drug interactions as compared with risperidone. In addition, this agent should have a reduced liability to cause unexpected over- or under-dosages related to CYP2D6 genetic variability and may be an appropriate choice for patients with hepatic impairment. Although paliperidone and risperidone share many pharmacodynamic properties, some differences have been documented between parent drug and metabolite (ie, off-rate dissociation from D<sub>2</sub> receptors and affinity for P-glycoprotein) whose potential clinical consequences are still unknown. At this time, however, the expected clinical benefits of paliperidone ER when compared to risperidone and other currently available second-generation antipsychotics have been only partially fulfilled.</p><p>Randomized, double-blind trials have documented that paliperidone ER is more effective than placebo for the acute treatment of schizophrenia and for the prevention of relapses. Evidence from the open-label extension phases of the short-term trials have indicated that symptom control may be maintained during long-term treatment. Paliperidone ER demonstrated efficacy not only in the control of the core symptoms of schizophrenia (positive and negative symptoms, disorganized thoughts, hostility/excitement, anxiety/depression), but also produced relevant improvement in personal and social functioning, an essential component of optimizing long-term outcomes for patients with schizophrenia. Of note, paliperidone ER is the only antipsychotic agent to date to include functionality assessment throughout the clinical development process. Some aspects of the efficacy profile of paliperidone ER deserve further investigation. To date, few head-to-head comparisons with other second-generation compounds have been performed. Although olanzapine was used as an active comparator in the pivotal trials of acute treatment, no statistical comparisons were conducted between paliperidone ER and olanzapine. When compared with quetiapine in hospitalized patients with a recent hospitalization, paliperidone ER was associated with a more rapid clinical improvement. In addition, no trials have so far evaluated the efficacy of paliperidone ER in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.</p><p>Based on short- and longer-term trials, paliperidone ER appears to be a safe and well tolerated agent with a lower liability to acute and chronic side effects in comparison to placebo. Its tolerability profile is very similar to risperidone. As with its parent drug, paliperidone ER may cause EPS and hyperprolactinemia in a dose-dependent manner. Long-term studies are obviously required to establish the incidence of tardive dyskinesia, especially in elderly patients. No evidence of clinically relevant alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism has been documented so far with paliperidone ER, while a dose-related increase in body weight of less than 1 and 2 kg was observed in short- and longerterm studies, respectively. Paliperidone ER appears to carry a low pro-arrhythmic potential. Preliminary data indicate that paliperidone ER has a favourable tolerability and safety profile in elderly patients with schizophrenia. As the available studies investigating the effect of CYP inhibitors or inducers on paliperidone kinetics were consistent with its favorable drug interaction profile, paliperidone ER might be particularly useful for elderly patients requiring multiple medications for co-morbidities.</p><p>A recent pharmacoeconomic analysis has evaluated the clinical and economic consequences of treatment with different oral atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone ER, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone) in schizophrenia over one-year from a US healthcare system perspective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-jcnsd-3-2011-027">68</xref> Despite important methodological limitations, this cost-effectiveness study, using a model that included discontinuation rates, symptom response, relapse, adverse events, resource utilization and unit costs, has indicated that paliperidone ER is associated with better outcomes and lower costs than other antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.</p><p>Current scientific evidence indicates that paliperidone ER is an effective and well tolerated agent in the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, without clear advantages over other antipsychotics. Therefore, independent, well-designed, active comparator trials examining efficacy, tolerability and cost-effectiveness are needed in order to accurately place paliperidone ER in relation to other second- generation antipsychotics and, in particular, risperidone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Paliperidone ER is a second-generation antipsychotic that is administered once daily and without the need for initial dosage titration. The results of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled support the efficacy of paliperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia. It has demonstrated efficacy in the reduction of acute schizophrenia symptoms in 6-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials and its clinical benefits were maintained in the longer-term according to extension studies of up to 52 weeks in duration. Paliperidone ER appears to be more effective than placebo also for the prevention of acute symptom recurrence. The drug is generally safe and well tolerated with a predictable adverse event profile. Like risperidone, paliperidone ER is associated with a dose-dependent risk of EPS and prolactin elevation. Due to minimal hepatic biotransformation, paliperidone ER has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions. Based on the current scientific evidence, paliperidone ER is a useful option in the management of schizophrenia. However, further independent, head-to-head comparative studies with other newer antipsychotics, in particular risperidone, are needed to determine the role of paliperidone ER in the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-jcnsd-3-2011-027"><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>This manuscript has been read and approved by all authors.
