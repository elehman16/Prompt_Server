assistive support (LLAS) on craniovertebral angle (CVA) and mechanical properties of the
upper trapezius (UT) muscle in subjects with forward head posture (FHP). [Subjects and
Methods] This study recruited 20 subjects with FHP. CVA and muscle tone, viscoelasticity,
and stiffness of the UT were measured using Myoton in all subjects in a sitting position
with LLAS and in a neutral sitting position. The order of measurements was randomized and
the mean values were calculated twice. [Results] The sitting position with LLAS showed a
significantly greater improvement than the neutral sitting position with regard to CVA and
muscle tone, viscoelasticity, and stiffness of the UT. [Conclusion] We suggest that the
sitting position using LLAS induces the maintenance of normal neck posture and a reduction
in the muscle tone of the UT in the subjects with FHP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Craniovertebral angle</kwd><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Lumbar lordosis assistive support</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Forward head posture (FHP) is commonly detected in patients with a neck problem and a
posture in which the head is placed anteriorly above the trunk<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. FHP is common in people who work long hours in sitting position and
has been associated with neck pain and decreased range of motion<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, this neck problem often causes psychological
disabilities in daily living, such as discomfort or depression<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Craniovertebral angle (CVA) of people with FHP is less than 51 degrees, and this is closely
related to the neck pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neck pain in
these patients was found associated with increased muscle tone and hyperactivity of the
upper trapezius (UT) muscle<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it is
very important to prevent induction of FHP for a successful treatment of the neck pain.
Prevention of FHP may help induce a correct posture and reduce the hyperactivation and
hypertonus of the UT muscle.</p><p>Long sitting position reduces the lumbar lordosis, while the lumbar lordosis reduction
produces FHP. This can cause back pain, because it increases the intra-pressure of
inter-vertebral discs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the
maintenance of lumbar lordotic curve during the sitting position is a key factor to prevent
FHP and the UT fatigue.</p><p>Surface EMG is commonly used to objectify the UT problems. Surface EMG, however, does not
directly reflect muscle mechanical properties, such as muscle tension<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Measurements using Myoton to quantify muscle mechanical
properties, such as muscle tension, can be easily performed in clinical settings. Evaluation
of muscle mechanical properties using Myoton is closely related to muscle activity generated
by surface EMG<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Andersson et al. reported that the use of lumbar support increased pelvic anterior tilt and
the lumbar lordosis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, Ko et al.
reported that the reduction of FHP in healthy elderly was greater in the sitting position
with a lumbar roll support than in the neutral sitting position. These results suggest that
the lumbar roll support induces upright lumbar lordosis during the sitting position<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yoo et al. found that the trunk muscle
activity was different according to the application height of the lumbar support device, and
authors suggested that this device was claimed to prevent musculoskeletal disorders<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, Horton et al. reported
that applying a lumbar support roll to a chair could reduce FHP<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies, however, did not confirm the effect of
the lumbar lordosis device on muscle properties of the UT<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, few studies
on lumbar lordosis device for people with FHP were performed.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the lumbar lordosis
assistive support (LLAS) on CVA and mechanical properties of the UT in subjects with
FHP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 20 subjects with FHP among Gachon University staff and students.
Subjects were included if they had a CVA of 51 degrees or less<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The following exclusion criteria were applied: any neck,
shoulder, or back operative experience, or neurological signs in arms and legs. All subjects
participated in the experiment with voluntary consent. The general characteristics of the
subjects are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subjects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.6 &#x000b1; 3.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body Mass Index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.6 &#x000b1; 2.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Craniovertebral angle (degrees)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.8 &#x000b1; 1.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Variables are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>. This study was approved by the Gachon University Institutional Review Board
(1044396-201708-HR-133-01).</p><p>All subjects were randomly placed in the neutral sitting position and in sitting position
with LLAS. CVA and mechanical properties of the UT were evaluated in the sitting position.
All measurements were performed by a single experimenter. LLAS (Chiropractic cushion,
Balancecord Inc., Republic of Korea) used in this study is a tool that helps to maintain the
posture of the lumbar lordosis during the sitting position. Additionally, it has a belt that
fixes the subject on the chair. Once LLAS is fixed on the chair, the lordotic curve of the
subject is fitted with LLAS comfortably. The application method of LLAS is as follows. The
subjects sit up straight on the chair with two feet put on the floor. The LLAS was applied
to L2&#x02013;4 area to support lordotic curve.</p><p>CVA was measured in the sitting position using a digital camera and ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health, USA). The distance between the subjects and the camera was
80&#x02005;cm. The posture of the subjects allowed their feet resting naturally on the floor and
both hands laying comfortably on the knees<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The height of the chair was 45&#x02005;cm. The angle between the floor and
the back of the chair was 90 degrees. Subsequently, the measurer attached the body markers
to the external auditory meatus and the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra of
the subjects. CVA was measured between the vertical line connecting the spinous process of
the seventh cervical vertebra to a parallel line to the ground and the line connecting the
spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra to the external auditory meatus. The
measurement was performed by one measurer, and the average value was calculated two times.
In a previous study, the reliability of the test-retest of the CVA was 0.88&#x02013;0.98<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mechanical properties of the UT were measured using Myoton PRO (Myoton AS, Tallinn,
Estonia). The mechanical properties of the UT were determined based on muscle tone (Hz),
stiffness (N/m), and viscoelasticity (logarithmic decrement of dampening oscillations).
Measurements were performed with the subject in a sitting position on the chair in a right
posture and in a quiet environment. All measurements were performed in a relaxed state with
no force, and the postures were analyzed with the subject in the sitting position with LLAS
and in the neutral sitting position. The measuring point of the UT was assessed based on the
midpoint of the horizontal line connected from the acromion to the spinous process of the
seventh cervical vertebra. The probe was measured perpendicular to the skin. In a previous
study, the intra-class correlation coefficients of the UT measurements were 0.97&#x02013;0.99<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All collected data were analyzed using SPSS 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The general
characteristics of the subjects were identified through descriptive statistics. The
normality of dependent variables was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The differences
in dependent variables were confirmed using a paired t-test. The significance level was set
at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>CVA in the sitting position with LLAS was significantly higher than that in the neutral

We used
LLAS, which determines the appropriate curve of lumbar lordosis in the sitting position, to
confirm the effect on CVA and the mechanical properties of the UT of the subjects with FHP.
As a result, CVA while sitting with LLAS was significantly higher than that in the neutral
sitting position, and mechanical properties of UT were significantly lower than those
measured in the neutral sitting.</p><p>The first finding of the present study was that the CVA while sitting with LLAS was higher
than that in the neutral sitting. This result is consistent with previous studies showing
that lumbar lordosis affects FHP. Black et al. found that pelvic anterior tilting produces
lumbar lordosis, which induces correct posture of the neck<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. After applying LLAS in this study, the positive changes of
mechanical properties of UT suggest that LLAS induces correct lumbar lordosis. Majeske et
al. stated that the use of a lumbar support pillow in the sitting position can maintain
sitting position effectively as it maintains the lumbar lordosis in place<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Andersson et al. reported that the use of
lumbar support increased pelvic anterior tilt and improved lumbar lordosis, which, in turn,
would have a positive impact on the neck posture<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Ko et al. reported that sitting with lumbar roll
support reduced FHP compared to the neutral sitting<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The second result of the present study is that the mechanical properties of UT were lower
while sitting with LLAS than in the neutral sitting position. In this study, several
mechanical properties of the UT, namely muscle tone, viscoelasticity, and stiffness, were
evaluated. These three variables were reportedly found highly related to each other. The
sitting position with LLAS showed a greater improvement in CVA, muscle tone,
viscoelasticity, and stiffness of the UT than the neutral sitting position. This fact
suggests that the reduction of FHP decrease muscle tone of the UT.</p><p>Increased muscle tone of the UT is a dysfunction of the shoulder, neck, and the muscles
that compensate when proper movement does not occur<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Computer workers who must work for long periods of sitting will
have increased muscle activity of the UT resulting in lower muscle activity of the lower
trapezius and serratus anterior. This eventually leads to an increase in the incidence of
the neck and shoulder pain due to the imbalance of the shoulder joint and the increase in
FHP<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the application of LLAS during sitting position in this
study may help reduce the incidence of shoulder and neck pain.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small. Second, the subjects
participating in this study were only people with FHP. Thus, the result cannot be
generalized to all patients with neck pain. Third, this study only confirmed a short-term
effects of LLAS. Fourth, we only identified the changes of mechanical properties of UT
following LLAS application. In the future, the effect of LLAS should be clarified by
supplementing these limitations.</p><p>In conclusion, this study was performed to investigate the effects of LLAS on CVA and
mechanical properties of the UT of subjects with FHP. As a result, CVA in the sitting
position with LLAS was significantly higher than that in the neutral sitting while the
muscle tone of the UT was significantly lower in the sitting position with LLAS. The results
of the study suggest that sitting with LLAS may have a positive effect on CVA and muscle
tone of the UT in subjects with FHP.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>No conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shaghayegh Fard</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmadi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Maroufi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Evaluation of forward head posture in sitting and standing
