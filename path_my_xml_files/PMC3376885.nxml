predictive processes as central to learning, yet practically all experiments
employ non-predictive measures during training. We argue that the common
theoretical assumption of anticipation and prediction needs clearer, more direct
evidence for it during learning. We offer a novel experimental context to
explore prediction, and report results from a simple sequential learning task
designed to promote predictive behaviors in participants as they responded to a
short sequence of simple stimulus events. Predictive tendencies in participants
were measured using their computer mouse, the trajectories of which served as a
means of tapping into predictive behavior while participants were exposed to
very short and simple sequences of events. A total of 143 participants were
randomly assigned to stimulus sequences along a continuum of regularity.
Analysis of computer-mouse trajectories revealed that (a) participants almost
always anticipate events in some manner, (b) participants exhibit two stable
patterns of behavior, either reacting to vs. predicting future events, (c) the
extent to which participants predict relates to performance on a recall test,
and (d) explicit reports of perceiving patterns in the brief sequence correlates
with extent of prediction. We end with a discussion of implicit and explicit
statistical learning and of the role prediction may play in both kinds of
learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prediction</kwd><kwd>consciousness</kwd><kwd>dynamics</kwd><kwd>implicit learning</kwd><kwd>statistical learning</kwd><kwd>serial reaction time</kwd><kwd>computer-mouse tracking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>To what extent is prediction related to sequential learning and memory, and to
implicit or explicit knowledge of that learning? In this paper, we offer a novel
methodology that may help answer this question, and present experimental results
that suggest this methodology holds promise for connecting these phenomena:
prediction, statistical learning, and explicit awareness. In brief, our experiment
is a simple manual spatial-position tracking task, in which a participant&#x02019;s
behavior is tracked with the computer-mouse cursor. We are thus able to detect
predictive movements readily. We show that predictive behaviors emerge quickly in a
simple short-sequence design, using 48-element sequences of varying grammatical
regularity. Prediction, learning, and explicit knowledge all correlate strongly.</p><p>Many researchers in diverse domains of cognitive science have identified prediction

Flanagan, 2001</xref>). This has been especially true of theories of statistical
learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cleeremans &#x00026; McClelland, 1991</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hoffmann, Martin, &#x00026; Schilling, 2003</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hunt &#x00026; Aslin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nissen &#x00026; Bullemer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Stadler, 1989</xref>). As we argue below, these
theories are almost always based on indirect evidence for prediction: Virtually all
statistical learning and serial reaction time (SRT) experiments employ reaction-time
(RT) methods that do not reveal predictive behaviors <italic>during</italic>
learning (D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus, Karatekin, &#x00026; Markiewicz,
2006</xref>). Yet such experiments cannot mediate between predictive,
forward-looking theories of statistical learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cleeremans &#x00026; McClelland, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nissen &#x00026; Bullemer, 1987</xref>), and theories that could be based
more on associative memory traces that link event to event, and need not invoke
forward-looking learning processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jones
&#x00026; Pashler, 2007</xref>). The former family of theories needs a more direct
technique to tap prediction and to support this common assumption.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a technique for capturing prediction behavior directly, and
present a simple experimental demonstration of it that speaks to this theoretical
aforementioned issue. Our results show that even if a brief sequential pattern is
sufficiently ordered, participants begin to actively predict what stimulus will
follow from a previous one, revealing prediction as a wholesale, active strategy.
Participants who do so more also tend to report more explicit awareness of pattern
in that stimulus sequence. Our data suggest that indeed prediction is central to
learning and awareness, and may reveal how <italic>different</italic> forms of
prediction may correlate with implicit or explicit awareness, which themselves are
dependent upon the relative transparency of the structure being learned. In what
follows, we first briefly review theoretical issues, and argue that predictive
versus associative mechanisms can easily be confounded in statistical learning
experiments. We then present our experimental results, and discuss their theoretical
implications in the general discussion.</p><sec id="S1a"><title>Predictive versus associative processes for learning</title><p>Distinguishing between predictive and associative learning mechanisms is a
problem that extends across many domains in cognitive psychology, given that
&#x0201c;...efficient processing of events in ambiguous contexts does not need to
result from effective preparation, but retrospective use of information
regarding events which occurred following those of interest&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bubic et al., 2010</xref>, p. 2). Some studies have
sought to tease apart these two potential mechanisms, predictive versus
retrospective processing, in behavioral experiments. For example, Enns and
Lleras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">2008</xref>) showed that visual search
from a recent scene in memory can be so fast (&#x0201c;rapid resumption&#x0201d;)
that only a predictive mechanism could sensibly explain their findings. They
noted that this is in contrast to fluid access to recent memory, characteristic
of more retrospective processes. These same issues are faced by RT facilitation
findings in sequential tasks that reveal statistical learning.</p><p>Consider the findings of Hunt and Aslin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2001</xref>), whose study is similar to the design we employed here. They
evaluated movement speed to predictable stimuli within a visuospatial layout. In
their experiment, the stimuli corresponded to seven lights that were arranged
equidistantly in a semicircle. Participants were instructed to press the lights
and then return to a fixed position below the lights to trigger the next
position. They showed learning of <italic>predictable</italic> positions across
trials of the experiment, finding that RTs were fastest for stimuli in
predictable positions.</p><p>Though Hunt and Aslin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2001</xref>) were
primarily interested in the type of cues that underlie learning in this
serial-reaction design, the cognitive process that was assumed to be operating
in this context was one of an anticipatory nature: &#x0201c;If it [RT] was
faster, this implied that the participant was relatively more certain about the
subsequent element in the sequence of stimuli and was able to anticipate the
correct transition and produce a faster response&#x0201d; (p. 670). One issue
with this general assumption is that faster latencies may simply reflect a
capacity to react more quickly given the strength of local &#x0201c;memory
traces&#x0201d; induced during learning. As another example, in a recent
computational model of SRT learning, Jamieson and Mewhort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">2009</xref>) require only very local memory cuing, and the model
by itself is not equipped with a predictive mechanism. It is in fact
retrospective (in the sense of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bubic et al.,
2010</xref>) because the generation of any new response is carried out
through integrating information from the previous stimulus and response, and
with this simple local process, it can capture a wide range of basic
statistical-learning results. A forward-looking model would produce expectations
or anticipations for the next stimulus. This is an important distinction that
should not be trivialized. The relevance of a current stimulus is evaluated
<italic>when it is seen</italic> in a retrospective model, rather than
<italic>before it is seen</italic>, which is how a predictive, anticipatory
process would function. So a memory-based retrospective process could facilitate
these responses in some manner, without being explicitly predictive. In short,
the current stimulus is simply faster to process when it is seen.</p><p>The distinction between predictive and retrospective processes can be
strengthened by considering two ways in which computational models could capture
response facilitation. In a sequential statistical learning experiment, where we
attempt to model the processing of some stimulus S<sub>N</sub> that has followed
from some previous set of stimuli (S<sub>N-1</sub>, S<sub>N-2</sub>, etc.),
there are two ways in which speeded processing of S<sub>N</sub> might happen. A
retrospective model would process this S<sub>N</sub> more quickly if its
(activated) memory traces for preceding material facilitate that processing. No
preparation or prediction is required for this to be so: Any of various
processes required for evaluating the new S<sub>N</sub> could be facilitated by
having relevant recent representations active before S<sub>N</sub>. A predictive
model, however, does not wait to be facilitated in this processing. Instead, it
would in some manner or another have at least part of the requisite processing
of S<sub>N</sub> already in place even before S<sub>N</sub> appears, because
seeing S<sub>N-1</sub>, S<sub>N-2</sub>, etc. together encourages the system to
&#x0201c;look forward&#x0201d; towards upcoming stimulus events. There is a
computational precedent for this distinction. In the retrospective case,
McClelland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">1979</xref>) introduced a cascade
algorithm to model facilitated processing time in an associative feedforward
network. In the predictive case, the well-known simple-recurrent network
architecture has been used to model SRT and statistical learning data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cleeremans &#x00026; McClelland, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Misyak, Christiansen, &#x00026; Tomblin, 2009</xref>).
Yet neither of these processes, prima facie, is fundamentally or a priori the
most desirable. We would agree that statistical learning studies offer
considerable evidence that anticipation is pervasive. Despite this
pervasiveness, some recent works suggest that this pervasiveness should not be
taken for granted in any given situation, and that direct evidence for such a
central mechanism, and its benefits, ought to be obtained (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jones &#x00026; Pashler, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The vast majority of research on statistical learning has employed indirect
measures of anticipation. Reber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">1967</xref>)
used grammatical endorsement scores in test phases as evidence of learning.
Looking time has been used in statistical learning studies with infants and
young children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Saffran, 2003</xref>, for a
review). SRT studies virtually all use basic RT measures in training phases,
from Nissen and Bullemer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">1987</xref>) onward.
There are a few studies that reveal anticipatory tendencies, such as those that
show the emergence of predictive errors in SRT studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schvaneveldt &#x00026; Gomez, 1998</xref>), yet these
predictive errors may still be evidence of some learning having already taken
place. In other words, prediction may not have been part of the learning
process, but rather an effect. There is indeed some good evidence that ocular
and manual movements display predictive behaviors during statistical learning
and that this prediction relates to explicit knowledge. D. J. Marcus et al.
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">2006</xref>) showed that eye-movement
anticipations are frequent in an SRT task, and relate to learning and explicit
knowledge. Duran and Dale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">2009</xref>) showed
some weak evidence for anticipatory manual responses in a statistical learning
paradigm similar to Saffran, Aslin, and Newport (1996; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Moisello et al., 2009</xref>). The current
experiment complements these findings and supplies a potential experimental
framework for systematic exploration of prediction, and possibly, different
types of prediction strategies. For example, here we show that manual
anticipation can take on two different forms: &#x0201c;optimized&#x0201d; reaction
(where one readies the response but does not try to make it beforehand), and
explicit &#x0201c;wagers,&#x0201d; which appear to accompany explicit learning, in
which a participant actually heads for the next expected stimulus prior to its
appearance. In our experiment, we observe that participants first find an
optimal cursor location from which to react while waiting for another stimulus
to appear (without predicting a specific stimulus), though at some point during
the experiment they become aware of a pattern and begin to explicitly predict or
&#x0201c;wager&#x0201d; its next occurrence. Once they do predict, it becomes a
stable strategy that guides learning of a short sequence.</p><p>In summary, most statistical learning experiments, whether explicit or implicit
in their learning outcomes, are based on indirect information about anticipatory
processes consistent with both anticipatory and non-anticipatory types of
models. We would agree with many researchers who have argued that anticipation
seems to be the most appealing cognitive process for handling events in time (as
cited above, and as discussed in the implicit learning literature, e.g., in D.
J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nissen &#x00026; Bullemer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schvaneveldt &#x00026; Gomez, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Stadler, 1989</xref>). But obtaining direct
evidence of this process, and developing an empirical framework to further
explore prediction in statistical learning, would further help to connect this
mechanism for learning <italic>during learning</italic>.</p><p>In this paper, we are not arguing that implicit learning is either purely
associative or predictive, for it may be that they both work together during
learning (and indeed, predictions may use associative mechanisms at root; e.g.,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bar, 2009</xref>). Our point is that theories
that use concepts of prediction could be further supported by directly revealing
prediction in behavior. The purpose of this paper is to showcase an experimental
paradigm that can reveal predictive processes, and to explore the properties of
this anticipation/prediction as it relates to memory for sequences and explicit
knowledge of the regularity of these sequences. We indeed find rich patterns of
prediction, and this prediction relates to learning and explicit awareness of
that learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Experiment</title><p>Here, we use an experimental design that reveals manual prediction, and we
investigate the properties of this behavior. To provide an unambiguous measure of
prediction, we turned to the measurement of hand movement during task performance.
In several recent studies, the semi-continuous movements of the computer-mouse
cursor were regarded as a direct and (occasionally) uninterrupted translation of
unfolding cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Song &#x00026; Nakayama,
2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Spivey, Grosjean, &#x00026; Knoblich,
2005</xref>). Motivated by this logic, we tracked participants&#x02019; computer
mouse as they clicked on a visual cue that moved around a spatial landscape on the
computer screen. Every time the cue was clicked, it momentarily disappeared before
reappearing in a new location. During this period of disappearance, the learner had
an opportunity to predict the most likely region of reappearance of the cue (it is
like a simplified version of the &#x0201c;Whac-A-Mole&#x0201d; classic arcade game
that readers may be familiar with). By tracking the coordinates of the
computer-mouse, results can show when (or if) participants manually gravitate
towards predictable regions. We used this in a simple sequence-learning task, in the
spirit of Nissen and Bullemer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">1987</xref>) and of
Hunt and Aslin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2001</xref>). The task requires
participants to respond to spatial stimuli that occur in sequences that vary in
their ordering regularities.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2a"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2a1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 143 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (www.mturk.com).

recall test, and (c) a report of explicit knowledge. Once participants opted
to perform our task, they were forwarded to the Flash interface in their
browser. Upon entry, the experimental software randomly assigned
participants to a training stimulus sequence (each participant just saw one
sequence). Participants were instructed to click the dots as fast as
possible, because the interface was administering a RT task. The mouse
cursor was continually tracked for the 48-position training stimuli. Circles
appeared only one at a time, with a 750-ms inter-stimulus interval between
them. This provided ample time for participants to initiate a predictive
mouse movement. Following these responses, participants were prompted to
produce a 24-position sequence from memory that matched what they had seen
during training (akin to the &#x0201c;inclusion&#x0201d; task that likely
marshals both implicit and explicit knowledge of the sequences; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Destrebecqz &#x00026; Cleeremans, 2001</xref>). We
tracked the circle positions that were clicked during this recall test. The
four circle positions were all on the screen for this part of the task.
Finally, participants rated how patterned they felt the 48-element sequence
was by clicking on a continuous scale between <italic>not patterned to
completely patterned with somewhat patterned</italic> in between.</p></sec><sec id="S2a4"><title>Measures and analyses</title><p>We continually tracked the computer-mouse x,y-pixel coordinates during
training. For each position appearance (of 48), we calculated two main
measures on which our analyses are based: (a) initial distance (in pixels)
to the next position and (b) initial distance (in pixels) from the previous
position. For (a), we computed the pixel distance to the next target just
before it appeared (at the 750-ms mark), which we call <italic>initial
distance to next</italic>. If participants are making a perfect
predictive movement, the initial distance will be 0 (i.e., right on top of
the next circle position). A reactive behavior, by contrast, will have a
larger initial distance, either near the previous target
(&#x0201c;waiting&#x0201d;) or near the center (&#x0201c;readying&#x0201d;).
However, for (b), a movement may be predictive but simply incorrect. We
therefore also calculated the maximum horizontal/vertical distance from the
previous target (at the 750-ms mark), which we call <italic>initial distance
from previous</italic>. If a movement is predictive at all, it will have
a large distance from previous, regardless of whether it is correct or not
(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, Panel B). As we describe
further in the analysis below, these two measures provide windows onto
predictive wagers of participants, and capture when participants are willing
to invest mouse-cursor movements in a <italic>particular</italic> predicted
stimulus. Any other trial, when the cursor does not make a large movement
towards a particular stimulus, we term a <italic>reactive trial</italic>.
Hypothetical illustrations of these trajectories are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (Panel C).</p><p>We also calculated the regularity of the test recall sequence, and its
similarity to the corresponding training sequence that a participant saw.
This is detailed below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2b" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2b1"><title>Analysis of reaction times</title><p>In an initial analysis, we simply tested whether our data indeed reflected
traditional reaction-time facilitation across levels of sequence regularity
(<italic>G</italic> score). In most statistical learning experiments, a
control round using random sequences is used, to see whether RT or other
measures are affected by the sudden change in the statistical structure of
event sequences. Here, sequences of different <italic>G</italic> serve as
relative, between-subject comparisons. We used a linear mixed-effects model
with Subject as a random factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Baayen,
Davidson, &#x00026; Bates, 2008</xref>), and Sequence Regularity
<italic>G</italic> (0-1), Trial (1-48), and their interaction, as
continuous fixed factors. <italic>G</italic> strongly predicted lower RT in
this model, with each successive .1 increase in regularity leading to, on
average, approximately 25 ms of facilitation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 139) =
42.5, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001. There was also a significant effect of
trial, with RT dropping by about 2 ms per trial, <italic>F</italic>(1, 6350)
= 303.1, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001. Importantly, these two factors
interact, with high <italic>G</italic> sequences dropping
<italic>more</italic> over trials than low <italic>G</italic> sequences,
<italic>F</italic>(1, 6350) = 132.8, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001. We
therefore conclude that by a traditional analysis of RTs, we are able to
show the same kind of results as found in previous work. The question,
however, is whether these RT facilitation patterns can be accounted for by
predictive movements. If so, then facilitation will arise from predictive
mouse-cursor movements that get closer and closer to where the next trial
stimulus will appear, even before the stimulus appears on the screen. We
explore this possibility in the next two analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S2b2"><title>Correct predictive movements</title><p>The overall extent to which participants moved the mouse cursor towards the
next target prior to the target&#x02019;s appearance was strongly related to
the regularity of the grammar. This is shown in Panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Using the same model as
described above, <italic>G</italic> highly significantly predicted initial
distance to next. Each .1 increase in <italic>G</italic> on average led to
about a 25-pixel closer initial position to the next target,
<italic>F</italic>(1, 139) = 125.7, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001. In
general, each subsequent trial reduced initial position by about 1 pixel,
<italic>F</italic>(1, 6351) = 174.2, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001, but
this depended upon <italic>G</italic>, indicated by a significant
interaction term, <italic>F</italic>(1, 6351) = 161.2, <italic>p</italic>
&#x0003c; .0001. In other words, high-<italic>G</italic> values (i.e., greater
regularity) had a larger drop in initial position across trials compared to
sequences with low-<italic>G</italic> values.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Panel A. Distance (in pixels and as a function of sequence

using initial distance from previous. As described in the Measures and
Analyses section above, if participants do not move at all, or only move
towards the center, then this would be a &#x0201c;reactive&#x0201d; trial,
because participants are only preparing for the next target to appear.
However, if participants move away by a certain pixel distance, then they
are likely moving the mouse cursor towards another target (either correctly
or incorrectly). Such a trial would be a predictive one. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (Panel B) shows the increase in
initial distance from previous across sequence regularities. In short,
participants become more predictive in the high-G sequences than
low-<italic>G</italic>sequences. All the same effects hold in the same
mixed-effects model (<italic>ps</italic> &#x0003c; .0001; we excluded the first
trial from these analyses, as there is no previous trial to obtain such a
measure). As suggested by the previous analysis, and in general, the extent
to which predictive behaviors occurred over trials depended upon the
predictability of the sequence itself.</p></sec><sec id="S2b4"><title>Reactive-predictive strategies</title><p>Simply averaging over participants (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) does not reveal a stark bimodality in predictive
tendencies that we observed in our participants. To showcase this
bimodality, we used the previous dependent measure (distance away from
previous trial) and conducted distribution analyses. In the 48-position
trials, any individual trial was deemed &#x0201c;predictive&#x0201d; when the
initial distance from previous was 275 pixels or greater (indicating
substantial movement away, likely to another target; see Panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We calculated the proportion
of trials that were predictive in six-trial blocks (giving eight blocks).
For any given block for each subject, a proportion score is obtained, lying
between 0 and 1, representing the extent to which that block was predictive.
A score of 1 on this proportion would indicate that all trials of these 6
were predictive. A score of 0 would indicate only reaction: Participants
stayed closer to their initial position prior to the next trial. For each
block, 1 to 8, a distribution of 143 scores is obtained (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The percentage of participants (from all 11 <italic>G</italic>-score

shows 6 bins because Block 7 contained no participants. This 0 was
included in the analysis, however.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="acp-08-196-g003"/></fig><p>Each of these distributions is different from an assumed histogram of a

primarily reactive. Gradually, participants exhibit a sharp bimodal
distribution in the final block. In inspecting the same histograms but for
individual sequences, the distribution is as one would predict from the
aforementioned analyses: High-<italic>G</italic>sequences have participants
that transition to fully predictive trials; low-<italic>G</italic>sequences
have participants that mostly remain reactive; bimodality holds
approximately in the intermediate sequences.</p></sec><sec id="S2b5"><title>Prediction occurs before correct prediction</title><p>We compared initial distance to next (correct prediction) and initial
distance from previous (overall predictive movements) across blocks. If
prediction occurs before knowledge, then overall prediction should be
significantly higher at a crucial period as prediction emerges. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows the first four blocks of
the three perfectly regular sequences, for which prediction was stable and
frequent in participants. At Block 2, trials tended to be more predictive
overall rather than simply correctly predictive. We generated a score from 0
to 6 for each block for each subject, computed by subtracting the number of
correct predictions (using a conservative 100-pixel threshold) from the
number of overall predictions by initial distance from previous (using the
same 275-pixel threshold). In Blocks 1, 3, and 4 this score did not differ
significantly from 0, as expected from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure
4</xref>, <italic>ts</italic> &#x0003c; 1.9, <italic>ps</italic> = .10, .09,
and .07, respectively. However, in Block 2, this score is substantially
positive across these participants, <italic>t</italic>(39) = 5.1,
<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001. This indicates that at about Block 2,
there is more prediction in general than just correct prediction. In short,
prediction generally appears to occur prior to total correct knowledge about
the sequences.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The distribution of trials in correct predictions (black line) and

output of 24 clicks using the same statistic as in Jamieson and Mewhort
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">2009</xref>). In the expected
direction, there is a strong relationship between the
<italic>G</italic>-score regularity of the training sequence and the testing
recall, <italic>r</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001. We also
found that the testing sequences more closely matched the original training
sequences in the same direction, <italic>r</italic> = .48,
<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001. This matching score was generated using a
sequence-alignment method known as <italic>cross-recurrence</italic> (see
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dale &#x00026; Spivey, 2005</xref>), where a
percentage score reflects the overall match between the original and testing
sequences by calculating the percentage of position sequences that are the
same (similar to Levenshtein distance). In addition, we tested the
relationship between how predictive a participant is in the final two blocks
of the experiment (12 trials, using distance from previous with 275-pixel
threshold), and the matching score, controlling for the training sequence
<italic>G</italic>-scores (included as a covariate in a linear
multiple-regression model). In the total model, training sequence
<italic>G</italic>-score is a significant predictor (<italic>p</italic>
&#x0003c; .01), but amount of prediction also strongly relates to the matching
score (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .005; multiple-<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>
= .29, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). The relationship between matching

training sequence <italic>G</italic>-score was no longer a significant
predictor of the 24-item test recall <italic>G</italic>-score
(<italic>p</italic> = .9). This suggests that the regularity of a
participant&#x02019;s memories for the sequences is somehow dependent upon
their tendencies to actively predict the positions. Therefore, when
controlling for the training sequence&#x02019;s <italic>G</italic>-score, the
tendency of participants to be predictive relates significantly to their
performance on the test in both the free-response regularity and match to
the training.</p></sec><sec id="S2b7"><title>Explicit awareness correlates with all measures</title><p>Participants who deemed the sequences to be more patterned tended to be the
ones who had training sequences of higher <italic>G</italic>,
<italic>r</italic> = .41, p &#x0003c; .0001. Higher explicit awareness of
pattern related to greater test match to the training sequences,
<italic>r</italic> = .47, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001, and greater
predictive behavior in the final 12 trials, <italic>r</italic> = .51,
<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001. We ran a separate regression analysis to
test for the relationship between prediction and explicit awareness while
controlling for other variables, because prediction on the last 12 trials
related significantly to these as well. First, we used the
<italic>G</italic> score of a training sequence to predict perception of
explicit awareness, and saved the residuals. When the
<italic>G</italic>score was factored out of explicit awareness in this way,
predictive tendencies still significantly accounted for what was left over
in those residuals, <italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> = .005. The
reverse is not true: Once prediction behavior is taken out of explicit
awareness, <italic>G</italic> score is no longer significantly related to
these residuals, <italic>r</italic> = .08, <italic>p</italic> = .4,
suggesting that prediction mediates between a sequence&#x02019;s regularity
and explicit awareness. We chose to use participants&#x02019; test sequence
generation&#x02019;s match to training as an additional measure of explicit
awareness, and both prediction and test recall correlated with explicit
awareness, even when controlling for each other, <italic>r</italic>s &#x0003e;

using brief exposure on a simple sequence of four positions. Nevertheless,
we sought to test whether there was any sign of implicit learning. As noted
above, most statistical learning experiments use a control round with random
(or different) sequences to see whether RT or other measures are increased
by the change in the structure of sequences. Again, sequences of different G
serve as relative, between-subject comparisons. If there is any implicit
learning then participants who have low pattern awareness should
nevertheless show improvement in RT across trials, moderated by the relative
level of regularity in the sequence, as captured by <italic>G</italic>. We
chose a subset of our participants who reported lower awareness of pattern
(below but not equal to &#x0201c;somewhat patterned,&#x0201d;
<italic>n</italic> = 25), and ran a linear mixed-effects regression with
Subject as a random factor, and <italic>G</italic>, and Trial (1-48) as
fixed factors, and included an interaction term. <italic>G</italic>was not
alone significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 29) = 2.1, <italic>p</italic> =
.16, though trial was, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1404) = 19.9,
<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001. <italic>G</italic>and Trial interacted
significantly, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1404) = 6.5, <italic>p</italic> = .01.
The pattern of this interaction was as expected: The higher
<italic>G</italic>sequences induced more learning across trials relative
to lower <italic>G</italic>sequences. These participants reported low
awareness of sequence pattern, and nevertheless showed modulated RTs
relative to the regularity of the structure they received. This is at least
suggestive of implicit learning in this brief exposure. As expected from
previous analyses above, these participants also have significantly less
predictive behavior in the final 12 trials than the remainder
(<italic>n</italic> = 99) of the participants, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;
.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2c"><title>Discussion</title><p>These extensive analyses of our data offer some basic ideas about prediction and
statistical learning, and their relationship to the implicit/explicit divide.
First, prediction in the form of a &#x0201c;behavioral wager&#x0201d; tends to
rapidly emerge as participants detect structure in the sequence. It is a stable
strategy that does not seem to happen as a <italic>result of learning</italic>,
but instead seems to <italic>occur in conjunction with</italic> early moments of
learning. The results showing that incorrect prediction occurs as participants
are transitioning into this predictive &#x0201c;mode&#x0201d; supports this. Below
we further consider a &#x0201c;two system&#x0201d; hypothesis related to this:
When an implicit learning process extracts sufficient structure, the cognitive
system can &#x0201c;seek out&#x0201d; a forthcoming stimulus, thus producing an
error signal, and kick starting explicit awareness and learning.</p><p>Second, explicit awareness measures (recall memory and awareness report) both
correlate strongly with predictive behavior, even when controlling for sequence
regularity. Thus, explicit knowledge appears to co-occur with
&#x0201c;wagers&#x0201d; that participants are willing to invest in when they
become aware of some structure. It may be that a particular kind of prediction
(for a particular stimulus) is related to processes that unfold under conditions
of conscious awareness.</p><p>As a final note, we observed that participants who did not wager often adopted
the &#x0201c;centering&#x0201d; strategy that Duran and Dale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">2009</xref>) found in their spatial statistical
learning experiment. Participants anticipated the next stimulus, which occurred
at one of three other locations, by positioning the mouse cursor at an optimal
location, equidistant from the next stimulus (i.e., in the center). As we
discuss further below, this may not be best described as
<italic>reactive</italic>, as we have categorized it in our analysis, but
rather an optimal anticipatory positioning close to possible future stimuli.
Even participants with low pattern awareness engaged in this form of
behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S3"><title>General Discussion</title><p>Admittedly, we designed a very simple task, and used it to explore
<italic>initial</italic> response tendencies. Results thus reflect the
processing of short-term event sequences that may be routinely faced by cognitive
systems during daily activities (e.g., observing or producing brief structured
action sequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Botvinick &#x00026; Plaut,
2004</xref>). Our experiment simplified this ecological context, and exposed
participants to a single stream of visuospatial information. Certainly, the
experiment is not of the same scope of traditional statistical learning and of SRT
tasks, which use more complex sequences over many blocks of training. In that
respect, what we are revealing is the very beginning of the learning system&#x02019;s
behavior, using computer-mouse trajectories to unveil the
&#x0201c;microstructure&#x0201d; of this initial processing.</p><p>Results do suggest that the cognitive system, at least with respect to the manual
motor system, is not constantly predicting the next particular stimulus event,
especially in random environments. Instead, it adapts a readiness to respond, which
may transition sharply into prediction once some regularity appears to be present.
From here, prediction permits the generation of error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rescorla &#x00026; Wagner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Sutton &#x00026; Barto, 1998</xref>), whereas simple reaction does not. From basic
learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Miller, Barnet, &#x00026; Grahame,
1995</xref>), to more complex computational approaches of the past couple of
decades (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Elman, 1990</xref>), prediction is a
wager the outcome of which leads to adjusted future expectations. It may be from
such contingencies that deeply entrenched learning ensues.</p><p>Though our experimental findings appear robust, there are clear limitations to the
current approach, which we hope to overcome in future investigations. Our simple
design was deliberately short, seeking to observe and relate prediction in stimuli
that are only brief. The optimal simultaneous &#x0201c;mixed strategy&#x0201d; (for
middle <italic>G</italic>-scores), in which participants might both wager/center in
predictable/unpredictable positions, is not observed but may emerge after extended
training. Another issue, mentioned above in our experimental discussion, is that our
participants often engaged in a consistent &#x0201c;centering&#x0201d; strategy. This
is not mere reaction, as one would call the &#x0201c;wait and respond&#x0201d;
strategy; yet it is not overt prediction either because participants are placing the
cursor in an optimal position to react. Future work may seek to identify perhaps
diverse response strategies that have various aspects of optimality depending on the
task structure and instructions at hand, and could identify individual differences
in this capacity to predict, either as an explicit or implicit strategy, which may
relate to tendencies in other tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Proulx
&#x00026; Heine, 2009</xref>). In addition, our aggregate measures of memory may
have underestimated the amount of explicit learning achieved during the task. It may
be that explicit knowledge reported during the test is simply organized around
particular sub-sequences (e.g., &#x0201c;4321&#x0201d;). Given the small number of
participants per sequence, a statistical test of this hypothesis cannot be conducted
here. Indeed, future work may demonstrate that computer-mouse movements form
organized hierarchical units of predictive patterns, as suggested in work that
models the organization of action sequences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Botvinick &#x00026; Plaut, 2004</xref>). This would also bear on models that
hypothesize different unitization of emerging statistical knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Perruchet &#x00026; Vinter, 1998</xref>).</p><p>We also focused on manual prediction tendencies, and did not look at oculomotor
prediction. Previous work has shown the eyes to be widely predictive and the extent
of this predictiveness to be related to explicit learning (D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting
reactive-predictive strategies in oculomotor control could function distinctively
(see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Land &#x00026; Furneaux, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Shelhamer &#x00026; Joiner, 2003</xref>). Despite this
potentially distinctive functioning, it is highly likely the unfolding of oculomotor
and manual dynamics are coupled in natural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ballard, Hayhoe, &#x00026; Pelz, 1995</xref>), and the relationship between their
predictiveness could be explored with simple experiments like the one presented
here. Indeed, the presence (or absence) of action contingencies is something that
researchers in implicit statistical learning have debated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Heyes &#x00026; Foster, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mayr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Willingham,
1999</xref>). The role of predictive processes is considered by many as central
to this coupling between perception, action, and the environment. We feel our
experiment could fruitfully connect prediction, statistical learning, and awareness
of that learning in a single paradigm, and our results are suggestive of rich
underlying relationships. We discuss this next.</p><sec id="S3a"><title>Implicit/explicit divide: Two systems?</title><p>We should preface our discussion here with an important note: Our results are
correlational in nature. Prediction and awareness of a pattern are correlated in
our task, as observed in past research (D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Willingham,
Nissen, &#x00026; Bullemer, 1989</xref>). Yet, this awareness does not
necessarily mean that a complete, explicit knowledge of the exact sequencing has
been formed. Controlling for explicit knowledge by factoring out test sequence
match, we still find that prediction occurs, suggesting that predictive behavior
mediates the transition between a vague awareness of a pattern and the
full-blown knowledge of that pattern (to which D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus et al., 2006</xref>, also attest). Thus, explicit wagers of
the kind we observe emerged rapidly in high <italic>G</italic>sequences,
showcasing errors of prediction earlier in learning, and then settling into a
stable strategy.</p><p>One subtle aspect of the debate in statistical learning in the past decade has
been the extent to which it is taken to be anticipatory in nature (D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nissen &#x00026; Bullemer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schvaneveldt &#x00026; Gomez, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Stadler, 1989</xref>), or may be based on associative processes
that need not always involve forward-looking mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Heyes &#x00026; Foster, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jones &#x00026; Pashler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mayr,
1996</xref>). In fact, models used to capture this behavior have both
properties as well, from local associative traces to more predictive processes
(see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cleeremans &#x00026; Dienes, 2008</xref>, for an
elegant review of models). A tentative conjecture from our approach is that, as
learners become acquainted with a sequential environment, their strategies may
change depending on the regularity of that environment, and extent of
exposure.</p><p>These strategies could reveal distinct underlying systems at work during
learning. For example, in a study by Schvaneveldt and Gomez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">1998</xref>), it was observed that single- versus
dual-task learning contexts may induce different sorts of processes, with
differing capacities to transfer that learning. They found in particular that
knowledge gained in single-task learning was not easily transferred to a
dual-task context when participants switched. Dual-task learning, however,
induced knowledge that was transferrable to a new single-task context. As
another example, previous researchers have debated the presence of two systems
for learning, one based on attention to the material and the other not requiring
attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Curran &#x00026; Keele,
1993</xref>), or whether just one system can account for such data (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Frensch, Lin, &#x00026; Buchner, 1998</xref>).
Theoretical debate in implicit learning has often been geared towards
identification of the subsystems involved, their properties, whether they
operate alone or in parallel, and whether they produce abstract or concrete, or
rule-based or statistical, knowledge (for reviews, see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cleeremans, Destrebecqz, &#x00026; Boyer, 1998</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Clegg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Conway &#x00026; Christiansen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Curran &#x00026; Keele, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Frensch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Jamieson &#x00026;
Mewhort, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Keele, Ivry, Mayr,
Hazeltine, &#x00026; Heuer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kirkham, Slemmer, &#x00026; Johnson, 2002</xref>; G. F. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Marcus, Vijayan, Bandi Rao, &#x00026; Vishton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Perruchet &#x00026; Pacton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Reber, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Seidenberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Willingham &#x00026; Goedert-Eschmann, 1999</xref>).</p><p>One may be tempted therefore to situate our results in this general trend to
identify subsystems for learning. An implicit learning system may work to
associate spatial positions over time, which facilitates spatial processing as
they appear in sequence (debate also concerns whether there are subsystems here,
regarding perceptual, attentional, and response-based bases; and recently there
is suggestion that it could even exhibit modality specificity, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Conway &#x00026; Christiansen, 2005</xref>). As
sufficient structure is extracted by this general system, an
&#x0201c;explicit&#x0201d; one kicks in, and participants begin to make explicit
behavioral wagers about the next stimulus location. Indeed, there exists a
prominent and related theory of cognitive control that also proposes two
underlying modes of proactive and reactive operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Braver, Gray, &#x00026; Burgess, 2007</xref>). Yet we agree with
Cleeremans and Dienes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">2008</xref>) that
identification of separate subsystems does not <italic>by itself</italic> count
as an explanation of any data, and besides, as suggested, for example, in
discussion by Kirkham, Slemmer, and Johnson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">2002</xref>), what we observed could be multiple behavioral strategies
emerging from a single general-purpose learning system. In fact, the modeling
work of Destrebecqz and Cleeremans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">2003</xref>)
includes both an associative and predictive component that could capture both
patterns we observe here. It may be (as we discuss below), that participants can
simply verbalize this single system&#x02019;s operation in some contexts, such as
when prediction is possible, versus others, such as when only equidistant
positioning (&#x0201c;centering&#x0201d;) is possible. Finally, even if we were to
propose such a two-system explanation, further research is needed to judge
whether, in our particular task, the associative, implicit system is still
functioning even when overt behavior is overwhelmingly predictive (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Willingham &#x00026; Goedert-Eschmann,
1999</xref>).</p><p>Whatever the architectural description, there are clearly two strategies or
&#x0201c;modes&#x0201d; observed in our behavioral data. And what is new in our
observations is that these modes can rapidly transition from one into the other,
from reactive practices into tentative prediction, and then to wholesale
wagering that gives way to consistently correct predictions. And despite our
task&#x02019;s simplicity, we were able to go beyond previous research, in which
such modes of learning or operating in sequential tasks are shielded by the
wonderfully easy to acquire yet aggregate measure of RT; this can mask any
interesting microstructure of unfolding statistical learning. Very elegant
experiments can be designed to capture strategies using this measure (e.g.,
error and probabilistic sequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schvaneveldt
&#x00026; Gomez, 1998</xref>), by focusing on the RT distribution itself (e.g.,
very-short RTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Willingham et al., 1989</xref>),
or simply by inducing prediction during training or testing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Destrebecqz &#x00026; Cleeremans, 2005</xref>); but in
our design, the dynamics of prediction during learning are unveiled naturally
and more transparently. Future work could identify the modes of operating, and
the principles that guide them, by exploiting the behavioral measures we used
here (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Duran &#x00026; Dale, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Moisello et al., 2009</xref>; D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3b"><title>Implicit/explicit divide: Prediction and awareness</title><p>Previous studies have also found that indices of prediction correlate with
explicit knowledge of the presence of regularity of a sequence (D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Willingham et al., 1989</xref>), and our results replicate this
connection. What is especially novel in our results, the study&#x02019;s
limitations notwithstanding, is that the time course of the onset of this
prediction can be captured. The data reported here suggest that participants
rapidly initiate prediction as a strategy that accompanies the acquisition of
knowledge, rather than being a direct consequence of it (cf. D. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Marcus et al., 2006</xref>). As mentioned at the
outset of this paper, many researchers have identified prediction as a central
process underlying much of perception, cognition, and action. It has been
implicated in high-level cognitive processes, such as explicit awareness of
causal agency (e.g., temporal relations in action-effect for judgment of
authorship; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Wegner, 2003</xref>) and
self-awareness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jeannerod, 2006</xref>, for
a review of relevant evidence), and even at lower levels, as a foundational
process of action and perception, since prominent theories of action control
still propose that the cognitive system predicts the consequences of actions
(e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hommel, 2009</xref>). Yet the fact that
prediction seems to relate to implicit/explicit knowledge in statistical
learning has not gained much theoretical attention.</p><p>One recent account that may explain why explicit prediction of the kind measured
here - which we have often referred to as <italic>wagers</italic> - is the
theory of Morsella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2005</xref>), which explains
phenomenal states as emerging in cross-modal and integrative contexts that
converge to control body plans. When diverse information (e.g., from multiple
modalities) converges on action plans, the states that accompany such a
condition have phenomenal properties that may function to bind these diverse
information sources into a likeness of experience that we typically call
<italic>consciousness, awareness</italic>, and so on. When wagering
prediction occurs, it may reflect a convergence of information from prior
perception and action experiences that, in Morsella&#x02019;s (2005) terms,
interfere with ongoing body plans, and phenomenal states reflect the cognitive
system&#x02019;s integration or binding of these experiences in order to maintain
skeletomotor control. In this sense, the strategy of explicit, stimulus-specific
prediction must draw the motor system away from other possible association and
drive the system toward a particular location; implicit associative processes
may involve parallel processes that compete more &#x0201c;benignly&#x0201d; and do
not require phenomenal binding processes to anchor them. This proposed
distinction can only be treated as gradient and approximate, however, because
there is evidence for <italic>implicit</italic> predictions in statistical
learning in other work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Turk-Browne,
Scholl, Johnson, &#x00026; Chun, 2010</xref>). It turns out that these more
implicit process do seem to relate to visual prediction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bar, 2009</xref>), where underlying associative
representations may be employed for relatively implicit, rapid expectations;
whereas in ours and previous studies, explicit awareness accompanies motoric
manifestations of prediction, as perhaps Morsella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2005</xref>) would hypothesize. Future research may reveal that
prediction bears in different ways on perceptual and response-based
implicit/explicit learning.</p><p>The foregoing discussion is not meant to argue that explicit knowledge is
required for learning, and indeed our data are suggestive of the early stages of
implicit learning in very simple sequences. We also do not wish to take up the
notion that implicit/explicit learning systems are architecturally distinct;
there are other perspectives on these issues that do not necessarily require
complete separation of processes or their resulting knowledge in order to
account for experimental data, whether one rejects any such dissociation (e.g.,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Perruchet &#x00026; Amorim, 1992</xref>), or
embraces a more gradient perspective on implicit/explicit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cleeremans &#x00026; Jim&#x000e9;nez, 2002</xref>).
Regardless of one&#x02019;s theoretical stance on architectural separation or
distinct functioning modes of a single learning system, the surface behavior
that is exhibited in this simple SRT task suggests that there are indeed
different modes or strategies that emerge during learning. We would argue that
the experimental paradigm we have presented may help mitigate these kinds of
theoretical debates.</p><p>This discussion is, of course, purely speculative with regard to the current
experiment, and there is extensive discussion about explicit
&#x0201c;conscious&#x0201d; awareness of such things as the actions that unfold
during everyday tasks, of why such actions have taken place, and of the learning
that may take place during these actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cleeremans et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cleeremans
&#x00026; Jim&#x000e9;nez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cohen &#x00026;
Schooler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Haggard, Clark, &#x00026;
Kalogeras, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hurley, 2002</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jeannerod, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reber, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Sarrazin, Cleeremans, &#x00026; Haggard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Van Orden &#x00026; Holden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Wegner, 2003</xref>), that we do not have space to
consider here. The excitement in the field regarding prediction, and the
continued interest in consciousness as an outstanding puzzle of the cognitive
sciences, may be a point of synergy between basic research on predictive
cognition and philosophical discussion of explicit awareness of learning that
takes place during everyday life. The field thus requires the development of new
techniques to tap predictive tendencies in laboratory contexts, and relate these
tendencies to implicit or explicit processes that underlie statistical learning.
We hope readers find the paradigm and experiment we offer here as a promising
means by which this can be pursued to bridge the divide.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation grant BCS-0720322 to
