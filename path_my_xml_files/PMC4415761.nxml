Insufficient angiogenesis can result in impaired wound healing and chronic wound formation. Electrical stimulation (ES) has been shown to enhance angiogenesis. We previously showed that ES enhanced angiogenesis in acute wounds at one time point (day 14). The aim of this study was to further evaluate the role of ES in affecting angiogenesis during the acute phase of cutaneous wound healing over multiple time points. We compared the angiogenic response to wounding in 40 healthy volunteers (divided into two groups and randomised), treated with ES (post-ES) and compared them to secondary intention wound healing (control). Biopsy time points monitored were days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14. Objective non-invasive measures and H&#x00026;E analysis were performed in addition to immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting (WB). Wound volume was significantly reduced on D7, 10 and 14 post-ES (p = 0.003, p = 0.002, p&#x0003c;0.001 respectively), surface area was reduced on days 10 (p = 0.001) and 14 (p&#x0003c;0.001) and wound diameter reduced on days 10 (p = 0.009) and 14 (p = 0.002). Blood flow increased significantly post-ES on D10 (p = 0.002) and 14 (p = 0.001). Angiogenic markers were up-regulated following ES application; protein analysis by IHC showed an increase (p&#x0003c;0.05) in VEGF-A expression by ES treatment on days 7, 10 and 14 (39%, 27% and 35% respectively) and PLGF expression on days 3 and 7 (40% on both days), compared to normal healing. Similarly, WB demonstrated an increase (p&#x0003c;0.05) in PLGF on days 7 and 14 (51% and 35% respectively). WB studies showed a significant increase of 30% (p&#x0003e;0.05) on day 14 in VEGF-A expression post-ES compared to controls. Furthermore, organisation of granulation tissue was improved on day 14 post-ES. This randomised controlled trial has shown that ES enhanced wound healing by reduced wound dimensions and increased VEGF-A and PLGF expression in acute cutaneous wounds, which further substantiates the role of ES in up-regulating angiogenesis as observed over multiple time points. This therapeutic approach may have potential application for clinical management of delayed and chronic wounds.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Partial funding was provided by Fenzian Ltd.

Electrical stimulation (ES) in its various forms has been shown to enhance wound healing by promoting the migration of keratinocytes and macrophages, enhancing angiogenesis, stimulating fibroblasts, and influencing protein synthesis throughout the inflammatory, proliferative and remodelling phases of healing [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Electrical signals have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis and organise blood vessel formation [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is limited information on the influence of ES on angiogenesis after acute wounding in human skin, as most research is restricted to animal models. Animal studies have shown that angiogenesis is induced by ES in ischemic and non-ischemic rat limbs, and is facilitated by the increased expression of VEGF in muscle cells [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Endogenous electric fields are able to direct the migration of epithelial cells during wound healing and may contribute to regulation of angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have shown that certain electrical currents, such as direct and alternating currents, are useful in treating; diabetic foot ulcers, skin ulcers and chronic wounds [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We have investigated the in vitro effect of different types of ES on the expression of collagen in skin fibroblasts. Importantly, we highlighted the role of a novel waveform termed degenerate wave (DW is a degenerating sine wave, which deteriorates over time) and demonstrated its beneficial effects compared to other known waveforms such as direct and alternating currents [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a recent in vivo study, we also demonstrated the application of an ES biofeedback device, which produces DW in a human volunteer study (n = 20) involving only one time point (day 14) punch biopsy [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The results showed increased blood flow in acute cutaneous wounds following the biopsy compared to controls that had not received ES. Additional experimental gene and protein studies corroborated these findings by demonstrating up-regulation of angiogenesis and down-regulation of inflammation in ES treated wounds [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, this study [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] only evaluated the effects of ES at one time point (day 14), with 20 participants and using only two objective measures.</p><p>In view of the above scientifically interesting and clinically relevant findings, the aim of this study was to further evaluate the role of ES in affecting angiogenesis during the acute phase of cutaneous wound healing over multiple time points to identify if the enhanced effect occurred earlier than day 14. In addition to multiple time points, we also used an increased number of sequential skin biopsies, increased number of participants (n = 40) with randomisation verified using additional non-invasive objective devices such as a three-dimensional camera and a Dermacorder (BioElectromed Corporation, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Healthy participants were enrolled into the study at the University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, England, UK.

Additionally, the anaesthetic used has been utilised routinely following surgery and there has been no evidence, which suggests this could have any detrimental effects on angiogenesis or wound healing. The punch biopsies were performed 5cm from the axillary hairline and parallel to the medial epicondyle and were 2.5cm in distance from each other (<xref rid="pone.0124502.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

It is a transcutaneous low intensity device, which detects changes in skin impedance. This device forms part of a biofeedback link with the individual&#x02019;s normal physiological repair. This modality follows the theory that the normal electrical potential of skin forms a global electrical network, which reflects the underlying neurological activity through changes in skin impedance. Using a concentric electrode the device detects the skin&#x02019;s electrical impedance and adjusts the outgoing microcurrent electrical biofeedback impulses. The device produces the degenerate waves and delivers 0.004 milliamps, 20&#x02013;80V, has a frequency default of 60Hz and impulses, which last approximately six-hundredth of a second. ES therapy was administered for all participants in both cohorts to the arms on 4 occasions. For cohort 1, ES was performed on days 7, 10, 12 and 14. For cohort 2, ES was administered on days 14, 17, 21 and 24. Electrical stimulation was applied by a single researcher and administered according to a standardised local protocol around the wound site. Treatments were performed for approximately 30 minutes. The intensity of the device was comfortable for the participant and the treatment was painless.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Objective Non-invasive Measures</title><p>Objective non-invasive imaging modalities were used at each time point for both cohorts prior to any intervention to monitor the progression of wound healing which will be outlined below.</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Full-field Laser Perfusion Imaging</title><p>Full-field Laser Perfusion Imaging (FLPI) (Moor Instruments Ltd, Axminster, UK) is a technique, which measures blood flow in the skin&#x02019;s microcirculation. This device uses low power light from a monochromatic stable laser and this is applied to a tissue, which becomes scattered by moving red blood cells which broadens the frequency. This is then photo detected and is processed to provide a blood flow measurement. Blood flow known as &#x0201c;flux&#x0201d; is described in arbitrary &#x0201c;perfusion units&#x0201d;. This is proportional to the speed and concentration of red blood cells in the tissue [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This device has been used in an acute human wound model and demonstrated that this technique is useful for small acute wounds [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Three-Dimensional (3D) Camera</title><p>The 3D LifeViz camera (Quantificare S.A., Cedez, France) in conjunction with its software system provides 3D visualisation with quantitative measurement [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The DermaPix image management software enables analysis of the images. This device was used to provide accurate imaging and measurements of the volume, surface area, and diameter of all participants&#x02019; biopsy sites as well as the depth of the wounds. 3D imaging has also been used to quantitate the surface roughness of skin and scars in a study by Bloemen et al [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. They found that the inter-observer reliability was satisfactory.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Dermacorder</title><p>The Dermacorder (BioElectromed Corporation, USA) is a bioelectric field imager used for measuring the electrical field (EF) in human skin [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is thought that skin has a transepidermal potential of approximately 10&#x02013;60mV [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition to the polarised distribution of ion channels, the distribution of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase ion pumps is also highly localised [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. When a wound is made, a low resistance pathway is formed and the transepidermal potential reaches 0mV at the wound. However, at distances of 1mm away or greater, the potential remains normal [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This drives a current of injury out of the wound and generates a lateral EF that can be detected non-invasively using the Dermacorder. The use of this device has been verified in an acute human skin wound study by Nuccitelli et al [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We used this device to measure the EF at the edges of the biopsy wounds on half of the patients (n = 20) due to availability of the device.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real time- polymerase chain reaction</title><p>For <italic>in vivo</italic> biopsies obtained on different days of healing, RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR were performed as explained previously [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, after tissues were diced, 0&#x000b7;5&#x02013;1 ml Trizol was added and the tubes were introduced to Qiagen tissue lyser (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) to homogenization. Additionally, it was centrifuged and the resulting supernatant was mixed with 0&#x000b7;2 ml chloroform (cat. 10050090; Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK).

Briefly, dewaxing was done in the same way as explained for H&#x00026;E staining. Antigen retrieval was done with citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 60&#x000b0;C for 1 h and then followed Novolink polymer detection kit protocol (cat. RE7150-K, Leica Biosystems Newcastle ltd., Newcastle Upon-Tyne, UK) which included endogenous peroxidase blocking for 30 min, protein blocking for 30 min and further incubation with primary and secondary (post primary) antibodies. After Novolink polymer incubation, sections were incubated with the substrate/chromogen, 3,3&#x02019; - diaminobenzidine (DAB), prepared from DAB chromogen and Novolink DAB substrate buffer (Polymer). Sections were counterstained with Hematoxylin and cover-slipped.

Additionally, measurements for the control arm and post-ES arm were compared on all wound days using pair-wise Wilcoxon signed ranks tests. All analyses used a two-sided 1% significance level; adjusting for repeated comparisons on multiple study days using Bonferroni adjustment. For cohort 1, wound days 30, 60 and 90 were considered to correspond to post-ES arm wound days 23, 53 and 83. At these follow-up time points, there was no control arm. The data were analysed to identify any trends or assess any effects that had been sustained in the treated arm. The randomisation was conducted by the statisticians in nQuery Advisor 7.0 using a computer generated permuted block design with mixed block sizes and random seed. All summaries and analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). For histological experiments, data is presented as mean +/- standard deviation from three independent experiments performed in triplicates (n = 3). Statistical analysis was calculated using one way ANOVA for comparison between three groups with Tukey post hoc test, and student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test for comparison between two groups. Confidence intervals of 95% with corresponding p value of 0.05 was chosen throughout analysis.

We have shown that wound volume was significantly reduced following ES on day 7. Additionally, volume, surface area and diameter of the wounds were significantly reduced post-ES on days 10 and 14. Furthermore, we noted a statistically significant increase in blood flow on days 10 and 14 post-ES. This particular finding was further verified with a simultaneous up regulation of angiogenic biomarkers in wound biopsies. The EF present at the wound edges was increased following ES in the initial days of healing albeit decreased in the later stages, compared to the control. To our knowledge, this detailed study, is unique in investigating the role of ES in enhancing cutaneous wound healing in human skin. Multiple sequential time points were correlated with a number of objective parameters including histological markers to demonstrate the role of an exogenous asymmetric biphasic current in positively impacting the rate of progression of cutaneous wound healing.</p><p>The benefits of this study were the relatively larger sample size of 40 compared to our previously published study of twenty subjects [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the inclusion of sequential temporal biopsies, randomisation to account for handedness and the utilisation of multiple non-invasive measuring devices to monitor the progression of wound healing. In the previous study, we did not utilise a device to measure the size of the wounds, therefore in the current study the use of a 3D camera proved invaluable as it enabled quantitative measurements of wound volume, surface area and diameter before and after application of ES. Additionally, for the first time, we used Dermacorder to measure the EF at the wound edges. The homogeneity of the cohorts was a strength of the study as all subjects were of a similar Fitzpatrick skin type, all were of same ethnic origin (Caucasian), all were right handed and all were of a similar age group (under 30 years of age). The participant arms were randomised to account for handedness as their dominant hand may have affected the healing of the wound, as this arm would be most active arm and in constant use. Additionally, the Fitzpatrick score gave a range of similar skin types for the participants in relation to having a homogenous cohort of subjects for melanin level measurement pre and post ES treatment. Furthermore, a single researcher conducted the treatments and data collections; therefore, inter-observer biases and errors were reduced. Evidence of wound crusting did not cause a problem when measuring the biopsy wounds. By day 7, the majority of crusting was not present with contracting 5mm biopsy wounds, therefore there was either none or minimal crusting present.</p><p>We demonstrated that the wound dimensions reduced following ES treatment compared to the controls, which was verified objectively and quantitatively by 3D imaging that calculated the surface area, volume, diameter and depth of the wound sites. This technique has also been used in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Contraction of the wound begins soon after wounding and peaks at 2 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The degree of wound contraction varies with the depth of the wound. For full-thickness wounds as in our study, contraction is an important part of healing and accounts for up to a 40% decrease in the size of the wound [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, the greatest reductions following ES were for wound volume on days 7, 10 and 14 and this reduced by 38.9%, 37.9% and 44.1% respectively.</p><p>We used the Dermacorder to measure the EF at the wound edges and demonstrated that the EF was increased following the application of ES. We noted that the potential difference between the wound and the healthy skin was increased on the initial days of healing post-ES treatment. EF = Potential difference / Distance. On day 3, there was a significant reduction in the diameter of the wounds post-ES, while the EF was increased. This shows that the potential difference was increased post-ES treatment. However, on days 10 and 14 the combined effect of both reduction in wound diameter and increase in potential difference may have resulted in a greater EF post-ES treatment. It is thought that current of injury decreases with subsequent time points in wound healing [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On day 60, EF was reduced following ES, while the wound diameter remained similar compared to the normal healing process. This demonstrates that there is a greater reduction in potential difference following ES application in the later stages of wound healing, which indicates accelerated repair. This also indicates that a non-leaky epidermal barrier had been established faster post-ES treatment.</p><p>Nuccitelli et al [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] developed this new approach, which does not require any electrode contact at the wound site therefore making it possible to quantitate the EF near skin wounds [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The endogenous EF generated near skin wounds is of interest because keratinocyte migration and wound healing are strongly influenced by EF [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A previous study on the subject of galvanotaxis involving human keratinocytes indicated that the mean translocation velocity of cells were proportional to the EF [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, during the maturation and remodeling phase of wound healing, the epidermis re-established its structure and resistance [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, the wound current and EF would approach to normal or control levels. The epidermal lateral EF decreases gradually with stratification in re-epithelialisation [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This correlates with the results observed here.</p><p>In this study, we also showed that there may be a direct effect of ES current through the skin on blood flow. We demonstrated that blood flow was significantly increased on days 10 and 14 following the application of ES. Our results are further corroborated by the findings from our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], where we showed that blood flow was significantly increased at day 14 (p = 0.027). These results were further supported by the previous gene and protein studies [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which showed that ES significantly up-regulated angiogenesis and down-regulated inflammation on day 14. However, to validate the results in the current study, we further investigated VEGF-A and PLGF mitogens. VEGF-A is involved in the normal physiological development of blood vessels [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and its biological effects on maturing endothelium usually takes place over the course of minutes to days during angiogenesis in wound healing. This phenomenon includes VEGF receptor phosphorylation, existing vascular dilation and permeability, and activation of endothelial cell precursors [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. PLGF is also a member of the VEGF family [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and has been shown to have strong angiogenic properties in mice [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, it has been shown to be up-regulated in the active angiogenic phase of wound healing in both migrating keratinocytes and endothelial cells of blood vessels within the human wound bed [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The increasing vascularisation over time, associated with multiple signs of active neo-angiogenesis in the dermal microvasculature indicated that the quiescent endothelium was responsive to ES, which activated potent angiogenic mitogens [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the developing vascular phenotype of human dermis following ES and controls, had no distinct features, other than an increase in capillary/vessel number when observed in ES treated tissues. This striking angiogenic phenotype induced by up-regulated VEGF-A and PLGF raises the possibility that these cytokines could be further modulated exogenously when ES is given to enhance neo-angiogenesis for therapeutic purposes.</p><p>We noted an association between blood flow and wound diameter, volume and surface area post-ES on days 10 and 14, compared to the control. Blood flow was increased whilst wound dimensions decreased following treatment with ES. It has been shown in a previous study using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in patients with peripheral arterial disease that capillary density was increased following treatment at 3 and 6 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Additionally, an increase in transcutaneous oxygen measurements were reported at the same time points. Therefore, it may be possible that ES could enhance the formation of capillaries. Follow-up time points on days 60 and 90 were used in both the current study (Cohort 1) and the previous trial [<xref rid="pone.0124502.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The results from both studies were compared, looking at the data produced from the common measurement device, FLPI, measuring blood flow. There were some similarities between the results from both studies. However, there was a reduction in blood flow by day 90 that was shown in both studies.</p><p>The ES device used forms part of a biofeedback link with the individual&#x02019;s normal physiological repair. This modality follows the theory that the normal electrical potential of skin forms a global electrical network, which reflects the underlying neurological activity through changes in skin impedance. The treatment was well tolerated by all participants and was relatively easy to use in clinical practice.</p><p>Limitations of this study include, the total number of time points employed for evaluation and performing sequential biopsies. In addition, the potential use of additional tools and objective devices for monitoring the process of repair non-invasively may add further detail and value to this study. Future studies are required to note the long-term effect of delivering ES to acute wounds beyond the day 14 time point and whether there is a need for additional treatments to be given beyond the time points discussed in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec034"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study indicates that ES accelerates acute cutaneous wound healing evidenced by a reduction in wound volume, diameter and surface area and an increase in blood flow. There is clear evidence from invasive and non-invasive modalities that treatment with ES resulted in increased angiogenesis. This study further substantiates the role of ES in enhancing cutaneous wound repair evidenced by quantifiable objective measures and histological analysis observed in multiple time points. Furthermore, this treatment may have potential application for treatment of delayed and chronic wounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec035"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124502.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria.</title><p>Table displaying the inclusion and exclusion criteria for assessing participant suitability to be enrolled onto this study.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124502.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124502.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Demographic data.</title><p>Table outlining the demographic data for the two cohorts combined.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124502.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124502.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Details of primers used for the study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124502.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124502.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>List of antibodies used for immunohistochemistry analysis.</title><p>Primary antibodies, secondary antibodies, concentration of antibodies, incubation parameters and detection methods used for immunohistochemistry analysis.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124502.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124502.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>List of antibodies used for Western blotting.</title><p>Primary antibodies, secondary antibodies, concentration of antibodies, incubation parameters and detection methods used for Western blotting.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0124502.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124502.s006"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Wound surface area data.</title><p>Table displaying the data for wound surface areas for both cohorts 1 and 2: Surface Area (mm<sup>2</sup>) Median (Range) for Biopsy Arms and Differences in Biopsy Arms.
