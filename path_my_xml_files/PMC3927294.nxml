The concentration of isoflurane used was recorded every 15 min.

This can be achieved using high concentrations of anesthetic agents or administration of vasodilators like sodium nitroprusside. However, these pharmacological techniques are associated with tachycardia which, apart from being an undesirable side-effect, can increase the venous oozing and therefore obscure the surgical field.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor antagonist such as labetalol, metoprolol and esmolol have been shown to be useful in lowering the blood pressure and provide a relatively bloodless field for surgery, but because of their short duration of action, this benefit does not last throughout the surgery.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>This clinical trial was an attempt to study the effect of oral bisoprolol, a longer acting &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor antagonist, to reduce the bleeding and thus improve the operating conditions, during FESS.

All adult, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II patients, scheduled for FESS, were eligible to participate in this study. Patients with hypertension, asthma, bleeding disorders and those on anti-platelet or anti-hypertensive medications were excluded. During the pre-operative evaluation, the study details were explained to the patients and an informed consent was obtained. A total of 30 subjects consented and as per the serially-labeled, sealed envelope, received the study drug (bisoprolol fumarate 2.5 mg or a placebo) orally with a sip of water, 90 min before the surgery.</p><p>The anesthesiologist taking care of the patient was blinded to the randomization. The anesthetic management of all the subjects was similar. Standard monitoring included electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 1 mg, fentanyl 1-2 &#x003bc;g/kg, thiopentone 4-5 mg/kg and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg and maintained on nitrous-oxide (60%), oxygen (40%) and isoflurane. The trachea was intubated with a suitable sized endotracheal tube and all patients received intravenous fluid at 4 ml/kg/h. Patient was positioned supine with the head elevated to about 30&#x000b0;. The surgeon infiltrated the nasal mucosa using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:200,000). The plan was to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 60-70 mmHg during the surgery. It was left to the anesthesiologist's clinical judgment to adjust the concentration of isoflurane and the dose of fentanyl. Dexamethasone (4 mg), immediately after induction of anesthesia and ondansetron (4 mg), half an hour before the end of the surgery was administered as antiemetic. At the end of the surgery, the residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with a standard dose of neostigmine and atropine. All the subjects were observed in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for an hour and in the ward overnight. In the PACU, the hemoglobin level was measured in all the patients.</p><p>The percentage of isoflurane administered and the total gas flow was recorded every 15 min. The volume of blood lost during surgery was measured by recording the volume in the suction bottle and counting the number of cotton strips used during surgery. A fully soaked cotton strip was estimated to contain 5 ml of blood and a partially soaked one as containing 2.5 ml. Immediately after the surgery, the surgeon was asked about his perception of the operating conditions and to grade the surgical field during the surgery, using the Fromme-Boezaart scale.</p><p><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-30-59-g001.jpg" position="float"/></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistics</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Calculation of sample size</title><p>A pilot study was carried out on 16 patients, with 8 of them receiving bisoprolol fumarate 2.5 mg as premedication while the others acted as controls.

The nasal mucosa is a very sensitive area and surgery of this region is associated with severe sympathetic stimulation causing hypertension and tachycardia. The nasal and the sinus mucosae are very vascular and bleed easily, which would severely compromise the visualization of the surgical field through the endoscope. This could result in inadvertent tissue injury leading to adhesions and scarring and even severe complications such as orbital and brain injury.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Establishing a near bloodless operative field is ideal for ease of surgery and to reduce complications.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Acceptable operative conditions during FESS have been achieved with local anesthesia,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] total intravenous and inhalational anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Infiltration of the nasal mucosa with local anesthetic and epinephrine cause local vasoconstriction and reduces bleeding for a limited period of time, but this can lead to transient hypertension and tachycardia; although, depending on the sympathetic tone, profound hypotension has also been reported.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Topical application of cocaine (3 mg/kg) is also effective in vasoconstriction of the mucosal vasculature.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Steroids, administered over several pre-operative days, would reduce the inflammatory process and reduce the bleeding during surgery. Total Intravenous anesthesia with propofol, remifentanil and dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce bleeding during FESS and provide good operating conditions.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, the expense and the availability of these drugs could be a factor to consider.</p><p>Reducing the arterial pressure during the procedure does minimize intra-operative bleeding.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This is usually achieved by increasing the concentration of inhalational or intravenous anesthetic agents or inducing hypotension with the drugs such as sodium-nitroprusside. However, these techniques are associated with reflex tachycardia, which apart from being an undesirable side-effect, also increases venous oozing.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The extent of surgical bleeding depends not only on the MAP, but also on the venous pressure and the capillary blood flow. It has been suggested that decreasing the heart rate increases the diastolic time with greater filling of the venous capacitance vessels, which lowers the venous pressure over the surgical field and therefore reduces the venous oozing.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In this study, if the initial surge due to the sympathetic stimulation of intubation and infiltration of the vasoconstrictor is ignored, the MAPs during the operative period were 70.0 &#x000b1; 2.7 and 62.6 &#x000b1; 3.6 mmHg in the control and the bisoprolol groups, respectively. Although this difference is statistically significant, it is not so, clinically. The heart rates during this period were 95.1 &#x000b1; 6.2 and 61.7 &#x000b1; 3.6/min. Therefore, it seems likely that the blood loss is directly related to the heart rate, as has been suggested by Nair <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is also important to note that the reduction in the arterial pressure in the control group required a significantly higher dose of isoflurane and fentanyl.</p><p>Beta blocker lowers the blood pressure and the heart rate and thereby reduces surgical bleeding and improves visualization. Previous studies have used single doses of metoprolol[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or esmolol,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] which are short acting and although did reduce the bleeding initially, the effect did not persist through the length of the surgery. As the effect of the &#x003b2;-blocker wore off, the heart rate and the venous tone increased leading to more bleeding.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] A continuous infusion of esmolol could be used to maintain the effect, but a single, pre-operative, oral medication appears simpler to implement. This clinical trial was an attempt to study the impact of bisoprolol, a longer acting beta-blocker, in reducing the bleeding and therefore improve the operative conditions, during FESS.</p><p>The volume of blood lost during the surgery was significantly lower in those patients who received bisoprolol. This could be due to one or more of the following reasons: The negative chronotropic action of bisoprolol would reduce the frequency of pulsations of the arterioles and thus the exudation of blood per unit time from the damaged vessels; The resultant hypotension would reduce the pressure head of the blood flowing out of ruptured vessels and thus decrease the volume lost.; Bradycardia increases the diastolic period leading to lower venous pressure and thus reduce the venous oozing.</p><p>The dose of bisoprolol used was only 2.5 mg which should not cause any serious side-effects. However, one patient did have significant bradycardia and hypotension when the nasal mucosa was infiltrated with epinephrine for vasoconstriction. This could possibly be a &#x0201c;vaso-vagal&#x0201d; reflex due to stimulation of the trigeminal nucleus causing vagal stimulation and bradycardia. A low dose of epinephrine infiltrated along with the local anesthetic into the surgical field has been shown to cause transient hypotension.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>This study has also shown that bisoprolol obtunded the sympathetic response to intubation and the infiltration of the vasoconstrictor into the nasal mucosa. This would be an added advantage in patients with coronary heart disease, in whom tachycardia is undesirable. Surgery in the region of the trigeminal nerve innervation is associated with a significant sympathetic response and the resulting tachycardia and hypertension is controlled by increasing the concentration of inhalational anesthetic and aliquots of opioids. Those who received bisoprolol, needed a significantly lower dose of fentanyl and isoflurane, thereby providing both clinical and financial benefit. The volume of liquid isoflurane used in those who received bisoprolol was only 28% of that used in the control group patients. Although, there was no incidence of awareness and the percentage of isoflurane was above one minimum alveolar concentration, one of the improvements that can be added to this study is an objective measure of depth of anesthesia, such as bispectral index monitoring.</p><p>The surgical field was graded by the surgeon at the end of the surgery, providing an overall impression. While planning this study it was felt that it was important to have the surgeon's opinion, but repeated assessment during the surgery would have distracted the surgeon, especially when the bleeding was excessive. Hence, a direct, real-time correlation between the arterial pressure or the heart rate and the Fromme-Boezaart grade of the operative field could not be performed. However, this assessment did give a global picture of the operating conditions. The decreased bleeding provided a better view for the surgeon and facilitated the speed of surgery, thereby reducing the operating time.</p><p>Therefore, this clinical trial has demonstrated that administration of a single pre-operative dose of bisoprolol (2.5 mg) can significantly reduce the blood loss during FESS and improve the visualization of the operating field and it also lowers the use of isoflurane and fentanyl needed to achieve this. The fact that the nasal mucosa is so vascular and bleeds easily definitely contributed to this low sample size study to show a significant difference (effect size) both statistically and clinically.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
