Randomization of patients ensured that 10 subjects received first the AGE-rich beverage (AGE-BLG) and were then switched to receive the control beverage (C-BLG) after a washout period of at least 7 days (first sequence). The remaining nine subjects followed the inverse sequence of test beverages (second sequence).</p><p>On each visit, vascular studies of the macrocirculation [flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)] and microcirculation [laser Doppler measured at the hand (reactive hyperemia following forearm ischemia)], measurements of blood pressure, heart rate, and blood draws were performed at baseline (T<sub>0</sub>) as well as 90 (T<sub>90</sub>) and 180 min (T<sub>180</sub>) following the test beverage.

The solution was then lyophilized, passed through a 1-mm mesh sieve, put in a climate-regulated drying cupboard at 25&#x000b0;C and 44% humidity for 3 days, and then packaged into closed plastic bags. The product was afterward exposed to 50&#x000b0;C for 17 h, then dissolved in water (to achieve a concentration of 0.1 g/mL), and ultra-filtered against water to eliminate the remaining free sugars, small degradation products, and other contaminants. After lyophilization and sieving, portions bags (20 g) were prepared and stored in a refrigerator at 4&#x000b0;C until administration.</p><p>For the preparation of the control BLG, exactly the same procedure was applied, except for the fact that no dextrose was added.

This effect was temporally associated with an increase in sCML supporting a detrimental effect of heat-derived dietary AGEs on vascular function in subjects with diabetes as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Generation of AGEs in food during the cooking process depends on the amount and type of substrates present (e.g., reducing sugars and proteins or lipids) and correlates positively with the temperature and duration of preparation and negatively with the humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We prepared our two test beverages using as substrate a single protein class (BLG) treated under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature, and, except for the protein glycation, the preparation of the two beverages was similar.</p><p>We have previously shown that a meal with a high AGE content (15,100 kU CML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and a beverage obtained from a soft-drink extract with an AGE content of 1,800 kU CML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) induced an impairment in macrovascular function in subjects with T2DM. In the current study, an even lower amount of AGEs (120 kU CML) impaired macrovascular function.</p><p>This study has several strengths: it is a randomized, double-blind, controlled study; we administered a well-defined AGE-modified protein class (BLG) obtained under accurately controlled conditions, thus ruling out the influence of other confounding factors like carbohydrates, lipids, inactivation of vitamins, or non&#x02013;glycation-produced food toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). We compared the effects of AGE-BLG to matched and identically temperature-prepared BLG and not to meals prepared under different temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), which enables us to identify effects of the AGE modification of proteins beyond the effect of heat (which might alter nutrients per se). We investigated the effects of whole AGE-modified proteins (BLG) rather than AGE adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), which we consider a dietary-relevant aspect. In our opinion, this study confirms that AGE-modified proteins negatively impact on vascular function in humans, strengthening the findings of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>FMD was decreased by 80% of baseline value at 90 min after the administration of AGE-BLG, showing significant recovery at 180 min, though well below the baseline. Ninety minutes following C-BLG intake, FMD modestly decreased (by 27% of baseline) at T<sub>180</sub>, reaching 51% of baseline, a level comparable to that of AGE-BLG. This suggests that although glycated proteins exert a rapid vascular effect, heat-induced changes of BLG alone may also promote a delayed transient vascular dysfunction, the nature of which requires further study.</p><p>GTN did not significantly change on any occasion, therefore a change in NO sensitivity of the vascular smooth muscle cells can be ruled out. Circulating levels of NO metabolites nitrite [a surrogate of NO bioavailability under physiological and pathophysiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>)] and nitrate decreased by AGE-BLG, suggesting AGE-mediated reduced NO bioavailability as one mechanism of impaired FMD. The bioavailability of NO is dependent on endothelial production and also on its rate of inactivation by, for example, AGEs or by reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Since we found neither a significant change in oxidative stress, nor a change in circulating levels of E-selectin and VCAM-1 as a measure of endothelial cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), it is possible that ingested AGEs directly quenched NO, decreasing its bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). But this hypothesis must be cautiously formulated, since we found no correlation between NO metabolites and CML change. Of note, we did not measure nitrotyrosine; therefore, this study gives limited information on nitrative stress.</p><p>In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), thiobarbituric acid&#x02013;reactive species as a measure of oxidative stress increased 2 h postprandially, decreasing afterward below the baseline value. A circadian variation in parameters regulating oxidative stress was reported, but remained controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In our study, at 90 min, malondialdehyde, a measure of oxidative stress, increased modestly after AGE-BLG and decreased compared with baseline at T<sub>180</sub> following both beverages. The explanation could be a circadian variation in oxidative stress and/or an efficient activation of antioxidant mechanisms by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found no effect by AGE-BLG on microvascular function. These results appear somehow in contrast to those we reported following a high-heat, high-AGE meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), which, however, contained glucose, lipids, and other heat-generated substances not involved in the current setting.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that even relatively low amounts of AGE-modified food proteins acutely impaired macrovascular function in patients with T2DM, independently of other effects imparted by thermal exposure of foods. Our study strengthens the evidence for a detrimental effect of food AGEs on vascular function in this population. Similar to postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), repeated postprandial alterations of vascular function due to oral glycotoxins might contribute to the development of vascular complications.</p><sec id="s10"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Since no healthy controls were investigated, the conclusions of the current study apply only to a population with T2DM.</p><p>We did not measure the endotoxin content of beverages. An interaction between endotoxins and the AGE receptor system exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and endotoxin-like products might contaminate AGE preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). While intravenous administration of endotoxins induces severe toxicity in mammals, oral administration of a high dose of lipopolysaccharides caused no toxicity or systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), probably due to poor endotoxin absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). We therefore do not believe that endotoxin effects influenced our results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
