It spares catecholamine use but whether it improves outcome remains uncertain. Current evidence suggests that it may be most effective if used early and possibly in conjunction with corticosteroids. This trial will compare vasopressin to noradrenaline as initial vasopressor in the management of adult septic shock and investigate whether there is an interaction of vasopressin with corticosteroids.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a multicentre, factorial (2&#x000d7;2), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 412 patients will be recruited from multiple UK intensive care units and randomised to receive vasopressin (0&#x02013;0.06&#x02005;U/min) or noradrenaline (0&#x02013;12&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/min) as a continuous intravenous infusion as initial vasopressor therapy. If maximum infusion rates of this first study drug are reached, the patient will be treated with either hydrocortisone (initially 50&#x02005;mg intravenous bolus six-hourly) or placebo, before additional open-label catecholamine vasopressors are prescribed. The primary outcome of the trial will be the difference in renal failure-free days between treatment groups. Secondary outcomes include need for renal replacement therapy, survival rates, other organ failures and resource utilisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial protocol and information sheets have received a favourable opinion from the Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (12/SC/0014). There is an independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee and independent membership of the Trial Steering Committee including patient and public involvement.

In the UK, the incidence of severe sepsis has increased 68% over a 9-year period, such that in 2004 there were 31&#x02005;000 patients who had severe sepsis admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A substantial number of patients will also develop severe sepsis after admission to intensive care,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> so the total number of severe sepsis cases may be in excess of 45&#x02005;000/annum. As the population ages and receives more complex medical treatments, this will continue to rise.</p><p>Mortality from sepsis is 30&#x02013;50%, proportional to illness severity and the number of organs failing. Septic shock, the most severe form of sepsis, is defined as hypotension in response to overwhelming infection.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As well as appropriate antibiotic treatment, one of the main treatments is cardiovascular resuscitation using intravenous fluids and catecholamines. Although usually effective in restoring blood pressure, catecholamines have important adverse effects and may even increase mortality.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Vasopressin, an endogenous stress hormone, has been proposed as an adjunct to catecholamines in the treatment of septic shock. The rationale for its use is that a relative vasopressin deficiency occurs in septic shock and exogenously administered vasopressin restores vascular tone,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> increases blood pressure and thus leads to a reduced requirement for catecholamine vasopressors.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Furthermore, vasopressin exerts its effects via interaction with a family of vasopressin receptors. V1a receptors are located on vascular smooth muscle cells and are responsible for vasoconstriction. Heterogeneity of the distribution of V1a receptor could have important clinical and therapeutic implications. For example, vasopressin causes renal efferent, but not renal afferent, artery vasoconstriction thereby increasing renal perfusion pressure and glomerular filtration rate.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In contrast, noradrenaline interacts with &#x003b1;-1 receptors on renal afferent and efferent arterioles and so noradrenaline at high doses may decrease renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Thus, in contrast to noradrenaline, there is a compelling organ-specific heterogeneity in the vascular responsiveness to vasopressin. Importantly, vasopressin also binds to oxytocin receptors, which, in addition to their uterine contractile effects, mediate calcium-dependent vasodilation via stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway in endothelial cells<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> of pulmonary,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> coronary<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and cerebral arteries.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref></p><p>There have been two recent meta-analyses of vasopressin (and its synthetic analogue terlipressin) in septic shock published that clearly demonstrated the catecholamine sparing effect of vasopressin and also suggested that its use appears safe.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The effect on short-term mortality was not so clear. Serpa Neto <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> using a fixed-effect model, reported a relative risk (RR) of death in adult patients treated with vasopressin/terlipressin of 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.99). Polito <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> using a random-effect model, reported an RR for vasopressin/terlipressin of 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.05). The uncertainty about the effect of vasopressin on survival rates in septic shock is reflected in the 2008 international Surviving Sepsis guidelines<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> that stated &#x0201c;Vasopressin&#x02026;may be added to noradrenaline subsequently with anticipation of an effect equivalent to that of noradrenaline alone.&#x0201d;</p><p>Therefore, there appears to be equipoise about the effect of vasopressin on outcome in septic shock and more trials are warranted. In order to design future trials, it is important to consider the results of the Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST), the largest randomised controlled trial of vasopressin until now.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In this multicentre trial, 779 patients who had established septic shock were randomised to receive a blinded infusion of either vasopressin or noradrenaline in addition to conventional catecholamine vasopressors. There was no evidence of a difference in 28-day mortality between the treatment groups (35.4% vasopressin group and 39.3% noradrenaline group, p=0.26) or in 90-day mortality (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively, p=0.11). Importantly, vasopressin infusion in septic shock appeared safe. The overall serious adverse event (SAE) rate was the same in the vasopressin and noradrenaline groups (10.3% and 10.5%, respectively), and there was no difference in specific adverse events (AEs) including myocardial ischaemia<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> or cardiac output.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, in the predefined stratum of less severe shock, there was a reduced mortality in the vasopressin group compared with the noradrenaline group (26.5% vs 35.7% 28-day mortality, respectively, p=0.05). There was no difference in mortality between treatment groups in patients who had more severe shock. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, the patient group treated with vasopressin within 12&#x02005;h (n=427) had a reduced mortality (33.2% vs 40.5%, p=0.12), but no difference in mortality if treated with vasopressin after 12&#x02005;h. In additional post hoc analyses, vasopressin treatment led to lower rates of progression to renal failure (21.2% vs 41.2%, p=0.02) and mortality (30.8% vs 54.7%, p=0.01) in patients at &#x02018;Risk&#x02019; of renal failure, but no difference in outcomes if renal failure was already established.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The Editorial accompanying the VASST report suggested that early use of vasopressin may be needed to produce a significant improvement in survival.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Another interesting subgroup analysis from VASST<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> provided strong evidence of an interaction between vasopressin/noradrenaline treatment and corticosteroid treatment (interaction p=0.008). The combination of vasopressin and steroids led to a lower mortality compared with noradrenaline plus steroids (35.9% vs 44.7%, respectively, p=0.03) and less organ dysfunction demonstrated by more days alive and free from shock, ventilation and renal failure. In contrast, patients who were treated with vasopressin and had no corticosteroids had an increased mortality compared with patients who were treated with noradrenaline and no steroids (33.7% vs 21.3%, respectively, p=0.06). The use of corticosteroids in septic shock remains controversial despite more than 40&#x02005;years of research. There is good evidence that they spare catecholamine requirements<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and recent meta-analyses reported a beneficial effect of prolonged low-dose corticosteroids in the more severely ill patients.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Therefore, in designing a further vasopressin trial in septic shock, we decided it was essential to start vasopressin administration early after the onset of hypotension and that we should control for a potential interaction of vasopressin with corticosteroids. Before starting this main trial, we conducted a pilot study, Vasopressin and Corticosteroids in Septic Shock (VACS).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This randomised controlled trial demonstrated that it was possible to use vasopressin (up to 0.06&#x02005;U/min) safely as an early vasopressor and that there was evidence of a clinical interaction between vasopressin and corticosteroids. Patients randomised to vasopressin and corticosteroids required three fewer days of vasopressin treatment and also received less than half the total vasopressin dose compared with patients randomised to vasopressin and placebo.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>This protocol describes the main trial that compares vasopressin to noradrenaline as initial vasopressor in the management of adult septic shock. As there may be an interaction of vasopressin with corticosteroids, the use of corticosteroids will also be controlled but only given to patients who are poorly responsive to fluids and vasopressors, according to international guidelines.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The VAsopressin versus Noradrenaline as Initial therapy in Septic sHock (VANISH) trial is a multicentre prospective, factorial (2&#x000d7;2), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

This should not occur until the treating physician has reassessed fluid resuscitation status and a reasonable dose of catecholamine has been given an opportunity to increase the blood pressure (suggested &#x02265;0.5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/kg/min of noradrenaline or equivalent). In this situation, study drug 2 should be stopped and open-label steroid given as per the treating physician's prescription. Study drug 1 should continue.</p><p>Similarly, if after inclusion, systemic steroids are required to treat another medical condition (ie, not septic shock) then study drug 2 should be stopped and the necessary steroid prescribed. Study drug 1 should continue. Inhaled steroids can be prescribed as clinically indicated at any time. All other drugs (other than vasopressors) should be prescribed as clinically indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Unblinding</title><p>It is unlikely that there would be a need to unblind the study drugs. The vasopressor infusions have very short half-lives, and therefore if there was an AE, the drug could be stopped and any effects would wear off in minutes. However, emergency envelopes will be supplied to each hospital pharmacy to allow emergency unblinding if needed.</p><p>The local investigators should aim to discuss the need for unblinding with the trial coordinator or chief investigator beforehand.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Laboratory evaluations</title><p>Blood and urine sampling will be carried out in select centres.

This is due to the fact that many patients will have a reduced level of consciousness due to their illness or due to sedative medication used as part of their treatment. As all the study drugs are already routinely used in the management of septic shock, there is minimal extra risk from participation in this study. As septic shock is a medical emergency and the fact that delays in administering the study drugs may affect patient outcome, the patient will be treated and samples collected in the emergency situation without prospective consent. No analysis of data or samples will occur until retrospective consent is obtained. At the first available opportunity, once the clinical condition has stabilised, retrospective consent should be sought.

The PerLR will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and provided with a copy of the covering statement for PerLR with an attached PerLR information sheet and asked to give an opinion as to whether the patient would object to taking part in such medical research.
