Invasive treatments and physiotherapy have been employed to relieve symptoms, but there is limited clinical evidence for their effectiveness. Acupuncture is widely used on Bell's palsy patients in East Asia, but there is insufficient evidence for its effectiveness on Bell's palsy sequelae. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in patients with sequelae of Bell's palsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><p>This study consists of a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms: an acupuncture group and a waitlist group. The acupuncture group will receive acupuncture treatment three times per week for a total of 24 sessions over 8 weeks. Participants in the waitlist group will not receive any acupuncture treatments during this 8 week period, but they will participate in the evaluations of symptoms at the start of the study, at 5 weeks and at 8 weeks after randomization, at which point the same treatment as the acupuncture group will be provided. The primary outcome will be analyzed by the change in the Facial Disability Index (FDI) from baseline to week eight. The secondary outcome measures will include FDI from baseline to week five, House-Brackmann Grade, lip mobility, and stiffness scales.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled-Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN43104115">ISRCTN43104115</ext-link>; registration date: 06 July 2010; the date of the first patient's randomization: 04 August 2010</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Bell's palsy is an acute, idiopathic, unilateral paralysis of the face. Its cause is unknown, but mounting evidence suggests that reactivated herpes viruses from cranial nerve ganglia play a key role in the development of this condition; its pattern is consistent with that of peripheral neural dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Inflammation of the facial nerve initially results in reversible neuropraxia and Wallerian degeneration ultimately ensues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The incidence of Bell's palsy is approximately 30/100,000 people per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The prognosis is good, and approximately 70% of patients recover completely within 6 months without treatment. However, 30% of Bell's palsy patients have sequelae, such as residual paresis (29%), contracture (17%), and facial spasm or synkinesis (16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The incomplete recovery of facial symmetry can have a long-term impact on the quality of life, such as difficulty with drinking, eating and speaking, as well as psychosocial problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The symmetry of the face is a determinant of facial charm and influences interpersonal attraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Medical options for the sequelae of Bell's palsy are limited to invasive treatments, such as injection of Botulinum toxin A and surgical reconstruction. Patients may be referred to physiotherapists as well, although there is no evidence favoring one intervention over another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. According to a 2009 study, the effect of steroids on acute Bell's palsy within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms is clinically effective, but steroids are not used on the sequelae of Bell's palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture is known to be a safe treatment and is used for a wide range of symptoms associated with Bell's palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In a 2007 systematic review, the effect of acupuncture on Bell's palsy was inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This stems from limited clinical studies on acupuncture for Bell's palsy and various errors in the design of some of those studies. To overcome such problems, a large-scale clinical trial investigating the effect of acupuncture on Bell's palsy is under way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here, our aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of acupuncture on the sequelae of Bell's palsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in patients with sequelae of Bell's palsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The change in the Facial Disability Index (FDI) social [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] score after completing eight weeks of acupuncture treatment will be compared to the score prior to treatment. This scoring system consists of two domains; physical score and social score, and has been investigated for the reliability and validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. FDI-social score evaluations will be performed on the first visit, the fifth- and eighth-week visits. Participants will answer five multiple choice questions related to problems associated with facial muscle function during the previous month.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome</title><p>Secondary outcome measures will include FDI-social score from baseline to week five, FDI-physical score, House-Brackmann (H-B) Grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], lip mobility (lip-length and snout indices) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and stiffness scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The H-B grade has been tested for its reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and lip-length and snout indices showed a high correlation with H-B Grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Stiffness scale is a simple five-point scale for facial stiffness (1 = no stiffness, 5 = very stiff) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, there has been no validation study of Korean version of each of the primary and secondary outcomes. In our study, two professional translators made each outcome measurement questionnaire in Korean, which has been used in our clinical facial palsy center for evaluating sequelae of facial palsy. So we decided that these questionnaires are readable and suitable to our study.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A randomized, assessor-blinded, waitlist controlled trial will be conducted at the Acupuncture and Moxibustion Department of Kyung Hee University's Oriental Medical Hospital in Seoul. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) The study includes a screening period before randomization and a treatment period of 8 weeks (3 sessions per week). After screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects will be randomized to either the acupuncture group or the waitlist group, in accordance with a computer-generated random number list that is hidden until the start of treatment. No-acupuncture waitlist control is used as a control because sham acupuncture cannot be substituted for a physiologically inert placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chronological Flow Chart of the Study Design</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-71-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Eligibility</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>To be included, patients have to be diagnosed with Bell's palsy at least six months prior to screening. Patients must score less than 70 on the physical aspect of the FDI, less than 80 on the social aspect and provide written informed consent. Participants who are 18 to 65 years old will be recruited using local newspaper advertisements and posted notices.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants will be excluded if they suffer from serious medical conditions, such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus requiring insulin injection, past or current malignant tumors, severe dyslipidemia, liver or kidney dysfunction, anemia, active pulmonary tuberculosis or other infectious or systemic diseases that are inappropriate for treatment with acupuncture.</p><p>Eligible participants will be excluded if they have complicated pathophysiologic conditions of secondary facial palsy from infection, multiple neuritis, tumors invading the temporal bone, brain contusion or stroke. Patients with Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] will also be excluded from the study, as well as those with bilateral or recurrent facial palsy. To avoid confounding effects that can influence patients' outcome measures, the oral administration of steroids or antiviral drugs (acyclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir, or ganciclovir), a surgical history for facial palsy, such as facial nerve decompression, reconstruction of the facial nerve or muscle, and history of acupuncture, moxibustion, vesiculation and massage therapy within three months will also result in exclusion from the study. With regard to safety and compliance issues, patients with other neurological illnesses, neuropsychiatric diseases, present or planned pregnancy, current lactation, or scars on the treatment area will also be excluded.</p><p>Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs for common colds, dyspepsia, headaches, etc. will be allowed. However OTC drugs of unknown components or indicated for Bell's palsy related symptoms will not be allowed. All patients will be instructed to disclose all medication use prior to enrollment. Records on the drugs taken by each patient will be obtained at every visit, and patients will be requested to inform us of any change to their medication or supplement regimen. Additional acupuncture treatments, herbal medicines, or medical interventions elsewhere will not be allowed throughout the study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Acupuncture treatment protocol</title><sec><title>Acupuncture intervention</title><p>Acupuncture will be performed by specialists in oriental medicine.
