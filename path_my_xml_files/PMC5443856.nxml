It is estimated that 20&#x000a0;% of the Western world&#x02019;s population is afflicted by various degrees of GERD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Along with lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter remedies, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently the mainstay of medical therapy and are particularly effective in controlling troublesome heartburn. However, recent studies have raised public concern relating to the potential development of osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with the continuous use of PPIs over the course of several years. Furthermore, and despite the unquestionable effectiveness of PPIs in the majority of cases, approximately 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% of patients remain unsatisfied because of incomplete symptom control on optimized PPI regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients and referring gastroenterologists are often reluctant to consider surgery as an option because of the occasional occurrence of debilitating post-fundoplication side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which may account for the steady decline in the number of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplications (LNF) performed in the past two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In this context, the transoral esophagogastric fundoplication (TF) performed with the EsophyX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device (Redmond, Washington) has emerged as a viable endoscopic alternative to conventional medical and surgical treatments of chronic GERD. The TF procedure creates a full-thickness, partial esophagogastric fundoplication above the <italic>Z</italic>-line, with fastener fixations extending longitudinally up to 3.5&#x000a0;cm and circumferentially between 270&#x000b0; and 330&#x000b0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Published randomized controlled multicenter double-blind and open-label studies have demonstrated the superiority of the TF procedure as compared to high-dose PPI therapy and/or sham procedure in eliminating troublesome regurgitation and a range of classic and atypical manifestations of chronic GERD up to 12&#x000a0;months post-TF in subgroups of patients with hiatal hernias &#x02264;2&#x000a0;cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Importantly, in more than 17,000 procedures performed to date, TF has maintained a solid safety record with virtual absence of associated new onset of dysphagia and gas bloat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, due to the lack of long-term follow-up data from the USA, the durability of the therapeutic effects following TF has remained in question.</p><p id="Par7">The 3-year follow-up data from the TIF EsophyX versus Medical PPI Open Label (TEMPO) randomized trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT01647958), which are the subject of this report, offer the opportunity to explore the long-term effects and durability of TF.

Data were collected by the investigators and coordinators at each site and entered into the secure electronic data capture system. As required by good clinical practices and applicable regulations, the sponsor of the trial was involved in source verification of the data (i.e., the comparison of reported trial data with information from primary health records of trial subjects).

</p><p id="Par12">The performance of the standard TF 2.0 procedure was mandated by the study protocol for all study patients who underwent TF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. All TF procedures were performed using the EsophyX device under general endotracheal anesthesia. The device is introduced transorally over a flexible endoscope and inserted into the stomach under constant endoscopic visualization. The endoscope is retroflexed to provide visualization of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). The helical retractor is engaged into the tissue just below the <italic>Z</italic>-line. The fundus of the stomach is then folded up and wrapped around the distal esophagus utilizing the tissue mold, the chassis, and the helix as an anchor. After locking all the tissue-manipulating elements, the invaginator is activated to allow the advancement of the GEJ below the diaphragm. Polypropylene &#x0201c;H&#x0201d; fasteners are then delivered through the thickness of the apposed stomach and esophageal walls. The maneuver is repeated at three additional positions to create a full-thickness, partial gastroesophageal fundoplication, with an average of 21 fasteners deployed at various locations. Intraoperative endoscopy is performed immediately before and after introducing the EsophyX device to assess the GEJ, confirm Hill grade, and assess the size of hiatal hernia, if present.</p><p id="Par13">Patients were followed up for a maximum of 3&#x000a0;years post-TF. Following the last study visit conducted in September 2015, data were monitored for accuracy against source documents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcomes and effectiveness assessment</title><p id="Par14">The primary outcome measure of the TEMPO trial was elimination of daily troublesome regurgitation and atypical symptoms, as defined by the Montreal consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) was used to assess frequency and severity of regurgitation; the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) questionnaire was used to assess atypical GERD symptoms. RDQ is a 12-item questionnaire that was designed to assess the frequency and severity of heartburn (four items measuring the frequency and severity of pain and burning behind the breastbone), regurgitation (four items measuring the frequency and severity of acid taste in the mouth and movement of the material upward from the stomach), and dyspeptic complaints (four items measuring the frequency and severity of pain or burning in the upper stomach) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Response options range from 0 (not present) to 5 (daily) for frequency and 0 (not present) to 5 (severe) for severity. Each patient&#x02019;s score is calculated as the mean of item responses with higher scores indicating more frequent or severe symptoms. Troublesome symptoms are defined as mild symptoms, occurring 2 or more days a week, or moderate to severe symptoms, occurring more than 1&#x000a0;day a week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The elimination of troublesome regurgitation was evaluated with the RDQ. A frequency score of three or more and severity score of two or more for the regurgitation questions were required to meet the Montreal consensus criteria for troublesome regurgitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. RSI is a 9-item validated questionnaire used to measure atypical GERD symptoms such as hoarseness, throat clearing, excess throat mucus, dysphagia, and cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The scale for each individual item ranges from 0 (no problem) to 5 (severe problem), with a maximum total score of 45 and a normality threshold of &#x02264;13.</p><p id="Par15">Primarily, we assessed symptom control after the TF procedure with these questionnaires while patients were off PPIs at 1-, 2-, and 3-year intervals. Secondarily, in order to include data on patients who had resumed PPIs after TF and whose questionnaires were completed only while on PPIs, we also report symptom control regardless of PPI use (off or on PPI therapy).</p><p id="Par16">Secondary outcomes included elimination of heartburn, healing of reflux esophagitis, cessation of PPI use, improvement in distal EAE, and patient satisfaction. Elimination of troublesome heartburn was assessed using the GERD health-related quality of life questionnaire (GERD-HRQL). GERD-HRQL is designed and validated to evaluate typical GERD symptoms by measuring ten items (six related to heartburn, two to dysphagia, one to bloating, and one to the impact of medications on daily life) on the visual analog scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (worst symptoms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A higher total GERD-HRQL score (range from 0 to 50) indicates more severe GERD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We used endoscopy to assess and grade reflux esophagitis, if present. Complete cessation of PPI use was documented. Levels of distal EAE were assessed with 48-h Bravo pH monitoring, using percent total recorded time pH &#x0003c;4 as our main outcome measure, and considering 5.3&#x000a0;% as the threshold for normality. Patient satisfaction with their current health condition was reported as part of the GERD-HRQL, with three possible answers: satisfied, neutral, or dissatisfied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par17">The primary analysis in this report focuses on the stability of elimination of troublesome GERD symptoms up to 3&#x000a0;years following the TF procedure. The comparison within patients was made with the use of the repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test followed by post hoc Tukey&#x02013;Kramer honestly significant difference multiple comparison procedure to identify which means differed from each other. In general, means and standard deviations (SD) are reported; the study follow-up intervals were reported as medians (ranges). Counts and proportions for the categorical data were compared with the use of McNemer&#x02019;s test. The two patients who underwent revisional procedure (TF failure) were included in the analyses and were assigned the worst outcomes observed during the study from the timing of revisional procedure going forward.

The rate of pH normalization off PPIs noted in our study 3&#x000a0;years post-TF (40&#x000a0;%) is comparable to rates of pH normalization reported in patients on double-dose PPI therapy (approximately 50&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These observations raise two important questions for future research. First, how much of pH improvement is necessary to achieve adequate symptom control and acceptable patient satisfaction? Second, does pH normalization have complementary effects on overall control of GERD? Uncontrolled GERD symptoms are a major reason for patients to visit their physicians and to utilize healthcare resources. We believe that the GERD therapies that are safe and able to provide control of GERD symptoms and prevent complications may reduce total medical and societal costs associated with the treatment of symptomatic GERD by reducing the frequency of outpatient visits and improving work productivity.</p><p id="Par30">The published literature suggests that achievement of higher normalization rates of EAE after traditional anti-reflux surgery may be attributed to the creation of a supra-competent valve in such procedures; this may contribute to troublesome and sometimes debilitating dysphagia and bloating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This is not the case in patients who receive the TF procedure, as de novo occurrence of post-procedure dysphagia and bloating is virtually nonexistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">The results of the 6- and 12-month follow-ups of the TEMPO trial comparing TF with high-dose PPIs had established the superiority of TF in controlling regurgitation, heartburn, and atypical symptoms in a subgroup of chronic GERD patients with small (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;cm) or absent hiatal hernias and with incomplete responses to PPIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similar results were reported in two other double-blinded randomized trials, one of which compared TF and placebo pills versus sham procedure and high-dose PPIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and another comparing TF versus sham procedure in a European population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">The cohort of patients considered for our report consisted of the totality of patients enrolled in the TEMPO trial, merging the group originally randomized to TF with the initial high-dose PPI control group (of which all patients elected to undergo crossover TF). Both groups were statistically similar in every respect, allowing for this design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">All TF procedures in this study were completed without perioperative or long-term SAE reported, underscoring the safety of the procedure. There have been more than 17,000 procedures performed worldwide to date, without mortality and with an estimated SAE rate of 3.4&#x000a0;% in the published literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, there were two reoperations (3&#x000a0;%); these patients were considered as failures of TF and included as such in our statistical analysis. Both revisional operations were performed without difficulty, confirming previous reports on the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery after TF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recently, a study discussing another more invasive anti-reflux procedure purported that the rate of reoperation following TF could range from 11.5 to 52.6&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], citing reports from Europe where earlier iterations of the device and technique had been used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in a suboptimally selected patient population which included large hiatal hernias and Hill grade III and IV. In contrast, in the TEMPO trial and other recent randomized controlled TF trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], all patients received a standardized TF 2.0 procedure with a rotational component, as described by Bell and Cadi&#x000e8;re [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Further, TEMPO participants deployed 21 fasteners on average, in accordance with previous reports indicating a direct correlation between the number of fasteners and the durability of favorable outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Lastly, the quality of our results can be attributed to the adherence to strict selection criteria, particularly by excluding patients with hiatal hernias larger than 2&#x000a0;cm in either axial height or greatest transverse dimension, patients with Hill grade III or IV ratings of the GEJ, and patients with more severe erosive esophagitis (Los Angeles grade C or D).</p><p id="Par34">We report in this study complete discontinuation of PPI use in 71&#x000a0;% of patients 3&#x000a0;years after TF, without statistically significant change compared to PPI cessation rates at 1- and 2-year follow-ups in the same group of patients. Testoni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] had reported that the percentage of patients who either stopped or halved their PPI therapy at 3-year follow-up was unchanged at 6&#x000a0;years (84&#x000a0;%), which portends positively for maintaining even longer-term PPI cessation rates in the same range. Interestingly, in the same study, complete discontinuation of PPIs dropped from 61&#x000a0;% of patients at 6&#x000a0;months to 30&#x000a0;% at 6&#x000a0;years, with the sharpest drop observed between 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post-TF, indicating that resumption of PPIs was most common within the first year after the procedure. In our view, this underscores the importance of patient selection and good technique. Furthermore, various factors make PPI use after any anti-reflux procedure an unreliable measure of success or failure, including easy access to over-the-counter medications and patients&#x02019; tendencies to resume PPI use without objective documentation of GERD. In fact, PPIs may be viewed an acceptable adjunct to TF procedures in patients whose GERD symptoms were uncontrolled on high-dose PPIs preoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Limitations of the current study include its open-label, crossover design that may introduce a potential bias. While a comparison at 3&#x000a0;years of the medical (PPI) group and the TF group might have offered valuable additional data, there are several reasons for using a crossover design. Following enrollment, patients in the PPI group were required to take the maximum standard dose of currently used PPI in an attempt to optimize control of their GERD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Patients experiencing ongoing symptoms despite medical therapy are routinely stepped up to maximum dosage in an attempt to control troublesome symptoms. Furthermore, the recommended treatment for patients with predominant extraesophageal symptomatology (our study population) is aggressive acid reduction using PPIs twice daily short term over a duration of 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A 3-year comparison between two groups would have likely made enrollment of patients and perhaps IRB approval very difficult. Furthermore, we elected to utilize a crossover design rather than analyzing two parallel groups to eliminate any potential confounding factors that may influence clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Primarily, the TEMPO study was designed to evaluate efficacy of TF versus high-dose PPI therapy at 6- and 12-month follow-ups and secondarily to assess a durability of TF in all patients who underwent the TF procedure. Therefore, for the long-term outcomes each patient served as his/her own control. While we recognize that 11 patients were lost to follow-up for the 3-year evaluation, we believe that an attrition rate of 17&#x000a0;% is acceptable for any 3-year follow-up study. Additionally, as commonly seen in studies evaluating GERD therapies, not all patients were willing to undergo objective evaluation at the study intervals (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>); however, the consistent results between 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-ups from this study, combined with the evidence from double-blind randomized studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and from the long-term European study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], further support the safety, efficacy, and durability of TF. We conclude that TF offers chronic GERD patients with incomplete symptom control on PPI therapy an effective therapeutic alternative with lasting effect.</p><p id="Par36">A study designed to provide a direct randomized comparison of the traditional anti-reflux surgery and the TF would be very difficult to enroll. Traditional anti-reflux surgery is often reserved for the patients with the most severe GERD, including patients with large hiatal hernias. In such patients, a diaphragmatic crural closure is routinely performed. In contrast, the use of the EsophyX device to perform the endoscopic TF procedure is restricted to a well-selected subset of GERD patients with small (&#x02264;2&#x000a0;cm) or absent hiatal hernia. This is reflected in the selection criteria of the TEMPO trial. Such patients are not typically referred for a surgical fundoplication; these patients receive a dose escalation of PPIs and addition of H2 blockers for breakthrough symptoms. In the case&#x02013;control study of patients undergoing TF, Nissen, or Toupet fundoplication, TF achieved similar dramatic symptom resolution, when compared to Nissen or Toupet fundoplication; a shorter operative times and lengths of stay were observed after TF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The TEMPO trial offered a randomized comparison of the two options for a common clinical scenario which presents significant challenges; it was conducted to find out whether TF is a viable alternative to patients with incomplete symptom control on optimized PPI therapy and who are fearful of the potential side effects of fundoplication. Furthermore, the level of scientific proof of its efficacy and therapeutic gain surpasses anything currently available outside the area of traditional laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Based on currently available evidence, the authors believe that the TF procedure performed with the EsophyX device should not be considered experimental and should be offered to well-selected chronic GERD patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">Our study demonstrated that the transoral esophagogastric fundoplication procedure performed with the EsophyX device provides sustained symptomatic relief, healing of reflux esophagitis, and prolonged improvement in all esophageal pH parameters at 3-year follow-up. Our results further confirm the safety, efficacy, and durability of TF in well-selected symptomatic GERD patients on chronic PPI therapy. We conclude that transoral fundoplication should be considered in the management of GERD patients with similar disease characteristics as presented in this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Presented at the SAGES 2016 Annual Meeting, March 16&#x02013;19, 2016, Boston, Massachusetts.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Elizabeth R.
