Therefore, preventive treatment for delirium may be beneficial. Worldwide, haloperidol is the first choice for pharmacological treatment of delirious patients. In daily clinical practice, a lower dose is sometimes used as prophylaxis. Some studies have shown the beneficial effects of prophylactic haloperidol on delirium incidence as well as on mortality, but evidence for effectiveness in ICU patients is limited. The primary objective of our study is to determine the effect of haloperidol prophylaxis on 28-day survival. Secondary objectives include the incidence of delirium and delirium-related outcome and the side effects of haloperidol prophylaxis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This will be a multicenter three-armed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prophylactic intervention study in critically ill patients. We will include consecutive non-neurological ICU patients, aged &#x02265;18 years with an expected ICU length of stay &#x0003e;1 day. To be able to demonstrate a 15% increase in 28-day survival time with a power of 80% and alpha of 0.05 in both intervention groups, a total of 2,145 patients will be randomized; 715 in each group. The anticipated mortality rate in the placebo group is 12%. The intervention groups will receive prophylactic treatment with intravenous haloperidol 1 mg/q8h or 2 mg/q8h, and patients in the control group will receive placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%), both for a maximum period of 28-days. In patients who develop delirium, study medication will be stopped and patients will subsequently receive open label treatment with a higher (therapeutic) dose of haloperidol. We will use descriptive summary statistics as well as Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, adjusted for covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This will be the first large-scale multicenter randomized controlled prevention study with haloperidol in ICU patients with a high risk of delirium, adequately powered to demonstrate an effect on 28-day survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01785290">NCT01785290</ext-link>.</p><p>EudraCT number: 2012-004012-66.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Critically ill</kwd><kwd>Delirium</kwd><kwd>Haloperidol</kwd><kwd>Intensive care</kwd><kwd>Mortality</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Prophylaxis</kwd><kwd>Randomized trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Delirium is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by an acute onset of confusion, inattention, and a change in level of consciousness that tends to fluctuate during the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The incidence of delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], approximately 30&#x02013;50%. Further, its occurrence is associated with detrimental outcome, including prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, increased ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], unplanned removal of tubes and catheters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and long-term cognitive disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, a strategy that can prevent delirium in high-risk patients may also decrease short-term (i.e., 28-day) mortality.</p><p>The first step in the management of delirium is to treat the underlying disease. If delirium does not subside, haloperidol is the most frequently used pharmacologic treatment of delirium. However, this drug may also be used to prevent delirium. In non-ICU patients, beneficial effects have been reported of prophylactic haloperidol in older and surgical patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For critically ill patients, data concerning prevention with anti-psychotic drugs are scarce and inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In one retrospective cohort study, ICU patients who received haloperidol were found to have a lower mortality rate compared to ICU patients that did not receive haloperidol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Only one prospective, randomized trial in critically ill patients is available, showing that haloperidol prophylaxis in non-cardiac surgical ICU patients had beneficial effects on delirium incidence and the number of delirium free-days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, only a very low dose, for 12 h infusion of haloperidol was administered and many of the patients were in the ICU for less than 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, there are no large, definitive trials that have studied the effect of haloperidol prophylaxis in ICU patients.</p><p>Recently, a model was developed and validated to predict delirium in ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. With this model, the effectiveness of preventive strategies can be compared in different groups that differ in <italic>a priori</italic> risk of delirium. This delirium prediction model was used to identify high-risk ICU patients (i.e., <italic>a priori</italic> risk of delirium &#x0003e;50%). Compared to a historical control group, prophylactic low-dose haloperidol was associated with better delirium related outcomes. In this high-risk group (&#x0003e;50%) of critically ill patients, incidence of delirium was significantly lower in the preventive treatment group (65%), compared to the control group (75%). Furthermore, haloperidol prophylaxis was associated with a hazard rate of 0.8 for 28-day mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, because of the pre-/post-implementation design of this trial, other factors that may have changed between the study periods may have influenced these findings. Nevertheless, the results suggest that prevention of delirium might be beneficial in critically ill patients. Since no relevant side effects associated with the administration of a low dosage of haloperidol were reported in the prophylactic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], it is conceivable that a higher dose of haloperidol may exert more pronounced beneficial effects. Furthermore, the optimal dosage of haloperidol in critically ill patients, as well as the occupancy levels of dopamine-2 receptors and sigma-1 receptors when administering haloperidol, remain unknown. Therefore, in the present study proposal the effects of two dosages of haloperidol versus placebo will be determined.</p><p>Given the fact that the development of delirium can be predicted only 24 h after ICU admission, and the clear relation between time to treatment with haloperidol and the duration of delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], initiation of prophylaxis as early as possible is warranted. Based on our historical data, the median predicted risk of delirium is approximately 35% in patients with an expected stay on the ICU of over one day; this is considered a high risk for delirium development. A clinical estimation of an ICU LOS &#x0003e;1 day is possible within the first few hours after ICU admission. Previous studies that included patients using similar criterion of an expected ICU LOS were found feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, the clinical estimation by the attending ICU-physician of an ICU LOS &#x0003e;1 day will be used as an inclusion criterion for this study, in which the prediction to develop delirium (using the PRE-DELIRIC model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) will be used to facilitate post-hoc analyses to investigate which patients benefit most from prophylactic therapy. By using the PRE-DELIRIC score as an <italic>a priori</italic> determined post-hoc analysis, we will learn if the putative beneficial effect of haloperidol is related to the risk to develop delirium, or comparable in all patients, independent of the baseline risk to develop delirium. In addition, it will facilitate the determination of a cut-off level for the PRE-DELIRIC score.</p><p>Potential side effects of haloperidol include extra pyramidal symptoms, drowsiness, agitation, and ventricular arrhythmias. The latter are extremely rare (only case-reports are published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) and dose dependent. With the haloperidol dosage that will be used in the present study (3x1 mg or 3x2 mg intravenously daily), no relevant side effects are expected, regardless of underlying condition, organ dysfunction, and concomitant medication. Nevertheless, and given the preventive nature of this study, extra attention is being paid to the recognition of possible side effects of haloperidol that could mitigate its potential beneficial effects. Importantly, in three recent prophylactic haloperidol studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] no relevant side effects, and in particular no ventricular arrhythmias, were reported using similar low dosages of haloperidol as described in the present protocol. Regarding the choice of haloperidol dosage, this was based on the previous study in which no relevant side effects were found when using a prophylactic dose of 3x1 mg in delirium high-risk ICU patients, and resulted in a significant decrease of delirium incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, in this high-risk group (mean delirium risk of 75%) the incidence was still 65%, suggesting that a higher dosage of haloperidol might decrease the incidence of delirium to a greater extent. For this reason, and taking into account the non-relevant side effects, we choose to add a third arm using a higher dose of 3x2 mg haloperidol.</p><p>The aim of this study is firstly to determine the effect of two different low dosages of prophylactic haloperidol on 28-day mortality as well as the incidence of delirium and other delirium related outcome measures and quality of life, compared with placebo, in ICU patients with an expected ICU stay of &#x0003e;1 day. Secondly, to relate the potential beneficial effects of haloperidol to the <italic>a priori</italic> risk of developing delirium, using the PRE-DELIRIC model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Lastly, to evaluate possible side effects of prophylactic haloperidol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study protocol is in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines concerning randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>A prospective, multicenter, three-armed, permuted block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prophylactic intervention study will be conducted in critically ill patients with a high risk of delirium development.

This is an independent committee composed of two physicians/researchers (a psychiatrist and an anesthetist) and a statistician. The DSMB will perform all interim analyses. To assess side effects of haloperidol and to determine superiority of the intervention or placebo the DSMB will be unblinded for this study, while all researchers remain blinded. Furthermore, the study will be monitored by an independent researcher who will monitor the trial master file, and perform random checks of informed consent forms, drug accountability lists, and source data of primary and secondary outcome measures.</p><p>Concerning safety issues, during a patient&#x02019;s treatment with the study medication, known side effects of haloperidol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] are pro-actively collected with a special focus on prolonged QTc-time, drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms, and agitation and sedation effects. All side effects will be collected during patients&#x02019; treatment with the study medication until 24 h after stopping the study medication. In case of the occurrence of side effects, physicians can reduce the dosage or stop the study medication, depending on the severity of the occurred side effect and at the discretion of the attending physician. Only for prolonged QTc-time, strict stopping rules are applied, as described below. To detect side effects of haloperidol, the protocol dictates that patients are physically examined every day for known signs of extrapyramidal symptoms (signs of Parkinsonism and/or akathisia and/or dystonia). Furthermore, daily QTc-time is calculated using a 12-lead ECG or a monitor lead ECG. A QTc-time of over 500 msec combined with an increase of over 10% of baseline QTc-time is defined as prolonged QTc-time. In case of QTc-time prolongation, the study drug is temporarily stopped until QTc-time is normalized. After normalization of QTc-time (&#x0003c;500 msec) the study drug will be restarted. If QTc-time becomes prolonged again, the study drug will be stopped definitively. The patient will remain allocated to the original study group.</p><p>To determine long-term side effects, such as rigidity, and quality of life, a recommended and validated quality of life questionnaire, SF-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], is taken at the time of admission and is sent to the patients 1 and 6 months after ICU admission.</p><p>The following adverse events will be collected: serious adverse events; non-serious adverse events that are considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study drug (e.g., prolonged QTc-time, drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms, agitation and sedation effects); adverse events that lead to permanent discontinuation of the study drug administration. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect at any dose that results in one of the following outcomes and is not classified as a clinical outcome of delirium or the underlying disease using the description: death that is not related to the underlying disease or sequel of the underlying disease, or death that is considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug; prolonged inpatient hospitalization or re-hospitalization; a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; considered significant by the investigator for any other reason.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation and statistics</title><p>Sample size calculation is based on the difference in survival from our previous prophylactic haloperidol study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this study, the median survival time in the control group was 18 days. If the true hazard ratio of control patients relative to intervention patients is 0.85, taking into account an accrual time of 90 days with 28 days of follow-up, we will need to study 647 patients per intervention group and 647 control patients to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves are equal with probability (power) 0.80. The Type I error probability associated with this null hypothesis test is 0.05. Taking into account a dropout percentage of 10%, we will include 715 patients per group (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A fixed sequence procedure will be followed. First, the highest dosage of prophylactic haloperidol will be compared with placebo using alpha 0.05 (two-sided). Only if H<sub>0</sub> is rejected, subsequently the lower dosage of prophylactic haloperidol will be compared with placebo. Cox regression analysis will be used to test differences on 28-day survival in the intervention group compared with the placebo group.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flowchart of patient enrollment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-400-1"/></fig><p>A safety, futility, and superiority interim analysis will be performed by the DSMB after 175, 350, 500 (safety and futility) and 1,000 (safety and superiority) patients are included. Differences in serious adverse events between intervention and placebo are used for safety analyses and the primary endpoint 28-day survival is used to determine futility or superiority of intervention or placebo.</p><p>After the inclusion of 1,000 patients, superiority will be tested. A proven superiority (<italic>P &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.003, two-sided)</italic> of any dose of haloperidol over placebo or a proven superiority (<italic>P &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.003, two-sided)</italic> of placebo over haloperidol determined during the interim analysis will result in an alpha of 0.049 (two-sided) for the final analysis. This alpha distribution was calculated by an independent statistician according to the method of Lan-DeMets cumulative alpha spending function of O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming alpha spending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. For the descriptive statistics, continuous variables will be given as mean with standard deviation or median and inter quartile ranges, depending on their distribution. Normally distributed variables will be tested using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test for comparison and Mann-Whitney U-tests for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical (and binary) variables will be presented as numbers and percentages and will be analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier curves will be used as graphical representation. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses will be used to estimate the hazard ratio for survival with the use of haloperidol versus placebo. Furthermore, we will perform adjusted analyses for relevant covariates (including delirium, APACHE-II score, age, sex, sepsis, and other differences between the three study groups irrespective of the possible imbalance between the three groups). For this covariate analysis, univariate logistic regression analysis will be performed first in order to test the strength of the relationship. Subsequently, variables significantly associated with the dependent variable will be included in the covariate analyses.</p><p>Furthermore, subgroup analysis will be performed by direct comparisons of <italic>a priori</italic> specified subgroups, i.e., predicted risk group, admission type group, and APACHE-II group, in order to determine effectiveness of prophylactic haloperidol treatment in these subgroups on 28-day survival.</p><p>All statistical tests are two-sided and statistical significance is defined as a <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.

Since it is recognized that the onset of delirium occurs, on average, on day 2 after ICU admission, early preventive treatment is likely to be more effective. In the short-term, low dose haloperidol has no known relevant side effects, therefore randomization and administration of study medication will be started immediately following identification of a high-risk patient. When an informed consent procedure results in a delay of randomization, a deferred consent procedure may be followed. The informed consent procedure will be started as soon as possible, but always within 24 h following ICU admission. If no deferred informed consent can be obtained within 24 h, the patient will be excluded from the study and study drug administration will be stopped.</p><p>The medical ethical committee of Arnhem-Nijmegen (CMO) approved this study including this deferred consent procedure (CMO-number 2012/424). This trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01785290.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and trial status</title><p>This is the first large-scale multicenter randomized-controlled prevention study with haloperidol in ICU patients with an increased risk to develop delirium. The study design and protocol was finalized in 2012 and the protocol passed the medical ethical committee on February 2013. Prior to the start of the study, all centers will be visited to inform all involved researchers and a second meeting will take place as an initiation visit. Furthermore, a meeting with the DSMB and the monitor will be scheduled prior to the conduction of the study.</p><p>Results of our study will be of importance for critically ill patients and permits us to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of haloperidol prophylaxis in reducing 28-day mortality, preventing delirium, and improving delirium-related outcome. Furthermore, it will provide information regarding the delirium-risk category in which the PRE-DELIRIC model prophylaxis is most effective. Positive effects of haloperidol prophylaxis on delirium outcome will result in the alteration of daily practice for critically ill patients and would therefore have major implications. However, if there is no effect of haloperidol prophylaxis, other possibilities of delirium prevention, such as nursing interventions, need to be studied. In addition, the effectiveness of nursing interventions focusing on delirium prevention can be studied in conjunction with haloperidol prophylaxis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Preparations of the study are nearing completion.
