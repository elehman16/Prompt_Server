The plan was to extend the study to other countries, but as a result of cessation of funding because of slower-than-anticipated recruitment, 182 of 540 patients, from the United Kingdom alone, were recruited.</p><p>Patients presenting with posterior circulation TIA or nondisabling stroke and VA stenosis resulting from presumed atheromatous disease with stenosis &#x02265;50% were included. Other eligibility criteria were ability to consent and willingness to be randomized to either treatment; if randomized to stenting, it could be performed within 2 weeks. During recruitment of the first 100 patients, patients had to have had symptoms within the last 6 months, but this was changed to 3 months in view of data showing that stroke risk was highest in the first 3 months.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were VA stenosis caused by dissection, vertebral stenting felt to be technically impracticable (e.g., access problems), previous stenting in randomized artery, and pregnancy and lactation in women.</p><p>Before randomization, the likely presence of a VA stenosis had to be demonstrated on imaging and confirmed by 2 experienced neuroradiologists. The following imaging modalities were acceptable: magnetic resonance (MR) angiography (preferably contrast enhanced), contrast-enhanced CT angiography, and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA). It was recommended that an additional imaging modality be used if there was any doubt about the result of a noninvasive screening test. The patient would be randomized only if the 2 methods provided concordant and appropriate results. The degree of VA stenosis was calculated by a method based on North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) in which the residual luminal diameter (R) was divided by vessel diameter (D) at a point distal to the stenosis where normal vessel caliber was restored and applying the following formula: ([1 &#x02013; R]/D) &#x000d7; 100 = degree of stenosis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> When normal distal vessel was not available, e.g., for distal stenosis, the proximal normal artery diameter was used as the denominator, a method based on the Warfarin Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) measurement of intracranial stenosis.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.</title><p>The study was approved by Multicentre Ethics Committee in England (REC 08/H0711/2).

To account for the differing recurrent stroke risk associated with site of VA stenosis, randomization was stratified by site of VA stenosis (V1 vs V2/V3 vs V4).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Both patients and clinicians were aware of treatment allocation, but an independent adjudication committee masked to treatment allocation assessed all primary and secondary endpoints.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Procedures.</title><p>All patients were expected to receive BMT, including antiplatelets or anticoagulation (when appropriate) and control of medical risk factors. Use of antiplatelet agents was recorded. Specific drugs to be used were not mandated.</p><p>The recommended antiplatelet therapy during the procedure was clopidogrel and aspirin with loading with clopidogrel at least 12 hours before the procedure (300&#x02013;600 mg) if the patient was not already taking clopidogrel. It was recommended that clopidogrel and aspirin be continued for at least 1 month after the procedure, after which standard antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention was used.</p><p>It was recommended that stenting, rather than angioplasty, be preferred for proximal vertebral stenosis, but for distal stenosis, the choice was at the discretion of the radiologist. Stent choice was at the discretion of the radiologist, but stents were CE marked for treatment of arterial stenosis. To be eligible to participate, a center had to have a consultant neurologist/stroke physician and a consultant interventional radiologist with experience in cerebral angioplasty/stenting. Interventionists were expected to have performed a minimum of 50 stenting procedures, of which at least 10 were on cerebral vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>Follow-up.</title><p>Both entry and follow-up data were collected via an online electronic case report form. Participants allocated to stenting were seen at the time of the procedure and at 1 month and 1 year after randomization. In addition, telephone follow-up was performed at 6 months and 2 years and then yearly by the coordinating center by a designated stroke physician or neurologist using a standard form. If patients had outcome events during follow-up, an endpoint form was completed, results of imaging were obtained, and data were reviewed by the adjudication committee. Repeat imaging with either MR angiography or CT angiography at 1 year to check for vessel patency was encouraged but not mandated.</p><p>Angiographic imaging at baseline and at 12 months was assessed by central reading by an experienced neuroradiologist (A.C.). Restenosis was defined as any residual or recurrent stenosis of at least 50% or occlusion of the VA on CT or MR angiography during follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s1-6"><title>Outcomes.</title><p>The primary endpoint was fatal or nonfatal stroke in any arterial territory (including periprocedural stroke) during follow-up. Stroke was defined as a focal neurologic deficit of presumed vascular cause, lasting &#x0003e;24 hours, of any severity. Secondary endpoints included stroke and TIA during follow-up, posterior circulation stroke (including periprocedural stroke) during follow-up, fatal or nonfatal stroke in any arterial territory within 90 days of randomization, and death resulting from any cause during follow-up. Periprocedural stroke was defined as stroke within 30 days of intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s1-7"><title>Sample size.</title><p>For sample size estimates, the following numbers were used: stroke risk in the medically treated arm of 24% over a 3-year period, and a risk reduction in the stented arm of 45%. The number of patients needed was estimated to be 245 per group, assuming <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 and 80% power. Calculations were performed with a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test comparing 2 proportions with nQuery Advisor software version 6.02. Sample size was increased by 10% to account for crossovers or loss to follow-up to give a sample size of 540. Because of slow recruitment, support for continued recruitment by the funder was withdrawn after 182 patients were recruited; at that point, an analysis was planned after every patient had &#x02265;1 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s1-8"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>The main analyses performed were on an intention-to-treat basis. We also conducted per-protocol analyses including patients who received the assigned treatment and had at least 50% VA stenosis confirmed at angiogram. Differences in baseline characteristics between treatment groups were compared by use of the <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables.</p><p>Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression models. Each patient accrued follow-up time from the date of randomization until the time of first event of each type, death, or March 1, 2016, by which follow-up of at least 1 year was available for all patients. Absolute event rates were calculated by dividing the number of events by the number of person-years. The proportional hazards assumption was tested with scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to construct time-to-event curves, and the log-rank test was used to compare the cumulative events between groups.</p></sec><sec id="s1-9"><title>Meta-analysis.</title><p>A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to combine the results from VIST and previous trials.

Stenting, particularly for extracranial stenosis, appeared safe. No significant difference was found in risk of stroke between the 2 treatment arms. Over a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the stented group had a nonsignificant 60% lower risk for the primary endpoint of fatal and nonfatal stroke compared with the BMT group. A similar magnitude of risk reduction was seen for posterior circulation stroke alone and for the combined endpoint of stroke and TIA.</p><p>Natural history data have shown that the risk of recurrent stroke after TIA or minor stroke due to vertebral stenosis is much greater in the first days and few weeks after the event.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This is a pattern similar to that seen in symptomatic carotid stenosis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Therefore, any intervention is likely to have greater benefit if administered early. Consistent with this, an analysis of patients randomized within 2 weeks of last symptoms showed a significant treatment benefit.</p><p>Four previous RCTs have compared stenting and/or angioplasty with medical therapy in patients with VA stenosis. The Carotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Study (CAVATAS) randomized 16 patients with extracranial VA stenosis to angioplasty or medical therapy; no stroke endpoints occurred in either group.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> SAMMPRIS randomized patients with a variety of intracranial stenoses to stenting or BMT.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Only 60 (13%) patients had intracranial VA stenosis, and among them, the 2-year primary event rate was 9.5% in the medical group and 21.1% in the stenting group.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The Vitesse Intracranial Stent Study for Ischemic Therapy (VISSIT) randomized 112 patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis in a variety of intracerebral arteries to stenting or BMT and reported a risk similar to that in SAMMPRIS, but the number with VA stenosis was not documented.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> VAST randomized 115 patients (83% with extracranial stenosis) and showed a nonsignificantly higher risk of early outcomes at 30 days in the stented group but similar risk of any stroke in both groups after a median follow-up of 3 years.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A meta-analysis of SAMMPRIS, VAST, and VIST showed no advantage for stenting/angioplasty vs BMT alone in extracranial and intracranial VA stenosis combined or in extracranial or intracranial VA stenosis (figure e-1).</p><p>Previous observational studies have shown that the risk of stenting is low with extracranial VA stenosis, on the order of 1%, compared with 7% to 10% for intracranial stenosis.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, natural history data have shown that the risk of early recurrent stroke is higher for intracranial stenosis.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> For this reason, it is possible that the treatment benefits vary in the 2 locations. Therefore, randomization was stratified according to location of stenosis. Because the majority of patients in VIST had extracranial stenosis, drawing firm conclusions on benefit in intracranial stenosis is difficult, although the risk of periprocedural stroke appeared higher for intracranial stenosis and the results are in line with those from SAMMPRIS showing higher risk in stented than in medically treated patients.</p><p>Strengths of VIST include the randomized design, that it is the largest study of stenting for VA stenosis, and that no patients were lost to follow-up. A criticism is that recruitment was stopped because of funding issues before the planned number of patients had been recruited. A further consideration is the intensity of medical treatment in the 2 arms. There was no difference in the use of statins or antihypertensive agents between the 2 arms. There was a slightly increased use of antiplatelet agents at the first-month follow-up in the stented arm, but it was small, reflecting the advice given that both groups should be given intensive medical therapy. An additional consideration is the high proportion of patients in the stenting arm who were found not to have stenosis &#x0003e;50% on DSA at the time of stenting. As a result of the small size of the vertebral arteries, noninvasive imaging with CT or MR angiography is more challenging.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, previous studies comparing these 2 noninvasive modalities with intra-arterial DSA have shown high sensitivity and specificity.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Central review of entry imaging failed to confirm stenosis in approximately half of the cases in which stenosis was not confirmed, while in others, entry imaging was adjudged to be of insufficient quality to confirm stenosis. This suggests that misdiagnosis was in some cases due to radiologic interpretation, and the misdiagnosis rate appeared higher in certain centers. This finding emphasizes the need for very careful ongoing quality control with rapid review of imaging throughout the trial. A further consideration is the experience of neurointerventionists who had to perform only 10 previous procedures to enter the study.</p><p>Recruitment into the trial was slower than expected, and rates varied widely between centers. This partly reflects the fact that in the United Kingdom not all patients with posterior circulation stroke receive CT or MR angiography. This would be likely to change if further data show that stenting is associated with improved outcome. The intention was to extend the trial to overseas centers, but this was delayed because of regulatory and contract issues and sites were not opened before the funder withdrew funding.</p><p>Stenting of extracranial symptomatic vertebral stenosis was performed in this multicenter study with a low periprocedural risk and appears safe compared with BMT alone. There was a nonsignificant reduction in recurrent stroke risk in the stented compared with the BMT arm. As a result of early termination of recruitment, the projected sample size was not reached, and larger trials are now required to confirm this finding.</p></sec>
