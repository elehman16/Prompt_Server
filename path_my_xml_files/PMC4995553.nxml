These trials ask individuals to bear special burdens for societal benefit. Thus, specific ethical attention to how that information is conveyed to potential individuals seems particularly important. Thus, for example, a recent draft guidance on informed consent by the US Food and Drug Administration states that disclosures &#x02018;must include a description of the current medically recognised standard of care &#x02026; [and when possible] quantified comparative estimates of risks and benefits (e.g., from the clinical literature)&#x02019; (Section 4, page 9&#x02013;10).<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> For placebo control trials testing novel antidepressants, a decision analysis model has shown that a person with moderate depression can expect to have almost 25% greater chance of symptomatic benefit by choosing individualised psychiatric treatment over entering a placebo control trial (64.3% <italic>v</italic>. 39.5%). In this study, we conducted a randomised experimental survey to examine the potential impact of providing quantitative outcome information to potential participants in placebo control trials testing a novel antidepressant. We tested whether providing this quantitative trade-off information would affect prospective participants&#x02019; willingness to enrol in depression RCTs and examined the reasons for their preferences.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants were recruited from the University of Michigan Depression Center. Upon check-in at the clinic, they received an introduction letter briefly explaining the study. Interested patients then picked up a survey in the waiting room. They either filled out the survey while waiting or returned it by mail in an unmarked envelope. Surveys were anonymous. The University of Michigan IRB approved the study with waiver of documentation of consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Measures</title><p>The main outcome measure was the choice between entering an 8-week RCT testing a new antidepressant for moderate depression, or pursuing treatment with a psychiatrist. This was measured on a 1&#x02013;6 scale (1=&#x02018;I would definitely choose the research study&#x02019; and 6=&#x02018;I would definitely choose treatment with a psychiatrist&#x02019;). Participants were then given the following prompt: &#x02018;Please comment on why you chose that answer&#x02019;. The survey text is in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix</xref>.</p><p>To standardise the stimulus, all participants were asked to imagine having moderate depression using the description in the Montgomery&#x02013;Asberg Depression Rating Scale.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> They were then randomised to either the <italic>standard</italic> or <italic>enhanced</italic> disclosure regarding the use of placebos. The standard disclosure mentioned the probability of receiving the placebo and presented an alternative to participating in the study as &#x02018;<italic>Instead of entering the research study</italic>, you can choose to receive regular treatment from a psychiatrist&#x02019;. The enhanced disclosure included in addition a quantitative comparison of the participant&#x02019;s probability of experiencing improvement in depression symptoms, depending on whether the person entered the RCT or chose individual treatment. Based on a previous decision analysis model, the probabilities were presented as 40% for participating in the RCT <italic>v</italic>. 65% for individualised treatment; the details of the model can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Participants completed the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> They also rated their level of happiness on a scale of 1&#x02013;10 (10 = &#x02018;extremely happy [feeling ecstatic, joyous, fantastic]&#x02019; and 0 = &#x02018;Extremely unhappy [utterly depressed, completely down]&#x02019;). We collected demographic data including age, gender, race, ethnicity, highest education attainment and annual household income.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analysis</title><p>A Mann&#x02013;Whitney rank sum test was used to compare the willingness to enrol scores in the standard disclosure and the enhanced disclosure arms. Because the decision between RCT and individual treatment is dichotomous, our primary analysis also dichotomised the responses, with responses 1&#x02013;3 being assigned as preferring the RCT and responses 4&#x02013;6 being assigned as preferring individual psychiatric treatment. We then used <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests to compare the disclosure arms. All tests performed were two-sided. For a 1:1 randomised experimental design with <italic>n</italic> = 140 in each arm, with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of 0.05, the power to detect an effect of 15% difference in the lower range (25% <italic>v</italic>. 40% willing to participate) is 0.77.</p><p>We performed a content analysis of comments that participants provided when asked to explain their answer to the willingness to enrol in RCT question. The coding process was iterative. Two research assistants reviewed the comments independently, developed the codes with the senior author, then coded them and resolved any discrepancies in discussion.</p><p>For each disclosure arm, we performed an exploratory logistic regression to examine the effects of age, gender, race, annual income, education and average BDI score (1&#x02013;10 happiness scale was not included owing to high correlation with BDI score).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 278 patients participated: 129 received the standard disclosure and 149 received the enhanced version. Demographic and clinical characteristics between the two arms were similar, indicating successful randomisation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).

Such trials continue to be the standard for testing the safety and efficacy of antidepressants.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, even if they are necessary to advance medical knowledge, how should researchers communicate to the potential participants the burden they are asked to bear? Specifically, what is the potential impact of providing a quantitative estimate of this trade-off to potential participants?</p><p>Our primary finding is that enhanced disclosure consisting of evidence-based, quantitative outcome data has a significant impact on willingness to participate in RCT. Participants in the enhanced disclosure arm were significantly less likely (0.58 times as likely) than those in the standard disclosure arm to prefer the RCT over individual treatment. Further, our qualitative analysis of the respondents&#x02019; rationales for their choices shows that this difference is likely because of the fact that participants in the enhanced arm made logical use of the information and their choices are more aligned with their preferences than those in the standard disclosure arm. This conclusion is supported by the following.</p><p>The overall proportions of comments reflecting altruism and direct benefits to self are similar in both arms; that is, there was no <italic>overall</italic> difference between the two arms in terms of proportion of altruistic <italic>v</italic>. direct benefit-related comments. However, when the respondents&#x02019; comments reflecting their reasons for choosing the RCT option are examined, the distribution of those reasons diverges between the two disclosure arms. Those in the standard arm expressed direct personal benefit reasons much more than altruism reasons (44.8% <italic>v</italic>. 19.4%); this pattern is reversed in the enhanced disclosure arm (22.2% direct benefit <italic>v</italic>. 35.6% altruism comments). Since the enhanced disclosure makes clear that enrolling in an RCT is disadvantageous for participants, we conclude that the enhanced disclosure arm shows greater congruence between choice of RCT and the reasons for that choice. This is further supported by the fact that in the enhanced arm, 22.2% of the comments among those choosing the RCT mentioned direct benefit, whereas 56.9% of comments among those choosing individualised psychiatric treatment mentioned direct benefit. In contrast, in the standard disclosure arm, comments among those choosing the RCT and those choosing individualised treatment mentioned direct benefit at a closer level of frequency (44.8% and 53.8%), suggesting that motivation for direct benefit does not distinguish those preferring the RCT from those preferring individual treatment among those in the standard arm. Thus, although enhanced disclosures may result in fewer persons volunteering in RCTs with placebo controls when effective treatments exist, such enhanced disclosures allow potential participants to make decisions more in line with their values regarding altruism and benefits to self.</p><p>Before discussing the potential implications of these results, we note several limitations. First, although the decision analysis model on which the trade-off information was based was conducted using standard methods and an extensive evidence base, all models are limited by their assumptions. We refer readers to the model for details.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Second, the hypothetical nature of the study may limit extrapolation to actual decision-making by potential participants. Third, the impact of the enhanced disclosure may be smaller in reality because by highlighting the trade-off information, we drew attention to it. On the other hand, research ethics boards might reasonably require researchers to highlight this trade-off because at the heart of risk&#x02013;benefit analyses for these trials is the issue of forgoing treatment. In that case, our study may accurately reflect the potential impact of implementing an enhanced disclosure. Another limitation is that our content analysis, like all qualitative analyses, depends on judgments of interpretation; other teams of researchers might have developed different coding schemes. Also, we did not subject the categorisations of comments to formal statistical testing given the low numbers for some codes and their post-hoc nature. Furthermore, our participants were already connected to a clinic for their depression treatment; we cannot infer from the results the potential behaviours of persons who are not connected to a mental health professional with little access to care outside of the RCT at the time they are offered to participate in one.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our study has the strength of a randomised experimental design ensuring high internal validity, evidence-based and rigorously derived quantitative outcome estimates for the enhanced disclosure information, and respondents from a typical population from which participants are drawn for depression RCTs, as reflected in their having moderate depression symptoms with demographic profiles within the range of those in published antidepressant RCTs.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Do our results support the practice of providing &#x02018;quantitative comparative estimates&#x02019;<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> of benefits to research participants when they are invited to take part in a placebo control RCT when effective treatments exist? What are the potential objections or obstacles to such a policy? First, it may not always be possible to provide a quantitative estimate of comparative outcomes. However, when a review of the clinical literature would yield such data, it should not be difficult to arrive at a reasonable range of estimates that would be useful for the potential participants. If that is the case, our evidence supports disclosure of that information. However, even if a quantitative estimate is not available, at least the lack of clinical equipoise (between entering RCT and receiving individual treatment) should be disclosed to the subject. They should be told that they are more likely to experience relief in symptoms if they seek individualised treatment, rather than simply be given a neutral description that other alternatives and treatments are available.</p><p>Second, our results show that if enhanced disclosures were required, recruitment would be more difficult but still feasible. This would raise the cost and effort of conducting placebo control clinical trials when effective treatments exist. The ethical gain (increased transparency with better decision-making by participants) would thus have a cost but one cannot expect ethics to be always without costs. In addition to the ethical gains, the more realistic expectations regarding potential benefits among participants could have important scientific benefits. Specifically, attrition bias is a perennial concern because average dropout rates in pivotal trials of new antidepressants is 37%.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> It is plausible that better informed participants with more realistic expectations might be more compliant, with fewer dropouts, thus improving the quality of such studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the debate over the ethical permissibility of withholding effective treatments in placebo control trials must also address the important ethical issue of how to inform participants in such trials of the special burden they will bear. Although there are important challenges to disclosing quantified comparative outcomes information to potential participants, our results provide evidence that such information, when available, will likely make a significant and ethically important difference in potential participants&#x02019; decision-making.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The views expressed are the authors&#x02019; and do not represent the views or policies of the NIH, DHHS, or the US government.</p></ack><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>Supported by the senior author&#x02019;s (S.K.) research fund, the University of Michigan.</p></sec><app-group><app id="app1"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="sa1"><title>Survey text</title><p>Please read the following description and circle a number on the scale below that best fits which option you would choose, then briefly describe why you would make that choice.
