However, information about their quality and efficacy is limited. In an attempt to evaluate the quality of the smoking cessation apps in one app store, a study found that most of the 42 apps identified were of low quality and that none scored more than 30 out of 60 points on a smoking cessation guidelines adherence index.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In addition, the study found that the most popular smoking cessation apps were less likely to score higher on the adherence index.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Finally, none of the identified apps followed the guidelines to ask users for their tobacco use status, assess their willingness to quit, arrange for a follow-up and/or recommend the use of approved quitting assistance medications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In another study in 2012, 107 prosmoking apps were identified in the Apple app store and Google Play store. These apps show explicit images of cigarette brands and teach users how to smoke in a simulation, and some claim that they can help in quitting smoking.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These prosmoking apps have gained popularity in 49 countries, some with strict tobacco control regulations, such as a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertisements (eg, Australia), and others with fewer tobacco control regulations (eg, Indonesia).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Use of health-related smartphone apps as a tool for behaviour change and research</title><p>In a recent study, we investigated the feasibility and the characteristics of those using a smartphone smoking cessation app released in the two most popular app stores (Apple App Store and Google Play), along with the app uptake over 1&#x02005;year in Australia, the UK and the USA.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We found that 77.2% (465/602) of the respondents were ready to quit in the next 30&#x02005;days, and the majority of these had never sought professional help (eg, Quitline).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> More than half had downloaded smoking cessation apps in the past and, of that group, three-quarters had made quitting attempts (lasted at least 24&#x02005;h) by using an app. We also found no significant differences among countries in terms of age, operating system, number of quitting attempts and language spoken at home.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These similarities suggest that a smoking cessation app could be effective across several countries.</p><p>Our study also confirmed the feasibility of collecting research data and recruiting participants directly from app stores. The study generated an unprompted response rate of 36.7% to our in-app questionnaire, and response rates were as high as 44.9% in Australia.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The study suggested that adding a reminder function telling the users to complete the questionnaire or any required data collection may improve the response rate.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore, smartphone apps have shown promising results in lifestyle-changing studies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

This recruitment method's feasibility was successfully tested in our previous study.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> After downloading the app, users will be asked to complete the eligibility questionnaire. If they are eligible, they can proceed to complete the remaining steps; if they are not eligible, a &#x02018;thank you&#x02019; message will be displayed, and they cannot resubmit the eligibility questionnaire even if they reinstall the app.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The participants will be included in this study if they are daily smokers of cigarettes, 18&#x02005;years old or over and from the included countries. Occasional smokers and users of other tobacco products will be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s5e"><title>Recruitment and data collection</title><p>The app download page summarises consent information before downloading, and is also included in the terms of use agreement. The consent form and participant information sheet are included inside the app's &#x02018;About&#x02019; section, so users can return to them easily at anytime. The app will include the eligibility test, baseline questionnaire, the intervention app and the control subapps.</p><p>Once the user opens the app for the first time, the app will assign the user a unique device identifier (UDI) and register the device in our secure online database. The UDI will not change if the user deletes the app or resets the device. This allows anonymous data collection, prevents duplicate enrolments and prevents contamination between groups. For example, if the user deletes the app after being randomised to one of the two groups and reinstalls the app again, the app will download the same previous data from the database to the device and the user will continue using the app in the same previous group.</p><p>As this study is fully automated, not being able to ensure that some users may download the app from another device is an unavoidable limitation. However, to monitor users who download the app onto two devices, we have implemented a server-side internet protocol that can identify the users who use different devices connected to the same internet network at similar times. This may not completely eliminate the possibility of contamination but will reduce it. To increase the response rate to the baseline questionnaire, we have implemented a reminder function that will send a notification to the user to complete the baseline questionnaire.</p><p>Although the Apple App Store limits the app downloads to specific countries, our previous study found that some users from other countries were able to download the app. We have therefore implemented a location identification function to identify the user's country the first time the user opens the app. This will be compared against the user's answer. If the user's location does not match the country answer, the user will not be included in the study. The Apple App Store will also allow for restricting the user's age for the app download, and when any user attempts to download the app, a warning message telling the user about the age restriction will be displayed and the user must agree to it before downloading the app. In addition, users will be asked about their age in the eligibility questionnaire. If the self-reported age is under the eligible age for this study, then the user will not be randomised. User answers will be sent automatically to the study's database. Participants can submit the answer to any question only once and, even if they delete and reinstall the app, their answers to previous questions are kept.</p></sec><sec id="s5f"><title>The intervention</title><p>The intervention app consists of four main features. There is both mandatory information about the pros and cons of available quitting methods and optional information about quitting benefits. Participants cannot move to the next step before confirming if they have read the provided information, and they will be asked if they have read all, some or none of the information. Second, the app will send compulsory notifications at different stages of the quitting process, for example, at the selected quitting date and daily motivational messages, using push-notification technology.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Push-notification allows the database to send messages to a specific user (similar to mobile short message service) at specified times, or after a specific task, free of cost. Third, the app includes a quit book to motivate participants to write quitting diaries (eg, craving triggers). Finally, the app includes a quitting benefits tracker that will notify the user about the health benefits gained after quitting (eg, carbon monoxide elimination after 48&#x02005;h of quitting). Participants will also see a visual tracker for this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005371F1">figure 1</xref> B, C). The app will monitor the daily usage data, including the number of times the participant opened the app, and records the number of times the participants looked at or used any function. The app will be available for the participants in the intervention group for 6&#x02005;months. After this period, the app will automatically stop the data collection and participants can then use it for as long as they want.</p></sec><sec id="s5g"><title>The control</title><p>In the control subapp, only static smoking quitting options and quitting benefits similar to those in the intervention app will be provided. The app will be available for participants in the control group for 6&#x02005;months. After this period, the app will automatically stop the data collection and then participants can use it for as long as they want. In addition, after the end of data collection period, participants in the control group will have access to the intervention app. The app will monitor the daily usage data, including the number of times the participant opened the app, and records the number of times the participants looked at or used any function. The control and the intervention subapps will have an &#x02018;About&#x02019; section that contains the participant's information statement and consent.</p></sec><sec id="s5h"><title>Primary outcomes</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Abstinence rate at 1&#x02005;month.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s5i"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Making quitting attempts (of at least 24&#x02005;h);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Abstinence rate at 10&#x02005;days, 1&#x02005;month, 3&#x02005;months and 6&#x02005;months;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Making an informed choice on our multidimensional measure of Informed Choice for smoking at the 10-day, follow-up point;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decisional conflict.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s5j"><title>Measures</title><p>In the baseline questionnaire, sociodemographic variables will be recorded: age, sex, educational level, marital status and income level.

The follow-up data will be collected by pushing a notification to the participants that will be received even if the app is not running. Participants can also click on a follow-up button inside the app to initiate the follow-up process if the follow-up time has come.</p><p>The participants in both groups will be advised to complete their reading of the app within the first 3&#x02005;days and to set a quit date in the next 7&#x02005;days.

We will also record the quit date and the date of the end of the follow-up, 6&#x02005;months after either the quit date or the date lost to follow-up. We will then calculate the length of the follow-up period. We will calculate the time to relapse: time interval between start date of smoking cessation and relapse or end of follow-up. Tobacco abstinence will be self-reported (not even a single puff of smoking since the quit date).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

Therefore, we recommend that future studies report on the rationale of the achieved sample size.</p><p>In addition to comparing the intervention's effects on quitting decision and period of quitting, this project provides a new method of conducting a cross-country automated RCT with no human intervention by utilising smartphone capabilities. The use of an automated method decreases the cost and staff burden if implemented appropriately. The study's limitation is that participants who use two devices, or who know each other, might know about the other subapp and, although measures have been placed to minimise this, we cannot eliminate this possibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e155" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005371.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e156" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005371.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors made substantial contributions to editing and revising of the manuscript.
