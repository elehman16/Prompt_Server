Amongst HCWs, nurses are at highest risk, with an estimated point prevalence of HD ranging between 12 and 30%. The burden of disease is high with chronicity, sick leave, risk of unemployment and impaired quality of life. Despite evidence from the medical literature on the risk factors and the importance of skin care in the prevention of HD, in practice, compliance to skin care protocols are below 30%.

Wet work, defined as unprotected exposure to humid environments/water; high frequency of hand-washing procedures or prolonged glove occlusion, is believed to cause irritant contact dermatitis in a variety of occupations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite there being no clear scientific definition for wet work in terms of exposure frequency, duration or intensity; most study groups refer to regulatory guidelines. For example, the German guidelines, in which wet work is defined as having wet hands for more than 2&#x000a0;h per regular work day (per shift), hand-cleansing more than 20 times per day or the wearing of occlusive gloves for 2&#x000a0;h per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Amongst HCWs, nurses are particularly at high risk of HD, with an estimated point prevalence of 12&#x02013;30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Almost 60% of HCWs are reported to have eczema-related sick leave during the first year after notification of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This makes the burden of disease high for affected individuals as well as in the socioeconomic context. The total annual costs for occupational skin diseases for medical care, absenteeism and disability pensions are estimated to be &#x020ac;98 million in The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Recently, infection prevention policy in The Netherlands has become stricter, with emphasis on the frequent use of hand alcohol and hand washing with soap to prevent transmission of infections. This has led to an increase in exposure to irritants and a higher risk of skin barrier damage.</p><p>In The Netherlands, the Dutch Society of Occupational Medicine (NvAB) established guidelines for the prevention of occupational hand dermatitis (OHD) in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The guideline stresses the importance of the maintenance of an uncompromised skin barrier for the prevention of HD and recommends regular use of skin care products such as emollients and ointments. A more recent update of contact dermatitis guidelines from The Netherlands Society of Dermatology and Venereology (NVDV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] consistently recommended the use of emollients to help prevent irritant contact dermatitis, referring to three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The findings from one RCT showed that the use of creams decreased occupational hand dermatitis, compared to the control without any intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In another RCT, healthy volunteers washed their hands 15 times a day, after which they used cream. Compared with the control group, skin hydration was significantly higher in the group which used creams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In an experimental study by Kampf et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], a test group comprising 25 subjects applied hand creams after every hand wash. The result was that the use of hydrating creams decreases the symptoms of HD including skin hydration and skin roughness. Several skin care programs have been effectively introduced in the health care setting to help prevent occupational diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The effectiveness of these programs seemed to depend on three factors: (1) the effectiveness of protective measures (i.e. skin care products), (2) the adherence to these measures (i.e. frequency of application) and (3) the effectiveness of education on preventive behavior (by raising awareness about the risk factors for HE and the importance of protective measures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moisturizers belong to the most widely used preparations to decrease dryness and improve skin barrier function. The effects of moisturizers on the skin barrier has mainly been investigated in several experimental irritation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A number of different mechanisms behind the barrier-improving effects of various creams have been suggested, but still their mechanisms are not fully understood.</p><p>With respect to the effectiveness of education, several intervention studies have shown moderate evidence that education influences behavior, which leads to a reduction in skin symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Regarding the second factor, despite evidence from interventions that consider appropriate skin care effective, the adherence to these preventive measures in the workplace remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Recently, an electronic monitoring system has been developed for the continuous registration of hand cream consumption and data recording. This system enables a detailed feedback to HCWs on the frequency with which the hand cream is used as well as when it is used. In hand hygiene studies, a similar monitoring system was earlier proven to improve compliance by 42% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Monitoring and feedback are widely used as a strategy to improve professional performance and patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The effects are generally moderate and vary based on the way that the intervention is designed and delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Feedback is suggested to be more effective to improve performance when: (1) baseline performance is low, (2) when the source is a supervisor, (3) when it is provided more than once and (4) when it is provided both verbally and in written form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Group monitoring is widely recognized as being more effective than other monitoring systems that track individuals&#x02019; actions which can be seen by staff as punitive or an invasion of their privacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Providing group data to units has been shown to encourage group collaboration in a positive manner as staff work together to improve compliance, resulting in better and more sustained results.</p><p>In the present study, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of such a feedback-monitoring system combined with raising awareness in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The intervention will comprise of the placing of hand cream dispensers on the wards, electronic monitoring of their use, and repeated feedback to the HCWs on the wards. The efficacy will be assessed by measuring skin conditions in HCWs before and after the intervention, compared with a control group.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>We will investigate whether an intervention program, based on the provision of hand creams and regular feedback on cream consumption, can improve the skin condition in nurses engaged in wet work, when compared to &#x02018;care as usual&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>A two-arm, single-blinded, cluster RCT, based on hospital wards as the unit of randomization. The aim is to recruit wards and then randomly allocate them to an intervention or a control group after stratification on exposure to wet work. The follow-up is 18&#x000a0;months. The primary means of data collection will consist of two assessments (one clinical and the other biochemical), questionnaires and electronic consumption records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial setting</title><p>The trial will take place at a large medical academic center in The Netherlands, the VUmc (Free University Medical Center), with a total of 45 departments of which approximately 20 are clinical wards.</p><p>The investigators are responsible for the protocol, the conducting of the trial, analysis of the data and all other aspects involved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment of participants</title><p>The trial includes nurses engaged in wet work activities (e.g. hand washing, use of hand disinfectants, wearing gloves) on clinical wards of the VUmc. The identification of the &#x02018;high-risk wards&#x02019; will be based on the consumption of soap and disinfectants per ward (normalized for number of HCW/ward). Wards where nurses have an increased risk of HD due to the nature of their work are defined as &#x02018;high risk&#x02019;. For recruitment, the manager responsible for a ward will receive a letter from the investigators stating the purpose of the study, a short version of the study protocol, and a brief description of the expected burden for the participant during the intervention. On the wards which are willing to participate, the researcher will give a short presentation on HD in HCWs and the preventive measures as described in the Dutch guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. During the presentation, the researcher will also inform the participants about the study and provide leaflets with study outlines. Furthermore, the HCW will be given an application form with contact details in which they can express their interest to participate in the study. The investigator will distribute the patient information letter on the wards and invite the interested participants for a visit.

</p><p>At baseline and 12&#x000a0;months after baseline, the participants in both groups will undergo clinical measurements (Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) scoring), SC samples will be collected for Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF) analysis and the participants will fill in the questionnaire.</p><p>Participants in the control group (just as in the intervention group) with severe eczema requiring medical treatment will be advised to consult the occupational physician or dermatologist.</p><p>Additional procedure in the intervention group:</p><p>After randomization into the intervention group, the hand cream (Stokoderma&#x000ae; Aqua Sensitive) will be provided in electronic dispensers (with monitoring system) on the wards at places which are easily accessible. At least five dispensers per ward will be located at sinks, at the entrance and exit of each ward and other relevant places such as in coffee rooms and toilets. The provided hand cream is commercially available and is widely used in the health care sector.</p><p>Each dispenser records continuously each application event, providing information on the timing and frequency of use of hand creams during the working shift. The system provides robust and easy to interpret web-based reports on cream use per dispenser. Data on use pattern (frequency, total consumption, moments of use) and trends will enable a structured feedback on hand cream use to the nurses and management to motivate and improve compliance. Feedback sessions on hand cream use will be done every 6&#x000a0;months after baseline during regular meetings of the nursing staff and performed by the head nurse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The change in disease severity as assessed by the Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) score.</p><p>This validated scoring system, the HECSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], grades the intensity of erythema, induration, papules, vesicles, fissures, scaling and oedema for five areas of each hand (fingertips, fingers, palms, back of hands, wrists) on a scale from 0 (not present) to 3 (severe). The extent of affected skin in each area is graded from 0 to 4. The total index score with a range from 0 to 360 is then found by multiplying the intensity with the extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The HECSI will be assessed at baseline and after 12&#x000a0;months in both the intervention and the control group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The change in levels of NMF in the skin as a marker of early signs of barrier damage.</p><p>NMFs are mainly composed of the breakdown products of epidermal protein filaggrin. NMFs play an important role for the skin barrier function as they contribute to skin hydration, the maintenance of the acidic pH of the skin, and the epidermal inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that various skin irritants significantly reduce the levels of NMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One study showed that during cleansing (and more than 10-min water contact) large quantities of NMF can leach from the skin surface, leading to dry skin and, by repetitive exposures to skin barrier damage, to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, the NMF levels might reflect early damage of the skin barrier.</p><p>The NMF levels will be determined in the uppermost layers of the skin, the stratum corneum (SC). The SC samples will be harvested by using adhesive tape strips, a method which is extensively used in experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Briefly, round adhesive tape discs (3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>, D-Squame; CuDerm, Dallas, TX, USA) will be attached to the skin of the right hand. Each tape is pressed onto the volar aspect of the hand for 10&#x000a0;s with standardized force, using a disc pressure applicator (CuDerm, Dallas, TX, USA). The first four successive strips from the same skin site will be discarded and for the NMF analysis the fifth to seventh tape strips will be collected. The tape strips are gently removed with tweezers and stored in a closed vial at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analysis. For the analysis of NMF in tape strips, NMF constituents will be extracted from the tape strips using 40% ammonia and subsequently analysed by HPLC-UV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To compensate for variable amount of SC harvested by a tape, the protein amount will be determined on each tape by measuring optical density (SquameScan, CuDerm, Dallas, TX, USA). NMF concentration on the tape will be normalized by the protein amount.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Process outcomes</title><p>Individual consumption of hand creams (application frequency/per shift) will be assessed by questionnaires at baseline and every 6&#x000a0;months from baseline.</p><p>Total consumption of creams in the intervention group will be measured by real-time monitoring per ward as a secondary outcome and compared over time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Skin exposure to irritants</title><p>Individual exposure will be assessed by questionnaires (estimated frequency of soap and alcohol use per shift), completed every 6&#x000a0;months.

The sample size is based on a previous study, in which the Osnabruck Hand Eczema Severity Index score after 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up in the control group was 0.1 points with a standard deviation of 1.2. A difference in the Osnabruck Hand Eczema Severity Index score of 0.4 points is clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Using a two-sided <italic>t</italic> test with a significance level of 0.05, we calculated that a study with 17 clusters per treatment group with 16 individuals per cluster would have 81% power to detect a difference of 0.4 in group means when the standard deviation is 1.2 and the intracluster correlation is 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Randomization</title><p>The method of fixed-block randomization will be used to carry out randomization with block sizes of 2.

We look at HD among nurses, who are known to have an increased risk of occupational hand eczema due to wet work. We focus on the facilitation of cream availability combined with the continuous monitoring of its consumption with regular feedback on skin care performance in HCWs, aimed at improving their preventive behavior. In addition, this trial will provide information on the actual degree of exposure to wet work in HCWs in The Netherlands, which is important for focused prevention.</p><p>The intervention is general, straightforward and, therefore, easy to implement in health care institutions. The results of this study will help to gain insight into the effectiveness of our intervention program on skin condition and, secondarily, on the consumption of hand creams. We will provide relevant data on the current use of moisturizers in practice in health care work environments and the efficacy of an intervention which is relatively easy to implement.</p><p>Currently, a multicenter intervention RCT, which investigates a range of interventions aimed at the reduction of hand dermatitis among nurses, is running in the UK (the SCIN trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In contrast to our study, the SCIN trial focuses on behavioral change to improve hand care, based on the theory of planned behavior and implementation intentions. The impact of the interventions will be assessed via questionnaires and standardized photographs of hands/wrists, and the primary outcome parameter will be the change in point prevalence of visible hand dermatitis from baseline to 12&#x000a0;months after the intervention. In the present study, the changes in the skin condition between control and intervention groups are used as the primary outcome. The skin condition will be assessed by clinical scoring (HECSI score) performed by a trained physician. In addition, we include as a secondary outcome the NMF levels, which might be a more sensitive parameter of the skin damage than clinical scoring.</p><p>With an RCT design, the risks of selection bias will be reduced, and random and design errors limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The risk of bias will be further reduced by conducting a central randomization stratified for exposure to soaps as an important prognostic factor. We blinded the outcome assessors to minimize the risk of detection bias. In order to limit contamination, the control group will not receive information about the existence of an intervention group or the purpose of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It must be acknowledged, however, that a risk of contamination bias cannot entirely be avoided because the participants work in the same medical center and could find out about the intervention group.</p><p>Strong points<italic>:</italic> real-time monitoring of consumption of creams, objective assessment of the skin condition, facilitation of creams, feedback on performance, and determining NMF levels to detect early signs of skin barrier damage.</p><p>Drawbacks: self-reported hand cream use to assess individual use of skin care in both the control group and the intervention group. The objective data on cream use in the intervention group are ward-based. Exposure estimates are ward-based and self-reported at the individual level.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment into this trial started in June 2016 and is taking place in the VU Medical Center in Amsterdam.
