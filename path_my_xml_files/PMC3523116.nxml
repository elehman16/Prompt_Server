Besides hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, decreased thrombopoietin (TPO) production by hepatocytes is an important cause of thrombocytopenia in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Some invasive procedures, such as liver biopsy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and partial hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), are performed as part of the therapeutic management of patients with CLD. Thrombocytopenia often interferes with such invasive procedures and platelet transfusions may be required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The frequency of splenectomy and platelet transfusions is significantly higher in HCC patients with severe thrombocytopenia (&#x0003c;50,000/&#x003bc;L) than in those without thrombocytopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, both splenectomy and platelet transfusions have limitations and disadvantages; for example, splenectomy is invasive and may be associated with life-threatening short- as well as long-term complications, and platelet transfusions are short-acting and may cause transfusion-related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, alternative therapeutic options to platelet transfusions or splenectomy would provide an important clinical benefit.</p><p>Eltrombopag (GlaxoSmithKline, Ware, UK) is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule, non-peptide thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonist, which has been approved for the treatment of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Eltrombopag induces the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes, resulting in an increase in platelet production in chimpanzees and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Eltrombopag increases platelet counts in a dose-dependent fashion in patients with ITP and in those with thrombocytopenia with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as well as in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Eltrombopag is primarily metabolized in the liver, and a higher plasma eltrombopag exposure has been reported in HCV-infected patients compared with ITP patients and healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, inter-ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag have been reported; the area under the curve (AUC) of eltrombopag in ITP patients and healthy volunteers was approximately 2-fold higher in East Asian subjects than in those of non-Asian origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag in Japanese patients with CLD may be different from those previously reported in ITP patients and Caucasian patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this phase II study was to assess the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in Japanese patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia using lower daily doses (12.5, 25, or 37.5&#x000a0;mg) than those typically used for Caucasian patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 38 patients with CLD (25 with HCV infection, 7 with hepatitis B virus [HBV] infection, 1 with both HCV and HBV infections, and 5 with cryptogenic cirrhosis) were enrolled from 10 Japanese institutions between January and August 2009. Eligible patients were 20&#x000a0;years of age or older and had thrombocytopenia (baseline platelet counts &#x0003c;50,000/&#x003bc;L). Patients were also required to have a Child&#x02013;Pugh score of 9 or less (Child&#x02013;Pugh class A or B) and hemoglobin concentration of &#x0003e;8&#x000a0;g/dL for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks before enrollment. Platelet transfusions and interferon therapies had to be completed at least 2 and 4&#x000a0;weeks before enrollment, respectively.</p><p>Patients with evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, evidence of portal vein thrombosis on abdominal imaging within 3&#x000a0;months before enrollment, a history of arterial or venous thrombosis with 2 or more thrombosis risk factors, or platelet agglutination abnormalities were excluded from the study. Patients with active World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 or 4 bleeding were also excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not eligible, nor were patients who required the use of polyvalent cation-containing medicines, which are known to form chelates with eltrombopag. Patients requiring medications that are known to affect platelet functions [e.g., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and anti-platelet agents], and patients requiring hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (for which exposure might be increased by eltrombopag administration) were also excluded.</p><p>Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was assessed by an aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) of &#x0003e;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and an FIB4 index of &#x0003e;3.25 according to the Practice Guideline for Liver Cirrhosis edited by the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

In the first part, 12 patients received 12.5&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag once daily for 2&#x000a0;weeks, and the data were reviewed by a Safety Review Committee (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After the evaluation of safety in the first part, in the second part 26 new patients were randomly allocated, at a 1: 1 ratio, to receive either 25 or 37.5&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag once daily for 2&#x000a0;weeks. An additional week of treatment was allowed if platelet counts were &#x0003c;80,000/&#x003bc;L at week 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Eltrombopag treatment was to be discontinued if platelet counts were &#x0003e;200,000/&#x003bc;L during the treatment period. Invasive procedures could be performed after the end of treatment with eltrombopag per the investigator&#x02019;s decision. All patients were assessed for the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag every week during the treatment period, and at 4&#x000a0;days, 1&#x000a0;week, and 2&#x000a0;weeks post-treatment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study design.

After review, by a Safety Review Committee, of safety data from the 12.5&#x000a0;mg group (first part), new patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 or 37.5&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag once daily for 2&#x000a0;weeks in the second part</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="535_2012_600_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in platelet counts at the end of week 2. Secondary endpoints were: (1) response rate (achieving platelet counts of &#x02265;80,000/&#x003bc;L) of eltrombopag administered for 2&#x000a0;weeks, or after an additional week, (2) median platelet counts, and (3) safety. The severity of adverse events was graded using the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (version 1.9, dated December 2004). The effects of pretreatment with eltrombopag on the prevalence of perioperative bleeding and platelet transfusions were also evaluated when invasive procedures, such as liver biopsy, RFA, and partial hepatectomy, were performed after the end of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>In the second part of this study, patients were randomly allocated to either the 25 or 37.5&#x000a0;mg group.

Based on Monte Carlo simulations, 12 evaluable patients per group were needed to provide 90&#x000a0;% or more power to detect a linear dose trend and saturation at a medium dose trend. No interim analysis was planned. Descriptive statistics and frequency tables were used to summarize demographics, baseline characteristics, and safety data. The analyses included all patients who had received at least one dose of eltrombopag.</p><p>The primary endpoint was analyzed using point estimates and 2-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs) by each group. In an exploratory analysis, the changes from baseline in platelet counts at week 2 were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline platelet counts as a covariate to detect the following dose response patterns: linearity in 3 doses, saturation at the medium dose (25&#x000a0;mg), or onset of response at the high dose (37.5&#x000a0;mg). A similar analysis, with both baseline platelet counts and Child&#x02013;Pugh class as covariates, was conducted as a secondary analysis. This model used the changes in platelet counts of each patient. No adjustment for multiplicity was made because these analyses were exploratory.

Our results also show that a maximum of 25&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag, a lower dose than that typically used in Caucasian patients, can be recommended for Japanese patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia.</p><p>In this phase II study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag in Japanese patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia. An inter-ethnic difference in the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been observed between East Asian and non-Asian patients with ITP, as well as between East Asian and non-Asian healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; in our study, the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>&#x003c4;</italic></sub> in Japanese patients receiving 37.5&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag once daily was estimated to be 236&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;h/mL, which is similar to that seen in non-East Asian patients with CLD receiving 75&#x000a0;mg once daily in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although the mechanisms underlying an inter-ethnic difference in the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag remain unclear, a common difference between East Asian and Caucasian ethnic groups is body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Because the clearance of eltrombopag increased with body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and because the body weight of East Asian patients is lower than that of Caucasian patients in general, body weight differences could account for the differences in serum levels of eltrombopag seen between the two groups. A pharmacogenetic study has also been performed to investigate a relationship between gene polymorphisms and inter-ethnic differences; however, the responsible polymorphism has not been identified (data not shown). Eltrombopag is a substrate of several drug-metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2C8, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, and UGT1A3, and the agent is also a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Because the activities of these enzymes are known to have inter-ethnic differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], it is possible that multiple factors, including genetic differences in metabolizing enzymes and transporters, may be involved in the observed difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, platelet counts continued to increase 1&#x000a0;week post-treatment and gradually decreased thereafter. This finding is similar to that seen in another study of eltrombopag in patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia; in contrast, in several studies of eltrombopag in chronic ITP, platelet counts began to decrease at 1&#x000a0;week post-treatment and returned to baseline levels within 2&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although the reason is unclear, 2 possibilities may account for this difference. First, plasma eltrombopag concentrations in patients with CLD are higher than those in patients with ITP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and therefore the differences in exposure between these 2 diseases may be responsible for changes in platelet counts after treatment with eltrombopag. Second, the difference may be based on the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia. The main cause of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP is an autoimmune-mediated active platelet destruction. In patients with CLD, increased blood flow into the spleen secondary to portal hypertension and subsequent passive trapping of platelets in the spleen contribute to thrombocytopenia in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Most AEs reported in the present study were grade 1 or 2 in severity, and no significant aminotransferase abnormalities were observed. The incidence of drug-related AEs in the 37.5&#x000a0;mg group was somewhat higher compared with the other groups, and drug-related serious events (ascites, increase of pleural effusion, and development of portal vein thrombosis) were seen in 2 patients receiving 37.5&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag. There was 1 portal vein thrombosis event seen after eltrombopag treatment. Post-hoc analyses of a study of non-Japanese patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia receiving 75&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag showed that maximum post-baseline platelet counts were associated with the thromboses observed in that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, thrombogenesis seems to be a factor for the development of the thrombotic events. In addition, it has recently been reported that platelets can amplify inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], suggesting that platelet-amplified inflammation could be a possible factor for the development of thrombosis. The minimum effective dose of eltrombopag should therefore be used in order to minimize the risk of thromboembolic events, and platelet counts should be closely monitored.</p><p>It may be unusual to recommend an optimal dose of eltrombopag in Japanese patients with CLD based only on this study. Nevertheless, we propose that 12.5 or 25&#x000a0;mg can be recommended for Japanese patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia undergoing invasive procedures, based on the following 3 findings: (1) a higher mean concentration of eltrombopag was observed in patients with Child&#x02013;Pugh class B compared with Child&#x02013;Pugh class A in the 37.5&#x000a0;mg group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); (2) although the mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x003c4;</sub> increased with an increase in the eltrombopag dose, the increase in platelet counts seemed to be saturated at 25&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>); (3) SAEs were seen in the 37.5&#x000a0;mg group. Although the SAEs may have been due in part to invasive procedures or the natural course of the disease, we could not rule out the possibility of these being drug-related.</p><p>In our study, except for 1 patient treated with partial hepatectomy, splenectomy, and cholecystectomy, perioperative bleeding was not seen and platelet transfusions were not required before invasive procedures. These findings suggested that eltrombopag may reduce the necessity for platelet transfusions in patients with CLD undergoing invasive procedures.</p><p>These findings demonstrated that a maximum daily dose of 25&#x000a0;mg of eltrombopag administered for 2&#x000a0;weeks was effective and well-tolerated for Japanese patients with CLD. Eltrombopag seems to be an efficacious alternative to platelet transfusions for supporting invasive procedures in patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia, although there might be a risk of treatment-related thrombosis. Further studies will help to establish the appropriate use of eltrombopag for supporting invasive procedures in patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia while investigating the effective prevention of thrombosis.</p><p>In conclusion, eltrombopag ameliorated thrombocytopenia in Japanese patients with CLD. A daily dose of 25&#x000a0;mg and 2-week administration is recommended for these patients. Recently, Afdhal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] reported that patients with HCV who were treated with eltrombopag showed significantly higher sustained virologic response rates following interferon-based therapy compared with patients treated with placebo. Therefore, in addition to its role as a supporting agent for invasive procedures, further studies will be focused on the ability of eltrombopag to initiate and maintain the interferon therapy, and subsequently facilitate an increase in the sustained virologic response rate in patients with thrombocytopenia with chronic HCV infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by GlaxoSmithKline, Tokyo, Japan.
