Consequently, most patients will require intensification of therapy to maintain glycemic control by the addition of other antihyperglycemic agents to ongoing treatment. Eventually, therapy with insulin is required by many patients with type 2 diabetes. Typically, basal insulin is used by patients with type 2 diabetes initiating insulin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, although insulin is the most efficacious glucose-lowering agent currently available, as many as 40&#x02013;70% of patients treated with insulin fail to achieve glycemic goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This failure may have a number of explanations, including patient and physician factors, such as the occurrence or risk of hypoglycemia, which limit aggressive titration of insulin dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, while treatment with basal insulin targets fasting and pre-meal blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the progressive diminution in insulin secretory capacity in patients with type 2 diabetes can lead to poor post-prandial glycemic control, and as a result, poor overall glycemic control.</p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated improved glycemic control when an oral agent has been added to insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, these studies have generally been performed in the context of stable doses of insulin. The addition of thiazolidinediones, metformin, or sulfonylureas to ongoing therapy, in study designs in which the dose of insulin was to remain stable unless reductions were required for hypoglycemia, has been shown to result in reductions in insulin doses relative to the addition of placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], presumably related to more down-titration of insulin in the active treatment groups. Similar observations have not been made when dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors were added to ongoing therapy with stable doses of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In one study, Vilsb&#x000f8;ll et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported that the addition of sitagliptin to ongoing therapy with a stable dose of insulin (with or without metformin) provided better glycemic control after 24&#x000a0;weeks relative to a placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in that study, the incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group (16%), while lower than what has been observed in similar studies with other DPP-4 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], was higher than that observed in the placebo group (8%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The impact of the addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor to treatment of patients who are actively up-titrating basal insulin using a structured treatment algorithm targeting fasting glucose has not been studied. Sitagliptin lowers post-prandial glucose levels by enhancing insulin secretion and by suppressing glucagon production. It was hypothesized that the addition of sitagliptin, compared with a placebo, would result in similar or better glycemic control with a lower dose of insulin (i.e., would be &#x02018;insulin-sparing&#x02019;) in patients with type 2 diabetes who are actively up-titrating the dose of basal insulin (with or without metformin) to achieve target fasting glucose levels of 4.0&#x02013;5.6&#x000a0;mmol/L (72&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg/dL).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Figure S1) performed between January 16, 2012 and June 07, 2013.

The model adjusted for the patients&#x02019; use of metformin at the screening visit (i.e., on metformin, or not on metformin). The model included the following time points: Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24. Missing outcome data were handled implicitly by the model without the need for imputation. In the analysis model, the daily insulin dose for any given week was defined as the average dose from the three most recent days preceding the index date for that week. The continuous secondary endpoints of mean change from baseline in HbA1c and FPG at week 24 were analyzed using a model analogous to that for the primary endpoint, including the time points of Weeks 0, 2 (for FPG only), 6, 12, 18, and 24. Statistical testing of between-group differences for these secondary endpoints was not pre-specified, but nominal <italic>p</italic> values (i.e., unadjusted for multiple comparisons) were calculated. The planned sample size of the study was 600 in total, to achieve 90% power (2-sided, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05), to detect a difference of 6.8% IU of daily insulin dose assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 25&#x000a0;IU, or 9.5&#x000a0;IU assuming a SD of 35&#x000a0;IU.

While various algorithms for initiating and intensifying basal insulin therapy have been described and evaluated, they all share a common strategy of dose adjustment based on a targeted fasting blood glucose concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Further insulin titration may be limited by the associated increased incidence of hypoglycemia, which may cause substantial health risks to patients.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] found significant associations between the incidence of hypoglycemia and both the absolute reduction in HbA1c level and the final achieved HbA1c level. In this context, less stringent glycemic goals are recommended for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia.</p><p>For patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin, reductions in total insulin dose without sacrificing glycemic control may be of clinical benefit. Higher insulin doses have been associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and may also result in greater weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. While the use of oral antihyperglycemic agents in combination with insulin would be expected to lower total insulin requirements, the impact of such combinations on these other endpoints is of potential clinical importance.</p><p>In the present study, patients titrating basal insulin to a target fasting glucose level of 4.0&#x02013;5.6&#x000a0;mmol/L (72&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg/dL) while being treated with sitagliptin 100&#x000a0;mg/day, compared with a similar group of patients titrating basal insulin while being treated with placebo, had a 20% smaller increase from baseline in insulin dose. Despite this smaller increase in insulin dose (and a lower daily dose of insulin at Week 24), patients in the sitagliptin group had lower HbA1c and FPG levels after 24&#x000a0;weeks, with a higher percentage of patients at HbA1c goal of &#x0003c;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol).</p><p>As both treatment groups were instructed to follow the same insulin titration algorithm, the study was designed to achieve equipoise between the two treatments with regard to FPG levels. The mean FPG levels appeared to plateau in both treatment groups by Week 18, and &#x0003e;70% of patients in both treatment groups achieved the protocol-specified FPG target of 4.0&#x02013;5.6&#x000a0;mmol/L (72&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg/dL). Despite these observations, which suggest that the study duration and design were adequate to allow for fasting glucose goal attainment, equipoise in FPG between groups was not achieved at Week 24: the mean FPG level in the sitagliptin group was lower than that in the placebo group. Although sitagliptin has been shown to lower FPG in both insulin-treated and non-insulin-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], this finding was unexpected in this study, as the superimposition of an insulin titration algorithm was expected to compensate for the lack of the effect of sitagliptin in the placebo group. The reason for this lack of equipoise on FPG is not clear. One possible explanation is that the higher incidence of hypoglycemia in the placebo group may have limited the ability to titrate insulin sufficiently or to maintain the insulin dose at the maximally titrated level, although this study was not designed to evaluate the impact of hypoglycemia on titration of insulin. Another possibility is clinical inertia in both treatment groups that resulted in the sitagliptin group having better glycemic control (including a lower mean FPG) due to the additional antihyperglycemic medication. Regarding the differences observed in HbA1c reduction between groups, the greater reduction in post-meal glucose levels in the sitagliptin group may have also contributed to the greater improvement in HbA1c. In keeping with the improved glycemic control achieved in both groups in this study, and possibly due to the titration of insulin, the percentage of patients with an HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0% (53&#x000a0;mmol/mol) at week 24 was more than twice that observed in previous studies in which a DPP-4 inhibitor was added to ongoing stable insulin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Improvement in glycemic control with insulin is typically associated with an increase in the incidence of hypoglycemia. Additionally, previous studies have reported that the incidence of hypoglycemia when an oral agent is combined with insulin is either similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] compared to the combination of placebo with insulin. Uniquely, in the current study, greater improvement in glycemic control with sitagliptin added on to insulin occurred along with a significantly lower incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia relative to placebo (25.2% vs. 36.8%), representing a relative reduction of 32% for the sitagliptin group compared to the placebo group.</p><p>The lower incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group in the current study may be a consequence of the lower dose of insulin used in this group throughout the duration of the trial. Other potential explanations for the lower incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group, such as improved counter-regulation in response to hypoglycemia, cannot be excluded, although altered counter-regulation has not been observed with DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. However, it is of interest that the levels of the incretin hormone glucose-dependent-insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) have been demonstrated to augment glucagon secretion in the setting of hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Investigation of the role of stabilization of active GIP by sitagliptin in altering the risk of hypoglycemia will be of interest.</p><p>The incidences of hypoglycemia in both the sitagliptin and placebo groups were higher in this study compared to a previous study of sitagliptin added onto stable-dose insulin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, a cross-study comparison is not appropriate because of the differences in the management of insulin doses between the two studies. In the previous study, sitagliptin was added to ongoing insulin treatment and the insulin dose was kept stable (except for down-titration for hypoglycemia, doses were maintained within 10% of the baseline dose) for the duration of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite an increase from baseline in the dose of insulin in the sitagliptin group, a minimal increase in weight occurred in this group. The mean change from baseline in body weight of 0.3&#x000a0;kg at Week 24 observed in this study was within the range of the mean change from baseline in body weight observed at Week 24 in studies where a DPP-4 inhibitor was added to stable doses of ongoing insulin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] despite a greater daily dose of insulin and reduction in HbA1c in this study than in the previous studies.</p><p>The results of the current study are consistent with observations made in two recent open-label studies in which sitagliptin was combined with insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. An open-label, randomized, active comparator controlled, 24-week trial in Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] examined the efficacy and safety of adding sitagliptin to ongoing insulin therapy compared to up-titration of insulin; patients were allowed to remain on stable doses of other antihyperglycemic agents, including sulfonylureas. Compared with up-titration of insulin alone, sitagliptin treatment added to ongoing insulin therapy resulted in a greater decrease in HbA1c and a lower incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia, even though there was a reduction in the insulin dose. Despite differences in study design, and differing definitions of hypoglycemia, the overall results from our study are consistent with the results from the study in Korean patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Similarly, an open-label, randomized study of sitagliptin- and metformin-treated patients initiating a twice-daily biphasic insulin while continuing or discontinuing sitagliptin revealed significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and a trend towards lower rates of hypoglycemia, in patients continuing sitagliptin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>The limitations of this study include the fact that the study may not have been of sufficient duration to observe the full effect of insulin titration, as insulin doses had not plateaued by Week 24. Additionally, the full impact of the intervention on asymptomatic hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia is difficult to assess in the absence of continuous glucose monitoring. Despite these limitations, the results from this study will be useful to guide the treatment of patients who are on basal insulin and wish to titrate their insulin doses based on fasting glucose values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ability to achieve glycemic treatment targets with insulin may be limited by the occurrence of hypoglycemia during insulin titration. As demonstrated in this study, the concurrent administration of sitagliptin with a treat-to-target insulin titration regimen reduced the insulin dose requirement while providing superior glycemic efficacy and a reduced incidence of hypoglycemia compared to the treat-to-target insulin-only titration regimen. This study is the first to reflect clinical practice more accurately as to how the combination of a DPP-4 inhibitor and basal insulin is typically administered: a stable dose of the DPP-4 inhibitor and a titration of the basal insulin to fasting glucose target. The data suggest that the addition of the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin may allow for more efficient and safer titration of basal insulin, thus bringing more patients to glycemic target with less risk of hypoglycemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13300_2015_105_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 2,355 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="13300_2015_105_MOESM2_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 2 (PDF 265 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="13300_2015_105_MOESM3_ESM.pptx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 3 (pptx 110 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01462266.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>This study and the associated article processing charges were funded by Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.
