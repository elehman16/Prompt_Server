The prevalence of full and partial thickness defects increases linearly with age after 50 years, and by the age of 80 years, they exist in 80% of the population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Patients with similar rotator cuff pathology manifest with varying symptoms and functional limitations. The influence of rotator cuff pathology on glenohumeral kinematics is not well documented in the literature, although several authors have speculated on the wide disparity of functional abilities of patients with grossly similar pathology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] </p><p>A number of cadaveric studies have examined the effects of rotator cuff pathology on shoulder kinematics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Collectively, these studies suggest that increasing the size of the rotator cuff tear will result in an increased alteration of kinematics. Currently, there is little information available on the effect of rotator cuff tears on active kinematics <italic>in-vitro</italic>. Kedgley <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effects of sequential one, two, and three cm rotator cuff tears that were created in the supraspinatus tendon and extended into the subscapularis tendon.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The humeral head was displaced posteriorly with progressively larger tears of the rotator cuff during active shoulder elevation. The authors concluded that increasing the size of the rotator cuff tear resulted in greater alterations in glenohumeral kinematics.</p><p>The goals of surgical repair of rotator cuff tears are to restore the anatomic relationship between the tendons and their osseous footprints on the humerus. Several different repair techniques have evolved since Codman's description in 1934.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Common open and arthroscopic techniques include transosseous suture repair or the use of suture anchors in either a single- or double-row repair configuration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Superiority of one technique over another has not been established.</p><p>Several recent studies have examined the biomechanical properties and clinical outcomes of the different repair techniques. Biomechanical studies have found double-row constructs to be stronger than single-row constructs in both cadaveric[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and animal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] models. In addition, double-row repairs can restore the tendon footprint more accurately[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] and are associated with higher rates of tendon healing than single-row repairs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] It has also been suggested that double-row repairs are preferable for cases with retracted tendons.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Despite the biomechanical advantage, clinical studies have failed to show a distinct advantage favoring the double-row repair technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] </p><p>In addition to ensuring mechanical integrity of these reconstructions, the resulting glenohumeral joint motion is also important. However, we are unaware of any studies that have examined the effect of different suture anchor repairs on shoulder translations. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine active glenohumeral kinematics with simulated 2 cm-sized rotator cuff tears. In addition, the ability of single- and double-row suture anchor repair to restore intact glenohumeral kinematics was also compared. We hypothesized that (1) two cm defects in the rotator cuff would have a minor effect on simulated active glenohumeral kinematics and that (2) both single- and double-row suture anchor fixation would restore normal active intact motion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Eight pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric upper forequarters (mean age: 66 &#x000b1; 9 years; range: 46-74 years; 5 male) were used. All specimens had no evidence of previous surgery, trauma, glenohumeral arthritis, or rotator cuff tendonopathy. Specimens were thawed to room temperature (mean 23&#x000b0;C (&#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C)) and were kept moist with 0.9% saline throughout testing.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Testing procedure</title><p>A shoulder testing simulator that creates active unconstrained glenohumeral elevation was employed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Specimens were prepared by osteotomy of the distal humerus at mid-shaft, exposure of the anterior deltoid, and exposure of the inferior border of the scapula. A 316 stainless-steel rod, with weights added to be equivalent to the intact arm, was cemented into the distal humeral canal. Equivalence between the intact arm and the weighted rod was verified with a spring scale.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Each specimen was mounted to the simulator by securing the inferior pole of the scapula into a custom pot with polymethylmethacrylate. Muscle simulation was achieved by suturing pneumatically actuated cables to the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles &#x02013; supraspinatus, subscapularis, and infraspinatus/teres minor, and attaching three cables to the deltoid tuberosity to simulate the three heads of the deltoid muscle. Forces were applied to the individual cables using a previously described set of loading ratios.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] These were based upon electromyographic (EMG) data[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] and the relative physiological cross-sectional areas of the muscles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] The forces varied according to the angle of elevation of the humerus and were different for each specimen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] The relative motion of the humerus with respect to the scapula was collected with an electromagnetic tracking device (Flock of Birds, Ascension Technologies, Burlington, USA). The receivers for the tracking system were fixed to the superior border of the scapula and the rod that replaced the distal humerus.</p><p>Passive glenohumeral elevation in the plane of the scapula was conducted to ensure no impingement occurred as a result of fixation. Initial testing was performed with the rotator cuff intact. Small tone loads of between 20N and 30N were applied to the rotator cuff muscles at the start of each cycle of motion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] These loads were selected to ensure that the humeral head was centered in the glenoid socket when the motion began. Five trials of both passive and active motions were conducted to allow quantification of repeatability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Elevation was defined as movement in the scapular plane from approximately 0&#x000b0; to 90&#x000b0; of glenohumeral elevation.</p><p>The experimental protocol is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Following intact testing, a deltoid splitting technique was used to expose the rotator cuff for creation of a 1 cm (mediolateral) by 2 cm (anteroposterior) defect in the anterior supraspinatus, which began at the rotator interval and propagated posteriorly. One centimeter of the supraspinatus tendon was resected to simulate the clinical scenario of tendon retraction. The deltoid muscle and skin incisions were closed with a running suture prior to recording the simulated active motion of the new torn state. Following testing, one shoulder from each of the eight pairs was randomized to undergo rotator cuff repair using a single-row suture anchor technique, while the contralateral shoulder was repaired using a double-row suture anchor technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] All repairs were performed with 5.5 mm threaded metal anchors double-loaded with #2 high strength suture (Arthrex, Naples, USA). The single row repair was performed by placing one anchor into the midportion of the greater tuberosity footprint. The rotator cuff was repaired with simple sutures placed into the lateral edge of the tendon. The double-row repair was performed by placing one anchor adjacent to the articular margin, and a second anchor was placed at the lateral edge of the greater tuberosity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The medial row was repaired using two mattress sutures, and the lateral row was repaired with two simple sutures. Once the repair was completed, motion trials were repeated.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>An overview of the experimental procedure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSS-7-46-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Outcome variables and statistical analysis</title><p>Repeatability of the trials was quantified by using the standard deviation of the five trials at each position.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] A segment-fixed co-ordinate system was created on each of the scapula and humerus to allow calculation of the glenohumeral joint kinematics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] The plane of abduction and the position of the humeral head relative to the fixed scapula were analyzed at every 10&#x000b0; of glenohumeral elevation.

These results would perhaps be expected; however, compensation likely occurs <italic>in-vivo</italic> with a medium-sized tear such as this. Glenohumeral subluxation was not expected,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and did not occur.</p><p>Our observations did not demonstrate any significant differences in the plane of elevation between single- and double-row repairs. These findings are in agreement with clinical findings in the literature. Sugaya <italic>et al</italic>., in a retrospective cohort study, compared the functional and structural outcomes of single-row versus double-row rotator cuff repair.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] At a follow-up 35 months, no statistically significant differences in clinical outcome could be appreciated between the two different repair techniques. Franceschi <italic>et al</italic>., in a randomized controlled clinical trial, compared 30 patients who received a single-row repair and 30 patients who received a double-row repair. At two years follow-up, there was no clinically significant difference between the two different repair techniques.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] In this study, there are a number of possible reasons that may account for the results.</p><p>First, all rotator cuff repairs were performed with suture anchors that create focal sites of tendon reattachment to the greater tuberosity. In an <italic>in-vitro</italic> study, integration of the tendon to the tuberosity does not occur, and restoration of normal force distribution from a pennate muscle across the tendon-bone interface is unlikely. In both repair conditions, the focal sites of tendon reattachment were similar. <italic>In-vivo</italic> repair studies may be capable of identifying kinematic differences among repair techniques that result in proportionately different rates of healing at the bone-tendon interface.</p><p>Second, there was variability in the size of the cadaveric specimens that were tested. A 2 cm defect may behave differently in a small specimen than in a large specimen and may have affected our ability to detect a change following the simulated tears. Simulating tears that are proportional to the size of the specimen rather than based on an absolute dimension may have resulted in more physiologically relevant results, although they should not have influenced the comparison of the repair types. This supports the generalized trend toward more accurate restoration of the intact glenohumeral kinematics was seen in double-row suture anchor repair for a 2 cm defect of the supraspinatus.</p><p>Third, rotator cuff pathology is often a chronic and progressive disorder that may occur in conjunction with adaptive changes in adjacent muscles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In contrast, this study examined the kinematics of an acute lesion, and repair of the rotator cuff and may not accurately reflect the more common clinical scenario seen in patients with chronic rotator cuff disease. The primary factors that contribute to shoulder stability remained functional, including the glenohumeral articular structures and capsulolabral complex. In a clinical situation, this would likely not be the case, as some degree of degradation would have occurred throughout the cuff tissue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] However, had the specimens already exhibited pathology of the rotator cuff, we would have been unable to compare the repaired and intact states.</p><p>Fourth, this study simulated a chronic clinical scenario by creating an acute defect in the rotator cuff to mimic tendon retraction. Shortening the tendon may have inadvertently created the anterior angulation seen in the plane of elevation with our suture anchor repairs. However, there are also theories that a biochemical mediator may cause a damaged rotator cuff to retract.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] Similarly, the re-attachment of the tendon most likely imposed the observed increased variability in the internal-external rotation angle of the humerus.</p><p>Unfortunately, the use of a deltoid split to produce the rotator cuff tear may not represent the same biomechanics, as that which would be observed had an arthroscopic approach been taken. However, no deltoid failures occurred during testing, and a previous study showed very little alteration of glenohumeral kinematics with a 1 cm rotator cuff tear created in the same way.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] </p><p>There are some noteworthy strengths of this study. The paired, randomized, and controlled nature of this study did generate results of significant merit. Furthermore, a unique, validated shoulder simulator capable of simulating active glenohumeral joint motion using a physiologically-based muscle loading protocol was employed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In summary, a 2 cm defect in the supraspinatus alters the kinematics of the glenohumeral joint by moving the humeral plane of elevation posteriorly. Both single- and double-row repair techniques resulted in restoration of normal kinematics when compared to the intact state. We did not find a significant difference in glenohumeral kinematics between the two repair techniques. Further studies are warranted to ascertain which repairs afford patients optimal functional and clinical results. With an improved understanding of the kinematics of the glenohumeral joint, physicians will be better equipped to treat patients with rotator cuff disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Milgrom</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Schaffler</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>van Holsbeeck</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rotator-cuff changes in asymptomatic adults.
