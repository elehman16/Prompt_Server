commercially available applanation tonometers for the
measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP). Forty subjects
underwent IOP measurement on two accurately calibrated
Goldmann type applanation tonometers (Zeiss AT 030 (GATZ)
and Inami L-5110(GATI)). The order of examination was
randomized and observers were masked to the IOP recorded.
The mean of two consecutive readings, from a randomly selected
eye for each subject, was used for analysis. Agreement was
assessed using the Altman and Bland plot. The mean (SD) IOP
readings on GATZ was 15.32 (&#x000b1;6.80) mm Hg and on GATI was
13.52 (&#x000b1;5.65) mm Hg (p&#x0003c;0.001, 95% CI of the difference: -2.48 to
-1.11). The 95% limits of agreement on the Altman and Bland plot
were:-2.47 to 6.16 mm Hg). There was significant inter-instrument
variability between the two accurately calibrated Goldmann type
applanation tonometers studied.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Agreement</kwd><kwd>Goldmann applanation tonometer</kwd><kwd>intraocular pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements are essential in
the diagnosis and follow-up of glaucoma. While there are a
number of methods for measuring IOP, applanation tonometry
is probably the most widely used technique and is considered
the current gold standard for IOP measurement. Goldmann
type applanation tonometers made by different manufacturers
are available commercially.</p><p>Studies on factors affecting IOP measurements such as
central corneal thickness and keratometric readings have
focused on the subject-related parameters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> However, while
there are reports comparing different instruments used for
measuring IOP, a literature search did not show any published
work on agreement on IOP measurements between different
Goldmann type applanation tonometers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> The literature
search was performed in the Medline database using the key
words Goldmann applanation tonometry with the Boolean
operand &#x02033;AND&#x02033;, and the terms agreement and comparison
independently. When this did not yield any articles that
met the criteria all abstracts with the key words &#x02033;Goldmann
applanation tonometry&#x02033; were reviewed.</p><p>Once the instruments are calibrated as per the manufacturer&#x02032;s
instructions we assume that the readings between devices are
comparable. A significant difference in IOP measurement
between instruments has diagnostic and therapeutic
implications. We studied agreement in IOP measurements
using two commercially available Goldmann type applanation
tonometers.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Sample size was calculated to measure a difference of greater
than 2 mm of Hg between the two instruments with an
estimated standard deviation of 4 mm, for 80% power and
a Type 1 error of 5%. We needed 34 patients to measure this
difference and recruited 40 consecutive adult subjects attending
a glaucoma prevalence study for the trial.</p><p>All subjects who could undergo visual acuity measurement,
refraction, slit-lamp examination and applanation tension
measurement were eligible. Corneal pathology including
astigmatism of 2 diopter (D) or greater, inability to measure
IOP or history of allergy to proparacaine or fluorescein were
reasons for exclusion. An informed consent was obtained from
all participants prior to enrollment.</p><p>Intraocular pressure was measured by one of two examiners,
using the Zeiss AT 030 (GATZ) (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany)
and the InamiL-5110 (GATI) (Inami and Co., Tokyo, Japan)
Goldmann type applanation tonometers.</p><p>At the start of the day the instruments were calibrated as per
the manufacturer&#x02032;s instructions and were used for examination
only if they were accurately calibrated.</p><p>To minimize the influence of any IOP-lowering effect
induced by applanation tonometry on the results, the
sequence of measurements was randomized. Applanation
tonometry was performed first on one randomly selected
instrument followed immediately after by measurement
on the second instrument. The IOP was measured after
anesthetizing the cornea with sterile 0.5% proparacain eye
drops (Paracain, Sunways, Mumbai, India) and staining the
tear film with fluorescein strips. The tonometer was set to the
zero mark prior to the start of the examination. Measurements
on both instruments for a subject were performed by a single
observer who was blinded to the actual readings, which
were read and recorded by the second examiner who then
reset the applanation tonometer to the zero mark. The IOP
was measured two consecutive times for each eye on each
instrument, and the mean of the two readings was used for
analysis; if there was a difference of greater than 2 mm of
Hg between the readings, a third measurement was taken
and the median of three readings was taken. By convention,
the right eye was examined first for every patient. The IOP
was measured on the second instrument, placed in the same
examination room, almost immediately after completing
recording on the first instrument.</p><p>Measurements from one eye were randomly selected for
analysis. Intraocular pressure was compared using the paired
&#x02032;t&#x02032; test and agreement was assessed by the Altman and Bland
plot.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty eyes (40 subjects, mean age: 53.3 SD &#x000b1; 7.9 years, 22 males,
18 females) were included. Mean IOP (SD) on GATZ was 15.32
(&#x000b1;6.80) mm Hg (Range:9 mm Hg - 36 mm Hg) and on GATI 13.52
(&#x000b1;5.65) mm Hg (Range:7mm Hg - 30mm Hg) (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, 95% CI of
the difference: -2.48 to -1.11). The coefficient of correlation for
the two instruments was 0.95 (<italic>p</italic>=0.001). The Bland and Altman
plot [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] revealed a tendency for higher IOP recordings
on the GATZ (95% limits of agreement:-2.47 to 6.16 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Intraocular pressure readings are essential in the diagnosis and
management of glaucoma. The absolute level of IOP may not
be as important to glaucoma diagnosis as was once thought,
however, the trend of IOP measurements is relevant in the
management of glaucoma patients.</p><p>There are various factors that could affect IOP measurements.
We attempted to minimize their influence on the study results.
In order to avoid an observer bias, two observers were
used for the study - however, the same observer made IOP
measurements on both instruments for a single patient. To
minimize the effect of a possible transient lowering of IOP
following applanation tonometry, on the results, we randomly
allocated the order of IOP measurement by either machine. The
IOPs on the second instrument were measured within a few
minutes of the measurement on the first machine to minimize
any temporal variation in IOP.</p><p>The significant variation in IOP recordings between both
instruments is surprising. Lower IOP readings were consistently
recorded on the Inami AT. In 70% of subjects IOP differences
were within the clinically acceptable range of 2 mm. With both
instruments calibrated accurately as per the manufacturer&#x02032;s
recommendations better agreement between the instruments
would be expected. Since manometric measurements were not
made in any of our subjects it is difficult to comment on which
instrument was giving erroneous results.</p><p>The clinical implications of this variation on disease
diagnosis are considerable since both instruments are widely
used in Asia. It could result in potential misdiagnosis of normal
tension glaucoma (NTG) or primary open angle glaucoma
(POAG). Follow-up may not be affected as significantly as
long as all measurements are made on a single instrument by
a single observer keeping other factors such as calibration and
the time of measurement constant. However, with increasing
cross-referrals and the use of multiple instruments in various
clinics the possibility of lack of agreement between devices has
to be kept in mind. Therapeutic and surgical decisions can be
significantly affected by this lack of agreement.</p><p>We have compared applanation readings between only two
instruments. With the large number of similar applanation
tonometers available, agreement between other commercially
available devices needs to be assessed. In this study all
devices were calibrated correctly as per the manufacturer&#x02032;s
instructions. If this was indeed the case there should not have
been a significant difference between devices and certainly
not a difference of the magnitude that was found. Perhaps,
the manufacturers need to reassess the calibration procedures
for these devices.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate yet another variable in IOP
measurements, the effect of which could be minimized by
performing baseline and follow-up IOP measurements on a
single instrument. Additionally, therapeutic decisions should
be made keeping in mind the possibility of an inter-instrument
variability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whitacre</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sources of error with use of Goldmann-type
