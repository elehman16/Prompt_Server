The study used a no-treatment control group because there were no hyaluronic acid fillers approved by the China Food and Drug Administration for malar augmentation in the People&#x02019;s Republic of China at the time the study was conducted. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethics committee at each participating site, with approval from an ethics committee before initiation, and in compliance with the China Food and Drug Administration and the International Conference on Harmonisation principles of good clinical practice. Each subject provided written informed consent before enrollment; subject privacy-related documentation was obtained in accordance with People&#x02019;s Republic of China and local privacy requirements where applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Study subjects had to be of Chinese ancestry and aged 18 years or older. By the investigators&#x02019; assessment, each subject had to require greater than or equal to 1 ml total volume of Voluma at initial treatment and less than or equal to 9 ml in total to achieve a meaningful improvement and/or change in their aesthetic appearance. Exclusion criteria included facial characteristics that would affect study measurements (i.e., moustache, beard, scarring), facial plastic surgery within the previous 12 months, previous tissue grafting/augmentation with permanent or semipermanent fillers in any part of the face or fat injections in the midface, various other facial aesthetic treatments and procedures during the previous 6 months, or plans to undergo any aesthetic facial procedure or dental operation during the study. Other exclusion criteria were a history of anaphylaxis; multiple severe allergies; allergy to hyaluronic acid products or streptococcal protein, or plans to undergo desensitization during the study; and any other condition or situation that in the investigators&#x02019; opinion could put the subject at risk, interfere with study participation, or confound study results.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Treatment</title><p>Three training physicians who had experience in midface injection with Voluma provided product-specific injection training and oversight of each investigator&#x02019;s first one to two subjects, who were designated as &#x0201c;run-in&#x0201d; subjects. The remaining subjects were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive Voluma or be in the delayed-treatment control group (who could receive Voluma at month 6).</p><p>The injection location and intended injection volume were determined by the investigator. The study treatment, Voluma, was supplied in prefilled syringes containing 1.0 ml of product and fitted with 27-gauge, half-inch needles. Pretreatment anesthetic was applied if needed (i.e., ice, topical anesthetic, or local anesthetic). Voluma was injected deeply into the subcutaneous and/or supraperiosteal plane within the medial malar region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); areas adjacent to the target treatment area could also be injected except for the tear troughs, nasolabial folds, and upper lip. Injections were performed in multiple locations using a volume of less than or equal to 0.25 ml at each point for even distribution and to reduce risk of product pooling. The minimum total initial treatment volume to be injected into the two sides of the face was 1.0 ml. After injection, the injected areas were massaged/molded to optimize tissue integration of the product.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Treatment areas.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="prs-139-1250e-g002"/></fig><p>Touch-up treatment could be administered 30 days after the initial treatment according to the agreement of the subject and investigator to achieve optimal correction.

The three-dimensional images were obtained using the Vectra M3 stereophotogrammetry system from Canfield Scientific, Inc. (Fairfield, N.J.) using a specific protocol. The three-dimensional images were collected at baseline (before injections) and at months 1, 3, and 6. The three-dimensional data were analyzed by blinded Canfield Scientific personnel. Briefly, multiple areas of interest on specific facial features were marked as landmarks on baseline three-dimensional images. A validated software algorithm was used to determine changes in volume by overlaying the baseline landmarks onto images from months 1, 3, and 6 to assess volume change in each area of interest.</p><p>Secondary endpoints included investigator and subject assessments of overall aesthetic improvement using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (2 = much improved; 1 = improved; 0 = no change; &#x02212;1 = worse; and &#x02212;2 = much worse) by comparison of baseline photographs to subjects&#x02019; facial features at each posttreatment assessment. The study included several additional assessments. The mean change in volume from baseline in the medial malar area at months 1 and 3 for the treatment group was determined. A subject self-assessment of treatment was used in which subjects responded to five questions/statements pertaining to treatment outcomes. The first was &#x0201c;Are you satisfied with your treatment outcome?&#x0201d; Possible answers and corresponding scores were &#x0201c;very satisfied,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;satisfied,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;neutral,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;dissatisfied,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very dissatisfied.&#x0201d; The second question was &#x0201c;Would you recommend the treatment to a friend?&#x0201d; Possible answers were &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no.&#x0201d; The other three statements were as follows: &#x0201c;The treatment made my cheeks look fuller,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;The treatment improved my facial contouring,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;The treatment made me feel more attractive.&#x0201d; The response scale for these three statements consisted of &#x0201c;strongly agree,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;agree,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;neither agree nor disagree,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;disagree,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;strongly disagree.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by or solicited from the subject for the pretreatment and follow-up periods were categorized using the <italic>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Version 17</italic>.

One study reported data from young adult women (mean age, 29.4 years) in the Republic of Korea using Voluma for injection in the glabellar, malar, and chin areas.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> More than 95 percent of physicians and subjects rated treatment on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale as &#x0201c;improved,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;much improved,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very much improved.&#x0201d; Another study exclusively assessed midface volumizing in 11 male and female subjects in the Republic of Korea with a mean age of 41.5 years using a poly-<sc>l</sc>-lactic acid filler.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> More than 90 percent of subjects and investigators rated improvement of subjects&#x02019; cheeks to be &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;good.&#x0201d;</p><p>The current findings of effectiveness in this Asian subject population are consistent with findings for U.S., European, and Australian subjects in studies of midface volumizing with Voluma. A total of 92.8 percent of subjects in a multicenter study at U.S. and Canadian sites rated their midface volume as improved or much improved on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale at month 6.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Likewise, investigator and subject ratings of satisfied/very satisfied with treatment in a study in Australian subjects were 100 percent and 98 percent, respectively, at week 8; and 88.2 and 79.4 percent, respectively, at week 52.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Subjects in the current study received a smaller injection volume compared with those in the European study of Voluma [mean of 1.9 ml for initial treatment and 2.3 ml including touch-up treatment compared with 3.8 ml (1.9 ml/side) in the European study].<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The smaller injection volume is explained by the fact that the faces of individuals of Chinese ancestry are typically wider compared with the faces of individuals of European ancestry; as a result, investigators avoided deep lateral injections into Chinese subjects with a prominent zygoma and soft tissue. This resulted in a smaller, more narrow target injection area to achieve optimized outcomes.</p><p>Most treatment-related adverse events were mild and resolved spontaneously within 2 weeks. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild swelling and bruising at the injection site. Approximately two-thirds of subjects received anesthetic treatment with ice. The use of ice required approximately half as much time as for administration of topical anesthetic. In addition, ice may reduce swelling and bruising. A recent study evaluated the use of a contact topical cooling device on one side of the face before injection of a hyaluronic acid gel for correction of nasolabial folds compared with the application of a noncooled applicator on the other side of the face. The use of the contact topical cooling device was associated with a significantly lower incidence of ecchymosis immediately after the procedures and at 1 and 3 hours after the procedure and showed a 66 percent mean reduction in ecchymosis on the following day, which failed to reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.09).<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>In this trial, the majority of subjects were between 30 and 50 years of age, so meaningful conclusions for subjects younger than 30 or older than 50 years should be drawn with caution. Effectiveness data were collected through 6 months; additional data over longer follow-up periods may provide perspective on the overall duration of effect of Voluma in this subject population. In addition, the measurement area for three-dimensional volume change in the midface was smaller than the disposition of Voluma after injection; therefore, expansion of the measurement area in future trials of Voluma may more precisely capture volume changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of this study demonstrate that Voluma injected in the subcutaneous and/or supraperiosteal plane was safe and effective for malar augmentation in Chinese subjects. The safety and effectiveness demonstrated in this study were comparable to those reported in studies of individuals of other ethnic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec><title>PATIENT CONSENT</title><p>Li Dong, M.D., represents that he has obtained or made every effort to obtain all necessary and appropriate patient releases.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was sponsored by Allergan, Inc.
