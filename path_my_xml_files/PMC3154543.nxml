Of these menstrual abnormalities, heavy menstrual bleeding, defi ned objectively as blood loss &#x02265; 80 ml per menstrual cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, is a common clinical problem accounting for approximately 12% of all gynaecological referrals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Heavy menstrual bleeding can have an adverse impact on women's health-related quality of life and is an important cause of iron deficiency anaemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Population-based estimates based on objective determination of monthly menstrual blood loss (MBL) suggest that blood loss &#x0003e; 80 ml per menstrual cycle occurs in about 9&#x02013;14% of menstruating women, while the prevalence based on subjective perceptions ranges between 20 and 52%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Both surgical and medical interventions are available for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. Treatments include the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), tranexamic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, danazol, cyclical progestogens, and combined oral contraceptives (COCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.With the exception of the LNG-IUS, cyclical progestogens and tranexamic acid, most medical treatments are prescribed off-label and without prospective, well-designed studies that validate or quantify their effect. Although COCs are used widely &#x02018;off-label&#x02019; for the treatment of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, prior to 2009, no large-scale objective, randomised or placebo-controlled data existed in the literature to support their use for this purpose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, with only one small randomised trial reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Surgical procedures such as hysterectomy and endometrial ablation offer effective strategies, but their cost and associated morbidity should limit these approaches to patients with whom medical therapies have failed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>A novel and effective oral contraceptive containing oestradiol valerate and dienogest (E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG) has been shown to be associated with good cycle control and a good tolerability profile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. This oral contraceptive has been available since May 2009 in many countries worldwide, under the trade names Qlaira&#x000ae; or Natazia&#x02122;. Recently, two identically designed Phase III trials, one conducted in Europe and Australia and the other in North America, were undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in the treatment of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. This paper details the reduction in MBL and safety findings as well as the patients' and investigators' rating of the improvement in bleeding symptoms from an analysis of pooled data from these two Phase III clinical trials. By pooling data from the available studies, we sought to better define the decrease in MBL achieved with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG and its safety profile across a larger and more diverse population of women. A pooled analysis of these trials was judged to be appropriate because of their identical design and enrolment criteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This is a pooled analysis of two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG for the treatment of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding. One study was conducted in the USA and Canada between December 2005 and May 2008 (ClimcalTnals.gov Identifier: NCT00293059), while the other was conducted in Australia and Europe (Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Ukraine [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00307801]) between February 2006 and May 2008. Both studies had identical designs and analysis plans; full details have been published previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>In brief, the studies consisted of four parts: a screening phase of 28 days, a 90-day run-in phase (to confirm symptoms of heavy, prolonged and/or frequent bleeding), a 196-day treatment phase (which concluded with a 90-day efficacy phase that had to start on the first day of a treatment cycle), and a follow-up phase of 30 days. A 90-day reference period was chosen in accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations. This duration has been widely used for several decades to assess bleeding patterns with hormonal therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>To be eligible to participate in the study, women had to be aged 18 years or older and have symptoms of heavy, prolonged and/or frequent menstrual bleeding (confirmed during the 90-day run-in phase) without &#x02018;organic cause&#x02019; (i.e., no lesion in the reproductive tract such as uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, severe hyperplasia or malignancy). Women had to be willing to use a barrier method of contraception (since the preparation had not been approved as a contraceptive prior to the start of these studies and because these were double-blind studies) and to use and collect sanitary protection items (pads and tampons) provided by the sponsor for the duration of the study. Full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria have been published previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. For ethical reasons, use of iron supplements in these studies was allowed if considered necessary by the attending physician.</p></sec><sec><title>Study treatment</title><p>Following the 90-day run-in phase, women with confirmed excessively heavy (two or more bleeding episodes each with a blood loss volume of 80 ml or more), prolonged (two or more bleeding episodes each lasting eight or more days) and/or frequent (more than five bleeding episodes with 20 or more bleeding days overall) menstrual bleeding were randomised to the E<sub>2</sub>-V/DNG oral contraceptive (Qlaira&#x000ae;/Natazia&#x02122;; Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) or matching placebo for 196 days (seven treatment cycles, each of 28 days). Study medication was started on the first day of bleeding following randomisation, and taken daily with no tablet-free days between cycles. The E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG oral contraceptive regimen was designed to deliver the oestrogen in a step-down and the progestogen in a step-up manner through each 28-day treatment cycle (E<sub>2</sub>V 3 mg on days 1-2, E<sub>2</sub>V 2 mg/DNG 2 mg on days 3&#x02013;7, E<sub>2</sub>V 2 mg/DNG 3 mg on days 8&#x02013;24, E<sub>2</sub>V 1 mg on days 25&#x02013;26, and placebo on days 27&#x02013;28). The treatment phase concluded with a 90-day efficacy phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Study assessments</title><p>Throughout the study (including during the 90-day run-in phase), women were required to complete electronic diaries on a daily basis to document menstrual bleeding, the number of items of sanitary protection used, and study drug intake (during the treatment phase). Women were required to collect their used sanitary protection items (pads and tampons) in provided containers for objective analysis of MBL using a modified version of the alkaline haematin method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

Additional safety assessments included the evaluation of vital signs, physical and gynaecological examinations, and mammography</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All variables were analysed based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (i.e., all randomised patients). MBL variables were also analysed in the subgroup of women with excessively heavy menstrual bleeding.</p><p>MBL was analysed during both the 90-day run-in phase and 90-day efficacy phase (which started on day 1 of treatment cycle 4 and ended on day 6 of treatment cycle 7). Bleeding episodes that started during a 90-day run-in/efficacy phase or cycle were counted completely within that period independently of whether the end of that bleeding episode was after the end of that phase/ cycle. Missing MBL data on non-consecutive days were replaced using the highest intensity value for bleeding obtained on the bordering days. No more than nine non-consecutive days were replaced per 90-day interval. Consecutive days with missing bleeding intensity data were not replaced.</p><p>The proportion of patients with improved menstrual bleeding symptoms as rated by investigators using the global assessment scale and by the patients using the patient's overall assessment scale was determined at the end of cycle 7 (when both investigators and patients were still blinded to treatment).</p><p>Safety outcomes were assessed in all randomised patients who took at least one dose of study medication. All variables were summarised using descriptive statistical methods. AN(C)OVA models were used to compare the treatment groups with the terms of treatment, pooled centre and baseline as covariates. A significance level of 0.05 was used. The mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum were calculated for metric data. The change in MBL from the 90-day run-in phase to the 90-day efficacy phase was calculated along with the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). Frequency tables were generated for categorical data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>RESULTS</title><p>Across the two studies, 421 women were randomised to treatment and made up the ITT population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Since withdrawal bleeding usually spanned two treatment cycles (in approximately 60% of patients, the onset of withdrawal bleeding started from day 27 onwards [unpublished data]), MBL during any of the seven treatment cycles represents the latter part of ongoing withdrawal bleeding that started in a previous cycle, any additional intermenstrual bleeding episodes plus the start of the next withdrawal bleeding.

After six months of treatment, i.e., by treatment cycle 7, the median MBL was reduced by 88%.

This effect is achieved at the first withdrawal bleed after treatment initiation and is sustained over the duration of treatment. By pooling data from the two Phase III trials conducted in Europe and Australia and North America, the decrease in MBL achieved with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG was shown to be consistent across a larger and more diverse population of women. Moreover, the reduction in MBL was associated with a decrease in the number of sanitary protection items used and an improvement in iron metabolism parameters.</p><p>In the present study, the percentage reduction in MBL with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG appears to be independent of baseline MBL. Interestingly, small reductions in MBL were also observed in the placebo group, with higher percentage reductions observed among those with highest baseline MBL. It may be postulated that the willingness to continue to adhere to study procedures (such as the highly demanding process of collecting used sanitary items) may have been compromised if those receiving treatment perceived a lack of clinical efficacy and, therefore, became less motivated to participate fully. This lack of motivation to fully participate would likely disproportionately affect the placebo group, especially those with highest baseline MBL, and, as such, would have affected the total count of sanitary items used, leading to an underestimation of blood loss determination by using the alkaline haematin method.</p><p>Although not directly comparable, the median decrease in MBL achieved by treatment cycle 7 with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment (88%) appears to approach that achieved with the LNG-IUS (median 95% and 96% reduction) over six cycles in two studies that also used the alkaline haematin method to objectively assess blood loss in women with heavy menstrual bleeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The LNG-IUS (<italic>n</italic> = 82 and <italic>n</italic> = 25, respectively) produced significantly greater reductions in median monthly MBL than the active comparators used: short-course oral medroxyprogesterone (<italic>n</italic> = 83) 10 mg daily for ten days starting on the 16th day of the menstrual cycle (21%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> or mefenamic acid (<italic>n</italic> = 26) 500 mg three times daily for the first four days of the menstrual cycle (17%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. By comparison, a median 24% reduction in MBL by treatment cycle 7 occurred in the placebo group in our study. Placebo-related reductions in measured blood loss have been recorded in heavy menstrual bleeding in a previous study over six menstrual cycles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>Oral tranexamic acid (1.3 g three times daily for five days from the start of menstruation) was shown to reduce mean MBL by 40.4% (vs. 8.2% reduction with placebo) in a recent study that also used the alkaline haematin method to objectively assess blood loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.These results with oral tranexamic acid appear rather modest in comparison with the reductions in blood loss achieved with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in our pooled analysis. Additionally, the added advantage of using E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG is that it provides effective contraceptive protection and use of back-up contraception is not required. Agents such as tranexamic acid do not offer contraceptive protection and should not be used in women using COCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Similarly, cyclical progestogens do not provide adequate contraceptive protection and additional non-hormonal backup contraception would be also required.</p><p>E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG represents the first COC approved for the treatment of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding in many countries worldwide. Other oral contraceptives have not been formally approved for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding but, have nonetheless, been frequently used off-label with some success.The available studies assessing the effectiveness of other COCs in reducing MBL in women with heavy menstrual bleeding are limited to three randomised comparative studies with the LNG-IUS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, one of which was in women with fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and a randomised crossover study that included mefenamic acid, naproxen and danazol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>In the first comparative study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, which used the semi-quantitative pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) to assess MBL, treatment with a COC containing norethindrone acetate (NETA) 1 mg and ethmylestradiol (EE) 20 &#x000b5;g (21/7 regimen; <italic>n</italic> = 19) resulted in a 68% reduction in median MBL scores at 12 months (vs. 83% with the LNG-IUS; between-group differences <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). In the second comparative study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, treatment with a COC containing LNG 150 &#x000b5;g/EE 30 &#x000b5;g (21/7 regimen; <italic>n</italic> = 56) resulted in a mean reduction in MBL at 12 months of 35%, as assessed using the alkaline haematin method (vs. 87% with the LNG-IUS [<italic>n</italic> = 56]; <italic>p</italic> = 0.013).PBAC scores were also used in this trial and suggested a 2.5% reduction in scores with the COC (vs. 87% with the LNG-IUS; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The discrepancy between MBL measured by the alkaline haematin method and the PBAC score may be due, in part, to the inherent wider variability between PBAC scores and measured MBL with increased volume of blood loss. The study by Higham <italic>et al.</italic> also shows the limitations of the PBAC method for the determination of MBL and supports the validity of the methodology used in the present study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In the study of women with fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, the mean reduction at 12 months in MBL with the COC (<italic>n</italic> = 29), also assessed using the alkaline haematin method, was 13% (vs. 91% with the LNG-IUS; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Pictorial blood loss assessment chart scores corresponded to a 54% reduction in scores (vs. 88% with the LNG-IUS; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02).</p><p>In the randomised cross-over study that included mefenamic acid, naproxen and danazol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, treatment with a COC containing LNG 150 Hg/EE 30 &#x000b5;g (21/7 regimen; <italic>n</italic> = 12) for two cycles resulted in a 43% decrease in mean MBL compared with control cycles (assessed using the alkaline haematin method). In comparison, mefenamic acid, naproxen and danazol reduced mean MBL by 20&#x02013;39%, 12% and 49%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the COC, mefenamic acid, low-dose danazol or naproxen treated groups.</p><p>The reduction in MBL achieved with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in the present study was accompanied by significant rises in haemoglobin, haematocrit and ferritin levels from baseline, which were significantly greater than with placebo. Although some improvements were observed in the placebo group, these were not significant and may, in part, have been due to the use of iron supplements in a minority of patients during the study. Similarly, treatment with the COC containing NETA 1 mg/EE 20 &#x000b5;g (21/7 regimen) or the LNG-IUS increased mean haemoglobin levels significantly from baseline to 12 months (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) in women with idiopathic heavy bleeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Interestingly, the raised haemoglobin levels plateaued after six months of treatment with the LNG-IUS, while the increase observed with the COC occurred at a much slower rate, progressing linearly with time over the 12 months. In contrast, in the two studies comparing the LNG-IUS with a COC containing LNG 150 &#x000b5;g/EE 30 &#x000b5;g (21/7 regimen) over 12 months, haemoglobin and ferritin levels significantly increased with the LNG-IUS, but not with the COC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. No improvements in haemoglobin and ferritin levels were reported in a placebo-controlled study assessing tranexamic acid (<italic>n</italic> = 123) over six cycles of treatment despite significant reductions in MBL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG represents a valid alternative to current treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. The consideration of contraindications and precautions for use of any individual treatment option, including E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG, is warranted to ensure a positive benefit-risk balance. The side effect profile of COCs is well established and includes an increased risk for thrombosis which must be carefully balanced against the benefits achieved. Hysterectomy and endometrial ablation are effective treatments, but are associated with surgical risks and are not suitable for women who wish to retain their fertility. Other approved medical therapies, apart from the LNG-IUS, do not provide effective contraceptive protection and use of back-up contraception would be required. However, active comparator studies with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in the treatment of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding are currently lacking.</p><p>No specific safety concerns were noted with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment across the two studies pooled. The type and frequency of adverse events reported with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG were typical of hormonal contraceptive use.</p><p>In conclusion, E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG rapidly reduces MBL in women with heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding. This effect is achieved at the first withdrawal bleed after treatment initiation and is sustained for the duration of treatment, irrespective of initial MBL.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Jenny Szkolar and Danielle Turner of <italic>in</italic> Science Communications, a Wolters Kluwer business, for medical writing support during the preparation of this manuscript.
