The aim of this study was to report the hypertension prevalence rate according to the data from blood pressure screening events, to describe the characteristics of health service utilization among aged Chinese Canadians, and to report the evaluation of participant satisfaction to the DASHNa-CC intervention. This study was designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 60. Among 618 Chinese Canadians participated in blood pressure screening events, 54.5% (n = 337) having various levels of hypertension. Across 2 months, 38 (63.3%) participants made a total of 47 visits to see their family physicians; 20 (33.3%) participants consulted their family members 224 times for lifestyle modifications and hypertension self-management. Various forms of Chinese media were frequently used as sources of health care information, and English media were rarely accessed. Participants highly satisfied with the contents, delivery approaches, and integration of traditional Chinese medicine in the intervention. Results indicated that middle-aged and senior Chinese Canadians have high hypertension prevalence and specific characteristics of health service utilization. It is important to implement interventions, which are culturally tailored, language appropriate, using proper technology and incorporating traditional Chinese medicine, in Chinese Canadian community for hypertension control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>health services utilization</kwd><kwd>patient satisfaction</kwd><kwd>immigrants</kwd><kwd>Chinese</kwd><kwd>Canada</kwd><kwd>pilot study</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0046958017724942"><title>Background</title><p>In Canada, 1.3 million Chinese comprise approximately 4.0% of Canada&#x02019;s population and 21.1% of the country&#x02019;s visible minorities.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Literature indicates that a 15.1% hypertension prevalence rate existed among adult Chinese Canadians.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Hypertension is the most prominent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and it accounts for a large proportion of stroke,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> myocardial infarction,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and heart failure<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> in the Chinese population. A systematic review, assessing the impact of 5 modifiable risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes, and smoking) on stroke risk in the Chinese population, suggested that the association between hypertension and stroke was the strongest of the 5 factors (odds ratio [OR] = 2.75-5.47).<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Compared with Western countries, the Chinese population has a higher risk ratio of hypertension and stroke. The Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration, an international comparison study, also suggested that the association between blood pressure and stroke was stronger in East Asians than in other populations.

Thus, further research on health service utilization of Chinese Canadians is needed to facilitate a better understanding of their health care needs and to provide them with better health care services.</p><p>There is a lack of culturally sensitive dietary interventions targeting Chinese Canadians despite an unhealthy diet being identified as the most important modifiable risk factor for hypertension in the Chinese population.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Literature suggests that Chinese Canadians rely strongly on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for chronic illness management, including hypertension control, and prefer to incorporate TCM into their health care.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Chinese Canadians reported that the holistic perspective of TCM facilitated the understanding of the nature of chronic problems, and traditional therapies promoted healing.

The pilot study was designed as a randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 60. Self-identified Chinese Canadians at least 45 years old, with grade 1 hypertension, but not on antihypertensive medication, were recruited from diverse community settings. Participants were randomized to either a control group (usual care, n = 30) or an intervention group (usual care plus the newly developed DASHNa-CC intervention, n = 30). The objective of the DASHNa-CC pilot randomized controlled trial was to determine the feasibility and potential effects of a culturally sensitive dietary intervention for hypertension control among Chinese Canadians. The findings suggested that, at 8 weeks post randomization, those in the intervention group had greater reductions in systolic blood pressure, 3.8 mm Hg, <italic>t</italic>(55) = &#x02212;1.58, <italic>P</italic> = .12, and higher physical health scores of 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-36), <italic>t</italic>(55) = 2.13, <italic>P</italic> = .04, compared with those in the control group.

Services from nurses, dietitians, public health personnel, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation were rarely accessed.</p><table-wrap id="table2-0046958017724942" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Health Service Utilization: Frequency of Use in 2 Months.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0046958017724942-table2"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Health services</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control (n = 28)<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Intervention (n = 29)<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SD</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Family physician</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TCM practitioner</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other health care professionals</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Family member</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Friends</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese media: Internet</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese media: Television</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese media: Radio</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese media: Newspaper</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese media: Magazines</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese media: Books/pamphlets</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese media: Others</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">English media: Internet</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.7</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn2-0046958017724942"><p><italic>Note.</italic> Two participants lost to follow-up in the control group; 1 participant lost to follow-up in the intervention group.

This prevalence rate is much higher than a cross-sectional study using national health survey data including 3308 Chinese Canadians, which indicated a prevalence rate of 15.1%.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The difference could be because of age, mean age of 42.3 years in that study versus 62.0 years in this pilot trial. Therefore, 15.1% might reflect the prevalence of hypertension in all adult Chinese Canadians, and 54.5% might reflect the prevalence rate among middle-aged and senior Chinese Canadians. However, it should be noted that the blood pressure screening in this pilot trial was not based on random population-based sampling; thus, the prevalence rate identified in this trial might not a true reflection of the prevalence rate in aged Chinese Canadian population. There might be an overestimation or underestimation and future study is warranted.</p><p>The high prevalence of hypertension in this pilot trial might be related to migration characteristics of Chinese Canadians. Lifestyle changes after migration might have an impact on hypertension prevalence. Immigrants increased intake of meat and fat because of the low price in local supermarkets.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> They also increased the fast food consumption because of its convenience and the affordable price.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In the meantime, they might decrease physical activity because of the availability and affordability of private home cars. Besides lifestyle changes, migration and acculturation stress might also be related to high hypertension prevalence. Language barriers may prohibit them from receiving health information from English media; at the same time, life stress accompanying with migration and acculturation may prevent them from attending health education services in the community. In addition, most immigrants experienced economic transition in the settlement process and had low socioeconomic status in Canada.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In the lengthy process of settlement in a new country, immigrants usually consider working and supporting family as life priority.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Chronic illness prevention and subtle changes in health can be easily ignored. For example, in the recruitment process of the DASHNa-CC study, some individuals had not measured their blood pressure for 2 years and some individuals were unaware of their blood pressure status.</p><p>Nonpharmacological approaches for blood pressure control should be emphasized because a large percentage of individuals with grade 1 hypertension were not on antihypertensive medication, or on antihypertensive medication but not able to control their blood pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg. In this pilot trial, 40.7% (n = 123) individuals with grade 1 hypertension were not on antihypertensive medication. Most of these individuals chose not taking medication because they did not want to take the antihypertensive medication for the rest of their lives, or they did not think they needed to take the medication, or they were afraid of the side effects of the medication.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> For these individuals, lifestyle interventions were the major treatment for hypertension. Health care providers should attentively listen to their concerns, provide advice of lifestyle modifications, communicate the benefits of antihypertensive medication, and emphasize the importance of blood pressure control. In addition, 25.2% (n = 76) of individuals were on antihypertensive medication, but blood pressures were still higher than 140/90 mm Hg. This finding may suggest that, for some individuals, a pharmacological only approach may not be able to control their blood pressure. Therefore, nonpharmacological approaches are complementary treatments to achieve better health outcomes. For these individuals, health care providers should assess the acceptance of and adherence to antihypertensive medication, educate the targets of blood pressure control, and encourage constant medical follow-up to reach better blood pressure control. Cochrane review suggested that antihypertensive medications used to treat adult grade 1 hypertension did not reduce mortality or morbidity, but the adverse effects of antihypertensive treatment caused 9% of patients to discontinue.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In contrast, a recent report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee concluded that, for all individuals with hypertension, the potential benefits of lifestyle intervention cannot be overemphasized, because the lifestyle treatments have the potential to improve blood pressure control and even reduce medication needs.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section22-0046958017724942"><title>Health Service Utilization</title><p>As the most frequently been visited health care professionals, family physicians should be trained and encouraged to provide adequate lifestyle interventions to their patients. In this pilot trial, 3 participants found that they had elevated blood pressure in a Shoppers Drug Mart and consulted their family physicians. The physicians stated that these individuals did not have hypertension but did not provide any explanation and any information on lifestyle modifications. Although all participants in this pilot trial were encouraged to see their family physicians, 22 (36.7%) did not make a visit in 2 months. When patients stated that they were not willing to take antihypertensive medication, family physicians did not always provide alternative lifestyle interventions. Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines suggest that lifestyle interventions should be applied to prevent and treat mild hypertension<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>; however, in clinic, physicians do not always endorse lifestyle intervention programs. The possible reasons might be lack of training and knowledge update.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Thus, effective training and information for physicians that provide local and international evidence on effectiveness of lifestyle intervention are necessary.</p><p>Besides family physicians, other health care professionals, such as dietitians, nurses, and TCM practitioners, should be involved in hypertension control in community. Although literature suggests that nurse-led educational interventions are related to better hypertension control,<sup><xref rid="bibr40-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> there was no such program in the Chinese community in Toronto and no participant encountered any nursing service in the community in 2 months. Participants had great interest of integration TCM into their health care, but TCM services were not covered by the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and not accessible due to its expensiveness. This finding of the inaccessibility of TCM services is consistent with other related studies in Chinese Canadians.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Therefore, there is a need of an alliance of multidisciplinary health care professionals in the community to help patients cope with hypertension, especially increasing the visibility of nurses and dietitians as advocates for evidence-based nutrition information and including TCM practitioners to provide traditional practice services based on patient preference.</p><p>In an immigrant population, with limited resources and an English language barrier, engaging family is important for hypertension control in the community. In this pilot trial, family members were important health care resources and play an important role in lifestyle intervention, such as dietary behavior modification. Participants consulted their family members more frequently than the physician. Among family members, daughters, wives, and individuals, who were health care professionals in China or currently working as health care professionals, were constantly used as health care resources. This finding is consistent with another Chinese Canadian study where 68% participants cited their family members as a source of nutrition information.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Thus, hypertension control interventions in the community have to be family-centered and encourage the participations of all family members.</p><p>Proper use of technology is essential in hypertension education in the community. In this pilot trial, the Internet was the most frequently used media for hypertension-related information. However, another Chinese Canadian study (n = 106) indicated that the frequently used Chinese media for nutrition information were television, radio, newspapers, and magazines rather than the Internet.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In addition, in a population-based survey of Chinese immigrants (n = 889) conducted in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle, Washington, about resources of cancer-related health information, less than three-fourths of the respondents reported receiving health information from health care providers, and only a minority used the Internet as a source of health information.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> This inconsistency of different findings may reflect the rapidly increased use of the Internet over recent years. In this pilot trial, it was also noteworthy that most seniors living independently in senior apartments did not have a computer and could not access the Internet service. Therefore, health educators need to constantly assess the change of the available media, the need and interest of the target population, and characteristics of the community, when planning a health education intervention. In the near future, the Internet-based component may be included as a complementary delivery approach for individuals who are unable or unwilling to attend the classroom education. However, solely Internet-based intervention may not be appropriate to senior Chinese Canadians, because it may further disadvantage senior individuals who were with low income, living alone, and with limited access to the Internet service, thereby enlarging the gap of existing social divisions.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>In this pilot trial, a very small percentage of participants (n = 3, 5%) used English media, and the only English media used was the Internet. Another Chinese Canadian study indicated that 40% of participants (aged 45-64 years) used the English media as a source of nutrition information.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The difference may be because participants in this pilot trial were older (aged 45-85 years) and less proficient in English. English proficiency is a barrier for Chinese Canadians, especially seniors, who cannot be overcome even after a lengthy stay in Canada. This implied the importance of culturally tailored and language appropriate interventions to Chinese Canadians.</p></sec><sec id="section23-0046958017724942"><title>Participant Satisfaction With the DASHNa-CC Intervention</title><p>Participants in this pilot study accepted and were highly satisfied with the DASHNa-CC intervention regarding its contents and delivery approaches. This finding was consistent with others who found favorable participant satisfaction in culturally sensitive chronic illness health education interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Thus, in future trial, the main contents of the DASHNa-CC intervention will not change. However, according to participants&#x02019; feedbacks regarding the qualitative components of the Participant Satisfaction Questionnaire, new knowledge about hypertension control and more information about TCM will be added in the intervention. In addition, a future trial should incorporate knowledge translation strategies that reflect the needs of the Chinese community and involve health policy makers in Canada.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>Integration of TCM into evidence-based clinical practice is needed to better meet Chinese Canadians&#x02019; health care needs.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Health care providers need to enhance their knowledge about complementary medicine and routinely screen all patients for the use of complementary treatments.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="bibr48-0046958017724942" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> China is the only country in the world where Western medicine and traditional medicine are practiced alongside each other at every level of the health care system.

This high prevalence rate of hypertension might be related to some migration characteristics. In addition, middle-aged and senior Chinese Canadians have specific characteristics of health service utilization including limited access to professional health services, family as an important care resource, frequent use of Chinese media, and rare access to English media when searching health information. These characteristics and results from participant satisfaction in the DASHNa-CC pilot trial indicate that it is important to implement interventions, which are culturally tailored, language appropriate, using proper technology and incorporating TCM, in Chinese Canadian community for hypertension control.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by various research grants, including Canadian Council of Cardiovascular Nurses Research Grant, Provincial Nurse Educators Interest Group Research Award, Bertha Rosenstadt Doctoral Research Dissertation Grant, and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Institute Community Support Travel Grant.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0046958017724942"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
