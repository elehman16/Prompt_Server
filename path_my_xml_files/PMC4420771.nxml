Noncompliance was considered in the form of treatment discontinuation and cross-over at specified proportions, with an assumed true hazard ratio of 0.9, 1, and 1.3, respectively.

When compliance is not perfect, the average causal effect of random treatment assignment may differ from that of non-random receipt of treatment. Although generally endorsed as conservative in estimating efficacy (i.e. underestimation of benefits), ITT may also underestimate harm in safety endpoints.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr5-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Of particular concern is that the upper confidence limit may also be underestimated. In the interest of better understanding and possibly protecting patient safety, the causal effect of actual exposure to treatment on an adverse outcome among the treated or among those who would comply with treatment may be of primary interest. For example, if an ITT analysis estimated an increased risk of cardiovascular event of up to 20% (i.e. upper bound&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2 for the risk ratio) for a drug treatment, based on a clinical trial with 40% of patients not taking the assigned treatment, the true risk may well exceed 30% among patients who actually took it. In practice, it would be useful to understand not just &#x0201c;up to 20% increased risk for all patients who are prescribed the drug,&#x0201d; but also &#x0201c;up to 30% increased risk for patients who take the drug as prescribed.&#x0201d;</p><p>Causal inference methods have been developed, which can be applied to evaluate potential safety upper bound in randomized trials with noncompliance.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, practical application of such methods for this purpose is still limited, compared to other alternatives to ITT such as per protocol, as-treated and/or on-treatment analysis,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> as well as various modified ITT analyses.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> These other alternative analysis methods may be biased due to post-randomization unmeasured confounding or selection bias<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> in the relationship between noncompliance and the outcomes of interest, that is, factors that affect compliance may also be independently related to outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> For example, previous clinical trials have found that in placebo arms, patients with poor adherence, compared with patients with good adherence, had higher risk of cardiovascular events.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr14-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>The cardiovascular safety of new therapies to treat type 2 diabetes provides an interesting context for the evaluation of safety upper bound in clinical trials with noncompliance. Although lowering of HbA1c (the primary efficacy endpoint) reflects a beneficial effect on the immediate clinical consequences of diabetes, and is reasonably expected to reduce the long-term risk of microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy, nephropathy), concerns about cardiovascular safety remain.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> To exclude an unacceptable cardiovascular risk of new type 2 diabetes therapies, the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines require that the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated risk ratio be less than 1.3 for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which should include cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A number of large clinical trials of diabetes drugs are being conducted mainly for this purpose.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr19-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Two of these studies<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> published results recently; both reported approximately 20% premature discontinuation during the trials, and both met the required upper bound of &#x0003c;1.3 by ITT analysis. Although some noncompliance in these trials is probably inevitable, it is unknown what impact such noncompliance may have on the cardiovascular safety upper bound evaluation, and whether ITT or various alternative analyses may address noncompliance appropriately. Potential advantages and limitations of these alternative analyses also need to be better understood.</p><p>We conducted a simulation study, using cardiovascular safety trials for type 2 diabetes therapies as a motivating example to (1) evaluate point estimates of cardiovascular risk by ITT and causal inference methods and (2) compare ITT and causal analyses with respect to the estimated 95% upper confidence limit (safety upper bound), specifically whether the estimated upper bound is above or below the threshold of 1.3 under various noncompliance conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section8-1740774515572352"><title>Methods</title><p>We simulated a cardiovascular safety trial for a hypothetical type 2 diabetes therapy with 10,000 total subjects randomly assigned to either the treatment or control arm in 1:1 ratio. Cox proportional hazards models were used in the ITT analysis of time to first occurrence of MACE, the outcome of interest. The hazard ratio (HR) was the primary measure of treatment effect. Follow-up was administratively censored when a total of 611 MACE had occurred, to reflect the common use of event-driven trials (i.e. trials in which the duration of study follow-up is not fixed in advance but depends on the number of MACE). The number 611 was chosen to give 90% power for excluding an upper bound of 1.3 for the two-sided 95% confidence interval if the underlying true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, comparing treatment to control. We also explored a fixed follow-up of 3 years for the hypothetical trial.</p><p>Because of our interest in potential harm for patients who would comply with their prescribed treatment, we focused on estimating causal treatment effects that would have been observed under perfect compliance. Using terminology from principal stratification,<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> we considered three types of potential compliance/noncompliance behaviors: (1) compliers would always take the assigned treatment (or control) throughout the trial, and causal effect (benefit or harm) of the treatment is defined for compliers; (2) always-takers would fully comply with the treatment when assigned to it, but would cross-over to the treatment if assigned to control; (3) never-takers would stop the assigned treatment prematurely before the end of trial, but would fully comply when assigned to control. We did not consider defiers, who would take the active treatment if assigned to control, but would not take the active treatment if assigned to it. For lack of a better term, we used &#x0201c;never-takers&#x0201d; to include not only subjects who would truly never take the assigned treatment (no exposure at all), but also those who may take the assigned treatment initially but would not adhere to it throughout the trial (partial compliance). That is, cross-over (from control to active treatment) noncompliance is captured by &#x0201c;always-takers&#x0201d;, while premature discontinuation of the active treatment at the beginning of or during the trial is captured by &#x0201c;never-takers&#x0201d;.</p><p>In practice, the control regimen to be compared with the active treatment of interest may be placebo or standard therapies. In this study, we assumed that the control regimen <italic>per se</italic> had no effects on MACE, although never-takers themselves may have a different risk of MACE compared with compliers. This assumption essentially provided a single reference level against which the risk of MACE for the active treatment is compared, consistent with the practice where one new type 2 diabetes drug is compared with alternative standard therapies as control. For example, if the control regimen is placebo on the background of metformin plus glimepiride, it may be assumed that the risk of MACE remains largely unchanged (from some baseline level that may be different from that of compliers) for a patient who discontinues glimepiride, or who takes glipizide instead. By randomization, the distribution of trial participants with each type of potential compliance was expected to balance across the treatment and control groups. However, the compliance type of all individuals is not identifiable in a particular trial. For example, an always-taker assigned to the treatment arm cannot be distinguished from a complier as both would exhibit perfect compliance in that trial. Likewise, a never-taker assigned to the control arm cannot be distinguished from a complier assigned to control. To cover a broad range of noncompliance reported in clinical trials of type 2 diabetes drugs (see Appendix 2, available online),<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="bibr24-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr25-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr26-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> the following triples were used to specify the proportions of compliers, never-takers, and always-takers, respectively: &#x03008;80%, 20%, 0%&#x03009;, &#x03008;60%, 40%, 0%&#x03009;, &#x03008;80%, 10%, 10%&#x03009;, and &#x03008;60%, 20%, 20%&#x03009; (the proportions must sum to 1 because we assumed that all trial participants fall into one of these three categories). By randomization, each set of these triples was equally applied across the treatment and control groups.</p><p>We considered both all-or-none<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and partial compliance. In all-or-none compliance, a never-taker assigned to treatment would fail to take the treatment at the very beginning of the trial (time zero), whereas an always-taker assigned to control would initiate treatment at time zero. In partial compliance, a never-taker may initially take the assigned treatment but would discontinue prematurely (before the occurrence of MACE or end of trial). Likewise, an always-taker assigned to the control arm may cross-over anytime during the follow-up and remain on treatment for the rest of the trial. In partial noncompliance, the timing of treatment discontinuation or cross-over was assumed to be uniformly distributed over potential (or counterfactual) time to MACE. Potential time to MACE was assumed to follow a Weibull distribution with survival function exp(&#x02013;&#x003bb;t<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>), where &#x003bb; is the scale parameter and &#x003b1; is the shape parameter (see Appendix 1). The Weibull distribution was chosen because it satisfies both the proportional hazards assumption and the accelerated failure time assumption. The Weibull parameters were chosen to reflect an initial annual cardiovascular risk of about 2% among type 2 diabetes, which rose during follow-up with increasing age and duration of diabetes.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> We chose a common &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.22 for all subjects, &#x003bb;<sub>0</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.024 for untreated compliers, and &#x003bb;<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x003bb;<sub>0</sub>*HR for treated compliers, where HR was the true causal HR comparing treatment with control and took on values of 0.9, 1, or 1.3 (see Appendix 3a-3c (available online) for supplemental analyses when HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1 or 1.2).

The causal HR of the treatment for compliers cannot be directly estimated because compliers cannot all be identified (explained above). However, because never-takers assigned to the treatment arm can be identified, their proportion and Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival function can both be estimated. Likewise, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival function for treated compliers can be estimated from the treatment arm. The survival function for untreated compliers can then be derived under an assumed HR. Given all these, the expected number of events on the control arm can be predicted using the mixture of survival functions of never-takers and untreated compliers. The solution for the causal HR is found iteratively by matching the predicted with the observed number of events on the control arm.</p><p>The second method estimated the causal survival TR under a structural nested accelerated failure time (SNAFT) model.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Suppose the observed event time for a patient was t&#x02009;=&#x02009;t<sub>0</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;t<sub>1</sub>, where t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>1</sub> were the lengths of time that the patient spent off and on treatment before the event, respectively.

We only present results from C-PROPHET under this scenario because the HR was directly estimated (not converted from TR) and because variance from C-PROPHET was uniformly smaller than (although similar in magnitude to) that from the SNAFT method in our simulations and in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> For partial compliance or treatment cross-over, only the SNAFT method was applicable and applied.</p><p>We ran 1000 simulations (hypothetical trial data generation and analysis) under each combination of the parameters and summarized results across these 1000 sets of analyses. All simulations were conducted in STATA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, v12.1, College Station, Texas. HR point estimates and confidence limits from ITT and causal survival analyses were summarized on the natural-log (denoted &#x0201c;ln&#x0201d;) scale by mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, as well as minimum and maximum. Bias in point estimates was defined as the difference between the mean of ln(estimated HR) and ln(true HR). For simplicity and for practical purposes, bias of small magnitude (absolute value &#x02264;0.009) from the simulations was considered as negligible. For example, when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, any estimated HR between 0.991 and 1.009 would meet this condition with a relative bias of &#x0003c;1% on the original HR scale.

Both ITT and causal upper bound were &#x0003c;1.3 in roughly 3% of simulations. Therefore, when treatment truly elevated risk of MACE above the threshold of 1.3, as set forth by regulatory guidelines, ITT could show this by estimating upper bound as &#x02265;1.3 with a high probability. Causal analysis shows this above and beyond ITT (when ITT upper bound is &#x0003c;1.3) by up to an additional 12% of the time (RR<sub>n</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), so that the chance of passing the regulatory hurdle, despite having a true HR of 1.3, was roughly 3%. In contrast, when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, ITT and causal upper bound were both &#x02265;1.3 in roughly 10% of the 1000 simulations, while causal upper bound was &#x02265;1.3 and ITT upper bound was &#x0003c;1.3 for 36% (RR<sub>n</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and 21% (RR<sub>n</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) of the times. Therefore, even when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, causal analysis alone could suggest an unacceptable risk of MACE for the treatment 46% of the time (RR<sub>n</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2). When the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9, ITT upper bound is &#x02265;1.3 in less than 2% of the simulations, while causal upper bound is &#x02265;1.3 and ITT upper bound is &#x0003c;1.3 in 20% (RR<sub>n</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and 7% (RR<sub>n</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) of simulations. Therefore, when treatment actually lowered the risk of MACE, the chance of causal or ITT upper bound of &#x02265;1.3 was not excessively high (although 20% is non-trivial).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section12-1740774515572352"><title>Discussion</title><p>We evaluated the potential impact of noncompliance in randomized trials on safety upper bound evaluation, using simulations to reflect common scenarios in cardiovascular safety studies for type 2 diabetes drug development. For sufficiently powered studies, the probability of correctly excluding upper bound of 1.3 by ITT analysis was good when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3 in most of these scenarios. Although causal survival analysis consistently estimated the true HR, the variance was large and the probability of suggesting upper bound of &#x02265;1.3 was high, especially when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.</p><p>Although causal survival analysis improved safety upper bound exclusion above ITT when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3, it could lead to &#x0201c;over-correction&#x0201d; with a large probability of causal upper bound of &#x02265;1.3 when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1. This mainly resulted from a large variance of the causal analysis methods. Part of this large variance may be explained by the reduced sample size of compliers for inferring complier-treatment effects, but part of it may be inherent in the methods themselves. The relative contribution of these sources is unknown, and we are not aware of an established minimum variance that can be achieved for the causal estimators in general, except under particular settings.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Although the variance of causal upper bound estimates was similar when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 to that when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3 (other parameters equal), the practical impact on the percentage of times causal upper bound is &#x02265;1.3 when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 is a legitimate concern. A &#x0201c;ceiling&#x0201d; effect might explain this different impact, with more &#x0201c;room&#x0201d; (i.e. percentage) left for causal estimates to disagree with ITT when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 than when the true HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3. Although a relative large variance, by itself, would not preclude application of a method, the usual trade-off between variance and bias needs careful consideration. Further research is warranted to try to reduce the variance associated with bias correction.</p><p>Our observation of the large variance in the causal inference estimates is consistent with previous studies. For example, instrumental variable (IV) estimates were shown to have a larger variance compared with per protocol or as-treated analyses.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Although we did not consider covariate adjustment (not yet implemented in the C-PROPHET or SNAFT STATA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> modules), it can reduce bias and improve precision for both causal and alternative methods.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p>We took the principal stratification approach<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> to noncompliance in clinical trials because our focus was potential harmful effects on compliers. However, this approach has its limitations, for example, the compliers are generally not distinguishable from always-/never-takers in observed data.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Some simplifying assumptions may also be needed for its application. For example, we assumed that standard type 2 diabetes therapies had no effects on MACE (at least for the trial duration) so that the active treatment can be compared with a common reference level. This assumption may hold approximately because standard type 2 diabetes therapies have not demonstrated significant cardio-protective effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> If one is convinced of any differential effects among these standard therapies on the risk of MACE, additional principal strata may be necessary to account for never-takers who take these different standard therapies or none at all. Although the assumption of no defiers appears to be suitable for most diabetes trials, Bayesian inference methods<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> may be applied in situations when there are defiers.</p><p>Other causal inference methods to address trial noncompliance may include IV survival analysis,<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> iterative parameter estimation algorithm,<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and parametric randomization-based methods.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Some of these methods have been compared with the two methods (C-PROPHET and SNAFT) employed here by simulations for addressing treatment switching<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and time-varying noncompliance<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> in randomized trials. The choice of a particular method should take into consideration the type of noncompliance, distributional assumptions, and bias&#x02013;variance trade-off, as well as other relevant issues. If the overall average causal treatment effect is of interest, linear programming methods can be used to derive nonparametric bounds in clinical trials with noncompliance.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> We employed the two methods based on their relatively simple assumptions (both taking advantage of baseline randomization to address noncompliance) and ease of implementation.

The SNAFT model is semi-parametric and can model various distributions including log-normal, log-logistic, inverse Gaussian, and gamma. We did not consider these alternative distributions, but note that underlying assumptions for any particular distribution should be checked and alternatives sought if violations of the assumptions (e.g. proportional hazards) are of concern. We did not consider additional complexities in causal survival analysis, such as treatment-by-covariate interaction,<sup><xref rid="bibr45-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> switching to non-trial treatment,<sup><xref rid="bibr46-1740774515572352" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> non-administrative censoring and other reasons for discontinuation (e.g. rescue therapy, intolerance or adverse events), more than two dosing and/or treatment arms (including active comparators), and missing data.
