Ephedrine and phenylephrine are individually used to prevent maternal hypotension; however, each has its own drawbacks. Some researchers have reported that the infusion of combined ephedrine and phenylephrine immediately after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery reduces the incidence of maternal hypotension. Other studies have indicated that the combination is not superior to the infusion of an individual agent. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of prophylactic infusion of ephedrine and phenylephrine before the induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean section on maternal hemodynamic. In a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial study, 90 pregnant women that underwent elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were recruited. Before the spinal anesthesia, the infusion of combined ephedrine and phenylephrine during 15 minutes (study group) or serum NaCl 0.9% (placebo group) was performed. Hemodynamic parameters and fetal blood gas were recorded. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software, version 16.0. The results showed that hypotension and bradycardia after spinal anesthesia were less in the study group. The need for vasopressors and inotropes to treat hypotension, nausea, and vomiting were higher in the placebo group. First- and fifth-minute Apgar scores were higher in the study group. The prophylactic infusion of low-dose ephedrine and phenylephrine before spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery can be used to decrease the frequency and severity of maternal hypotension and its side effects to the mother and neonate.

</p><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypotension is the most common complication of neuraxial anesthesia in obstetric patients<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and its prevalence in cesarean section is about 50-90%.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Maternal hypotension causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest. Hypotension may reduce placental perfusion and result in fetal acidosis and neurological injury.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Several techniques have been proposed to prevent hypotension.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Ephedrine has been used as the agent of choice in the prevention and treatment of hypotension following spinal anesthesia in pregnant women. However, recently, there have been concerns regarding its use because of complications such as supraventricular tachycardia, tachyphylaxis, and the probability of fetal acidosis.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Phenylephrine (a strong &#x003b1;-agonist of sympathetic receptors) can be used for the prevention and treatment of maternal hypotension. It reduces the incidence of nausea and vomiting as well as fetal acidosis, but it may cause maternal bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. Therefore, the use of phenylephrine, especially for prophylaxis of hypotension, is uncommon.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action lowers the amount of each drug, thus the undesired effects are minimized.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of prophylactic infusion of a combined ephedrine and phenylephrine on maternal hemodynamic before the induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. This topic was motivated by the fact that there have been no investigations evaluating the effect of vasopressors before spinal injection. In previous studies, the drugs were administered after spinal injection. Furthermore, there are dissimilar results on the infusion of combined ephedrine and phenylephrine after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section if maternal hypotension and fetal acidosis occur.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was performed in Al-Zahra Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (Tabriz, Iran) from May 2014 to February 2015. In total, 90 full-term pregnant women with ASA class I-II were recruited. The sample size was calculated using the incidence of hypotension as the primary outcome. A sample size of 42 pregnant women per group was required to achieve 80% power at 5% significance level to detect 40% difference in hypotension rate between the two groups. To allow for potential dropouts, 90 patients aged 18-40 years were recruited. Using the simple random method, the patients were randomly allocated into two groups (n=45 each), namely the study group and placebo group.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were full-term pregnant women, 18-40 years of age, ASA class I-II, and scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were pre-existing or pregnancy-induced hypertension (BP&#x0003e;140/90 mmHg), systemic or psychological diseases, known fetal abnormality, emergency cesarean section, any medical contraindication to spinal anesthesia, allergy to local anesthetics, and the use of vasopressors before the operation.</p><p>Patients with 8-hour fast did not receive premedication. Standard monitoring was established in the operating room, women rested in the supine position with left uterine displacement, and baseline blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and HR were measured and recorded. Then, two 18-gauge intravenous cannulas were sited. Each patient received a 10 mL/kg IV infusion of Ringer&#x02019;s solution for 15 minutes before spinal anesthesia. At the same time (i.e. during the administration of serum) and before spinal anesthesia, the infusion of 20 mL automated syringe was started in patients with the rate of 60 mL/h. The syringe in group 1 (study group, n=45) contained ephedrine 10 mg plus phenylephrine 125 mcg that had reached 15 mL with normal saline serum (NaCl 0.9%). In group 2 (placebo group, n=45) it contained only 15 mL of normal saline serum. The infusion rate of study solutions was adjusted according to the systolic blood pressure (SBP). This rate was maintained if SBP remained within 90-105% of the baseline. The rate of infusion was 30 mL/h if SBP increased within 105-120% of the baseline. The infusion was stopped if SBP increased to more than 120% of the baseline value and restarted at 60 mL/h if SBP decreased back to 90-105% of the baseline.</p><p>The dosage of vasopressors was chosen based on the study by Saravanan et al.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> All infusion solutions were prepared previously and labeled with code numbers. The patients as well as the medical student and nurses, who infused the solution and monitored vitals and other clinical signs throughout the operation, were blinded to the solutions. After the completion of fluid infusions, all patients received spinal anesthesia in a sitting position from L<sub>3-4</sub> or L<sub>4-5</sub> interspaces using a 25-gauge Quincke needle with 10 mg bupivacaine 0.5% (2 mL) and 15 &#x000b5;g fentanyl (1 cc; 10 &#x000b5;g). The total drug volume was 3.5 mL. Immediately after spinal anesthesia, all patients were positioned in the supine position with left uterine displacement. The operation began after the sensory block at dermatome T<sub>4</sub>. Oxygen was administered at the rate of 3 lit/min by a face mask until the umbilical cord was clamped. Oxytocine 20 U in Ringer&#x02019;s solution was administered after the clamping of the cord. Blood pressure was controlled every 2 minutes after spinal anesthesia until delivery and then every 5 minutes throughout the operation. Moreover, HR and SpO<sub>2</sub> were controlled throughout anesthesia. Sensory block was monitored to obtain a T<sub>4-5</sub> level of anesthesia. After delivery and clamping of the umbilical cord, 1 mL of blood was drawn from the umbilical artery for neonatal blood gas analysis. Any decrease of about 20% from baseline in BP after spinal anesthesia was treated with 100 mg phenylephrine (if associated with tachycardia) or 5 mg ephedrine otherwise. Bradycardia (maternal HR&#x0003c;50 beats/min) was treated with 0.5 mg atropine if it was not associated with hypotension. The incidence of hypotension, maximal hypotension, duration of hypotension, total dose of injected vasopressors, and neonatal outcome parameters (first- and fifth-minute Apgar scores and PH of the umbilical artery) were recorded. The occurrence of nausea or vomiting was recorded on a four-point scale (0=none, 1=mild nausea, 2=nausea requiring treatment, 3=vomiting). Nausea or vomiting with a score of &#x02265;2 was treated with 5-10 mg IV metoclopramide if untreated by vasopressors. Other collected data included the duration of operation and anesthesia (time of sensory block), total IV fluid administration, cause of cesarean, gravidity, and side effects (maternal unconsciousness and respiratory depression). Two surgeons were responsible for the operations. An anesthesiologist was responsible for the anesthesia and patient monitoring, and the other anesthesiologist and an intern were responsible for recording patient information and completing the questionnaires.</p><p>Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods (mean&#x000b1;SD), frequency, and percentage. Mean difference tests for independent samples were used for quantitative variables and Chi-squared test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for qualitative variables.
