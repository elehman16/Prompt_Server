The glucose-lowering effects resulting from the inhibition of glucagon secretion and the gastric-emptying rate could be of clinical importance in type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). However, GLP-1 also reduces appetite and spontaneous food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Therefore, potential beneficial effects in terms of reduction of insulin dose, reduced risk of hypoglycemia, and improved glycemic control should be balanced against the occurrence of adverse effects (mainly nausea) and weight loss. We investigated whether 4 weeks of treatment with liraglutide, a once-daily human GLP-1 receptor analog, would reduce insulin dose while preserving or improving glycemic control and decreasing the risk of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic patients with and without residual &#x003b2;-cell function.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Ten type 1 diabetic patients with (C-peptide positive) and 20 without (C-peptide negative) residual &#x003b2;-cell function were recruited. All C-peptide&#x02013;positive patients were treated with liraglutide plus insulin for 4 weeks, whereas C-peptide&#x02013;negative patients were randomly assigned to either 4 weeks of liraglutide plus insulin or insulin alone (control subjects). We expected treatment effect to be smallest in the C-peptide&#x02013;negative group, and because eligible C-peptide&#x02013;positive patients are difficult to recruit, we only included C-peptide&#x02013;negative patients as control subjects. It was calculated that with nine patients in each group and an SD of 15%, a change in insulin dose of 30% would be detected at a 5% significance level with 80% probability. Patients were recruited through outpatient clinics; they agreed to participate and provided oral and written information, and the study was performed according to the principles of the Helsinki 2 Declaration. The following were the inclusion criteria: age 18&#x02013;50 years, BMI 18&#x02013;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, Caucasian descent, diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 40 years, remission period was assumed to be ended, no known late diabetes complications (except microalbuminuria), no use of medication known to affect glucose metabolism, or symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. Participants were excluded if screening revealed not previously recognized late diabetes complications, autonomic neuropathy (see below), anemia, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;8.5%. The study (clinical trial reg. no. NCT00993720) was surveyed by the good clinical practice unit, Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark, and approved by the Danish Medicines Agency and the Danish Data protection Board. Before entering the study, glycemic control was evaluated for 4 days with self-monitored blood glucose measurements six to seven times daily, and, if needed, insulin dose was corrected to ensure the best possible glycemic control before entering the study.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Screening procedures</title><p>Screening was performed in the morning after an overnight fast. The night before, usual long-acting insulin was injected, but no insulin was taken in the morning. Blood samples were collected for analysis of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, liver enzymes, creatinine, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, VLDL, triglycerides, islet cell antibodies, and GAD-65. Measurements of weight, height, and resting blood pressure were carried out. Autonomic neuropathy (orthostatic systolic blood pressure drop &#x0003e;20 mmHg after 0, 1, or 2 min of standing and/or a beat-to-beat variation during deep breathing of &#x0003c;10 bpm [R-R variation at electrocardiogram] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) was assessed. To determine residual &#x003b2;-cell function, blood glucose was raised to 15 mmol/L with intravenous bolus of glucose, and C-peptide was measured before and 6 min after an intravenous bolus of 1 mg glucagon injected 2 min after blood glucose was raised. Patients were classified as C-peptide negative if stimulated plasma C-peptide was below the detection limit (&#x0003c;0.03 nmol/L) and as C-peptide positive if &#x02265;0.06 nmol/L.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Insulin dose, mean blood glucose, 24-h glucose profiles, and blood samples</title><p>In week 0 and week 4, subjects carried a blinded continuous glucose-monitoring system (iPro2; Medtronic, K&#x000f8;benhavn, Denmark) for 3 days. Patients were allowed to live their daily life and followed their own individual routine for food intake and physical activity but had to reproduce meals as well as physical activity between the two study periods. Therefore, for each patient, day 1 in week 0 and day 1 in week 4 were similar with respect to meals and physical activity and so on for days 2 and 3. However, days 1, 2, and 3 were not required to be identical or comparable within or between patients. Patients kept logbook recordings of insulin injections and performed no less than seven daily blood glucose measurements. IPro2 uses a retrospective algorithm to convert sensor signal to glucose values based on self-monitored capillary blood glucose readings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Therefore, all patients received a glucose meter (Contour; Bayer Diabetes Care, Lyngby, Denmark) to ensure uniform measurements for conversion of sensor signals. Patients were requested to maintain the same level of glycemic control during the two time periods and to adjust insulin dose accordingly. Changes in mean insulin dose, mean blood glucose, 24-h glucose profiles, fasting, as well as peak postprandial blood glucose during 2 h after breakfast were evaluated from the logbook and continuous glucose-monitoring data. Hypoglycemic time, normoglycemic time, and hyperglycemic time were calculated from the 24-h glucose profiles and defined as time spent with a blood glucose &#x0003c;3.9, between 3.9 and 10, and &#x0003e;10 mmol/L, respectively. The primary end point was change in mean insulin dose, and secondary end points were changes in 24-h glucose profiles, glycemic control, mean blood glucose, and body weight between weeks 0 and 4. Blood samples were collected during weeks 0 and 4.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Randomization procedures</title><p>C-peptide&#x02013;negative patients were randomly assigned to liraglutide plus insulin or insulin alone after completion of the first continuous glucose-monitoring period.

If severe gastrointestinal adverse effects (vomiting) occurred, dose escalation was postponed or reduced until recovery. The dose of fast-acting insulin was decreased by 50% and long-acting insulin by 0&#x02013;20% at the start of liraglutide (0% if morning blood glucose was &#x0003e;7 mmol/L and up to 20% if values were lower). Insulin dose was then titrated up or down to meet a target blood glucose of 5&#x02013;7 mmol/L according to at least 7-point blood glucose profiles (before and after meals and at bedtime) for the next 3 days. All patients received a telephone follow-up once daily for the first 3 days and once in the second treatment week to ensure proper glycemic control and to record adverse effects. Patients also were allowed to adjust their insulin dose during the study, and they all received a chart with target blood glucose and suggested insulin adjustments.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Meal test and bicycle exercise test: C-peptide&#x02013;negative patients randomly assigned to liraglutide</title><p>After an overnight fast, patients consumed a mixed meal consisting of 1,303 KJ (29.2% fat, 14.3% protein, and 52.2% carbohydrates) with 200 mL water plus 300 mL coffee or tea (optional). Before the meal, patients injected their usual dose of fast-acting insulin during week 0, and during week 4 they injected the new dose (if changed) plus liraglutide. After 2 h in a recumbent position, patients performed a 45-min exercise test on a stationary bicycle ergometer. Selected workload was 50% of the maximal watt performance during a max watt test. Frequent blood samples for plasma glucose and glucagon were collected.

The major finding was a reduction in insulin dose, which was significant in both groups of patients treated with liraglutide and also compared with patients treated with insulin alone. The reduction was accompanied by unchanged time spent with blood glucose &#x0003e;10 mmol/L, whereas HbA<sub>1c</sub> and time spent with blood glucose &#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L tended to be reduced. Fast-acting insulin accounted for 63 and 85% of the reduction in insulin dose in C-peptide&#x02013;positive and &#x02013;negative patients, respectively. This is in accordance with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) in which 6 months&#x02019; treatment with exenatide in C-peptide&#x02013;positive patients with longstanding disease decreased total insulin by 13% but prandial insulin by 30% and also with a short-term study in C-peptide&#x02013;negative adolescents in which exenatide reduced glucose excursions despite a 20% reduction in insulin dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The current study also was inspired by previous short-term trials using intravenous or subcutaneous infusion of native GLP-1 in type 1 diabetic patients. In patients with low or undetectable C-peptide levels, pharmacological concentrations of GLP-1 were shown to reduce fasting plasma glucose from 13.4 to 10 mmol/L, glucagon concentration by 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and isoglycemic meal&#x02013;related insulin requirement by 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Furthermore, subcutaneous exenatide or human GLP-1 administered together with the usual dose of insulin safely improved glucose control in patients without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) as well as with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) residual &#x003b2;-cell function.</p><p>In most cases, the antidiabetes effects were accompanied by a reduction of glucagon levels and/or by delayed gastric emptying. Therefore, inhibition of gastric emptying as well as reduced glucagon levels seem to explain the glucose-regulating effects of GLP-1 during a meal, whereas the importance of residual &#x003b2;-cell function is less well defined. In the current study using liraglutide, inhibition of gastric emptying may be less important because of the development of tachyphylaxis during continuous exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>In our study, the reduction in insulin dose was larger in C-peptide&#x02013;positive patients, and two patients completely discontinued insulin treatment without loss of glycemic control. Despite reduced insulin doses, neither fasting nor peak postprandial blood glucose measurements differed significantly between weeks 0 and 4 in any group. This is in accordance with our goal of preserving the same (good) glycemic control during the two periods. However, there were weak trends of higher mean postprandial levels in C-peptide&#x02013;positive patients and of higher fasting levels in C-peptide&#x02013;negative patients treated with liraglutide. This could theoretically result from worsening of glycemic control but also, and more likely, from reduced occurrence of hypoglycemia. It may be argued that part of the reduction in insulin dose was attributed to the initial reduction in the liraglutide-treated patients. However, this is highly unlikely because all patients were optimized in insulin dose before entering the study and because insulin dose afterward was titrated up or down to meet the same target blood glucose according to careful examination of at least 7-point blood glucose measurements for 3 consecutive days immediately after start of treatment and in week 2. In C-peptide&#x02013;positive patients, HbA<sub>1c</sub> decreased from 6.6 to 6.4% and from 7.5 to 7.0% in C-peptide&#x02013;negative patients treated with liraglutide, in both instances, with a tendency for decreased hypoglycemia, but this did not change in patients treated with insulin alone. The reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> may partly result from a carry-over effect from the optimization in insulin therapy before entry. However, all patients were dose adjusted if necessary, and random assignment took place after the initial correction, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> did not change in patients treated with insulin alone.</p><p>A limitation of the current study is the lack of blinding because of unavailable placebo pen devices. However, proper blinding would have been difficult because of the necessary reduction in insulin dose (for safety reasons) in liraglutide-treated patients and because of the gastrointestinal adverse effects. The reduction in insulin dose could theoretically also result from reduction in appetite, leading to an unintended (and unreported) decrease in carbohydrate intake in week 4 or from improved insulin sensitivity. However, change in insulin dose was not correlated with weight loss.</p><p>The lack of increments in glucose-stimulated as well as glucagon-stimulated C-peptide secretion during liraglutide treatment is puzzling but is in agreement with Rother et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), in which 6 months&#x02019; treatment with exenatide did not change the &#x003b2;-cell response to arginine.</p><p>The weight loss in the liraglutide-treated patients occurred (in 18 of 19 treated patients) despite encouragements to maintain body weight, but weight loss did not correlate with BMI. Nausea and vomiting occurred only in the first 2&#x02013;3 treatment days and resolved spontaneously or subsequent to dose reduction, but patients also reported loss of appetite unrelated to nausea. Because almost all liraglutide-treated patients experienced transient gastrointestinal adverse effects, start dose should perhaps have been reduced.</p><p>We could not demonstrate a change in risk of hypoglycemia during cycling. However, in week 4, postprandial glucagon was significantly reduced but increased appropriately during exercise, when glucose levels fell; therefore, it appears that liraglutide, like GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), does not inhibit the glucagon response to decreasing glucose levels.</p><p>Four weeks&#x02019; treatment with liraglutide reduces insulin dose in type 1 diabetic patients along with improved or unaltered glycemic control. Treatment effect is larger in patients with residual &#x003b2;-cell function, and some patients may discontinue insulin treatment. Almost all patients treated with liraglutide lost weight.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
