dose of isoniazid (INH) 300 mg for six months. In Brazil, INH was formulated as 100
mg tablets. The treatment duration and the high pill burden compromised patient
adherence to the treatment. The Brazilian National Programme for Tuberculosis
requested a new 300 mg INH formulation. The aim of our study was to compare the
bioavailability of the new INH 300 mg formulation and three 100 mg tablets of the
reference formulation. We conducted a randomised, single dose, open label, two-phase
crossover bioequivalence study in 28 healthy human volunteers. The 90% confidence
interval for the INH maximum concentration of drug observed in plasma and area under
the plasma concentration vs. time curve from time zero to the last measurable
concentration &#x0201c;time t&#x0201d; was 89.61-115.92 and 94.82-119.44, respectively. The main
limitation of our study was that neither adherence nor the safety profile of multiple
doses was evaluated. To determine the level of INH in human plasma, we developed and
validated a sensitive, simple and rapid high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry method. Our results showed that the new formulation was
bioequivalent to the 100 mg reference product. This finding supports the use of a
single 300 mg tablet daily strategy to treat latent TB. This new formulation may
increase patients&#x02019; adherence to the treatment and quality of life.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>latent tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>isoniazid</kwd><kwd>bioavailability</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>HPLC-MS/MS method</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The greatest public health goal in tuberculosis (TB) control is stopping the transmission
of Koch bacilli. The most efficient approach to stop transmission is treating infectious
cases using an appropriate drug regimen. However, this approach does not benefit patients
who have already been infected and present with latent TB infection. An important secondary
objective towards eliminating TB is treating patients with latent infection who are at high
risk of developing TB disease and becoming infectious. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">IUATCP 1982</xref>, WHO 2012a) TB is a co-morbidity associated with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the treatment of latent TB infection in HIV
epidemic areas is essential (WHO 2012b).</p><p>In the 1950s, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Horwitz et al. (1966)</xref> evaluated
isoniazid (INH) as TB prophylaxis in a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled
clinical trial in Greenland. The results demonstrated a reduced incidence of active
infection in the treated arm after six years of follow-up. However, they concluded that
chemoprophylaxis recommendations should be restricted to selected population groups (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Horwitz et al. 1966</xref>).</p><p>The results of subsequent clinical studies support that 300 mg INH treatment for one year
is effective at preventing the progression of latent TB to active infection (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Comstock 1962</xref>, Bush Jr et al. 1965, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Del Castillo et al. 1965</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Egsmose et al. 1965</xref>, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akolo et al. 2010</xref>).
In 1982, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases published a study
comparing six, nine and 12 months of treatments with a five-year follow up of 28,000
patients (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">IUATCP 1982</xref>). This study supports the
reduction of chemoprophylaxis to six months, especially given the improved adherence to the
proposed six months of treatment. The Brazilian guidelines for the treatment of latent TB
recommend 5-10 mg per kg weight with a 300 mg maximum dose for at least six months (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">PNCT 2011</xref>). Selected populations should be exposed to
INH if there are risk factors for the progression to active TB disease. Thus,
chemoprophylaxis is recommended in the following situations: immunodeficiency or under
immunosuppressive treatment, age under two years and above 60 years and malnutrition.
Chemoprophylaxis for patients with HIV infection is especially highlighted (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">PNCT 2011</xref>).</p><p>Reduced immunocompetence in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients increases
the risk of reactivation of a remote TB infection. A study conducted with Haitian subjects
who were likely infected with TB during childhood showed that AIDS was related to the
progression to active TB in 60% of the cases (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Pitchenik et
al. 1984</xref>).</p><p>If left untreated, most HIV patients with a positive purified protein derivative test will
progress to active disease. The therapeutic recommendation for this population is wider
than the other groups because they have a higher risk of mortality and a higher risk of
becoming infectious (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">MS/SVS/PN DST/aids 2008</xref>).</p><p>In Brazil, the governmental national control programmes supply highly active
anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and anti-TB drugs free of charge to the population. Until
now, INH has only been available as 100 mg tablets in the country. The number of necessary
tablets to complete the recommended six months of treatment may compromise patient
adherence to the treatment (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">WHO 2003</xref>). This issue is
even more serious in HIV patients on HAART because they already have a high pill burden.
For these reasons, the Brazilian National Programme for Tuberculosis (PNCT) requested the
development of a new 300 mg INH formulation. This new formulation provides an important
pill burden reduction to Brazilian patients (from 540-180 tablets for the whole treatment).
This reduction may have a considerable impact on patient adherence to INH.</p><p>We conducted this study to support the registration of the new product by the Brazilian
regulatory agency. The aim of the study was to compare the bioavailability of the new INH
300 mg formulation manufactured by Institute of Drug Technology (Farmanguinhos)/Oswaldo
Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) and three 100 mg tablets of the reference formulation. As a
secondary objective, we assessed the tolerability of a single dose of the formulations.</p><sec><title>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>
<italic>Clinical protocol</italic> - The protocol for this trial is available as
<inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="0074-0276-mioc-110-4-0543-suppl01.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d35e194" content-type="local-data">Supplementary
data</inline-supplementary-material>. The clinical study protocol and informed
consent were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee at the University of
Campinas (CAAE 3652.0.000.146-08). This committee is accredited by the Brazilian
National Council on Ethics in Research of the Ministry of Health. The clinical study was
conducted in accordance with the Helsinky Declaration revised in 2000, Good Clinical
Practice (ICH 1996), Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401 1998) and Brazilian legislation (RES 196/96/MS/CNS 1996, RES
251/97/MS/CNS 1997, RES 1170/06/MS/CNS 2006). Written informed consent was obtained for
every subject prior to enrolment. All of the subjects were informed about the nature of
the trial, the possible risks and that they were free to withdraw their consent of
participation at any time. The investigators and study staff observed the
confidentiality of the records. The clinical part of the study was conducted at the
Synchrophar clinical unit at Irm&#x000e3;os Penteado Hospital, Campinas, state of S&#x000e3;o Paulo,
Brazil, which is accredited by the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA).</p><p>The trial was designed as a single centre, randomised, single dose, open label, fasting,
two-phase crossover bioequivalence study with an washout period of seven days (&#x0003e; 7
half-life). The trial was registered at the Brazilian National Information System of
Pharmaceutical Equivalence and Bioequivalence studies (SINEB) (registry CEF 03/08) and
in the clinicaltrials.gov database (registry NCT02043314). The authors confirm that all
of the ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were predefined as follows: healthy men and women, aged between
18-50 years and body-mass-index (BMI) between 18.5-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The exclusion
criteria included known hypersensitivity to INH, pregnancy, use of other drugs other
than contraceptives, health problems, alcohol or drug abuse and any other condition that
could alter absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of INH.</p><p>
<italic>Study procedures</italic> - The study participants were recruited and enrolled
from the study volunteers&#x02019; pool at Synchrophar. All of the volunteers met the inclusion
and the exclusion criteria defined in the study protocol. Healthy volunteers were
considered to be eligible for the study based on medical history, demographic data,
medication history, physical examination and clinical laboratory tests [haematology,
biochemistry, urinalysis, HIV and hepatitis B and C, parasitological faeces test, &#x003b2;-HCG
(female subjects before each administration of study drugs and post study) and a 12-lead
electrocardiogram].</p><p>The volunteers were recruited and included in the study on the 21 October 2008, the
second phase was conducted after the washout period of seven days and the follow-up
adverse event (AE) evaluation was conducted 10 days after the last blood collection. The
Labsefar statistician performed the randomisation. Each subject was assigned to one of
two study treatment sequences (RT or TR). The trial was open label and thus no blinding
was needed. After 10 h of fasting overnight, each subject received either the test
formulation (INH 300 mg manufactured by Farmanguinhos - batch 06102382) or three tablets
of the reference formulation (INH 100 mg manufactured by Aeronautics Chemical and
Pharmaceutical Laboratory - batch 07090034). The study drugs were administered with 200
mL of mineral water. Mouth checks were performed following drug administration to ensure
ingestion of each dose. Subjects continued to fast until after 4 h after the
administration and controlled meals were served afterwards. Fluid intake was allowed
<italic>ad libitum</italic> until 6 h before dosing and 2 h after dosing.</p><p>Serial blood samples for the pharmacokinetic assessments were collected over a period
that was greater than three half-lives at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose 30 min
before dosing), 0:20, 0:40, 1, 1:20, 1:40, 2, 2:30, 3, 3:30, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h
after oral administration of each treatment. Blood samples (7.5 mL each) were drawn into
heparinised tubes for further processing. Immediately after blood collection, the tube
was inverted by hand to ensure thorough mixing with the anticoagulant and centrifuged
for 10 min at 3,000 rpm (+4&#x000ba;C). After centrifugation, the plasma samples were
immediately transferred to separate appropriately labelled plastic cryotubes and stored
at -25&#x000ba;C until analysis.</p><p>AEs were assessed either by periodic physical examination or by clinical laboratory
tests at baseline and at the end of the study. Registration of AEs included duration,
severity, intensity and causality relationship with the drug as well as the outcome.
Neither serious deviation nor violation of the study protocol occurred.</p><p>

</p><p>
<italic>Drug analysis</italic> - The analytical part of the study was performed from 11
December 2008-14 January 2009. The statistical analysis was performed from 11 December
2008-16 March 2009. The study was finalised in March 2009.</p><p>
<italic>Chemicals and reagents</italic> - The INH reference standard and fluconazole
(FLC) [internal standard (IS)] were identified and supplied by the United States
Pharmacopoeia (USA). Methanol, acetonitrile and isopropanol were of chromatographically
pure grade and the formic acid was of analytical grade. All of the chemicals were
purchased from T&#x000e9;dia Company (USA). Ultra purified water (type I) was separated and used
for preparing the solutions and the mobile phase study.</p><p>
<italic>Instrumentation and operating conditions</italic> - Liquid chromatography was
performed using a Varian System (USA) equipped with two Varian 212-LC pumps. A CTC
Analytics HTS auto-injector was used. Chromatographic separation was conducted using an
Inertsil Sil 100A (5 &#x003bc;m, 50 x 2.1 mm I.D.) column at an ambient temperature. The mobile
phase consisted of a mixture of the following two solutions: (i) water containing formic
acid 0,046% and (ii) isopropanol-acetonitrile. The composition of the mobile phase was
20A/80B v/v and was set at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.</p><p>The mass spectrometric detection was performed using a Varian 310-MS quadrupole LC-MS/MS
system (USA) equipped with an electrospray ion source and operated in the positive
ionisation mode. The ion spray voltage and source temperature were 3,000 V and 400&#x000ba;C,
respectively. The parameters for the other gas source were set, as follows: drying gas
20 psi, nebulizer gas 55 psi and collision induced dissociation 2.00 mTorr.
Quantification was performed using multiple reaction monitoring of the fragmentation
transitions m/z 138.50&#x02192;121.30 for INH and m/z 307.30&#x02192;238.00 for FLC (IS) (Figs 2, 3).
Data acquisition and analysis were achieved using the Varian MS Workstation software
v.6.6 (USA).</p><p>
<italic>Preparation of stock and work solutions</italic> - The stock solution of INH was
prepared at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL in ultrapure water. Stock solutions of FLC (IS)
were prepared only in methanol/water - 50/50 - v/v at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. All
of the solutions were stored at -25&#x000ba;C.</p><p>The standard working solutions of INH analytes were prepared in 200, 400, 1,000, 2,000,
4,000, 10,000 and 15,000 ng/mL concentrations. They were obtained by serial dilution of
the stock solution with ultrapure water. Quality control (QC) working solutions of INH
in 200, 400, 4,000 and 10,000 ng/mL concentrations were similarly prepared as the
standard working solution. The working IS solution containing 1,000 ng/mL of FLC was
prepared in methanol/water - 50/50 - v/v by diluting the stock solutions. When not in
use, all of the solutions were stored at -25&#x000ba;C in an amber glass bottle.</p><p>
<italic>Sample preparation</italic> - QCs, calibration curve and clinical plasma samples
were extracted using a precipitation extraction technique. A 0.10 mL aliquot of the
collected plasma sample from healthy volunteers, QCs or calibration curve was pipetted
into a 2 mL polypropylene tube. The working solution of the IS (1,000 ng/mL) and 0.4 mL
of acetonitrile were added and then vortexed for 1 min. Then, the samples were
centrifuged at 14,400 rpm for 5 min at +4&#x000ba;C. The organic layer was transferred to
another 2 mL polypropylene tube, 0.1 mL ultrapure water and formic acid 0.046% were
added and the mixture was vortexed for 30 s. An aliquot of 0.3 mL was transferred to
vial glasses and 10 &#x000b5;L was injected into the LC-MS/MS system.</p><p>
<italic>Method validation</italic> - The validation process was conducted according to
guidance (Bioanalytical Method Validation) provided by the US Food Drug Administration
(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">FDA 2001</xref>). This guidance is in accordance
with resolution 899 of 23 May 2003 by the ANVISA (ANVISA 2003b).</p><p>Selectivity was assessed by comparing chromatograms of six different batches of blank
human plasma with the corresponding spiked human plasma. In this test, no significant
interference was detected in the retention times of the analyte and the IS. Intra and
inter-day precision [the relative standard deviation (RSD)] and accuracy (the relative
error) were determined by analysing low, medium and high QC samples (n = 8) on three
different days. The extraction recovery was determined by comparing the mean peak areas
of eight extracted samples at low, medium and high QC concentrations with the mean peak
areas of Spike after the extraction samples.</p><p>Stability was assessed by analysing the replicates (n = 8) of the low and high QC
samples during sample storage and processing procedures. The freeze-thaw stability was
determined after four freeze-thaw cycles. Post-preparation stability was estimated by
analysing QC samples at 24 h at +4&#x000ba;C. Six aliquots of QC samples were stored at -20&#x000ba;C
for 63 days and at ambient temperature for 6 h to determine long-term and short-term
stability, respectively.</p><p>
<italic>Pharmacokinetics analysis</italic> - Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with
the data from subjects who completed both periods of the study using the
WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software v.5.01 (Pharsight Co, USA). Concentration values below
the quantification limit (100 ng/mL) at the initial absorption or at the terminal
elimination phase were considered to be zero. Missing values were not included in the
pharmacokinetic evaluation calculation.</p><p>The following pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated: maximum concentration of drug
observed in plasma (C<sub>max</sub>), area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve
from time zero to the last measurable concentration &#x0201c;time t&#x0201d; (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>)
calculated using a linear trapezoidal method, area under the plasma concentration vs.
time curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>) calculated as where
cycle threshold is the last concentration of the drug, the time required to reach
maximum concentration of drug in plasma (T<sub>max</sub>), elimination rate constant,
Lambda_z and the time it took the plasma concentration to reduce to 50% during the
elimination phase. A noncompartmental method was used to estimate the pharmacokinetic
parameters.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the plasma concentrations using a
noncompartmental method for INH. The area under the curve was obtained by the linear
trapezoidal method. The C<sub>max</sub> and the T<sub>max</sub> were obtained by
directly reading the concentration results.</p><p>
<italic>Statistical analysis</italic> - Summary statistics were calculated for the
concentration-time data of the test and reference products for all of the
pharmacokinetic parameters, including the arithmetic mean [mean, SD, coefficient of
variation (CV), minimum (min), maximum (max) and median].</p><p>The bioequivalence acceptance interval was set at 80-125% as required by the regulatory
agency (ANVISA 2003b). The 90% confidence interval (CI) of the test/reference mean ratio
of INH was computed for the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of
C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>. The ANOVA model included
the following factors: sequence, subject with sequence, period and treatment.</p><p>

<italic>Drug analysis</italic> - INH is a hydrophilic compound that is easily eluted
from a normal reversed phase C18 column. Therefore, to chromatically resolve these
compounds, we used a highly mobile phase and an Inertsil Sil 100A (5 &#x003bc;m, 50 x 2.1 mm
I.D.) column that provided appropriate retention and selectivity for polar
compounds.</p><p>The best analysis conditions were achieved using a mixture of solutions, including (i)
water containing formic acid 0.046% and (ii) isopropanol-acetonitrile. This mixture
provided a good chromatographic peak shape of the analyte and the IS as well as their
elution in a short period of analysis when compared with literature (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Panchagnula et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2007</xref>). The extraction method by precipitation with
acetonitrile was adequate for the study. However, the analyst chose to perform a
procedure of division in the acquisition of masses at the beginning of the analysis up
to 0.5 min to eliminate potential contaminants that could suppress the signal when in
contact with the ion source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig. 4</xref>). The
linearity of the method set from the LLQ of 100 ng/mL to the upper limit of 7,500 ng/mL
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table III</xref>) was sufficient to define the
pharmacokinetic parameters of the study. The linearity limits of the bioanalytical
method were defined based on published data of the bioavailability of INH.</p><p>

<italic>Tolerability analysis</italic> - Fourteen volunteers (50%) presented with 25
AEs. The most frequent AEs were anaemia or low haemoglobin levels (9 cases) and headache
(8 cases). These events might be related to study procedures as the sample collection.
The distribution of AEs was similar between the reference and test groups, as follows:
12 AEs were reported after the administration of the reference formulation and 13 were
reported after the test dosing formulation. Symptomatic treatment was prescribed in nine
cases. Causality was defined as probable in 14 cases, possible in six cases and
unrelated in five cases. No serious AEs were reported during the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This manuscript addresses a new treatment approach for latent TB that is highly relevant
for clinical practice in Brazil. Because there have been no radical innovations for TB
treatment for a long time, incremental innovations are important to increase patients&#x02019;
quality of life. Public health policies that reduce pill burden have been recommended to
simplify treatments (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blomberg et al. 2001</xref>)
increase compliance and even prevent the emergence of resistance (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison 1998</xref>). A well-known approach is the use of fixed dose
combinations (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blomberg et al. 2001</xref>). Because the
new formulation will reduce pill burden compared to the old formulation, it is expected
to improve care by simplifying treatment.</p><p>The main limitation of our study is that neither adherence nor multiple doses safety
profile was evaluated. However, an increased risk of AEs is not expected because the
daily and total dose of treatment remains the same. The bioavailability results confirm
that exposure to the drug using the old formulation and the new formulation is
equivalent.</p><p>For this bioequivalence study, a sensitive, simple and rapid high-performance liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to determine INH levels in human plasma
was developed and validated. The described method showed good specificity, precision,
accuracy and linearity over the range of 100-7,500 mg/mL for INH. This method provided a
simple sample preparation using protein precipitation with acetonitrile. The established
LLQ of 100 ng/mL for INH was adequate to determine concentrations in human plasma during
the pharmacokinetic study. No significant interferences caused by endogenous compounds
were observed.</p><p>The stability tests demonstrated that the INH analyte showed no signs of degradation
when present in the biological matrix under plasma conditions of storage and analysis in
short and long term. The developed method using tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated
the advantage of a short run time and high selectivity for application to high
throughput analysis. Contrary to usual practice, this analytical method is thoroughly
reported in this paper. Researchers will benefit from this simple method, which can be
used to explore the pharmacokinetic aspects of INH in future research studies, clinical
practice and therapeutic drug monitoring.</p><p>By applying this method, the new formulation of INH 300 mg has been shown to be
bioequivalent to three tablets of the 100 mg reference product. This new product in
Brazil may increase adherence to treatment for latent TB. In 2013, the PNCT made the
standard dose formulation recommended worldwide available to Brazilians. While the new
formulation is made available in the country, the medical community needs to be aware of
the new treatment strategy adopted by the PNCT, namely a single tablet of 300 mg INH
daily for six months. Increasing medical awareness is important to avoid medication
errors when prescribing INH because the wrong use of the new formulation could lead to a
higher frequency of AEs. Further pharmacovigilance studies may explore the misuse of INH
formulations.</p><p>This bioequivalence study reports important data on the pharmacokinetics of INH to
consider including INH as a Class I drug in the Biopharmaceutical Classification System
(BCS). The BCS may avoid unnecessary exposure of healthy human volunteers to clinical
trials. The BCS may also lower the costs of developing generic products and improve the
population&#x02019;s access to these products. INH has been regarded as a product that can be
considered as a biowaiver, i.e., a product can be approved in a regulatory agency based
on in vitro dissolution tests rather than requiring bioequivalence studies in human
subjects (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lindenberg et al. 2004</xref>). However,
regulatory agencies have been refusing this approach because standard permeability tests
have not been defined. The historic series of bioequivalence studies have been the
actual gold standard to define the permeability of a product. In 2011, the Brazilian
regulatory agency published a list of biowaivers that included INH (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">ANVISA 2011</xref>). This study may provide additional
support for this decision that can lower the costs of future INH formulation
developments. These results could also support the acceptance of INH as a biowaiver by
regulatory agencies worldwide.</p><p>This bioavailability study demonstrates that the new formulation of INH 300 mg and three
100 mg tablets of the reference formulation are interchangeable. The study led to the
registration of the new product by the Brazilian regulatory agency. By increasing
patient adherence to the treatment, it is expected that the new formulation will improve
patient care for latent TB.</p><p>The analytical method reported provides a sensitive, simple and rapid way of measuring
INH in human plasma that will help future research on INH worldwide.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>To all the volunteers that participated in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akolo</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Adetifa</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Shepperd</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Volmink</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><year>2010</year><article-title>Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in HIV
