Many women have distinct areas (subregions) of the face, chest, neck, or hands, which may make them look older than they are chronologically. Conversely, they may have other subregions that are perceived to be more consistent with their actual age. This situation may be compounded by the absence of reliable methodologies for the evaluation of skin surface and volume changes associated with aging, potentially resulting in inconsistencies in diagnoses and indeed, in what esthetic treatments are administered. A new patient education software program, called &#x0201c;HOYS&#x0201d; for <italic>Home of Younger Skin</italic>, has been developed with the objective of creating an individualized and reproducible consultation, empowering patients to make informed treatment decisions for their facial and extrafacial correction/rejuvenation, in coalition with their health care practitioner.</p><p>The HOYS program has two potential independent audiences: the patient (and their esthetic physician) and the clinical investigator. For the patient, HOYS is specifically designed for the self-evaluation of their facial and environmentally exposed extrafacial features. As the patients complete the program, they will educate themselves on the age-related changes encountered by women from their twenties to their sixties through viewing a series of representative digital images. These images characterize age-related changes in skin surface and volume at a total of 35 defined areas (subregions) of the human face, at rest or during movement. Each of these 35 subregions is depicted by five images from a &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; patient at the ages of 25, 35, 45, 55, or 65 years, reflecting five grades of aging or &#x0201c;severity&#x0201d; of the particular feature, presented in a Likert scale. The first program profile was designed for Caucasian females.</p><p>During the administration of HOYS, patients look at their image in a mirror while using a web-based application of the program, selecting the representative image that most closely matches their own appearance for the particular subregion under examination. The program is automated, thus allowing the patients to navigate through this assessment at their own pace, following the various prompts. At the conclusion of the program, the images and associated grades identified by the patients as closest to their own appearance will generate a report detailing the &#x0201c;skin age&#x0201d; for each of these seven regions, which are underpinned by the 35 subregions. These seven regions encompass the upper face, which is divided into two regions (forehead and temples, and the periorbital region); the midface; the perioral/lower face; and the extrafacial regions of neck, d&#x000e9;colletage, and hands. A total skin age score is also generated, which is a composite of these seven regions. A treatment prioritization list is created by the HOYS program based on the degree of divergence of the age or &#x0201c;grade&#x0201d; assigned by the patient for each of the regions, relative to what is expected for a woman of the same chronologic age as defined by the program utilizing a proprietary algorithm. This forms the basis for a clinical treatment plan to be used by the patient&#x02019;s physician in a subsequent consultation with the patient.</p><p>As the HOYS program generates a total skin score, as well as the skin scores for the seven constitute regions detailed above, another potential use for HOYS is in the field of clinical research. By completing the HOYS-based assessment prior to treatment intervention and then repeating this assessment post-treatment, a quantitative measure of outcome can be captured. This could be employed as a means to assess comparative efficacy following the administration of different esthetic treatments.</p><p>The photonumeric Likert scales representing the 35 subregions employed in HOYS were created by an Australian dermatologist and primary author of this report (GG), who developed these scales and the overall program following an exhaustive review of over 5000 relevant images from his medical practice. The selection and associated ranking process used in the generation of these scales is therefore open to examination, and indeed confirmation, by the dermatologist&#x02019;s peers and by allied health care professionals working in esthetic medicine. This is to ensure that the scales employed in this program are in fact dependable and reproducible instruments, thereby validating the HOYS program. This was the principal objective of the study described in this report.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A group of 30 raters agreed to participate in this validation study. The raters consisted of eleven expert physicians ( dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and cosmetic physicians) and 19 non-physicians (nurses and other nonmedical clinic staff), none of whom had previously been exposed to the program and received only a brief overview immediately prior to their participation in the study.</p><p>In preparation for the study, individual image stations were positioned in two large meeting rooms. Each station consisted of an A2-sized display board with five digital images (160 mm &#x000d7; 120 mm) from the photonumeric Likert scales for the 35 subregions employed in the actual HOYS program. For selected subregions, additional stations were utilized to represent supplementary aspects of the same area during facial animation (ie, smiling, frowning, squinting, raising eyebrows, pursing lips, or contracting neck muscles) to mimic the HOYS program, resulting in a total of 43 stations. (A list of the HOYS subregions represented on the 43 image stations is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ccid-5-023">Table 1</xref>). The images were positioned in random order on each display board, based on a block randomization of five, with the assigned labeling of A&#x02013;E. In one case, a display board had a total of ten images, representing juxtaposed lateral and frontal images of eyelashes for each of the five age ranges, with the same A&#x02013;E labeling and block randomization applied.</p><p>The raters were asked to sequentially rank the images at each station: (1) representing the youngest skin age and (5) the oldest. This was documented on a case report form (CRF) identified by the rater&#x02019;s ID (initials and date of birth). They were asked to complete this ranking exercise for all 43 stations, spending a maximum of 1 minute at each, and were not to discuss their rankings with their colleagues. Each rater then returned the completed CRF to the study coordinator (Procedure 1). Without being able to review their rankings recorded during Procedure 1, each rater was asked to repeat the exercise 2 hours later using a new CRF (Procedure 2). To evaluate internal consistency, upon completion of Procedure 2, raters were then asked to return to each station and record their best guess of the age represented by a particular image, which had also been designated through a block randomization and identified by a star symbol (Procedure 3).</p><p>For the calculation of inter-rater reliability, all available data pairs were used in the analysis. Agreement between the raters&#x02019; ranking and true ranking were summarized by weighted kappa statistics and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), with the former measuring agreement beyond chance, taking into account how close the rating was to the true response. The reproducibility of raters&#x02019; responses was summarized at two time points ( Procedures 1 and 2) and via agreement between the true age groups and the estimated age groups (Procedure 3). In addition, bubble charts were used to graphically present the range of responses for Procedures 1 and 2. The data from Procedure 3 were also summarized by kappa statistics and 95% CI, comparing actual age band to the estimated age band. Furthermore, to illustrate how the program utilizes the components (subregions) of the seven regions, one of these regions, the perioral/lower face, was selected, with the raters&#x02019; ranking of the constituent subregions analyzed. This region comprises the nasolabial folds (upper lip atrophy, lip volume, upper lip wrinkles; at rest or on contraction, marionette lines, prejowl sulcus, and jaw line). The representative images of each of the aforementioned subregions, which were used in this validation study (albeit in random order), are correctly presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ccid-5-023">Figure 1(A&#x02013;G)</xref>, depicting youngest to oldest or &#x0201c;least to most severe.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inter-rater reliability assessment (all seven regions)</title><sec><title>Procedure 1</title><p>A high degree of reliability in sequencing the images for all seven regions was confirmed when assessed for all 30 raters, with a weighted kappa of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.77&#x02013;0.79). The eleven physicians (0.79; 95% CI: 0.78&#x02013;0.81) and 19 nonphysicians (0.77; 95% CI: 0.76&#x02013;0.79) ranked the images similarly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ccid-5-023">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, when analyzed separately, the seven individual regions displayed a consistent weighted kappa of between 0.74 for the neck and 0.88 for the hands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ccid-5-023">Table 3</xref>). These data are also presented graphically in a bubble chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ccid-5-023">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure 2 (Procedure 1 repeated 2 hours later)</title><p>Following a 2-hour interval, Procedure 1 was repeated, with similar results achieved: a weighted kappa of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.81&#x02013;0.83) for 28 raters (one physician and one nonphysician did not complete Procedure 2), with no differences in the ranking of the physicians (0.82; 95% CI: 0.80&#x02013;0.84) and nonphysicians (0.82; 95% CI: 0.81&#x02013;0.83) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ccid-5-023">Table 2</xref>).

The intra-rater agreement between Procedures 1 and 2 for the seven individual regions was again demonstrated, with a weighted kappa ranging between 0.66 for d&#x000e9;colletage and 0.82 for neck (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ccid-5-023">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure 3 (internal consistency: raters&#x02019; estimation of actual age)</title><p>From the analysis of the age estimates of the raters for the randomly assigned photo at each display station, a satisfactory weighted kappa of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.70&#x02013;0.74) was demonstrated, based on the ranking of all the raters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ccid-5-023">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inter- and intra-reliability assessment (perioral/lower face region constituents)</title><p>To assess for a consistency across the constituents of a particular region, the same analysis was conducted for the individual components (subregions) of the perioral/lower face region. A very consistent pattern of high inter- and intra-rater agreement was confirmed for these subregions, with a weighted kappa of 0.79 or above for the evaluation of inter-rater reliability during Procedures 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ccid-5-023">Table 4</xref>). The only exceptions to this were Upper lip wrinkling at rest in Procedure 1 (0.66; 95% CI: 0.58&#x02013;0.74) and Jaw line in Procedures 1 (0.64; 95% CI: 0.56&#x02013;0.72) and 2 (0.67; 95% CI: 0.59&#x02013;0.75). The overall intra-rater reliability was also very high, with a weighted kappa of 0.75 or greater, with the exception of Lip volume (0.69; 95% CI: 0.61&#x02013;0.77) and the Jaw line (0.66; 95% CI: 0.58&#x02013;0.75) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ccid-5-023">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Raters&#x02019; estimation of age (perioral/lower face region constituents)</title><p>A scatter graph showing the individual age estimations of the raters, plotted against the correct age for the individual components of the sample perioral/lower face region, is also presented for the constituents of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ccid-5-023">Figure 4</xref>). It also highlights the good level of accuracy and agreement between raters.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inherently, when we meet people for the first time we judge their age, or when we greet someone whom we haven&#x02019;t seen for a long time we assess how they have aged since we last met, and indeed, whether the person looks &#x0201c;young or old&#x0201d; for their age. How do we do this? It is probable that we closely analyze the features of another person&#x02019;s face subconsciously, perhaps comparing what we see against a hardwired understanding of how particular features of a person should present for any given age. The different visual clues one obtains from facial and exposed extrafacial regions of the other person may quickly provide us with the necessary information to process.</p><p>It is well established that our genetics meshed with the environment to which we are exposed ultimately determines whether our current appearance or &#x0201c;esthetic age&#x0201d; is consistent with our chronological age. That is, &#x0201c;are we aging better or worse, relative to others of the same vintage?&#x0201d; Individuals of certain ethnicities, for example, may enjoy a comparative delay in the formation of lines and wrinkles owing to a greater deposition of collagen and elastin in their skin. However, this outcome might still be significantly altered by the environment, in addition to the lifestyle of the individual, with the potential for skin changes to occur nonuniformly. Those who smoke regularly, for example, may develop premature perioral lines due to chronic movement of the orbicular oris muscle over many years. Other individuals who have continuously squinted due to chronic exposure to bright sunlight may present with wrinkles in the lateral canthal region, which are consistent with someone several years older than their chronological age.</p><p>To address the above issues, the HOYS program was designed to facilitate a detailed self-assessment of 35 subregions representing the constituents of seven regions across the face, the neck, the d&#x000e9;colletage, and the hands. Using a proprietary algorithm, differences from one region to another can be quickly identified, with a composite (total) age score, as well as the score for each of these seven regions recorded, thus quantifying any divergence between a patient&#x02019;s esthetic and chronological age. By following this methodology, those areas that appear to have aged disproportionately (that is, accentuating the greatest imbalance in one&#x02019;s overall features) can be quickly determined. A specific treatment protocol can subsequently be employed to achieve a harmonious outcome; a departure from the practice of assessing specific features of a patient&#x02019;s face in isolation. Since these scores are generated during the patient&#x02019;s own self-evaluation, a greater understanding of the aging process at each region, and indeed, at the constituent subregions is likely to be obtained. This improved knowledge may facilitate a more active participation of the patient in any subsequent physician consultation with regard to treatment options. This might be focused on the removal of pigmentation, the correction or minimization of wrinkles and skin folds, or the restoration of lost volume or structure, amongst the myriad of rejuvenation and/or enhancement strategies available to the esthetic physician.</p><p>Many other grading scales have been described previously to rank specific facial and/or extrafacial subregions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ccid-5-023">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ccid-5-023">13</xref> In addition, several facial recognition techniques have been perfected over the years to analyze facial features and may also be programmed to document changes as a person ages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ccid-5-023">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ccid-5-023">16</xref></p><p>The HOYS program differs from these aforementioned technologies by:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Providing the patient with education on age-related changes to skin surface and volume, which is individualized. This information thereby empowers the patient to actively participate in any subsequent discussions with their esthetic physician about the diagnosis of any deficits and the rationale for the treatment recommendations.

This was also the case at the subregion level when the rankings of the constituents of the perioral/lower face were analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ccid-5-023">Table 4</xref>). The only exception to this was the ranking of the Upper lip wrinkling at rest scale in Procedure 1, although an acceptable weighted kappa of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58&#x02013;0.74) was still returned and agreement was high (0.79; 95% CI: 0.72&#x02013;0.85) for the same scale when it was ranked in Procedure 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ccid-5-023">Table 4</xref>). Moreover, the related scale; Upper lip wrinkling on contracture, had a weight kappa of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81&#x02013;0.90) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79&#x02013;0.89) for Procedures 1 and 2, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ccid-5-023">Table 4</xref>). Notably, when these animated images are paired with the equivalent images at rest, as would be the case when the &#x0201c;live&#x0201d; HOYS-based evaluation is conducted by patients, little difficulty in grading would be expected. The ranking of the Jaw line was also not as reliable as for the other subregions. However, it was still quite acceptable with a weighted kappa of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.56&#x02013;0.72) in Procedure 1, rising to 0.67 (95% CI: 0.59&#x02013;0.75) in Procedure 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ccid-5-023">Table 4</xref>). Intra-rater reliability was also high for the perioral/lower face subregions, with agreement at 0.75 or above, with the exception of Lip volume and Jaw line, although both subregions still had a very respectable weighted kappa of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61&#x02013;0.77) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58&#x02013;0.75), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ccid-5-023">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>It is evident from the bubble charts that the agreement between raters during both Procedures 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ccid-5-023">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ccid-5-023">3</xref>) was lower for the images of subjects in the mid decades of life, relative to those representing the age groups of 20&#x02013;29 and 60&#x02013;69 years. Nevertheless, a weighted kappa of 0.70 or greater was still calculated for these mid-age groups. Explanations for this phenomenon will to some degree be found in the nature of these or similar scales, with the youngest or least affected and the oldest or most affected generally easier to rate since there is no alternate choice below or above these grades, respectively. This may also reflect the relatively slower, more subtle aging processes in Caucasian females between the ages of 30&#x02013;45 years, which generally hastens thereafter with the start of menopause.</p><p>There should be a clear demarcation between the grades on the five-point Likert scales used for each subregion in the HOYS program. The results from Procedure 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ccid-5-023">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ccid-5-023">Figure 4</xref>) show a high degree of accuracy and agreement amongst the raters for age estimation, based on only a single randomized image of each of the representative subregions in this program. For many of these subregions only a small segment of the facial or extrafacial area in question is displayed in the relevant image (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ccid-5-023">Figure 1A&#x02013;G</xref>). This may be consistent with our innate ability to calculate another person&#x02019;s age from only subtle visual clues, as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the high inter- and intra-rater reliability of the rankings, as documented by both physicians and nonphysicians in this validation study, suggests that the specific five-point photonumeric scales that underpin the HOYS education program are an accurate representation of age-related changes likely to be observed in the 35 constitute subregions of seven distinct facial and exposed extrafacial regions of individuals, ranging between 20&#x02013;69 years. As a consequence, this interactive software program, designed for self-evaluation by patients, may serve as a useful scale in esthetic practices to evaluate age-related skin changes. It may also be an effective research tool to quantitatively evaluate the therapeutic effects of different esthetic treatments. Importantly, due to the individualized outputs resulting from their own self-evaluation, patients completing this program may perceive greater empowerment in any subsequent consultation with their physician on their treatment options through an improved understanding of the rationale for these treatments, and indeed, how these treatments might be prioritized to best enhance their overall appearance. This may result in logic-based treatment decisions by the patient, as these judgments may no longer be based on a particular bias that a patient or a physician may have. Such an approach may result in better treatment outcomes for patients, as evidenced by improved patient satisfaction and greater overall fiscal investment in enhancing his or her appearance. Consistent with this, a high level of patient satisfaction with the HOYS program was confirmed in a prospective, randomized, controlled study, in which esthetically orientated patients compared the utility of HOYS to a standard patient education program on age-related skin changes currently employed in many esthetic clinics throughout Australia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ccid-5-023">17</xref></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ccid-5-023"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>GG developed the HOYS program.
