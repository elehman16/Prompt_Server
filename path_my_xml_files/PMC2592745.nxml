Subgroup analyses suggested heterogeneity in the observed treatment effect for some subgroups, including those defined by baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, by protocol violation status, and by the sequence of enrollment at a study site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Within these subgroups, the observed reduction in mortality associated with DrotAA was larger for patients with higher APACHE II scores, with no violation of the protocol, and who comprised the second and subsequent patients enrolled at a study site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The latter two observations suggested that a learning curve appeared to be present within PROWESS such that the ability to demonstrate efficacy improved with increasing site experience with the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Based on subgroup analyses of PROWESS, regulatory agencies approved the use of DrotAA in patients at higher risk of death as defined, for example, by an APACHE II score of greater than or equal to 25 or multiple-organ dysfunction (MOD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As a condition for approval, the US Food and Drug Administration required the sponsor to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of DrotAA in the nonindicated population of severe sepsis patients at lower risk of death (the Administration of Drotrecogin Alfa [Activated] in Early Stage Severe Sepsis [ADDRESS] study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Based on the estimated placebo mortality rate in this lower-severity population, the ADDRESS study planned to enroll approximately 11,400 severe sepsis patients at 1,000 investigative sites in 35 countries. The ADDRESS study was prematurely terminated at the recommendation of the safety monitoring board because of a low likelihood of meeting the prospectively defined objective of demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality with DrotAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>As a potential learning curve was present in the PROWESS trial and because the ADDRESS trial would require approximately 1,000 investigative sites, many of which were without prior clinical trial experience, prospectively defined analyses were included in the ADDRESS statistical analysis plan to assess the influence of any learning curve on the observed outcomes. We report the results of these analyses and additional exploratory analyses of both the PROWESS and ADDRESS databases. We discuss the results of these analyses in the context of their implication on the design and conduct of future clinical trials in patients with severe sepsis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Both PROWESS and ADDRESS were randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy (28-day mortality) of DrotAA (Xigris<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) given as an intravenous infusion (24 &#x003bc;g/kg per hour) for 96 hours in patients with severe sepsis. Both studies were approved by the ethics committee of each individual participating center, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient or next of kin. In PROWESS, patients were at a greater risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] than in ADDRESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (placebo 28-day mortality 30.8% versus 17.0%, respectively). For ADDRESS, the study enrolled patients with severe sepsis not indicated for treatment with DrotAA under the applicable label in the country in which the patient was enrolled. Severe sepsis was defined as the presence of a known or suspected infection and at least one sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. The population indicated for DrotAA varied from country to country but was generally defined as patients with severe sepsis with MOD and/or an APACHE II score of greater than or equal to 25. Randomization was stratified by site and within site by heparin use.</p><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>In the PROWESS study, the prospectively defined analysis to assess the influence of site enrollment on the observed treatment effect was an analysis of treatment effects that potentially differed across subgroup strata (using Breslow-Day tests). Potential interactions were identified for subgroups defined by presence versus absence of a significant protocol violation (<italic>P </italic>= 0.07), original versus amended protocol (<italic>P </italic>= 0.08), and APACHE II quartile at baseline (<italic>P </italic>= 0.09). Further examination of these interactions led to <italic>post hoc </italic>analyses of within-site sequence effects, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Based on the <italic>post hoc </italic>significance of an interaction related to sequence, ADDRESS included a prospectively defined analysis to assess the influence of site enrollment on the observed treatment effect which was an analysis of 28-day mortality in the subgroups of first patients enrolled at each investigative site compared with the second and subsequent patients enrolled at each site (using Breslow-Day tests). The treatment effect was further assessed by analysis of mortality by the number of patients (1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, and more than 12 patients) enrolled per site. Chi-square tests were used to compare mortality rates between treated and placebo patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At the time of termination, 2,640 patients had been enrolled in the ADDRESS study at 516 centers in 34 countries. Mortality data at day 28 were available for 2,613 patients (placebo, n = 1,297; DrotAA, n = 1,316). There was no statistical difference between the placebo and DrotAA groups in 28-day all-cause mortality (placebo, 17.0%; DrotAA, 18.5%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.34) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Based on a prospectively defined analysis, there was a significant treatment-by-sequence of enrollment interaction for the first patient enrolled at each site compared with all subsequently enrolled patients at that site (<italic>P = </italic>0.04). Mortality at 28 days was higher for DrotAA patients compared with placebo patients in the subgroup of patients who comprised the first patients enrolled at each study site (22.3% versus 14.5%). Mortality rates were similar between treatment groups for the second and subsequent patients enrolled at each study site. Similar to what had previously been reported for PROWESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], treatment effect assessed by enrollment sequence grouped by block size (four patients per block) is listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. In ADDRESS, mortality was higher for DrotAA patients compared with placebo in the first block, similar to placebo in the second block, and lower than placebo in the third and subsequent blocks. The median number of patients enrolled per site was eight. A treatment-by-enrollment sequence was observed at both small (&#x02264;8 patients) and high (&#x0003e;8 patients) enrolling sites (data not shown).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Twenty-eight-day mortality for all patients enrolled in ADDRESS and for sequence subgroups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2">Drotrecogin alfa (activated)</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Placebo</td><td align="center">Relative risk</td><td align="center">95% CI</td><td align="center">Breslow-Day <italic>P </italic>value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td align="center">Number</td><td align="center">Died (percentage)</td><td align="center">Number</td><td align="center">Died (percentage)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">All randomly assigned patients</td><td align="center">1,316</td><td align="center">243 (18.47)</td><td align="center">1,297</td><td align="center">221 (17.04)</td><td align="center">1.08</td><td align="center">0.92, 1.28</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Patient classification</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center">0.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;First patient only</td><td align="center">260</td><td align="center">58 (22.31)</td><td align="center">249</td><td align="center">36 (14.46)</td><td align="center">1.54</td><td align="center">1.06, 2.25</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Excluding first patient</td><td align="center">1,056</td><td align="center">185 (17.52)</td><td align="center">1,048</td><td align="center">185 (17.65)</td><td align="center">0.99</td><td align="center">0.82, 1.19</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>ADDRESS, ADministration of DRotrecogin alfa (activated) in Early Stage Severe Sepsis; CI, confidence interval.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In PROWESS, a statistically significant treatment-by-enrollment interaction was also observed (<italic>P </italic>= 0.007) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

However, in ADDRESS, randomization was also stratified by baseline heparin use, so there was no uniform block size for randomization, thus the first four patients (in theory) could have all received DrotAA or all placebo or some other combination. Thus, further exploratory analyses were performed by subgroups in which the first through fourth patients enrolled at each site were excluded from the analysis. In ADDRESS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), 28-day mortality was lower for DrotAA patients compared with placebo patients in the subgroup of patients excluding the first two patients enrolled at a site (16.6% versus 18.4%). These data are similar to those in PROWESS in which higher mortality was observed for DrotAA patients compared with placebo patients who comprised the first enrolled patients at each site (n = 164 patients, 26.2% versus 20.0%).

For patients in the &#x02264;2 subgroup, 28-day mortality rates were 21.9% and 15.8% for DrotAA and placebo patients, respectively. In the &#x02265;3 subgroup, 28-day mortality rates were 16.6% and 18.4% for DrotAA and placebo patients, respectively. Baseline characteristics for these subpopulations are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. Compared with patients in the &#x02264;2 subgroup, patients in the &#x02265;3 subgroup site tended to be enrolled in countries other than the US and Canada (indicating that 'patients per site' rates were generally lower in the US and Canada compared with the rest of the world), had lower acute physiology scores, and were more likely to have chronic health points, to have undergone recent surgery, and to have received prophylactic-dose heparin.

Analyses of the ADDRESS and PROWESS studies suggest that the enrollment sequence effect or 'learning curve' may be largely confined to the populations with a lower risk of death and may relate to difficulties in diagnosis, timely diagnosis, or a situation in which small absolute reductions in mortality may not overcome the complications of therapy.</p><p>In ADDRESS, as in the PROWESS study, there was a statistically significant interaction between the observed treatment effect associated with DrotAA and the sequence in which patients were enrolled at study sites. In both trials, greater mortality was found with DrotAA use within the subgroup that comprised the first patients enrolled at study sites. In PROWESS, mortality was lower with DrotAA treatment for the second and subsequent patients enrolled at a site. However, in ADDRESS, mortality remained higher with DrotAA compared with placebo for the second patients enrolled. Thereafter, mortality was lower for DrotAA-treated patients compared with placebo.</p><p>A comparison of baseline characteristics for patients in ADDRESS who comprised the first two patients enrolled at a site compared with the third and subsequent patients indicated that there were changes in the characteristics of patients enrolled in the study as the site gained experience with the protocol. Specifically, differences were observed between the subgroups in the racial origin of patients, acute physiology scores, percentage of patients with chronic health points, surgical status, and heparin use. The mean time from the onset of first organ failure to treatment with study drug decreased from 24.1 to 21.8 hours for the first two patients compared with subsequent patients (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). The observed relative risk for DrotAA was similar between studies for patients enrolled in the third and subsequent patient blocks (0.82 versus 0.80 and 0.69 versus 0.69 for patients in the third block and subsequent blocks, respectively). An analysis of outcomes within clinically relevant subgroups suggested that any sequence effect is contained within the population of patients at lower risk of death. These data suggest that a potential sequence effect was present in the ADDRESS study as was observed in PROWESS.</p><p>An analysis of bleeding complications by sequence of enrollment in ADDRESS also indicated that sites enrolled patients at lower risk of bleeding in both the DrotAA and placebo groups. The percentage of patients experiencing any bleeding complications declined in both treatment groups as sites enrolled more patients into the study. Patients in the &#x02265;3 subgroup who received DrotAA received fewer transfusions compared with those patients in the &#x02264;2 subgroup. In both treatment groups, mortality was higher for patients experiencing any bleeding complications compared with those who did not have a bleeding event. As bleeding events were more common in the DrotAA groups, there were more patients in this group compared with placebo who experienced any bleeding event and did not survive. Patients experiencing a bleeding event were more severely ill than those who did not experience a bleeding event, so a direct contribution to the cause of death could not be determined but certainly cannot be excluded.</p><p>Determining the influence of sequential changes in patient characteristics on the outcome of ADDRESS is difficult. Previous data have suggested that the observed treatment effect associated with DrotAA is larger if treatment is initiated within 24 hours of first organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The presence of a sequence effect in low-risk patients only may suggest the difficulty of making the diagnosis of severe sepsis in this clinical setting. The influence of protocol violations on outcome could not be assessed because less than 50% of patients were monitored. However, protocol violations reduced the observed treatment effect in PROWESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Fewer bleeding complications and transfusions in DrotAA patients comprising the third and subsequently enrolled subgroup could have contributed to the lower observed mortality. However, an important aspect of these data is that the population of patients enrolled in a clinical study may change as sites gain experience with a protocol and patient identification, leading to change in the observed treatment effect associated with an intervention as sites enroll more patients in the study. These observations have important implications for the design of future trials. For example, the ongoing PROWESS shock study (a randomized placebo-controlled trial of DrotAA in adults with persistent shock) is using an academic coordinating center to approve every patient enrolled into the study. In addition, this trial has robust source data verification and documentation of protocol violations which will allow for re-education if the sites demonstrate inadequate understanding of the protocol.</p><p>Learning curves have been described in other clinical trials and in clinical practice. Halm and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] performed a literature review of studies examining the independent relationship between hospital or physician volume and clinical outcomes. They found that, overall, 71% of all studies of hospital volume and 69% of studies of physician volume reported statistically significant associations between higher volume and better outcomes. The strongest associations were found for AIDS treatment and for surgery on pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, abdominal aortic aneurysms, and pediatric cardiac problems. However, it is not always clear what exactly is responsible for these different outcomes.</p><p>While it is perhaps easier to explain a sequence effect in relation to surgical procedures, as well as AIDS treatments noted earlier, there have been a number of studies investigating the relationship between outcome and clinical experience with the use of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in ischemic stroke. Heuschmann and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] found that data from the German Stroke Registers Study Group indicated that in-hospital mortality of ischemic stroke patients after tPA use varied among hospitals with different experience in tPA treatment in routine clinical practice. There have been additional studies from different countries indicating that tPA should be administered by experienced physicians in hospitals with expertise in acute stroke care and that published treatment guidelines should be followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Similar to the findings associated with following tPA treatment guidelines, adherence to the American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines for hemodynamic support for newborns and children in septic shock has been noted to be associated with improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Data analyses based on secondary objectives in a clinical study and <italic>post hoc </italic>exploratory analyses suffer from concerns over the play of chance in multiple comparisons as well as reporting bias. Primary and secondary analyses have been reported for both the PROWESS and ADDRESS studies. The initial report of a treatment-by-enrollment interaction in PROWESS was considered hypothesis-generating. However, this finding in a subsequent trial suggests that such a sequence effect may have important implications for study design and data interpretation. Nevertheless, such findings do not alter the overall conclusions of these studies.</p><p>The exact cause of the 'enrollment sequence' remains uncertain. We have demonstrated associated changes in patient characteristics, but it is not clear whether these or other 'unrecorded' differences may be responsible. Changes in patient management, particularly in relation to DrotAA administration, could also be important, but not all of the details of patient management were collected. Two factors that could be important are time to treatment, which has previously been linked to improved outcome with DrotAA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and the frequency of bleeding events. We hypothesize that the 'sequence effect' may be more apparent in populations with lower mortality risk because the absolute mortality reduction is anticipated to be less in this population and thus it may be more difficult to demonstrate efficacy in this situation unless treatment conditions are optimized. The 'enrollment sequence' may thus have been more apparent in ADDRESS because much of this population was at low risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Analysis of the ADDRESS and PROWESS studies suggests that an enrollment sequence effect was present in both studies. In PROWESS, this enrollment sequence effect reduced the observed treatment effect associated with DrotAA. In ADDRESS, this enrollment sequence effect may have contributed to the decision to recommend early termination of the study for futility. The finding of such an enrollment sequence effect in two separate clinical trials in severe sepsis suggests that trial designs, site training, data collection and monitoring, and statistical analysis plans need to be adjusted for these potential confounders.
