We hypothesized that PB would prolong hyperaminoacidemia, enhancing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and muscle protein anabolism compared with a whey protein isolate (WPI).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This double-blind, randomized controlled trial studied men 55&#x02013;75 y of age. Subjects consumed 30 g protein from WPI or PB (25% soy, 25% whey, and 50% casein) 1 h after leg extension exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions at 70% one-repetition maximum). Blood and muscle amino acid concentrations and basal and postexercise muscle protein turnover were measured by using stable isotopic methods. Muscle mTORC1 signaling was assessed by immunoblotting.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Both groups increased amino acid concentrations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and mTORC1 signaling after protein ingestion (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Postexercise fractional synthesis rate (FSR; <italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05), fractional breakdown rate (FBR; <italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05), and net balance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08) did not differ between groups. WPI increased FSR by 67% (mean &#x000b1; SEM: rest: 0.05% &#x000b1; 0.01%; postexercise: 0.09% &#x000b1; 0.01%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), decreased FBR by 46% (rest: 0.17% &#x000b1; 0.01%; postexercise: 0.09% &#x000b1; 0.03%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and made net balance less negative (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). PB ingestion did not increase FSR (rest: 0.07% &#x000b1; 0.03%; postexercise: 0.09% &#x000b1; 0.01%; <italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05), tended to decrease FBR by 42% (rest: 0.25% &#x000b1; 0.08%; postexercise: 0.15% &#x000b1; 0.08%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.08), and made net balance less negative (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

With the aging of the baby boomer generation, the prevalence of sarcopenia will increase. A sarcopenic population will add to the ever-increasing health care costs as these older individuals will require enhanced care from weakness, bedrest, and loss of independence. Additionally, reduced muscle mass and weakness increase the risk of falls in older adults (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A fall can lead to hospitalization and placement in a care facility (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Amino acid (AA)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5"><sup>11</sup></xref>/protein supplementation and resistance exercise (RE) are well-studied interventions for maximizing muscle protein synthesis in adults of all ages (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Unfortunately, these stimuli do not enhance muscle protein synthesis in the elderly as robustly as in younger individuals. This phenomenon has been classified as anabolic resistance (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Although the mechanism for anabolic resistance is unknown, evidence suggests that a dose threshold must be reached for protein supplementation to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older individuals (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Current research suggests that an intake &#x0003c;20 g protein is insufficient for maximal stimulation of protein synthesis (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, any supplement provided to older individuals should contain 20 g protein at a minimum (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Muscle protein breakdown is less well studied, especially in older individuals. The fractional breakdown rate increases after RE alone or exercise combined with feeding (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, protein synthesis must be maximized to counteract these increases in protein breakdown to shift protein metabolism into an anabolic state and reach a positive net balance.</p><p>Adequate protein intake is only one aspect of using protein supplementation as a tool to overcome anabolic resistance and improve muscle protein turnover. The protein source is also important because different protein sources contain different compositions of amino acids (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In addition, certain proteins vary in their digestion rates (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Because activation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis is contingent on the AAs being taken up by the muscle from the blood, the overall length of prolonged blood hyperaminoacidemia is crucial (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The most well-studied protein supplement, whey protein, contains high levels of branched-chain AAs compared with other protein sources. It is especially high in leucine, an AA demonstrated to be responsible for activating protein synthesis (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Whey protein is a rapidly digested protein and thus results in a rapid spike in blood AA concentrations (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The other milk protein, casein, has a slower digestion profile than whey. As a result, casein prolongs hyperaminoacidemia longer than whey protein. Although the increase in blood AAs after casein ingestion does not reach the magnitude seen with whey ingestion, protein synthesis is still activated postexercise (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Milk is not the only protein source for postexercise supplementation. The plant protein soy is also capable of stimulating muscle protein synthesis (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In addition, soy contains many antioxidants and is a good alternative source of protein for those on a vegetarian diet (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Because whey, casein, and soy all have different AA profiles and digestion rates, a blended protein supplement may potentially provide the benefit of all 3 proteins (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>A study using this soy-dairy protein blend (PB) supplement in young adults demonstrated that the PB prolonged AA net balance across the leg for &#x02264;2 h postingestion compared with only 20 min for the whey-only group (<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In addition, the PB increased muscle protein synthesis for 4 h post ingestion compared with 2 h for the whey-only group (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This prolonged stimulus may hold the key for improving skeletal muscle protein anabolism and attenuating sarcopenia in older adults.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether soy-dairy PB ingestion after RE in older adults promotes muscle protein anabolism. We hypothesized that soy-dairy PB ingestion in older adults after a bout of RE would prolong hyperaminoacidemia and enhance muscle mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and protein synthesis compared with a single protein isolate. To test our hypothesis we conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in men aged 55&#x02013;75 y and compared the effects of whey protein isolate (WPI) to a soy-dairy PB ingested 1 h after a bout of high-intensity RE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Screening of participants.</title><p>We recruited 20 healthy men aged 55&#x02013;75 y for this double-blind, randomized clinical trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).

Participants were required to be healthy, only recreationally active (no high-intensity RE regimen), nonsmoking, and not currently using any protein supplements. Participants were screened on 2 separate days at the Institute for Translational Sciences-Clinical Research Center at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Screening one included laboratory tests (complete blood count with differential, liver and kidney function tests, coagulation profile, fasting blood glucose, hepatitis B and C screening, HIV test, thyroid stimulating hormone, lipid profile, urinalysis, and drug screening), clinical history with physical examination and one-repetition maximum (1RM) testing. The second screening included a DXA scan (Hologic QDR 4500W) to measure lean and fat mass, an additional 1RM test, and a cardiac stress test. The 1RM testing was performed on a leg extension machine (Cybex-VR2). The repetition maximum was considered the average of the heaviest weight lifted from each of the 2 sessions. All participants provided written, informed consent before enrollment in the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Medical Branch and is in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 1983.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow diagram for study recruitment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jn231159fig1"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Participant characteristics<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1"><sup>1</sup></xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, y</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fat, %</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lean mass, kg</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1RM</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">WPI</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.3 &#x000b1; 2.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.5 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.5 &#x000b1; 2.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.9 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">175 &#x000b1; 8.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PB</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.2 &#x000b1; 1.5*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.1 &#x000b1; 1.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.3 &#x000b1; 1.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.1 &#x000b1; 3.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">179 &#x000b1; 15.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>1</label><p>Values are means &#x000b1; SEMs. *Different from WPI, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04. 1RM, one-repetition maximum; PB, soy-dairy protein blend; WPI, whey protein isolate.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Study design.</title><p>The infusion protocol for this study was identical for both groups (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1</bold>).

Feeding alone can be effective in increasing muscle protein synthesis in older populations with the proper dosage. Cuthbertson et al. (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) showed a significant increase in FSR &#x02264;3.5 h postingestion using 10&#x02013;20 g essential AAs (EAAs). Similarly, Katsanos et al. (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) saw a marked increase in FSR in older subjects after ingestion of 6.7 g EAA beverage containing 2.8 g leucine. This was the equivalent leucine concentration of a 25- to 30-g protein supplement. Moore et al. (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) also demonstrated a need for greater protein intake for stimulating myofibrillar protein synthesis in older compared with younger subjects in a retrospective study, with older subjects requiring a protein intake of 0.40 g &#x000b7; kg body mass<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; meal<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> compared with the 0.24 g/kg body mass the young required.</p><p>Unlike feeding, RE alone typically does not promote a robust increase in skeletal muscle protein synthesis in older adults. Using RE, Fry et al. (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) were unable to induce an increase in FSR in older adults that was shown in younger adults after 8 sets of 10 leg extensions at 70% 1RM. Kumar et al. (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) saw a similar disparity between young and old subjects after RE alone and concomitant increases in FSR. Conversely, Kumar et al. (<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) did find an increase in myofibrillar protein synthesis for older adults with RE alone when exercise volume was doubled while intensity was held constant.</p><p>It would appear that the key factor for promoting skeletal muscle protein synthesis is the leucine concentration in the supplement (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In older adults, Katsanos et al. (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) showed that 2.8 g leucine was necessary to increase FSR, whereas a 1.7-g leucine dose was insufficient, even when the total EAAs in the beverage remained constant. Bukhari et al. (<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) demonstrated significant elevations in muscle protein synthesis in older women using a 3-g EAA beverage containing 1.2 g leucine in combination with RE. The study by Katsanos et al. (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), along with that of Moore et al. (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) cited above, offers further evidence that body mass may play an integral role in protein and leucine dosage in older individuals. The mean lean body mass for subjects in the study by Bukhari et al. (<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) was only 40.5 kg compared with &#x0223c;53.5 kg for the study by Katsanos et al. (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This weight discrepancy may explain the increases in muscle protein synthesis after ingestion of 1.2 g leucine in one study not seen with 1.7 g in the other study.</p><p>The 2 groups in this study, WPI and PB, were not matched for leucine content. The WPI group received 3.26 g leucine whereas the PB received 2.78 g. Although the 2 groups did not ingest equal amounts of leucine, according to the work of Katsanos et al. (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), both groups received enough leucine to exceed the minimum threshold to shift protein turnover into an anabolic state. Similarly Mitchell et al. (<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) demonstrated an increase in myofibrillar FSR for middle-aged subjects consuming either whey protein alone or a whole-milk (20% whey, 80% casein) supplement with the whole-milk group receiving a smaller leucine dose than the whey protein group.</p><p>For the first primary outcome, there was no difference between groups for either blood leucine concentrations or AUC measurements after supplement ingestion. Therefore, leucine availability was comparable for both the WPI group and the PB group. Interestingly, previous work has shown a pronounced and prolonged hyperaminoacidemia in older adults after ingestion of protein or AAs (<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), which may have contributed to the similar hyperaminoacidemia between groups found in our study.</p><p>The sustained availability of AAs in the blood past 2 h for both groups may explain the increased anabolic signaling through the mTORC1 signaling pathway at 2&#x02013;4 h postingestion of the supplement. This hyperaminoacidemia is vital for stimulating anabolic signaling in older individuals. Fry et al. (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) showed no increase in mTORC1 signaling or muscle protein synthesis after RE alone in older adults. We found for our second primary outcome that mTORC1 and its downstream targets rpS6 and S6K1 were similarly phosphorylated after supplementation for both groups. Thus both groups activated skeletal muscle mTORC1 signaling in response to exercise and protein ingestion.</p><p>Although both hyperaminoacidemia and mTORC1 signaling were similarly elevated between groups, only the WPI group showed a statistically significant increase in FSR, our third primary outcome, during the Early period (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This may have been because of the potentially superior ability of fast-acting whey protein compared with a PB to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older adults. Yet there was no difference in FSR between groups. The PB group had a higher baseline FSR value and therefore did not show a statistically significant increase during the Early period. A large variance within the baseline measures for PB prevented a significant increase in FSR during the Early period. Still, considering the similarities between groups in AA concentrations, cell signaling, and overall FSR during the Early, Late, and Entire periods, it is possible to speculate that the PB group would have matched the WPI group during the Early period if not for a few unexplained high values during the baseline period.</p><p>Protein turnover is not only governed by changes in muscle protein synthesis. Muscle protein breakdown may serve an important role in controlling muscle accretion or atrophy (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Some studies have shown an increase in FBR after exercise but then an attenuation after feeding in younger adults (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Research on FBR in older adults is not as comprehensive. One study showed no change in FBR in older adults after RE alone between baseline and 24 h after exercise (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This study measured protein breakdown both during the rest period and the treatment period. Protein supplementation resulted in an attenuation of the increase in FBR, a secondary outcome measure, which is commonly observed after RE. WPI yielded a significant decrease in FBR with only a trend for a decrease in the PB group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08). This attenuation resulted in a shift toward a less negative net protein balance (Supplemental Figure 6).</p><p>There are a few limitations to our study. First, we included only men. Although sex differences are not apparent in younger populations for mTORC1 signaling and muscle protein synthesis after RE, we cannot make any inferences on the potential sex differences in older populations when combining RE with a PB (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Second, our randomization procedure resulted in subjects in the PB group being slightly younger. This may have contributed to the tendency for baseline FSR values to be higher in this group. However, as mentioned previously, the primary factor for not detecting a significant increase in FSR in this group was most likely due to a few subjects with high basal FSR values. In fact, in the PB group 7 of the 9 subjects had an increase in FSR after exercise and protein ingestion.</p><p>The precursor-product method used for measuring skeletal muscle protein breakdown in this study has four assumptions that must be met for the FBR equation to be valid: <italic>1</italic>) isotopic steady state must be maintained, <italic>2</italic>) inward transport and protein breakdown are constant over time, <italic>3</italic>) the only source of tracer is from arterialized blood, and <italic>4</italic>) the intramuscular free AA pool size is constant. First, as shown in Supplemental Figure 7, the <sc>l</sc>-[<sup>15</sup>N] phenylalanine tracer enrichment was in a steady state condition at both time points before termination of the tracer. After tracer cessation, both groups experienced a similar loss of tracer enrichment, and there was no difference between groups at any time point for <sc>l</sc>-[<sup>15</sup>N] phenylalanine tracer enrichment. Second, in our study we were unable to measure inward transport because we did not use femoral catheters. However, in our previous study in which we compared these supplements in young men (<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), inward transport rates were not significantly different from rest during the 3&#x02013;4 h after ingestion. Although this may be different in older adults, our earlier data would suggest that inward transport rates returned to resting levels during the time period when we measured FBR for the current study. Third, the contribution of tracer from a source other than arterialized blood is minimal. The protein-bound enrichment was negligible relative to the blood enrichment because it reached a maximum of &#x0223c;0.05%, i.e., 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the blood phenylalanine enrichment (typically 8&#x02013;10%) (Supplemental Figure 8). Fourth, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> show that intramuscular phenylalanine concentrations had returned to postprandial concentrations by the muscle biopsy at 4 h after ingestion. This suggests that during our postprandial FBR measurement (i.e., 3&#x02013;4 h after protein ingestion), the intramuscular pool size remained constant. In summary, all assumptions of the FBR model have been met for measuring protein breakdown rates during the postprandial period, and all relevant data for validation of these model assumptions have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and Supplemental Figures 5&#x02013;8.</p><p>For our net protein balance results, we used the 2- to 4-h time point (Late period) for FSR in the net balance equation because the FBR measurement occurred during the 3- to 4-h time point after ingestion. Although these time points do not match exactly, they do overlap and thus provide an opportunity to determine net protein balance over the final hour of the study period. We believe that net protein balance remained negative in this study after both RE and protein supplementation because of the timing of the measurement (i.e., FSR peaked during the Early period and returned to baseline values during the Late period). Thus, net protein balance during the first hour after protein ingestion was most likely positive.</p><p>In summary, WPI ingestion after exercise increased FSR and reduced FBR, resulting in a less-negative net protein balance. PB ingestion after exercise did not significantly increase FSR and tended to decrease FBR; however, this combination caused net balance to become less negative. This resulted in no differences between groups postexercise for FSR, FBR, or net balance. We conclude that protein supplementation, whether a single protein isolate or a PB, enhances mTORC1 signaling and muscle protein anabolism in older men after RE.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Junfang Hao, Susan Wilson, Ming Zheng, Chelsea Therrien, and Allyson Schattel for technical assistance and Sarah Toombs Smith for writing assistance.
