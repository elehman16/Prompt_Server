The present study investigated the long-term effects of regular exercise training on biological indicators among these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this quasi-experimental trial with pretest-post-test design, 65&#x02009;patients with T2DM aged 33&#x02013;69 years (experiment (35), control (30)) participated. After 8&#x02009;years of conducting the program, the data on 30 patients (experiment (15), control (15)) were entered into analysis. The training program included aerobic exercise three sessions per week, 90&#x02009;min, 50%&#x02013;80% VO<sub>2</sub>max. Before and after the intervention, the biological indicators (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI) and VO<sub>2</sub>max) were measured. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of covariance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our long-term exercise training program had a significant effect on HbA1C, BMI and Vo<sub>2</sub>max (P&#x0003c;0.05). Compared with patients in the control group, HbA1c was significantly reduced and BMI and VO<sub>2</sub>max were significantly improved among the experiment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Long-term regular physical activity training was found to be helpful in improving glycemic control, body composition and cardiovascular fitness among patients with T2DM. Long-term continuous physical activity offsets the deteriorations of biological indicators found in the control group. Further research, with a particular focus on practical and real-world programming, is needed to determine the responsive health outcomes of such long-term programs on the patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>A1c</kwd><kwd>Physical Exercise And Health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004366</institution-id><institution>Tabriz University of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance of this study</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known about this subject?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Obesity and insulin resistance, as the important components of metabolic syndrome are the results of reduced physical activity in daily life.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyle are considered important factors in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What are the new findings?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Long-term regular physical activity training had positive effects on glycemic control and body composition among patients with T2DM.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Long-term regular physical activity training promoted cardiovascular fitness among patients with T2DM.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Long-term continuous physical activity offsets the deteriorations of biological indicators found in the control group.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Regular physical activity training programs should be continued for &#x0003e;12 months among the patients with T2DM to investigate the long-term effects of the program on the biological indicators of the disease.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A particular focus on practical and real-world programming is needed to determine the responsive health outcomes of such long-term programs on the patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is a need to investigate the effects of such long-term physical activity programs on controlling mental health outcomes (such as depression and anxiety symptoms) of the disease as well as quality of life among the patients with T2DM.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nowadays, there is an increasing rate in the incidence of lifestyle-related chronic physical and psychological problems, due to a decrease in the level of healthy behaviors like healthy nutrition and physical activity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> A reduction in daily physical activity may result in obesity and insulin resistance, which are important components of metabolic syndrome.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This syndrome predicts an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> as well.</p><p>According to WHO, the lack of physical activity may be considered as one of the 10 reasons for mortality and disability throughout the world. It is also well known that obesity and sedentary lifestyle are important factors in increasing the incidence of T2DM worldwide.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Therefore, as body mass index (BMI) increases among populations, the higher risk for mortality may be expected.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>T2DM, with an increasing rate of prevalence in recent decades,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> has caused many health and socioeconomic problems throughout the world. Due to its various consequences and disabilities, T2DM has been known as a disabling disease, as well. Therefore, strategies for reducing the healthcare costs associated with the disease should be emphasized.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Exercise, as one of above-mentioned strategies, has significant effects on the metabolism of nutrients. In particular, it diminishes the blood glucose levels, and plays an important role in the treatment of patients with diabetes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It has also been found that beside diet control and medical treatment, regular exercise may improve glycemic control, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, play a role in weight loss and, consequently, improve well-being among these patients. Regular exercise may also prevent the development of T2DM among high-risk individuals.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Weight loss and the loss of visceral fat may be considered as the important benefits of exercise, which may lead to a significant improvement in the metabolic indices.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Regular aerobic exercise may result in high insulin sensitivity, considerable weight loss and improved body composition. Weight loss by 10%&#x02013;15% may lead to reduction in insulin resistance and may be most beneficial at the early stages of T2DM progression, when insulin secretion is still adequate.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Evidence has shown that hemoglobin A1c&#x000a0;(HbA1c), as the gold standard for monitoring glycemic control, may serve as an indicator for diabetes-related diseases.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The epidemiological analyses have indicated that 1% reduction in the HbA1c value is associated with 14% reduction in myocardial infarction (MI) and 21% reduction in diabetes-related death and 37% reduction in microvascular complications.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x000a0;Furthermore, establishing glucose control at or below 7% can reduce the long-term complications of the disease up to 76%.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Several previous studies have shown that regular exercise training can significantly reduce the values of HbA1c.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> According to a meta- analysis, chronic hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease among adults with diabetes adults.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x000a0;There is also evidence that among patients with T2DM, the maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) values are lower compared with the healthy individuals.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This phenomenon may be contributed to specific pathogenic mechanisms including hyperglycemia, low capacity density and alteration in oxygen delivery.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Lemura <italic>et al</italic>, conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of training program on aerobic fitness in adults aged 46&#x02013;90&#x000a0;years.

The majority of these trials, however, have only engaged the patients in 6 weeks to 12 months of exercise training. In order to find better understandings of the long-term effects of regular physical activity training on the biological indicators of the disease, we conducted an 8-year trial among patients with T2DM in Tabriz, Iran. The aim of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of a long-term, regular exercise training program on the levels of BMI, glycosylated hemoglobin and VO<sub>2</sub>max among patients with T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>This was an experimental study with before-after design.

regular exercise training program on the levels of BMI, glycosylated hemoglobin and VO<sub>2</sub>max among patients with T2DM. We eventually found that such long-term exercise training program may improve the level of VO<sub>2</sub>max and reduce the levels of BMI and HbA1c among these patients. It is well known that regular exercise training to the patients with T2DM has positive effects on their level of glycemic control as well as the disease complications such as cardiovascular problems.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition, the indirect effects of exercise on weight loss and the improvement of function in the beta-cells and insulin sensitivity have all been known.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>In the present study, after 8 years of regular exercise training, the experimental group revealed significant improvement in BMI. As shown in the results, there was a linear decrease in BMI during the first 6 years and an increase in the remaining 2 years of follow-up. In contrast, among the patients in the control group a slightly constant increasing pattern was observed in the level of BMI during the 8 years of follow-up. These findings are consistent with those reported by Balucci <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and Cuff <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the study conducted by Goldhaber-Fiebert <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> significant weight loss was observed in the experimental group. The training program in their study included exercise and diet, which might be a reason for the significant positive effects. A possibility for the increase found in the level of BMI at the eighth year of our study may be the confounding effect of the age of participants. Stevens <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> in a bi-ethnic cohort, found aging in association with an increase in BMI in white and African-American men and women. Considering that our study was a longtime intervention and as the patients were getting older and older during time, the level of their BMI may be affected by their age. In other studies conducted by Ahmadizad <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and Tokmakidis <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> no significant improvement was found in BMI after conducting 12 weeks aerobic and resistance training and 16 weeks combined exercise training programs, respectively. Furthermore, in a systematic study applying different types of exercise, Boul&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic> did not find any significant change in BMI of the experiment group.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In contrast, Krousel-Wood <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> reported that home-based exercise improves BMI among patients with T2DM. A review on these studies shows that the majority have conducted the training program for &#x0003c;6 months, which may be a reason for the controversial findings. Our study, as a long-term trial may be considered as an affirmation for the effects of regular exercise training on the BMI of the patients with T2DM.</p><p>In the present study, significant decrease (1.39%) was found in the level of HbA1c among the experiment group after the last 2 years of intervention. Also, a constant decreasing pattern in the level of this variable was observed in the experiment group during the 8 years of follow-up, except for the value found in the sixth year. In the control group, the 8-year timeline change for HbA1c was also found to follow a slightly decreasing pattern. Despite the decreasing pattern of HbA1c in the control group, the values of this index were higher than those found in the experiment group during the 8 years of our program. In a meta-analysis on 12 aerobic training and 2 resistance training studies during 1989&#x02013;2000, Boul&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> revealed that exercise may reduce HbA1c values by approximately 0.66%, which is an appropriate reduction to improve the glycemic control. Yan <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> also reported that after a 12-week aerobic program, HbA1c level was reduced by 1.1% and VO<sub>2</sub>max was increased, as well. They, however, reported no significant change in BMI after the program. In another study, R&#x000f6;nnemaa <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> reported that 4 months of exercise program has reduced HbA1c level from 9.6% to 8.6%. Sigal <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Shenoy <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Kelley and Kelley<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and Church <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> also reported significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin. In our present study, the level of HbA1c among the patients was decreased by 0.73% and 1.33% after 16 weeks postintervention and 1-year follow-up, respectively. Also, in the third (6 years after initiation of intervention) and the fourth (8 years after initiation of intervention) analyses of our data, the levels of HbA1c decreased by 1.11% and 1.84%, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> that, in contrast to control group, the level of HbA1c in the experiment group has decreased in a relatively constant pattern. It may be, therefore, concluded that having a stable level of physical activity during a long time may increasingly improve the level of HbA1c among the patients with T2DM. All these findings along with those reported in the present study affirm the direct relationship between long-term regular physical activity with the level of HbA1c and cardiovascular fitness, especially VO<sub>2</sub>max values and BMI.</p><p>Also, our results demonstrated that long-term regular aerobic training program may result in increasing the level of VO<sub>2</sub>max among patients with T2DM. Similarly, Boul&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> reported &#x0003e;10% improvement in VO<sub>2</sub>max values as a result of a rather low intense aerobic exercise program. Cauza <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and Alam <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> also found significant increases in VO<sub>2</sub>max after aerobic and 6-month controlled exercise trainings, respectively. Inconsistent with those found in our study, Byrkjeland <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> did not find a significant change in values of HbA1c and VO<sub>2</sub>max after a 52-week aerobic training program among patients with T2DM. They, however, found considerable increase in ventilation pulmonary threshold and time of fatigue in the training group compared with the control group. Differences in the variations of VO<sub>2</sub>max by increasing age may be described by the effective factors of aerobic fitness readiness. The difference in body composition changes during growth and the changes in daily physical activity could be attributed to these disorders.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, there is evidence that among patients with T2DM, VO<sub>2</sub>max value is lower than that among healthy individuals, which may be associated with specific pathological mechanisms such as hyperglycemia, low capacity density and alteration in oxygen delivery.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Getting the patients with T2DM to engage in such a long period, regular physical activity program provided the researchers with an interesting experience of working with the patients. After 8&#x02009;years of study, the relationships between the research team members and the patients have become so strong that the remaining subjects in the intervention group do not intend to terminate the program. They still come to the club (the place of conducting the program) three times per week and continue to their exercise along with some members of the research team. Also, 5&#x02009;years after the initiation of study, a majority of the patients remained in the program (90%) was literate patients. This highlights the role of literacy in maintaining and promoting health among such populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Long-term regular physical activity training was found to be helpful in improving glycemic control, body composition and cardiovascular fitness among patients with T2DM. Long-term continuous physical activity offsets the deteriorations of biological indicators found in the control group. Further research, with a particular focus on practical and real-world programming, is needed to determine the responsive health outcomes of such long-term programs on the patients. It is also suggested to investigate the effects of such long-term physical activity programs on physiological adjustments, controlling mental outcomes (such as depression and anxiety symptoms) of the disease as well as quality of life among the patients with T2DM.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> FN, MM, AY and AA researched the data; AY, NMA and MN contributed to discussion and wrote the manuscript; JHG, VS and HN reviewed/edited the manuscript and helped in researching the data.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences grant number 93-43-2211.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Patient consent:</bold> Obtained.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> Ehtics Committee in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Provenance and peer review:</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Data sharing statement:</bold> Additional data are available at the website of <italic>BMJ Open Diabetes Research &#x00026; Care</italic>.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Janssen</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Leblanc</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group>
