The search identified two articles describing the in-vitro activity of ridinilazole showing potent growth inhibition of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> and that ridinilazole possessed a targeted spectrum of activity, with little or no growth inhibition of either Gram-positive or Gram-negative members of the intestinal microbiota. Additional evidence was available to the authors at the time, including results from a phase 1 study showing ridinilazole to be safe, well tolerated, localised to the gastrointestinal tract, and to largely preserve the intestinal microbiota of the trial participants. Non-clinical data included results from the hamster model of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, which showed that ridinilazole protected against both acute infection and disease recurrence. These data have subsequently been published. On the basis of this evidence, it was decided to assess the efficacy and safety of ridinilazole in a phase 2 clinical trial.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>This phase 2, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study shows the non-inferiority of ridinilazole compared with vancomycin in terms of sustained clinical cure of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection (ie, clinical cure at the end of treatment and no recurrence within 30 days), while being safe and well tolerated.</p><p><bold>Implications of all available evidence</bold></p><p>Ridinilazole has potential as a new treatment of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, owing to its good sustained clinical response rates compared with those of conventional therapy, probably as a result of decreased disturbance of the normally protective intestinal microbiota.

Participants were recruited between June 26, 2014, and August 31, 2015. We did a preliminary assessment of all patients with a positive diagnostic test for <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, on the basis of protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria, to determine potential suitability for the study before approaching them for formal screening for enrolment into the study. The <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref> shows further details of study design and participants. Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional review board at each centre. The study adhered to ethical principles as set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and followed all principles of good clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Participants</title><p>This study included men and women aged 18&#x02013;90 years. Eligible participants had <italic>C difficile</italic> infection (defined as more than three unformed bowel movements or more than 200 mL of unformed stool in rectal collection devices 24 h before randomisation) and a positive local diagnostic test for <italic>C difficile</italic> infection (detection of either a toxigenic strain by nucleic acid amplification tests or free toxin in stool by enzyme immunoassay). Participants could have received no more than 24 h of antimicrobial treatment with metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin before initiation of the study drug and were either treated as inpatients or as outpatients for part or all of the study. All participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ridinilazole or vancomycin. Stratification was done on the basis of centre, age (&#x0003e;75 years and &#x02264;75 years), history of recurrent <italic>C difficile</italic> infection over the past 12 months (no occurrences and one to three previous occurrences), and presence of <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin A (TcdA) or toxin B (TcdB) at screening (either free toxin positive or free toxin negative and free toxin not tested at screening). Stratified randomisation was done by use of a dynamic allocation procedure (MedPace, Cincinnati, OH, USA). No participant could begin treatment before receiving a unique randomisation number, which was created by an allocation-concealed, computer-generated random permutation procedure. The investigators enrolled participants into the trial. Randomisation and study group assignment was done by an interactive voice and web response system (IVRS/IWRS) overseen by MedPace. Participants, investigators, and other study personnel remained blinded to the treatment received until the database was locked, except if an unblinding procedure was needed (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p>Blinding was achieved by over-encapsulation of both study drugs (ridinilazole and vancomycin) and a placebo within identical size zero, Swedish orange, hard gelatin immediate-release capsules.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Procedures</title><p>Ridinilazole (200 mg) was given orally twice daily for 10 days, with participants also receiving two doses of placebo to preserve blinding through consistency with the dosing schedule in the vancomycin group, while vancomycin (125 mg) was given orally four times daily for 10 days. Use of other antibiotics to treat <italic>C difficile</italic> infection was prohibited, as were probiotics, antidiarrhoeal drugs, antiperistaltic drugs, and other products used to slow bowel movement. The first dose of study medication was administered following completion of screening procedures, baseline assessments, and randomisation (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). As part of the baseline assessments, stool samples were assessed for the presence of free <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin with either an enzyme immunoassay test (C. Diff Quik Chek Complete; Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) provided by the sponsor to each site or a cell cytotoxicity neutralisation assay at a central laboratory (South Bend Medical Foundation, South Bend, IN, USA). Participants were assessed for clinical response to treatment on day 4&#x02013;6, at the end of treatment (day 10&#x02013;11), at test of cure (day 12&#x02013;14), at weekly follow-up visits after completion of treatment (day 13&#x02013;39), at a follow-up site visit (day 22&#x02013;28), and at an end-of-study visit (day 37&#x02013;43). In addition, unscheduled visits could be made if recurrence was suspected.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of ridinilazole compared with vancomycin in the treatment of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained clinical response, defined as clinical cure (less than or equal to three unformed bowel movements in a 24-h period or less than 200 mL unformed stool in rectal collection devices) at test of cure and no recurrence of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection within 30 days after end of treatment. Recurrence was defined as a new episode of diarrhoea between test of cure and end of the study, resulting in the individual receiving antimicrobial treatment for <italic>C difficile</italic> before the end of the study. We followed up patients for recurrence for 30 days after the end of treatment, in keeping with similar phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Secondary efficacy endpoints were clinical cure at test of cure (ie, at day 12&#x02013;14), time to resolution of diarrhoea (defined as the time from starting study drug to the first formed bowel movement not followed by an unformed bowel movement within the subsequent 24 h), and time to hospital discharge (for participants admitted to or treated in hospital, based on day of discharge, provided that there was no readmission for <italic>C difficile</italic> infection before test of cure visit). Participants who were lost to follow-up, discontinued the study, or received other treatment for <italic>C difficile</italic> infection before test of cure were regarded as having treatment failure. Sustained clinical response for each participant was centrally assessed on the basis of investigator-determined cure at test of cure and recurrence.</p><p>The secondary objectives were assessment of the safety and tolerability of ridinilazole compared with that of vancomycin (occurrence of adverse and serious adverse events), plasma and faecal concentrations of ridinilazole, and health status (assessed by participant-reported responses to the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire).</p><p>Safety assessments comprised physical examination, vital signs (eg, blood pressure, pulse, weight, and body temperature), clinical laboratory evaluations (eg, haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms. Safety was assessed in all participants who received the study medication from the time of consent until the last study assessment, regardless of their response to treatment. We coded adverse events using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 17.0). Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as adverse events that started or increased in severity at the time of or after administration of the first dose of study medication.</p><p>Prespecified exploratory objectives of this study comprised qualitative and quantitative effects on the bowel microbiota of participants identified by 16sRNA sequencing; effects of treatment on calprotectin, lactoferrin, tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;), interleukin 1&#x003b2;, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, interleukin 8, and interleukin 23 in faecal samples over the course of therapy; and the effects of treatment on the microbiology of faecal samples voided over the course of therapy. Microbiology assessments included <italic>C difficile</italic> spore counts and the culture, isolation, and quantification of <italic>C difficile</italic> and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. <italic>C difficile</italic> isolates underwent ribotyping and susceptibility testing with an antibiotic panel that comprised fidaxomicin, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, rifampicin, rifaximin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, tigecycline, ridinilazole, imipenem, and linezolid.

Moreover, ridinilazole was shown to be superior to vancomycin with regard to sustained clinical response in the primary analysis population. The overall adverse event profiles of ridinilazole and vancomycin were similar, with no safety signals being identified with ridinilazole. Oral administration of ridinilazole was associated with minimal systemic exposure, consistent with data in healthy volunteers at the same dose of 200 mg given twice a day for 10 days, suggesting that systemic exposure of ridinilazole is not increased in the presence of an inflamed gastrointestinal tract.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> No significant effect of ridinilazole on time to resolution of diarrhoea was evident.</p><p>Participants in this study were fairly representative of those who develop <italic>C difficile</italic> infection. We included patients older than 65 years, those with severe disease, and those with previous episodes of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, all of whom are at increased risk of infection and of disease recurrence following treatment.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Progressive deterioration in treatment outcomes has been documented in adults older than 40 years,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and 93% of deaths related to <italic>C difficile</italic> infection in the USA in 2009 occurred in adults older than 65 years.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Additional risk factors for <italic>C difficile</italic> infection include exposure to the health-care system, previous or current antibiotic use, being immunocompromised, and having underlying chronic comorbid conditions.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Our finding that ridinilazole was associated with improved sustained clinical response compared with vancomycin in both the primary efficacy analysis and in secondary analyses of subgroups based on age, baseline severity, history of recurrence, baseline concomitant antibiotic use, and hospital (inpatient <italic>vs</italic> outpatient) status is encouraging. However, differences in sustained clinical response were not statistically significant in many of the subgroups, probably because of the small sample size, and these outcomes, along with others, will be further investigated in larger confirmatory studies.</p><p>We used the modified ITT population for the primary analysis on the basis of evidence that patients with a diagnosis confirmed by presence of free toxin are most likely to have true <italic>C difficile</italic> infection. Infection severity and clinical outcomes, including mortality and complications related to <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, are significantly worse in patients with <italic>C difficile</italic> infection defined by the presence of faecal toxin, as opposed to a toxigenic <italic>C difficile</italic> strain alone (eg, as defined by a toxin gene PCR-positive result).<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Such findings are likely to reflect the poor discriminatory power of molecular <italic>C difficile</italic> tests to distinguish colonisation from infection in elderly people with several comorbidities, who have a high chance of being colonised by toxigenic strains and thus might be falsely identified as having <italic>C difficile</italic> infection when they have diarrhoea due to another reason. Our focus on faecal-toxin-positive individuals is consistent with national and international <italic>C difficile</italic> infection diagnostic guidelines and, as such, adds rigour to our analyses.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Bacteria that are part of the normal gut microbiota directly confer resistance to colonisation by intestinal pathogens through, for example, bile salt metabolism, competition for nutrients, and production of inhibitory molecules, or indirectly through immune-mediated mechanisms.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> The superiority of ridinilazole compared with vancomycin with regard to sustained clinical response was driven by a marked reduction in recurrent <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, which is likely to be due to the highly selective activity of ridinilazole against <italic>C difficile</italic> and the absence of collateral damage to the microbiota during therapy.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Sustained clinical response takes into consideration both initial cure rates and recurrence rates, and has therefore been a preferred measure of treatment outcomes for <italic>C difficile</italic> infection when comparing agents with similar initial clinical response rates.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p><p>This study had some limitations. First, only 21 of the 33 sites recruited participants for the study. Although 14 sites recruited three or more participants, most of the recruitment (approximately 70%) was done across eight sites. Second, although study participants were reasonably representative of patients with <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, they were slightly younger and had milder disease. Third, the power calculation of the study was based on the assumption of 100 participants in the primary analysis population. However, although the primary analysis only included 69 participants, the study still met the primary endpoint, establishing non-inferiority and also showing statistical superiority at the prespecified 10% level. Fourth, recurrence was only monitored for 30 days after the end of treatment. Although this follow-up accords with similar phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> future studies should consider longer follow-up periods. Finally, 31 participants were not included in the primary analysis population because of a negative free toxin assay. This probably reflects, in part, the suboptimal sensitivity of free toxin assays resulting in false negative results, and poor specificity of molecular assays for detection of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection resulting in the potential for enrolment of colonised rather than infected participants. However, the rigour with which the modified ITT population was defined mitigates this limitation and supports the study's primary analysis and results.</p><p>Our findings suggest that ridinilazole has the potential to be an effective treatment of <italic>C difficile</italic> infection and support its assessment in larger phase 3 clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
