Colonization (occur in 46% of VLBW infants) is a usual precedent of invasive disease. Ten percent of colonized infants progress to invasive disease. Fluconazol prophylaxis has been shown to effectively decrease the rates of invasive fungal infection in VLBW infants; however, concerns with regard to long-term safety and emergence of resistance still exist. Bovine lactoferrin has been shown to decrease the rates of late onset sepsis through its documented antinfective properties. This study is a subgroup analysis of the previously published paper in JAMA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] with a focus of lactoferrin role in decreasing the rates of fungal colonization and invasive disease in VLBW infants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This is a secondary analysis of the data obtained during a multicenter RCT developed in Italy in the years 2006-2007.</p><p>Multi-center randomized controlled trial in 11 neonatal intensive care units in Italy.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Population</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion</title><p>VLBW infants younger than 3 days of age</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Exclusion</title><p>Lack of parental consent</p><p>Ongoing antifungal prophylaxis</p><p>Early onset sepsis</p><p>Evidence of liver failure (three-fold increase in liver enzymes)</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Three groups</title><p>Lactoferrin group</p><p>BLF (100 mg/d) (LF100; DicofarmSpA, Rome, Italy) alone</p><p>Lactoferrin + Lactobaccilus GG</p><p>BLF (same dose as above) and Lactobacilus GG (6&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units/d) (Dicoflor 60, Spa Dicofarm)</p><p>Control</p><p>Placebo (2 cc of D5% glucose solution)</p><p>Treatment lasted 6 weeks for infants &#x0003c;1000 g or 4 weeks for infants with birth weight 1001-1500 g or until discharge.

The data presented augments previously known antinfective ability of Lactoferrin in the prevention of late onset sepsis. This effect of Lactoferrin was more pronounced when ELBW infants are included with a number needed to treat of 7. The data does not suggest any additional synergistic effect when probiotics are added to Lactoferrin. According to this data, Lactoferrin has the same impact of prevention IFI as compared to fluconazole.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Although the death rate in Lactoferrin group was one-third of the control one, this did not reach statistical significance mostly due to lack of power. Death attributable to IFI was not different; however, the numbers are too low to make firm conclusion.</p><p>Although, the data is robust, supported by pathophysiologic rationale; clinicians should take the results of this trial by caution and await further data to support these findings <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Outcome data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCN-1-68-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Abstracted from</title><p>Manzoni P, Stolfi I, Messner H, Cattani S, Laforgia N, Romeo MG, <italic>et al</italic>.
