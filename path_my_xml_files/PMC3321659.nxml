Current treatments inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system but suppression of aldosterone may be incomplete. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone has been shown to improve survival in patients with chronic, severe heart failure. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone antagonist expected to have a lower incidence of hormonal side effects than spironolactone.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims:</title><p>To assess the evidence on the therapeutic value of eplerenone for treatment of heart failure in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence review:</title><p>The evidence base consists of one large double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter randomized trial in over 6000 patients with postmyocardial infarction (MI) heart failure, comparing eplerenone plus standard therapy with placebo plus standard therapy. All the main outcomes were patient-oriented. Evidence from this trial shows that eplerenone improves survival and reduces cardiovascular hospitalization/mortality, compared with standard treatment alone. The incidence of hormonal side effects is no greater than with placebo. The risk of hyperkalemia is significantly increased, especially in patients with low creatinine clearance. Eplerenone was both more effective and more costly than standard treatment alone. The cost-effectiveness ratio has been estimated at $US10 402&#x02013;21 876 per life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Place in therapy:</title><p>Eplerenone reduces mortality compared with current treatment alone in patients with post-MI heart failure, at additional cost. Direct comparative evidence is needed to assess its efficacy versus spironolactone. It may be valuable in patients who are intolerant to the hormonal side effects of spironolactone.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>eplerenone</kwd><kwd>evidence</kwd><kwd>heart

The development of heart failure is considered to be a progressive process, characterized by structural changes in the heart and especially in the left ventricle, resulting in an increase in ventricular wall thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ce-1-125">Hunt et al. 2001</xref>). This process is referred to as left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiac remodeling, and may be an important contributor to the development and worsening of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ce-1-125">Hunt et al. 2001</xref>). However, there are diverse mechanisms for heart failure progression, and the exact role of remodeling is not fully understood.</p><p>Heart failure can be considered as an inappropriate response of the systems that normally regulate blood pressure and blood volume, of which the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a particularly important component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ce-1-125">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Injury to the heart (e.g. from MI) reduces cardiac output (the volume of blood pumped per minute), which in turn reduces the flow of blood around the body and tends to reduce arterial blood pressure. Reduced blood flow to the kidneys stimulates the release of renin, an enzyme which converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. A second enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), found mainly in the lungs, converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II has numerous actions on the cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ce-1-125">Remme 1999</xref>). It increases sympathetic nerve activity, which in turn increases heart rate and tends to increase cardiac output. Sympathetic stimulation can also increase renin release. Angiotensin II also acts as a peripheral vasoconstrictor, causing blood vessels to narrow and thus tending to increase arterial blood pressure, and stimulates release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex.</p><p>Aldosterone is a steroid hormone (sometimes referred to as a mineralocorticoid, because its main effects are on mineral balance) that acts on the kidney tubule to increase reabsorption of salt and water and indirectly increases potassium excretion. The increase in salt and water retention increases blood volume, which tends to increase both cardiac output and blood pressure. In healthy individuals and acute situations, restoration of cardiac output and blood pressure to normal inhibits renin release and switches off the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone production also occurs locally in tissues such as the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys, and these local systems may become progressively and chronically activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ce-1-125">Remme 1999</xref>). Chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is maladaptive and may contribute to the characteristic symptoms of heart failure. Fluid retention results in peripheral and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary edema may give rise to breathlessness. Vasoconstriction limits the blood flow to muscles and may contribute to impaired exercise tolerance. Fluid retention and increased blood pressure increase the strain on the heart, which in turn tends to promote cardiac remodeling as the ventricular muscle mass increases to meet the increased load. Angiotensin II also has direct effects on cardiac remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ce-1-125">Remme 1999</xref>).</p><p>There is evidence that aldosterone may also contribute directly to cardiac remodeling and damage to other organs. Aldosterone-generating enzymes and aldosterone receptors have been identified in heart muscle and blood vessels, indicating that these tissues can synthesize and respond to aldosterone independently of the adrenal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ce-1-125">Pitt et al. 2003c</xref>).</p><p>In animal models, aldosterone in combination with a high-salt diet is associated with increased oxidative stress, inflammation of coronary blood vessels, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis and necrosis, renal vascular damage, and proteinuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ce-1-125">Rocha &#x00026; Funder 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ce-1-125">Rudolph et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ce-1-125">Shieh et al. 2004</xref>). These effects could contribute to the development of cardiac remodeling, nephrosclerosis, and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ce-1-125">Rocha &#x00026; Funder 2002</xref>). Aldosterone-induced cardiac fibrosis increases the stiffness of the ventricle, which may contribute to the development of ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ce-1-125">Struthers 2002</xref>), and in clinical studies plasma aldosterone concentrations have been correlated with left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular stiffness, and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ce-1-125">Rudolph et al. 2004</xref>). Aldosterone has also been shown to increase tissue levels of ACE, endothelin, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ce-1-125">Pitt et al. 2003c</xref>). In the blood vessels, aldosterone has been shown to inhibit fibrinolysis and to reduce endothelial nitric oxide (which in turn reduces the ability of the blood vessels to relax in response to vasodilator agents), and may mediate tissue injury by a variety of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ce-1-125">Struthers 2002</xref>). Aldosterone may also block the reuptake of norepinephrine and other catecholamines in the heart, thus potentiating the effect of sympathetic nervous system stimulation and possibly contributing to the development of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ce-1-125">Struthers 2002</xref>). Aldosterone can also decrease the sensitivity of pressure receptors in animals and humans, and this may also be linked to arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ce-1-125">Struthers 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Current therapy options</title><p>Treatment guidelines have been published for the management of patients with heart failure in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ce-1-125">Hunt et al. 2001</xref>) and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ce-1-125">Remme &#x00026; Swedberg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ce-1-125">Swedberg et al. 2005</xref>).

Aldosterone escape has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular events and reduced exercise capacity, and has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the blunting of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ce-1-125">Struthers 2004</xref>). The mechanism of aldosterone escape is unclear, but may be related to non-ACE-dependent pathways for synthesis of angiotensin II (e.g. chymase), and/or direct synthesis of aldosterone in tissues such as the brain, heart, and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ce-1-125">Struthers 2004</xref>).</p><p>Recognition of aldosterone escape has resulted in increased interest in aldosterone antagonists, since these agents directly block the action of aldosterone. Pivotal in this research was the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ce-1-125">Pitt et al. 1999</xref>). This study randomized 1663 patients with chronic severe heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of &#x02264;35% to double-blind treatment with either the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone (25 mg/day) or placebo, in addition to standard treatment with ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, and (in most cases) digoxin.

It has affinity for androgen and progesterone receptors as well as aldosterone (mineralocorticoid) receptors, so it can be associated with troublesome hormonal side effects such as gynecomastia, breast pain and impotence in men and abnormal vaginal bleeding in women. In RALES, gynecomastia or breast pain occurred in 10% of men treated with spironolactone, compared with 1% of placebo-treated men (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), causing 10 men in the spironolactone group to discontinue treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ce-1-125">Pitt et al. 1999</xref>). Furthermore, because one of the effects of aldosterone is to increase potassium excretion, suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or aldosterone antagonists tends to promote potassium retention. Impaired renal function may also promote potassium retention, as the ability of the kidney to excrete excess potassium is reduced, and mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency is common in patients with advanced heart failure, especially in patients with concomitant conditions such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ce-1-125">Sica et al. 2003</xref>). The combination of drug therapy and impaired renal function means that hyperkalemia is not uncommon in patients with heart failure, and may be a serious complication as it can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ce-1-125">Sica et al. 2003</xref>). Strategies for minimizing hyperkalemia include restriction of dietary potassium intake, and dose reduction or temporary withdrawal of drugs that suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Aldosterone receptor antagonist treatment is at greatest risk of inducing hyperkalemia in patients with moderate renal impairment and serum potassium of &#x02265;4.5 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ce-1-125">Sica et al. 2003</xref>). In patients with more advanced renal failure, the risk of hyperkalemia has limited the use of aldosterone antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ce-1-125">McLaughlin et al. 2004</xref>). However, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) the effects of aldosterone blockade on potassium excretion should be minimal, since there is little or no renal excretion to be affected. Limited evidence from a small number of patients indicates that the risk of hyperkalemia with aldosterone antagonists may indeed be lower in ESRD patients, although further studies are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ce-1-125">McLaughlin et al. 2004</xref>).

Data on healthcare resource use (hospitalization, outpatient procedures, and drugs) were collected prospectively during the trial, and combined with unit costs for the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>) or The Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ce-1-125">Zhang &#x00026; Weintraub 2004</xref>) to estimate total direct healthcare costs during the trial period.

Costs for these items were estimated based on 2001 Medicare fees and reimbursement rates. All medications were costed using the US average wholesale price for 2001, except eplerenone which was assigned its average wholesale price for 2004, and all medications were assumed to continue for the duration of follow-up for each patient. The eplerenone cost was $US3.60 per patient per day. Costs were calculated for the average duration of follow-up (16 months). Life-years lost for those patients who died during the trial period were estimated using survival data from three different epidemiologic studies: the Framingham Heart Study, Saskatchewan Health database, and the Worcester Heart Attack Registry. Patients who survived during the trial period were considered to have 0 life-years lost. The difference between life-years lost in the eplerenone and placebo groups gave the number of life-years gained with eplerenone. Lifetime cost-effectiveness ratios ($US per life-year gained) were estimated from the number of life-years gained and the projected lifetime costs. Costs beyond the EPHESUS trial period were estimated by projecting forward the costs in years 2 and 3 of the trial. All costs and life-years were discounted by 3% per year.</p><p>As discussed earlier, utility scores were obtained from a subgroup of 1123 patients from English-speaking countries at 12 months into the trial, using the EQ-5D questionnaire. The number of life-years lost was multiplied by the mean utility score in each treatment group to estimate the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost. As the utility scores were derived only from a subgroup of patients this was considered to be a sensitivity analysis, with the estimate of cost per life-year gained being the main analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>The Dutch analysis appeared to use similar methods, except that the discount rate was 4% per year, costs for eplerenone were not presented, and only the Framingham Heart Study and Saskatchewan Health database were used to estimate life-years gained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ce-1-125">Zhang &#x00026; Weintraub 2004</xref>). However, the information available in the abstract is limited.</p><p>In the analysis with US unit costs, the mean additional cost of eplerenone was $US1513 per patient over the trial period. This was the only component of cost that was statistically significantly different between the eplerenone group and the group receiving standard treatment only, although there were numerical differences in hospital costs that partly offset the additional costs of eplerenone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t10-ce-1-125">Table 10</xref>). Fewer life-years were lost in the eplerenone group, as expected from the survival benefit demonstrated in the clinical study analysis (see Clinical evidence section). The mean number of life-years gained by addition of eplerenone was 0.1 (Framingham), 0.06 (Saskatchewan), and 0.13 (Worcester) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>). Thus, addition of eplerenone to standard therapy was both more effective and more costly than standard therapy alone. The cost-effectiveness ratio was $US13 718 per life-year gained (Framingham estimate), $US21 876 (Saskatchewan estimate), or $US10 402 (Worcester estimate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in utility scores, and the cost per QALY gained was $US20 579 (Framingham estimate), $US32 405 (Saskatchewan estimate), or $US15 330 (Worcester estimate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>). Whether these cost-effectiveness ratios represent acceptable use of resources depends on circumstances and policies in different healthcare systems and/or institutions and is a matter for the judgment of individual decision makers. The authors of the US economic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>) argue that these cost-effectiveness ratios for eplerenone compare favorably with those for other interventions and with a &#x0201c;threshold&#x0201d; of $US50 000 per life-year gained (see Resource utilization section).</p><p>The analysis with Dutch costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ce-1-125">Zhang &#x00026; Weintraub 2004</xref>) produced a similar pattern, with numerically smaller hospital costs in the eplerenone group but no statistically significant difference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t10-ce-1-125">Table 10</xref>). However, this abstract did not present estimates of the cost of eplerenone, overall costs, or cost-effectiveness ratios.</p><p>No data that would allow an estimate of indirect costs were collected during EPHESUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>). However, as the mean age of the EPHESUS patients was 64 years, it is likely that some would have already retired from employment and thus indirect costs may be quite small. Direct evidence is needed to assess this possibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Resource utilization</title><p>The evidence base for eplerenone (the EPHESUS study) relates to the use of eplerenone as an additional treatment on top of existing management strategies for post-MI heart failure. There is no evidence indicating that eplerenone could replace any of the other therapies. Thus, the acquisition cost of eplerenone would be a net addition to the drug budget for the duration of therapy. In the USA, the average wholesale price of eplerenone is $US112.50 per patient per month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce-1-125">Barnes &#x00026; Howard 2005</xref>), which equates to approximately $US1350 per patient per year. The optimal duration of therapy with eplerenone is uncertain, but a period of 1&#x02013;2 years has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ce-1-125">Pitt 2003</xref>).</p><p>Hospitalization is the main component of cost in the management of heart failure (see Disease overview section). As the addition of eplerenone to standard therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular hospitalization compared with standard therapy alone, it might be expected that the reduction in hospitalization costs could offset part or all of the additional costs of eplerenone. However, economic analyses of EPHESUS have found that the reduction in hospitalization costs in the eplerenone group was not statistically significant, and was not sufficient to offset the additional cost of the drug (see Economic evidence section). On the current evidence base, it thus seems likely that addition of eplerenone to standard therapy would result in a net increase in healthcare costs. However, the main economic analysis was conducted using US Medicare costs, and the authors suggest that as Medicare costs tend to be lower than US managed care costs their analysis may have underestimated the potential savings in hospital costs with eplerenone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>). Further economic analyses using other unit costs and in other countries are required to assess this possibility.</p><p>Eplerenone has shown clear evidence of a survival benefit, and it is possible that this could translate into a reduced loss of working days and thus a reduction in indirect cost. Such a reduction in indirect cost might offset more of the eplerenone cost, although there is as yet no evidence that this is the case. The net gain in life-years with eplerenone was quite small, averaging about 0.1 life-years gained per patient (see Economic evidence section above), which may suggest that any corresponding gain in indirect costs might also be small. As heart failure is primarily a disease of elderly people, a substantial proportion of patients may no longer be economically active, and this would also tend to suggest that any gain in indirect costs may be modest.</p><p>The evidence base at present shows quite clearly that the addition of eplerenone to standard therapy is both more effective and more costly than standard therapy alone. Cost effectiveness for the addition of eplerenone in the US was estimated at $US10 402&#x02013;21 876 per life-year gained or $US15 330&#x02013;32 405 per QALY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>). The authors of this US economic analysis argued that the cost-effectiveness ratios for eplerenone compared favorably with those for other interventions in cardiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>). For example, they cited previous cost-effectiveness estimates for captopril therapy versus no captopril in post-MI patients ($US3700&#x02013;10 400 per QALY, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ce-1-125">Tsevat et al. 1995</xref>), and implantable cardiac defibrillators versus amiodarone in survivors of cardiac arrest ($US37 300 per QALY, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ce-1-125">Owens et al. 1997</xref>). The authors also considered that the cost effectiveness of eplerenone was below a &#x0201c;threshold&#x0201d; for acceptable cost effectiveness of $US50 000 per life-year gained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ce-1-125">Weintraub et al. 2005</xref>). Whether the additional benefits of eplerenone justify the additional costs is a matter for decision makers in individual healthcare systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient group/population</title><p>The EPHESUS patient population consisted of men and women with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction 3&#x02013;14 days following an acute MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ce-1-125">Pitt et al. 2003b</xref>).

As the EPHESUS study provides the entire current evidence base for eplerenone in post-MI heart failure, this is the only population to which the results can be confidently applied. However, it is likely that a very high percentage of patients with post-MI heart failure would meet the selection criteria used in EPHESUS (B. Pitt, personal communication). A substudy of 134 eplerenone-treated patients in EPHESUS found that the pharmacokinetic behavior of eplerenone in this population was similar to that in healthy volunteers of similar age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ce-1-125">Reid et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>EPHESUS included several subgroup analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t11-ce-1-125">Table 11</xref>).

Almost all the evidence (except for one small pharmacokinetic study) is derived from EPHESUS, a large double-blind multicenter RCT conducted in over 6000 patients. The main efficacy outcomes in EPHESUS were patient-oriented, measuring mortality and/or hospitalization. The study also collected data on other patient-oriented outcomes such as health status and functional capacity, but as yet this information does not appear to have been published. The main disease-oriented evidence related to the incidence of hyperkalemia, a well-known and potentially serious side effect of drugs that suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.</p><p>As EPHESUS compared eplerenone plus standard therapy with standard therapy alone, the results are of clear relevance to current practice. Patients were treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (87% of patients), beta blockers (75%), aspirin (88%), and diuretics (60%). In addition, 45% of patients received reperfusion therapy or revascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ce-1-125">Pitt et al. 2003b</xref>). This suggests that the survival benefit produced by addition of eplerenone to standard therapy was a genuine improvement over what can be achieved by current best practice, and cannot be attributed to undertreatment in the control group. However, clinical trials are likely to have a higher degree of patient monitoring than is possible in routine practice, and are conducted in defined and selected patient populations. Whether the results can be generalized to populations of heart failure patients other than the population selected for EPHESUS requires further evidence. However, as the EPHESUS population is considered likely to represent a high proportion of patients with post-MI heart failure (B. Pitt, personal communication), the results are likely to be applicable to many, perhaps most, patients in clinical practice.</p><p>Clear evidence shows that addition of eplerenone to standard therapy improves all-cause mortality and combined cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization compared with standard therapy alone. There is also evidence of benefit on secondary endpoints including cardiovascular mortality, risk of sudden cardiac death, and combined all-cause mortality/hospitalization. There was no significant improvement on the risk of cardiovascular hospitalization, though EPHESUS was not powered on this endpoint. The trial also provided evidence that eplerenone had an incidence of hormonal side effects that was no greater than placebo. This contrasts with the 10% incidence of hormonal side effects observed with spironolactone in the RALES study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ce-1-125">Pitt et al. 1999</xref>), indicating that eplerenone may be better tolerated in this regard than spironolactone.</p><p>Limited evidence from a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis indicated that eplerenone treatment could be associated with a shorter length of stay in patients hospitalized for heart failure. Similarly, limited evidence from a substudy found that although eplerenone was associated with higher mean utility score (indicating better health-related quality of life) than standard therapy alone at 12 months, the difference did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>There is evidence that eplerenone treatment is associated with a higher risk of hyperkalemia than standard therapy alone, especially in patients with low creatinine clearance. In the EPHESUS study, where patients with high serum creatinine and/or potassium at baseline were excluded and where serum potassium was regularly monitored throughout treatment, evidence from a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis indicated that the hyperkalemia was nonfatal and manageable. However, this emphasizes the need for monitoring of serum potassium and dose adjustment as necessary during use of eplerenone in routine practice.</p><p>Economic analyses showed that the addition of eplerenone was more costly than standard treatment alone, as well as more effective. Although small and nonsignificant reductions in hospital costs were observed, they were not sufficient to offset the additional cost of eplerenone. The cost-effectiveness ratio in the EPHESUS population was estimated at $US10 402&#x02013;$US21 876 per life-year gained (depending on the method used to estimate life-years). The study authors considered that this compares favorably with other cardiology interventions such as ACE inhibitor use after MI. It will be for individual decision makers to assess whether this represents acceptable value in their particular healthcare systems and institutions.</p><p>EPHESUS demonstrated clinical benefit with eplerenone in a large population (over 6000) of patients with post-MI heart failure. The population enrolled in EPHESUS is considered likely to represent a high proportion of patients with post-MI heart failure. It may be that eplerenone could also be beneficial in other populations, such as the patients with severe heart failure who benefited from spironolactone treatment in the RALES study, but there is as yet no evidence on this issue. It has been recommended that formularies should include both drugs, with eplerenone used in patients who resemble the EPHESUS population and spironolactone used in patients who resemble the RALES population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ce-1-125">Pitt 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce-1-125">Barnes &#x00026; Howard 2005</xref>).

However, at US average wholesale prices generic spironolactone is considerably cheaper than eplerenone ($US14&#x02013;25 compared with $US112.50 per month) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce-1-125">Barnes &#x00026; Howard 2005</xref>). Other authorities have suggested that spironolactone could be tried first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ce-1-125">Jessup 2003</xref>). Evidence from trials directly comparing eplerenone and spironolactone is needed to fully assess the optimum place in therapy for the two drugs, but at present no comparative data are available.</p><p>In summary, the current evidence base indicates that eplerenone improves survival and reduces cardiovascular hospitalization/mortality, compared with standard treatment alone, in patients with heart failure as a complication after acute MI. The incidence of hormonal side effects is no greater than with placebo. Eplerenone is associated with an elevated risk of hyperkalemia that necessitates regular monitoring of serum potassium and dose adjustment as required. Eplerenone is both more effective and more costly than standard treatment alone, and decision makers will need to assess whether this represents added therapeutic value in their own situations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ce-1-125"><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>AHA (American Heart Association)</collab></person-group><source>Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics &#x02014; 2005 Update</source><publisher-loc>Dallas, Texas</publisher-loc><publisher-name>American Heart Association</publisher-name><year>2004</year><comment>Available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.americanheart.org">www.americanheart.org</ext-link> (accessed March 30, 2005).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ce-1-125"><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Anon</collab></person-group><article-title>Inspra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> US Prescribing Information</article-title><comment>Available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.inspra.com">www.inspra.com</ext-link> (accessed April 20, 2005).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ce-1-125"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antman</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name><name><surname>Anbe</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name><name><surname>Armstrong</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on practice guidelines (Committee to revise the 1999 guidelines on the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction)</article-title><source>Circulation</source><year>2004</year><volume>110</volume><fpage>588</fpage><lpage>636</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15289388</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ce-1-125"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barnes</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Eplerenone: a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist for patients with heart failure</article-title><source>Ann Pharmacother</source><year>2005</year><volume>39</volume><fpage>68</fpage><lpage>76</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15590870</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-ce-1-125"><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>BHF (British Heart Foundation)</collab></person-group><article-title>Statistics website</article-title><comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.heartstats.org/topic.asp?id=18">http://www.heartstats.org/topic.asp?id=18</ext-link> (accessed April 26, 2005).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6-ce-1-125"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cleland</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Health economic consequences of the pharmacological treatment of heart failure</article-title><source>Eur Heart J</source><year>1998</year><volume>19</volume><issue>Suppl.
