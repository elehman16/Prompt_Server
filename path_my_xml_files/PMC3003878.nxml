However, the effectiveness of proactive telephone counselling with cold-called smokers from the broader community is unknown. This study examined whether proactive telephone counselling improved abstinence, quit attempts and reduced cigarette consumption among cold-called smokers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>From 48&#x02008;014 randomly selected electronic telephone directory numbers, 3008 eligible smokers were identified and 1562 (51.9%) smokers recruited into the randomised controlled trial. Of these, 769 smokers were randomly allocated to proactive telephone counselling and 793 to the control (ie, mailed self-help) conditions. Six counselling calls were offered to intervention smokers willing to quit within a month and four to those not ready to quit. The 4-month, 7-month and 13-month follow-up interviews were completed by 1369 (87.6%), 1278 (81.8%) and 1245 (79.9%) participants, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Proactive telephone counselling participants were significantly more likely than controls to achieve 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 4 months (13.8% vs 9.6%, p=0.005) and 7 months (14.3% vs 11.0%, p=0.02) but not at 13 months. There was a significant impact of telephone counselling on prolonged abstinence at 4 months (3.4% vs 1.8%, p=0.02) and at 7 months (2.2% vs 0.9%, p=0.02). At 4 months post recruitment, telephone counselling participants were significantly more likely than controls to have made a quit attempt (48.6% vs 42.9%, p=0.01) and reduced cigarette consumption (16.9% vs 9.0%, p=0.0002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Proactive telephone counselling initially increased abstinence and quitting behaviours among cold-called smokers. Given its superior reach, quitlines should consider active telephone recruitment, provided relapse can be reduced.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry; ACTRN012606000221550.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Telephone counselling</kwd><kwd>quitline</kwd><kwd>smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>addiction</kwd><kwd>cessation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proactive telephone counselling involves counsellor-initiated counselling calls and may be offered to treatment seekers after their initial contact or to smokers referred to the quitline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> Yet only 1% to 7% of adult smokers use quitlines annually<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2 b3 b4">2&#x02013;4</xref> despite about 40% of smokers making a quit attempt each year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> Active recruitment strategies that involve recruiter-initiated contact with smokers, such as active telephone recruitment or &#x02018;cold calling&#x02019;, may increase quitline use given it is acceptable to smokers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and can recruit almost 45 times more smokers to cessation interventions than media.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref></p><p>Most randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining proactive telephone counselling recruited smokers seeking treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8 b9 b10 b11 b12 b13 b14 b15 b16 b17 b18 b19 b20 b21 b22 b23">8&#x02013;23</xref> Of those that measured 7-day point prevalence abstinence the majority found a significant effect of proactive telephone counselling at 3 months,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> but not at 6 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> or 12 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.

Eligibility requirements were: daily tobacco use; aged 18&#x02005;years or older; New South Wales (NSW) resident, Australia; and English speaking. Smokers were eligible regardless of their quitting intention.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and evaluation</title><p>Overall, 48&#x02008;014 telephone numbers were randomly selected from the NSW Electronic White Pages telephone directory. Households were mailed an information letter and a trained interviewer telephoned within 2 weeks. Of 43&#x02008;710 households reached, 3008 contained at least 1 eligible smoker. If two or more eligible smokers were residents, a computerised age grid randomly selected one smoker. This smoker was invited to join the RCT and if he/she gave verbal consent completed a baseline computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI; n=1562). Subsequently, the CATI used a random number generator created by an independent programmer to allocate the smoker to proactive telephone counselling (n=769) or self-help materials (control: n=793). Assessors were blind to participant condition during the baseline interview.</p><p>Between January 2006 and June 2008, CATIs were conducted at 4 months, 7 months and 13 months post recruitment to assess smoking cessation. Given follow-up interviews included condition-specific items assessors were not blind to participant condition. However, assessors were independent of the researchers and NSW Quitline. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> outlines participant recruitment and assessment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Recruitment and progress through the trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tobaccocontrol35956fig1"/></fig><p>The University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee and the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee granted ethics approval.</p></sec><sec><title>Conditions</title><sec><title>Proactive telephone counselling</title><p>The contact details of each intervention participant, preferred days and times to call, and responses to selected baseline interview items were included in a referral form and securely emailed to the NSW Quitline the next working day.</p><p>The NSW Quitline called all intervention participants regardless of their quitting intention. The initial proactive counselling call typically occurred within 1 week of referral and aimed to provide smokers with motivation to set a quit date or move closer to quitting. At the end of the initial counselling call, participants were asked if they were willing to quit within a month and counselling calls offered according to their quitting intention. Six attempts were made over a week to reach the participant for each counselling session. At the end of each counselling call the next session was scheduled (if accepted). Although calls were offered as per the schedule, each call was booked according to participant preference.</p><sec><title>&#x02018;Ready to quit&#x02019; callback schedule</title><p>Participants ready to quit within a month were offered an additional five proactive telephone counselling calls: on the quit date, and at 3, 7, 14 and 30&#x02005;days after the quit date. This evidence-based call schedule accounts for the greatest probability of relapse, involves calls being scheduled close to the critical first 2 weeks following a quit attempt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and mimics the standard call schedule offered by NSW Quitline.</p><p>The content of the &#x02018;ready to quit&#x02019; calls included: assessing smoking status (eg, stopped, cut down, relapsed, smoking the same), identifying and coping with triggers (eg, alcohol, stress, tea/coffee, meals), information on effective quitting aids (eg, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion), setting tasks to assist with quitting (eg, listing goals, listing triggers and strategies to deal with triggers) and relapse prevention strategies and promotion of self-efficacy.</p><p>Those who relapsed and set a new quit date within a month restarted the &#x02018;ready to quit&#x02019; schedule, whereas those who did not were offered a call in 1 month's time.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x02018;Not ready to quit&#x02019; callback schedule</title><p>Participants not ready to quit within a month were offered an additional three proactive telephone counselling calls at 1 month, 3 months and 5 months after the initial counselling call. The &#x02018;not ready to quit&#x02019; calls involved motivational interviewing (MI) that focused on encouraging participants to move towards setting a quit date. These calls included assessing smoking status, setting tasks to encourage quitting, talking about available quitting strategies and promotion of self-efficacy.</p><p>If those in the &#x02018;not ready to quit&#x02019; schedule indicated during counselling that they were now willing to quit within a month, they began the &#x02018;ready to quit&#x02019; callback schedule on their nominated quit date.</p></sec><sec><title>Maximum number of counselling calls</title><p>To allow for changes in readiness to quit a maximum of 12 proactive counselling calls were offered regardless of quitting intention.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Advisor training</title><sec><title>NSW Quitline training</title><p>NSW Quitline advisors receive comprehensive theoretical and practical training, including supervision with an experienced mentor before undertaking telephone counselling. A refresher course on cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy and MI is also provided. Most (70%) advisors who delivered the intervention attended booster MI training sessions to assist with supporting smokers who were not ready to quit.</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocols training</title><p>Advisors contacted participants only after attending a 2 h training session where researchers outlined the study protocols.

During the 4-month interview, all participants (given all smoked at baseline) were asked whether they had quit for 1 day or longer since baseline. At the 7-month and 13-month assessments the proportion that made a quit attempt was based on those who had smoked at some time since the previous interview.

At 4 and 7 months post recruitment proactive telephone counselling significantly increased 7-day point prevalence abstinence. However, this was not sustained longer term. The North American Quitline Consortium recently recommended assessing quit rates at 7 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> however many previous trials have done so at 6 months. If we assume that our 4-month, 7-month and 13-month assessments are similar to the 3-month, 6-month and 12-month assessments in other trials, respectively, comparisons can be made. The 7-day point prevalence abstinence findings were consistent with trials of treatment seekers that reported a significant proactive telephone counselling effect at 3 months,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and 6 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> but not at 12&#x02005;months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Apart from two trials that reported much higher proportions,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> our 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates for proactive telephone counselling participants at 4 months (13.8%), 7 months (14.3%) and 13 months (15.2%) were similar to those of treatment seekers: 10% to 15% at 3 months,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> 15% to 20% at 6 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and 14% to 17% at 12&#x02005;months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Our results were also consistent with most trials of actively recruited smokers that reported no impact of proactive telephone counselling on 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref></p><p>Proactive telephone counselling significantly increased 3-month prolonged abstinence at 4 months and 6-month prolonged abstinence at 7 months but not for any measure at 13 months post recruitment. Given most trials with treatment seekers reported that proactive telephone counselling significantly increased prolonged abstinence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8 b9 b10 b11 b12 b13 b14 b15">8&#x02013;15</xref> the present findings are only partially consistent. The proportion of proactive telephone counselling participants who achieved prolonged abstinence appears lower than corresponding rates with treatment seekers,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> particularly the 12-month prolonged abstinence rate (1.4%). This may reflect that giving smokers who had not volunteered for treatment a month in order to make a quit attempt and achieve abstinence is not a long enough grace period to facilitate measurement of prolonged abstinence. Research suggests that 3% to 5% of self-quitters achieve prolonged abstinence at 6 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> The intervention group's 3-month prolonged abstinence at 7 months (6.0%) and 6-month prolonged abstinence at 13 months (5.7%) were higher. Past trials with actively recruited smokers reported proactive telephone counselling had no impact on prolonged abstinence within 12 months,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> therefore this is the first time that significant prolonged abstinence findings with actively recruited smokers have been found at 4-month and 7-month follow-ups.</p><p>Making a quit attempt was significantly more likely for proactive telephone counselling participants than controls at 4 months post recruitment. However, this was not maintained longer term. Similarly, proactive telephone counselling increased treatment seekers' quit attempts in the first 3 months,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> but not at 6 or 12 months post recruitment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> Unlike previous trials with actively recruited smokers,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26 b27 b28">26&#x02013;28</xref> this trial demonstrated that proactive telephone counselling can facilitate quit attempts in the short term among actively recruited smokers. The finding that proactive telephone counselling produced a significant reduction in daily smokers' cigarette consumption at 4 months but not longer term was partly consistent with previous results with treatment seekers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> or actively recruited smokers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> that reported short-term and longer-term treatment effects.</p><p>The RE-AIM (&#x02018;Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance&#x02019;) framework proposes that the combined effects of the intervention's reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation and maintenance determines the public health impact of the intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> Given 52% of eligible smokers were recruited,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> compared to the 1% to 7% of adult smokers calling quitlines annually<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2 b3 b4">2&#x02013;4</xref> this trial dramatically increased the reach of proactive telephone counselling. Efficacy was also found up to 7 months post recruitment. However, there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in long-term maintenance of smoking cessation. This raises the question of whether the mailing of self-help materials to cold-called smokers is a more cost-efficient option.</p><p>The results consistently show short-term but not longer-term effects of proactive telephone counselling with actively recruited smokers. While intervention participants were receiving proactive telephone counselling their cessation outcomes were superior to the control group. More booster telephone sessions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> over a longer period or re-enrolling participants back into quitline treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> may have helped maintain the initial proactive telephone counselling benefit. Further research is needed to determine if such strategies would increase the efficacy of proactive telephone counselling with cold-called smokers longer term.</p><p>Limitations included the following. First, that the reach of active telephone recruitment was restricted because the telephone directory did not contain unlisted or mobile phone numbers. Random digit dialling may have increased the reach of recruitment. Second, participants were not asked about their mental health or use of illicit drugs at baseline. Therefore, the potential influence of such factors on the proportion of smokers achieving abstinence is unknown. Third, no biochemical validation of self-reported cessation was conducted. An expert workgroup recommended that it is unnecessary for large-scale population-based trials without face-to-face contact to conduct biochemical validation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> Given evidence that disconfirmation rates are low and do not differ significantly between conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> the lack of biochemical validation is unlikely to have influenced the outcomes. Fourth, an untreated control group was not included because it was not appropriate to withhold treatment having actively recruited smokers. Fifth, the impact on participant abstinence of other household smokers using the self-help materials mailed to the control group or phoning the quitline to receive similar support to their intervention group housemates is unknown. Finally, tobacco control activities in NSW during the trial such as media campaigns, new graphic warnings on cigarette packets and increased smoking restrictions inside licensed premises may have improved outcomes but are likely to have impacted both conditions equally.</p><p>Proactive telephone counselling initially increased abstinence, quit attempts and cigarette reduction among smokers actively recruited by telephone. Given 52% of eligible smokers were recruited,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> compared to the 1% to 7% of adult smokers calling quitlines annually,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2 b3 b4">2&#x02013;4</xref> active telephone recruitment has considerable potential for facilitating more successful quit attempts provided longer-term efficacy and cessation rates broadly similar to smokers seeking treatment can be achieved.
