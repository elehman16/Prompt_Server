This study investigated the effect of a gastric acid suppressant, famotidine (a histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist), on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This two-period, two-treatment crossover study randomized 18 healthy subjects to receive a single oral dose of apixaban 10 mg with and without a single oral dose of famotidine 40 mg administered 3 hours before dosing with apixaban. Plasma apixaban concentrations were measured up to 60 hours post-dose and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Famotidine did not affect maximum apixaban plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) or area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinite time (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>). Point estimates for ratios of geometric means with and without famotidine were close to unity for C<sub>max</sub> (0.978) and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> (1.007), and 90% confidence intervals were entirely contained within the 80%&#x02013;125% no-effect interval.

Apixaban pharmacokinetics would not be affected by an increase in gastrointestinal pH due to underlying conditions (eg, achlorhydria), or by gastrointestinal pH-mediated effects of other histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists, antacids, or proton pump inhibitors. Given that famotidine is also an inhibitor of the human organic cation transporter (hOCT), these results indicate that apixaban pharmacokinetics are not influenced by hOCT uptake transporter inhibitors. Overall, these results support that apixaban can be administered without regard to coadministration of gastric acid modifiers.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>apixaban</kwd><kwd>factor Xa inhibitor</kwd><kwd>famotidine</kwd><kwd>H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists</kwd><kwd>hOCT inhibitor</kwd><kwd>drug&#x02013;drug interaction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Apixaban is an oral, potent, reversible, direct, and highly selective inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-cpaa-5-059">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-cpaa-5-059">2</xref> which plays a pivotal role in the clotting cascade by decreasing the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-cpaa-5-059">3</xref> Apixaban is approved as a fixed dose in a number of countries for thromboprophylaxis in patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-cpaa-5-059">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-cpaa-5-059">6</xref> and for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cpaa-5-059">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cpaa-5-059">8</xref> Apixaban is also being developed for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cpaa-5-059">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cpaa-5-059">10</xref></p><p>Clinical studies show that apixaban has a predictable pharmacokinetic profile across a wide range of doses. The oral bioavailability of apixaban is approximately 50%, and its elimination half-life is approximately 12 hours.

Over-the-counter availability of gastric acid suppressants further increases the likelihood that coadministration of these agents with apixaban will occur. While a significant pharmacokinetic interaction was not expected between apixaban and drugs that modify gastric pH, because apixaban has no ionizable groups, it was important to confirm in a clinical trial whether alterations in gastric pH would affect the pharmacokinetics of apixaban.</p><p>Famotidine is a commonly prescribed histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist that suppresses secretion of gastric acid by parietal cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-cpaa-5-059">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cpaa-5-059">20</xref> Famotidine was selected for this study because it is a widely used gastric acid suppressant with a well established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, in addition to a rapid onset of action following single-dose administration.

Upon administration of a single 10 mg dose of apixaban 3 hours after a single 40 mg dose of famotidine, the geometric means for apixaban C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;T</sub> were unchanged, and the 90% CIs for their ratio of geometric means, with and without famotidine, were entirely contained within the prespecified no-effect interval of 80%&#x02013;125%, indicating no effect of famotidine on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban.</p><p>The elimination half-life of apixaban has been well characterized in numerous clinical pharmacology studies and is approximately 12 hours. Accordingly, the 60-hour, intensively sampled pharmacokinetic monitoring period for apixaban and a 3-day washout period (approximately five elimination half-lives for apixaban) were considered appropriate in this study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cpaa-5-059">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cpaa-5-059">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cpaa-5-059">27</xref> The famotidine dose (40 mg) and time interval (administered 3 hours prior to apixaban) in combination with the dose of apixaban (10 mg) were considered to represent the largest potential for an interaction due to gastric acid suppression.</p><p>The lack of a pharmacokinetic drug&#x02013;drug interaction observed between apixaban and famotidine is in agreement with the physicochemical properties of apixaban. Apixaban is a compound that lacks ionizable groups in its molecular structure, and thus its aqueous solubility is not affected by changes in pH. The results of this study suggest that increases in gastric pH due to other gastric acid modifiers (such as other H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, and antacids) or the presence of abnormally elevated gastric pH (eg, achlorhydria) are unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of apixaban.</p><p>It is important to consider the potential for metabolic or transporter drug&#x02013;drug interactions between famotidine and apixaban. While apixaban is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein, famotidine is minimally metabolized, is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cpaa-5-059">20</xref> Famotidine has minimal potential for CYP450-mediated drug&#x02013;drug interactions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cpaa-5-059">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-cpaa-5-059">24</xref> However, it is an inhibitor of hOCT uptake transporters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-cpaa-5-059">25</xref> The data from the current study indicate that the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are not influenced by hOCT-3, hOCT-2, or hOCT-1 inhibitors such as famotidine, and confirm the in vitro findings, indicating that apixaban is not a substrate for hOCT-2 transporters (data on file, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA).</p><p>In summary, the gastric acid inhibitor, famotidine, did not affect the pharmacokinetics of apixaban, consistent with the pH-independent solubility properties of apixaban. In addition, no significant drug&#x02013;drug interaction between apixaban and famotidine occurred via the human organic cation transporter system (hOCT-1, hOCT-2, and hOCT-3). Administration of apixaban alone and with famotidine was well tolerated in healthy subjects. Overall, these results suggest that increases in gastric pH due to other gastric acid modifiers such as antacids, proton pump inhibitors, or other H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists are unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of apixaban by means of their influence on pH or inhibition of hOCT. Other inhibitors of hOCT are also not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of apixaban.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Matthew Farmer, Tong Li, and Zhigang Yu to this study.
