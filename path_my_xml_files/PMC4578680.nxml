In Dignity Therapy, patients create a formalized &#x0201c;legacy&#x0201d; document that records their most cherished memories, their lessons learned in life, as well as their hopes and dreams for loved ones in the future. To date, this treatment has been studied for its impact on mitigating distress within hospice and palliative care populations and has provided mixed results. This study will instead focus on whether Dignity Therapy enhances positive outcomes in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this study, 90 patients with cancer receiving hospice or palliative care will complete a mixed-methods randomized controlled trial of Dignity Therapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45) versus Supportive Attention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45). The patients will be enrolled in the study for 3 weeks, receiving a total of six study visits. The primary outcomes examine whether the treatment will quantitatively increase levels of positive affect and a sense of life closure. Secondary outcomes focus on gratitude, hope, life satisfaction, meaning in life, resilience, and self-efficacy. Using a fixed, embedded dataset design, this study will additionally use qualitative interviews to explore patients&#x02019; perceptions regarding the use of positive outcome measures and whether these outcomes are appropriately matched to their experiences in therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Dignity Therapy has shown mixed results when evaluating its impact on distress, although no other study to date has solely focused on the potential positive aspects of this treatment. This study is novel in its use of mixed methods assessments to focus on positive outcomes, and will provide valuable information about patients&#x02019; direct experiences in this area.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN91389194?q=&#x00026;filters=conditionCategory:Cancer,ageRange:Adult&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=1&#x00026;totalResults=1323&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN91389194</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer care</kwd><kwd>Hospice care</kwd><kwd>Palliative care</kwd><kwd>Dignity therapy</kwd><kwd>End-of-life care</kwd><kwd>Life satisfaction</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Positive outcomes</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Caring for cancer patients in hospice or palliative care involves addressing many physical, psychological, social, and spiritual concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In doing so, there is often a two-fold mission: 1) decreasing suffering and distress while 2) increasing positive quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, in order to address the psychological concerns of cancer patients receiving hospice or palliative care, several psychotherapies have been created and studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>One such therapy is Dignity Therapy; a brief, individualized psychotherapy designed to address the emotional and existential needs of adults who are receiving hospice or palliative care while enhancing a sense of legacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In therapy, patients complete an interview that highlights their most important memories, the times they felt most alive, and their most important accomplishments and roles. Additionally, patients are able to reflect on the lessons they have learned in life, and describe any hopes and dreams they have for their loved ones in the future. This interview is recorded, transcribed, and edited to create a formalized &#x0201c;legacy document&#x0201d; which can then be given to the patient&#x02019;s family and friends as a keepsake.</p><p>The first Phase I trial of Dignity Therapy with 100 patients demonstrated significant decreases in depressive symptoms and patients&#x02019; sense of suffering at post-treatment, with the majority of patients reporting an increased sense of dignity (76&#x000a0;%), sense of purpose (68&#x000a0;%), and sense of meaning (67&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A subsequent study of 60 family members, whose loved ones had completed Dignity Therapy, resulted in similar trends, providing corroboration that the treatment was viewed favorably and was highly recommended as a treatment for others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The most recent Phase III randomized controlled trial of Dignity Therapy compared patients who received Dignity Therapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;108), Client Centered Care (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;107), and Standard Care (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;111) on the primary outcomes of distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, no significant differences were found between the 3 treatment groups on the primary measures of distress. However, on secondary measures the Dignity Therapy patients reported significantly higher ratings regarding the treatment being helpful, improving quality of life, increasing a sense of dignity, being beneficial to the family, and changing the way the family appreciated the patient. In light of the mixed results, the researchers noted the study instruments may have been unresponsive to the beneficial changes demonstrated in the Dignity Therapy group. As such, the researchers concluded that &#x0201c;future research exploring the beneficial effects of Dignity Therapy will help unravel the psychological, spiritual, and existential complexities for an individual facing death&#x02026;&#x0201d; (p. 9).</p><p>We began to explore the beneficial effects of Dignity Therapy at San Diego Hospice and the Institute for Palliative Care in 2009. In this environment, we provided Dignity Therapy as a clinical service to patients with cancer and other diagnoses, serving as the first hospice in the country to do so. As a result, we gathered valuable pilot data regarding the referral processes, logistics, and basic costs of treatment as well as the characteristics of patients who completed Dignity Therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We additionally gathered pilot data from 23 patients, 7 family members, and 18 hospice staff who were asked to rate the treatment. All three groups rated Dignity Therapy as &#x0201c;highly worthwhile&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;helpful.&#x0201d; During additional qualitative interviews, the staff did not frequently describe Dignity Therapy as a tool to mitigate distress, but spoke more often about it as a <italic>positively enhancing experience</italic>; one that provided a valuable sense of contentment, gratitude, hope, meaning, and resilience for patients as well as a way to address unfinished business and create a sense of connectedness among the patients, families, and friends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the results of the previous randomized controlled trials as well as our pilot studies suggest that Dignity Therapy can provide positive benefits, although these outcomes have not been systematically investigated to date. Therefore this study is designed to measure the <italic>positive impact</italic> of enhancing legacy via Dignity Therapy among patients with cancer receiving hospice or palliative care. Specifically, this study aims to examine whether Dignity Therapy can significantly increase positive outcomes such as contentment, gratitude, hope, meaning, positive affect, satisfaction with life, and a sense of life closure. An additional line of inquiry is whether patients&#x02019; levels of resilience and self-efficacy play a mediating or moderating role in the treatment&#x02019;s impact.</p><p>Moreover, patients in this study will be asked to share their direct experience with the therapy, and will be asked to provide their feedback about the applicability of positive outcome measures. Using a mixed-methods design, the study incorporates quantitative treatment outcomes in addition to qualitative data regarding patients&#x02019; perceptions. These results can guide future positive outcome research, particularly as we aim to design studies that fit patients&#x02019; needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><p>This study involves a mixed-methods randomized controlled trial of Dignity Therapy versus a Supportive Attention control group (please see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for an overview of the study activities). Specifically, this study involves providing either Dignity Therapy or Supportive Attention to 90 patients receiving hospice or palliative care who have a primary diagnosis of cancer. The aim is to assess whether patients who receive Dignity Therapy will exhibit significantly greater contentment, hope, gratitude, positive affect and sense of closure, and whether patients&#x02019; levels of resilience and self-efficacy mediate or moderate this effect.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow-chart of the randomized controlled trial of Dignity Therapy focused on positive outcomes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12904_2015_41_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>All of the patients in the study will be followed for 14&#x000a0;days, with evaluations occurring at baseline and at the end of treatment.

In this study, the therapy will be performed by trained Master&#x02019;s level mental health counselors who will meet with patients during 4 home-based visits over the course of 3 weeks, each session lasting approximately 1 hour. The first session will involve a consultation to evaluate the patient&#x02019;s motivation for therapy and to determine any specific goals they have for creating the legacy document. The second session will involve the completion of a life reflection interview using the standardized interview protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

This session fosters autonomy by allowing the patient to provide personal edits as necessary, and ensures accuracy of content. Additional therapeutic value is gained since the reading provides an emotional reminder of the patient&#x02019;s cherished memories and verifies that his/her history has been witnessed and recorded according to his/her wishes. The final session will then be conducted after all of the patient&#x02019;s edits have been completed and formatted into a bound document.

Sample items include, &#x0201c;I can usually handle whatever comes my way&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;When I am confronted with a problem, I can usually find several solutions.&#x0201d; This scale is used to identify whether self-efficacy is a mediating or moderating variable for patients in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar10"><title>Study completion questionnaire</title><p>To gather patient feedback regarding the impact of the therapy sessions, a researcher-derived questionnaire has been created for this study. The questionnaire contains 30 brief Likert-scale items for patients to rate, at the completion of the study, whether the treatment they received (either Dignity Therapy or Supportive Attention) was helpful, worthwhile, and enhanced their sense of personhood. Sample items include, &#x0201c;Participating in this study has helped me feel like a person, not just a disease,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;The process of completing this study was worthwhile.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Qualitative interview</title><p>As part of this study&#x02019;s mixed-methods design, a randomly-selected subset of Dignity Therapy patients will complete a qualitative interview in addition to the quantitative measures described above. This one-hour qualitative interview will include 7 semi-structured questions asking patients for feedback regarding their Dignity Therapy experience - what worked, what did not, and what may have surprised them about the process. Patients will also be asked whether measuring positive outcomes is &#x0201c;in sync&#x0201d; with their experience. To this end, sample questions from the qualitative interview include: &#x0201c;When future researchers are interested in these types of &#x02018;positive changes,&#x02019; what types of questions would you suggest they ask?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;In your opinion, were there positive or negative changes we <italic>should</italic> have asked about as you completed your legacy document, but did not?&#x0201d; These data will help shape future positive outcome studies &#x02013; ones that can be based directly on patients&#x02019; perspectives in hospice and palliative care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be obtained for all variables, including distributions, means, medians, variances, standard deviations, skewness, kurtosis, ranges, and quartiles. Tests of normality of continuous measures will be made using the Shapiro-Wilk W and the Kolomogorov D statistics in conjunction with plots of the distribution of data and descriptive measurements. The data will also be examined for homogeneity of variance. An appropriate statistical method will be employed to correct for any abnormalities (such as log, square root, and inverse). All statistical tests will be two-tailed. Differences will be considered statistically significant provided a <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 is obtained. The comparability of the two treatment groups in baseline demographic and clinical features will be tested with analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for continuous variables and Chi-square analyses for dichotomous variables.</p><p>Analyses will be based on a Random Regression Model (RRM) for continuous data using a generalized linear model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This model was selected over more traditional analytic approaches such as a change score, end-point, or repeated measures analysis of variance for several reasons. First, a 14&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% death rate is anticipated based on pilot studies, and using this statistical method, we will be able to include all of the patients with missing data, early termination, or death without relying on data imputation procedures. Second, both fixed and time-varying covariates and systematic person-specific deviations from the average time trend are allowed in this method. A fully saturated treatment by time model will be utilized for inference. Co-variance structure will be chosen based on Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC). Random group level treatment effects will also be evaluated for importance based on the model AIC. This allows for any group level effects to be incorporated into the model. Denominator degrees of freedom will be calculated using the Kenward-Roger small sample correction.</p><p>In order to assess how resilience and self-efficacy may mediate or moderate the impact of Dignity Therapy, we will use a RRM method similar to the primary hypotheses. The effect of mediator and moderator variables will be explored using RRM for each candidate mediator and moderator as a main effect and an interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. If the interaction effect is significant, pairwise comparisons of groups will be performed. These analyses will examine interactions of treatment group with time at each level of the mediator and moderator, and evaluate treatment levels within each subgroup.</p><p>Finally, the time course of treatment of each individual will be modeled by projecting the outcome measures on orthogonal linear, and quadratic of time. Model diagnostics will be used to determine the suitability of an autoregressive error component and nonlinear effects for assessment time. Analyses will be performed using the SPSS (version 21.0) procedures. Data will be included for all patients completing at least one assessment after baseline.</p><p>The assumptions for sample size and power calculation are based on our pilot data and using procedures described by Hedeker et al. for Random Regression Models (RRM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. With the proposed sample size of 86 subjects without attrition or 90 subjects adjusted for attrition (45 for each of the two groups), the study will have power of 80&#x000a0;% to yield a statistically significant result for a medium effect size. Here, medium effect size is defined as a between-group difference increasing linearity from 0 at baseline to 0.5 SD units at session 4. Results from this study will provide information regarding appropriate power calculations to further determine necessary effect sizes for larger-scale studies in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Qualitative analyses</title><p>Using a methodology of Coding Consensus, Co-occurrence, and Comparison, rooted in Grounded Theory, a qualitative analysis of interviews among 25 randomly-selected patients completing Dignity Therapy will be completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These one-hour, semi-structured interviews will be recorded and transcribed, then two study investigators will independently read a randomly-selected 20&#x000a0;% subset of the interview transcripts. The initial themes present will be discussed and compared. A coding matrix will then be devised and applied to subsequent transcripts until saturation is achieved. Upon saturation, the coding matrix will be applied to all the study transcripts in their entirety with coding being completed at the paragraph level. During this coding process, disagreements in assignment or description of codes will be resolved through a discussion between the investigators and an enhanced definition of codes. A detailed analysis and calculation of the frequencies of codes and nodal relationships will be completed using Dedoose software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will measure the positive outcomes among cancer patients in hospice and palliative care who receive Dignity Therapy versus those who receive Supportive Attention. Although Dignity Therapy is designed to address the emotional and existential needs of patients, little is known about how the treatment may increase positive aspects such as contentment, gratitude, hope, meaning, positive affect, sense of closure, and satisfaction with life.</p><p>This study addresses these questions, and utilizes a novel mixed-method design to additionally gather qualitative data regarding patients&#x02019; personal experiences with Dignity Therapy. These qualitative interviews will help researchers better understand whether positive measures are viewed as meaningful or relevant to patients, thereby leading to refined positive outcome studies in the future.</p><p>In sum, this study helps address critical questions pertaining to positive psychotherapeutic outcomes in cancer care via an emphasis on increasing patients&#x02019; sense of legacy. It has been noted that patients in today&#x02019;s world of health care resonate more strongly with how healthcare can <italic>enhance</italic> their experience and quality of life versus only focusing on how treatments may diminish pain or suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Randomized controlled trials that systemically measure the <italic>beneficial</italic> impacts of treatments are needed now and in the future in order to fortify the hospice and palliative care response to these important patients&#x02019; needs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LMT is the study&#x02019;s principal investigator with oversight of all research operations.
