The following week participants performed 10 sets x 5 repetitions at 80&#x000a0;% of their 1RM barbell back squat for 3 consecutive days and 48&#x000a0;h following the third lifting bout participants returned for (T2) testing whereby they repeated the T1 battery. Immediately following and 24&#x000a0;h after the three lifting bouts, participants were randomly assigned to consume one of two commercial products in 600&#x000a0;mL of tap water: 1) BCAAs and CHO (3&#x000a0;g/d L-leucine, 1&#x000a0;g/d L-isoleucine and 2&#x000a0;g/d L-valine with 2&#x000a0;g of CHO; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15), or 2) 42&#x000a0;g of CHO only (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15). Additionally, venous blood was drawn 24&#x000a0;h following the first and second lifting bouts and 48&#x000a0;h following the third bout to assess serum myoglobin concentrations, and a visual analog scale was utilized prior, during, and after the 3-d protocol to measure subjective perceptions of muscular soreness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were similar decrements in 1RM squat strength and isokinetic peak torque measures in the BCAA-CHO and CHO groups.

Indeed, there have been reviews regarding the efficacy of a wide array of nutritional ergogenic aids in optimizing strength and power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Specifically, supplemental protein (e.g. whey, casein, soy, and egg) and/or amino acid ingestion enhances post-exercise recovery by increasing skeletal muscle protein synthesis and reducing muscle proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] while also potentially reducing post-exercise skeletal muscle inflammation and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Researchers have also examined if amino acid supplementation can mitigate post-exercise muscle damage. Jackman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported that branched chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation attenuated perceived muscle soreness in an untrained population, but supplementation did not alter muscle function following unilateral eccentric knee extension exercise. Howatson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] also reported that 7&#x000a0;days of BCAA &#x02018;loading&#x02019; in resistance-trained participants attenuated increases in serum creatine kinase (a muscle damage marker) and perceived soreness following one bout of drop-jump induced muscle damage. Other research has shown that BCAAs may foster a beneficial hormonal environment as well as blunt the rise in serum creatine kinase levels following intense resistance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nosaka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported that BCAA supplementation in untrained individuals reduced muscle damage and soreness when consumed immediately before and during a 4-d recovery period of an eccentric leg extensor bout. However, opposite findings also exist. For instance, White et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported that carbohydrate/protein supplementation did not have an effect on muscle soreness, performance or serum creatine kinase levels following eccentric quadriceps contractions. Stock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] similarly reported that a leucine/carbohydrate beverage provided to subjects prior to and after 6 sets of heavy back squats did not affect serum creatine kinase, serum lactate dehydrogenase, or muscle soreness up to 72&#x000a0;h following exercise. These authors also reported that back squat performance was not improved with leucine/carbohydrate beverage administration 72&#x000a0;h following the initial heavy squat.</p><p>While there is some evidence to suggest that amino acid supplementation may be beneficial for promoting various facets of post-exercise skeletal muscle recovery (i.e., increasing muscle protein synthesis and reducing muscle protein breakdown), there are also studies finding that BCAAs are not useful in improving markers of muscle damage, soreness and performance during or following acute exercise protocols. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of BCAA and carbohydrate (BCAA-CHO) versus carbohydrate (i.e., sports drink; CHO) supplementation on markers of muscle damage and performance as well as gross immunological markers during and after a 3-day high intensity back squat protocol. Based upon the aforementioned literature, we hypothesized that BCAA-CHO would attenuate performance decrements and/or positively affect muscle damage markers compared to CHO supplementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Prior to initiating this study, the protocol was reviewed and approved by the Auburn University Institutional Review Ethics Committee (protocol #14-328), and was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Apparently healthy males (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) volunteered to take part in this investigation. Subjects gave written consent and completed the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire as well as a health history questionnaire to detect potential risk factors that might be aggravated by strenuous physical activity.

In addition, participants were asked to forgo any strenuous activity for at least 48&#x000a0;h prior to arrival in order to minimize any residual markers of muscle damage. To assure adequate hydration status, urine specific gravity (USG) was measured using handheld refractometer (ATAGO 2393, Bellevue, WA, USA). The hydration threshold prior to exercise testing included a USG of 1.020&#x000a0;g&#x02022;mL<sup>-1</sup>. For subjects that were dehydrated, 0.5&#x000a0;L of water were provided and USG was re-determined 30&#x000a0;min later. Baseline venous blood samples were then collected into a 5&#x000a0;mL serum separator tube and a 3&#x000a0;mL EDTA tube (BD Vacutainer, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for subsequent analysis of serum and whole blood markers, respectively. Following blood draws, all participants consumed a cereal bar (Kellogg&#x02019;s Nutri-Grain&#x000ae; bar; 2&#x000a0;g protein, 24&#x000a0;g carbohydrates, 3&#x000a0;g fat, 120&#x000a0;kcal) in order to standardize pre-testing meals. Participants then had their right mid-thigh shaved and alcohol-swabbed for electromyography (EMG) electrode placement and were seated on System 4 Pro Biodex isokinetic dynamometer (BioDex Medical Inc., New York, USA). Bottom start-position knee flexion was set at 90&#x000b0; and full knee extension was set at 10&#x000b0;. Following a familiarizing practice trial, participants performed a maximal knee extensor isometric contraction for 5&#x000a0;s in order to obtain peak torque and EMG maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) values. Following a brief recovery period (~1&#x000a0;min), maximal knee extensor isokinetic torque with EMG activity was measured across 5 repetitions at 60&#x000b0;/s and 120&#x000b0;/s, with a brief rest period (~1-2&#x000a0;min) between bouts.</p><p>A 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min recovery period was allowed following isometric/isokinetic dynamometry. Following this recovery period, participants began a one repetition maximum (1RM) back squat protocol. The first set of back squats occurred with the bar only (20&#x000a0;kg). Participants were allowed a 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min recovery period and then performed 5 repetitions at ~50&#x000a0;% of their putative 1RM. Participants were allowed a 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min recovery period and then performed 2 repetitions at ~80&#x000a0;% of their putative 1RM. Thereafter, participants performed 1 rep whereby ~2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;kg were added until they were unable to achieve a successful lift. To ensure that proper depth on each back squat repetition was accomplished, participants were asked to make contact with a box that was behind them without sitting on it entirely. The box was set at a height where the participant&#x02019;s femur was perpendicular to the ground during the bottom-eccentric portion of the back squat. Following 1RM back squat testing, participants were scheduled subsequent experimental visits. In addition, they were asked to not perform any strenuous physical activity for at least 48&#x000a0;h prior to their day 2 visit described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Day 2 (bout 1)</title><p>Approximately one week following day 1 (T1), participants reported to the laboratory 4&#x000a0;h fasted, were checked for hydration status and were given a standardized cereal bar to standardize pre-exercise meals. Participants were then asked to mark on a visual analog scale to indicate their perceived soreness (described below). Participants then performed a warm up protocol of 5 repetitions at 20&#x000a0;%, 40&#x000a0;%, and 60&#x000a0;% of their back squat 1RM with 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min between sets. Following the warm-up protocol, participants performed 10 sets of 5 repetitions at 80&#x000a0;% of their back squat 1RM with a 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min recovery period between each set. If participants were unable to complete the repetitions, a 5&#x000a0;% reduction in resistance weight was employed. Lifting volumes for the bout 1 session were recorded and included dropped weights. Immediately following completion of this protocol, participants were randomly assigned to consume one of two commercial products in 600&#x000a0;mL of tap water and the products were provided to participants by laboratory testers. The composition of each product is described in further detail below:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>BCAAs and CHO (BCAA-CHO) (2 servings of AMINO1, Musclepharm Corp., Denver, CO, USA); per 2 servings: 10&#x000a0;kcal, 3&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L-leucine, 1&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L-isoleucine and 2&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L-valine with 2&#x000a0;g of non-sugar carbohydrates</p></list-item><list-item><p>42&#x000a0;g of carbohydrates (CHO; Powerade, Atlanta, GA, USA); per serving: 168&#x000a0;kcal, 40&#x000a0;g sugar whereby 57&#x000a0;% of the sugar is fructose, 39&#x000a0;% is glucose, 4&#x000a0;% is sucrose and the remainder of the sugars are trace amounts of lactose and maltose</p></list-item></list></p><p>While these supplements were not standardized to CHO or Calorie content, our intent was to provide a practical comparison between these two products. Alternatively stated, we surmised that (in a real-world setting) participants would either consume a sports drink-like CHO beverage or the experimental BCAA-CHO beverage and, thus, we compared two servings of each supplement regardless of Calorie or CHO content. Finally, we elected to provide participants two servings of BCAA-CHO given that two servings contain a total of 3&#x000a0;g of L-leucine and this amount has been posited to be a &#x02018;threshold&#x02019; at which post-exercise muscle protein synthesis is optimized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Of note, the testers and participants were blinded to the supplement conditions whereby BCAA-CHO were packaged in &#x02018;B&#x02019; containers, and CHO was packaged in &#x02018;A&#x02019; containers by a person in the laboratory who did not interact with persons involved in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Day 3 (bout 2)</title><p>Twenty four hours following day 2 (bout 1), participants reported to the laboratory 4&#x000a0;h fasted, were checked for hydration status and blood was drawn/collected into a 5&#x000a0;ml serum tube and 3&#x000a0;ml EDTA tubes. Participants were then asked to mark on a visual analog scale to indicate their perceived soreness. Participants then performed the 10 sets of 5 repetitions at 80&#x000a0;% of their back squat 1RM described during day 2 above.

Prior to electrode placement the participants&#x02019; mid-thighs were shaved, abraded and cleaned using alcohol swabs. A Noraxon Myosystem 1200 (Noraxon USA INC, Scottsdale, AZ) EMG system was used to obtain measurements of neuromuscular activation during MVIC and isokinetic trials. Surface EMG data were sampled at 1000&#x000a0;Hz. Raw EMG signals were full-wave rectified and filtered using a moving average with a 200&#x000a0;ms window. The MVIC was obtained during the isometric knee torque test. Peak values from MVIC trials were used to normalize peak values obtained during the isokinetic trials. Normalized isokinetic values were subsequently represented as percentage of MVIC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Whole blood and serum analyses</title><p>On the days of blood collection, all 3&#x000a0;mL EDTA tubes were refrigerated at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

A human ELISA for myoglobin was used to determine serum concentrations (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).

Herein, we report that compared to CHO supplementation, BCAA-CHO supplementation was not able to reduce decrements in performance variables, markers of muscle damage and perceived muscle soreness increased over the study duration in both groups. These findings are discussed in greater detail below.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>BCAA-CHO supplementation does not reduce decrements in lower body strength after three consecutive high intensity exercise bouts</title><p>As mentioned previously, some reports suggest that BCAA supplementation reduces muscle soreness following muscle-damaging protocols, although they do not appear to aid in attenuating the reduction of muscular performance following intense resistance training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our findings are in agreement with these reports in that BCAA-CHO-supplemented participants did not experience any significant performance outcomes relative to CHO-supplemented participants following three rigorous resistance exercise bouts. This contrasts the findings of Kirby et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] who supplemented 250&#x000a0;mg/kg of leucine following 100 depth jumps and 6 sets of 10 repetitions on eccentric leg presses, and subsequently observed a greater maintenance of isometric squat force relative to placebo and control groups. The reason for our findings are likely related to the resistance training protocol being too much of a muscle-damaging stimulus. Alternatively stated, while limited evidence suggests that BCAA administration may prevent muscle soreness and markers of muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], muscle damage inflicted by resistance exercise is likely not mitigated by nutritional factors and, thus, occurs in spite of macronutrient provision. Therefore, while BCAA provision following exercise enhances post-exercise muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and reduce muscle proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], our findings suggest that BCAA-CHO supplementation does not prevent muscle fibers from being damaged during rigorous resistance training stimulus, and this ultimately leads to the performance decrements observed herein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>BCAAs and CHO provision do not differentially alter myoglobin serum concentrations or muscle soreness</title><p>BCAAs have been reported to attenuate the rise in serum myoglobin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] as well as attenuate perceived muscle soreness following rigorous exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, our findings differ from the aforementioned reports. Reasons for the divergence of our findings could be due to differences in exercise protocols, as Shimomura et al. had participants perform one bout of 7 sets of 20 body-weighted back squat repetitions, whereas our investigation applied 3 consecutive days of high intensity heavy-weighted back squats. Further, Shimomura et al. administered a BCAA supplement prior to the exercise protocol, whereas we administered the supplement following exercise. Notwithstanding, our data are in agreement with White et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] who reported that a carbohydrate/protein drink, which was rich in BCAAs, did not have an effect on muscle soreness, muscle performance or creatine kinase levels following eccentric quadriceps contractions. Our data are also in agreement with Stock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] who reported that a leucine/carbohydrate beverage provided to volunteers prior to and after 6 sets of heavy back squats did not affect serum creatine kinase, serum lactate dehydrogenase, or muscle soreness at 24&#x000a0;h, 48&#x000a0;h, or 72&#x000a0;h following exercise. Additionally, others have reported that L-leucine administration does not differentially alter serum myoglobin following depth jumps or eccentric leg presses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; a finding which is also in agreement with our current data. Therefore, we again contend that BCAA provision likely does not prevent muscle fibers from being damaged during and/or following a training stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>BCAA-CHO supplementation reduced exercise-induced increases in monocyte differentials versus CHO supplementation</title><p>Interestingly, BCAA-CHO supplementation prevented the rise in monocyte percentages compared to the CHO group, although monocyte counts were not altered between or within groups. While aerobic and resistance exercise have been reported to transiently increase leukocyte number and white blood cell differentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], levels typically return to baseline within hours of endurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and resistance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Vigorous physical activity has also been shown to induce neutrophil proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and intense cycling bouts have been shown to increase neutrophilia and alter neutrophil function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, in the current study, there were no differences in total WBC or neutrophil counts between or within groups, and this was likely due to the short intermittent duration of the employed weightlifting protocol and/or the 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h post-lifting sampling time points.</p><p>Notwithstanding, exercise-induced increases in monocyte percentages can lead to their differentiating into macrophages which, like neutrophils, can infiltrate damaged skeletal muscle following eccentric contractions and potentiate the inflammatory response. In this regard, Malm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] reported that circulating monocyte numbers and percentages robustly increase up to 7&#x000a0;days following a muscle-damaging eccentric protocol; an effect which paralleled the appearance of macrophages in skeletal muscle tissue. While we are unaware of studies that have examined the ability of BCAA supplementation to reduce post-exercise monocyte proliferation and skeletal muscle macrophage infiltration, it has been recently posited that BCAAs can be transaminated to glutamate in order to increase glutamine synthesis which, in turn, can be consumed by macrophages as a fuel source to propagate inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Notwithstanding, our findings that BCAAs are able to prevent the elevation in monocyte percentages over three days of rigorous weightlifting may suggest that BCAAs may possess an anti-inflammatory properties and should be further researched.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study is not without limitations. First, and as described earlier, while these supplements were not standardized to CHO or Calorie content, our intent was to compare these two supplements in a practical or real-world setting. In this regard, our results may have differed had we had participants consume isocaloric amounts of each supplement. Notwithstanding, we posit that our administration of supplements ascribed to real-world application whereby participants (in free-living environment) would have consumed either the BCAA-CHO or CHO supplement. Second, the training protocol was very brief and does lack a certain degree of external validity (i.e., not many practitioners or athletes would engage in three consecutive days of heavy squats). However, we contend that this study is similar to other laboratory studies which have used comparable weightlifting protocols to elicit muscle damage over short periods of time. Another limitation to this study is that it lacks various mechanistic features; specifically, skeletal muscle biopsies were not obtained and analyzed for infiltrating inflammatory cells and/or histological signs of muscle damage. Thus, we contend that future research needs to employ such mechanistic protocols over longer and more practical training interventions (i.e., &#x02018;overreaching&#x02019; paradigms) in order to better determine whether BCAA or BCAA-CHO supplementation can improve markers of muscle damage. Finally, it should be noted that there was not a non-supplemented control condition. Alternatively stated, it is possible that supplement conditions may have reduced the decrements in strength and markers similarly compared to a non-supplement group, but the current study design precludes us from reporting such data. Notwithstanding and despite these limitations, we report that BCAA-CHO supplementation did not reduce decrements in lower body strength or improve select markers of muscle damage/soreness compared to CHO supplementation over three consecutive days of intense lower-body training. As with previous studies reporting similar findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we contend this is due to exercise-induced muscle damage occurring independent of BCAA or CHO provision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>1RM, one-repetition maximum; BCAA, branched chain amino acids; CHO, carbohydrate; EMG, electromyography; MVIC, maximum voluntary isometric contraction; USG, urine specific gravity; VAS, visual analog scale; WBC, white blood cell count</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the participants for devoting time to this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Reagent costs and participant compensation costs were paid through a contract awarded to MDR through MusclePharm Corp.
