intensity laser therapy on delayed caesarean section healing in diabetic women. [Subjects
and Methods] This study was conducted on forty diabetic women with delayed caesarean wound
healing, ranging in age from 28 to 38&#x02005;years. They were randomly assigned into two groups;
the group I (n=20) received pulsed high intensity laser therapy for 6-weeks, 3 times per
week plus standard medical treatment for treatment of diabetes and caesarean wound
patients, the group II (n=20) received sham laser treatment for 6 weeks, 3 times per week
plus standard medical treatment for treatment of diabetes and caesarean wound patients.
The wound size and appearance in all participants were measured by the tracing method and
pressure sore status tool before and after the 6-week treatment. [Results] Pulsed high
intensity laser therapy produced a significant difference in wound size and appearance in
comparison to the sham laser treatment in diabetic women with delayed caesarean wound
healing. [Conclusion] Pulsed high intensity laser therapy is effective in the treatment of
delayed caesarean section healing in diabetic women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pulsed high intensity laser therapy</kwd><kwd>Caesarean section</kwd><kwd>Diabetic women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Caesarean section is a common delivery procedure in obstetric practice which can be
performed as emergency or elective. In addition to the successful delivery of the baby, good
wound care is a priority for the mother<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, whenever a woman has a caesarean section, there is a five to 20-fold greater
risk for infection compared with a vaginal delivery and a three-fold higher incidence of
surgical site infections in diabetic patients undergoing a caesarean section when compared
to non-diabetic women<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most common
type of wound healing problem is separation, opening of the skin and fatty tissue just
beneath the skin<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Wound care is an expensive area of treatment for health care services<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, with caesarean section wound infections representing a
substantial burden to the health system. The prevention of such infections should be a
healthcare priority in developing countries, and the global estimates of surgical site
infections (SSI) range from 0.5&#x02013;15%<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, diabetes affects about 2&#x02013;4% of
the general population and it is expected that the number of patients with diabetes in the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will grow by 96% from 2013 to 2035 or from 34.6
million to 67.9 million. In Egypt, the prevalence of diabetes is around 15.56% among adults
and its incidence is increasing<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Diabetic wounds present a major health problem as they have complex multiple
pathophysiological processes characterised by polymicrobial infection, altered immune
function or increased susceptibility to infection, decreased wound nitric oxide (NO)
production, and often hypoxia/ischemia<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The course of diabetic wound healing
appears to be hindered by many factors, including specific metabolic deficiencies and
impaired physiological responses, for example, the altered metabolism of carbohydrates, fats
and proteins resulting from the absence or deficiency of insulin, hyperglycaemia leading to
non-enzymatic glycosylation, osmotic diuresis resulting in decreased perfusion, low oxygen
tensions, low pH, and high lactate concentrations, altered collagen metabolism with a
significant reduction in the number of fibroblasts and free radical production<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Wounds that are difficult to heal represent a serious public health problem as the lesions
may severely affect the quality of life of individuals due to decreased mobility and
substantial loss of productivity. They can also cause emotional damage and contribute to
increased burden of public expenditure in healthcare<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in wound size during the initial phase of treatment have
been shown to be a potential indicator of the subsequent response to treatment and
ultimately healing<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Wound healing
acceleration in women who have undergone caesarean surgery could help them to return to
their normal function, especially to begin breastfeeding their newborn, one of the most
important aspects of newborns&#x02019; care<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The need to care for a population with poorly healing wounds is a growing challenge that
requires innovative strategies. Such an approach in the treatment of these lesions is
low-power light therapy, such as laser therapy<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low level lasers have been introduced as one treatment modality
for wound healing and several indications have been described for their use in wound healing
processes. However, the effect in a healthy individual is limited and the prime indication
for laser therapy in wound healing is for individuals or tissues with a compromised
state<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Laser therapy is an effective therapeutic modality to promote
healing of skin wounds. The biological effects promoted by these therapeutic resources are
similar and are related to the decrease in inflammatory cells, increased fibroblast
proliferation, angiogenesis stimulation, formation of granulation tissue and increased
collagen synthesis<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. When laser energy penetrates deep into the skin it has several
effects, such as increased ATP production and microcirculation, stimulation of the immune
system, anti-inflammatory effects, and improved metabolism due to photostimulated products
that circulate in the blood<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of
this study was to determine the effect of pulsed high intensity laser therapy (HILT) on
delayed caesarean section healing in diabetic women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty diabetic women from Makkah hospitals diagnosed with delayed caesarean section healing
for more than eight weeks participated in this study to investigate the effect of pulsed
high intensity laser on delayed caesarean section healing. All participants provided
informed consent form, giving agreement to participation and publication of the study
results. All patients received the same standard medical care for the treatment of diabetes
and caesarean wounds and did not receive any physical therapy modalities before the study.
Inclusion criteria: diabetic women categorised as having a delayed caesarean wound for more
than eight weeks, ranging in age from 28 to 38&#x02005;years. Exclusion criteria: any pathological
conditions or associated injuries which could affect the results of the study, skin disease
or any disease leading to delayed wound healing other than diabetes, such as venous or
arterial disease. The study was approved by the research committee of the Physical Therapy
Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences in Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi
Arabia (Approval Number FAMS15022017). Informed consent forms were signed by all
participants.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, the group I (HILT group) and the
group II (sham laser group) using systematic sampling. Patients in the laser group received
pulsed high intensity laser therapy for 6 weeks, 3 times per week plus standard medical
treatment for the treatment of diabetes and caesarean wound patients. Patients in the sham
laser group received sham laser for 6-weeks, 3 times per week plus standard medical
treatment for treatment of diabetes and caesarean wound patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-30-570-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>Participants in HILT group received pulsed Nd:YAG laser produced by a HIRO 3 device (ASA,
Arcugnano, Vicenza, Italy) for about 8 minutes during each treatment session. The HILT
apparatus used postulates (Nd:YAG), with pulsed emission (1,064&#x02005;nm), very high peak powers
(3 kW), high levels of energy density (fluency from 810&#x02013;1,780&#x02005;mJ/cm), very short pulse
duration of (120&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;s), a duty cycle of approximately 0.1%, and frequency (10&#x02013;40&#x02005;Hz). The
HILT was applied with an average total energy of 360&#x02013;540 J, which was administered through
three phases. The HILT probe was kept perpendicular at a 1&#x02005;cm distance away from the wound
surface. The irradiation was performed in 3 different phases, i.e., the initial,
intermediate, and final phase. In the initial phase, fast scanning in the vertical and
horizontal directions was applied to the wound area with an energy density of
510&#x02005;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, a frequency of 25 HZ, energy of 25&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup>, and a total
energy of 100&#x02013;150 J. In the intermediate phase, the probe was held at the periphery of the
wound on fixed points at a distance of 1&#x02005;cm away from the wound margin and fixed for 14
seconds at each point providing energy of 20&#x02005;J/point for 8&#x02013;12 points (i.e., a total of
160&#x02013;240 J). In the final phase, the same laser parameters were used as in the initial phase,
except that the scanning was done at a slower pace. The laser application was performed
after the patient received standard medical treatment at each session. The standard care of
diabetes and caesarean wound patients included good glycaemic control, adequate nutrition,
local care (moist dressings and topical management), lessening of oedema, surgical
debridement of devitalised wound tissue and antibiotic therapy<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Wound Surface Area (WSA). The wound surface area was measured at two time points, baseline
and after 6 weeks, by tracing the wound perimeter as reported by Kloth and Feedar<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the transparent method, the patient
was positioned in a comfortable position with the wound exposed, double sterilised
transparent plastic films were placed directly flat and attached to the skin around the
wound area by avoiding any movement. The wound margins were traced by the same investigator
to ensure reliability of the measurements. The wound perimeter was traced by using the
film-tipped transparency marker and each wound was traced three times to establish
measurement reliability. After tracing, the side of the transparency film facing the wound
was cleaned with a piece of cotton and alcohol. Carbon paper was placed over the
1-mm-squared metric graph paper. The traced transparency film was placed over the carbon
paper with white paper in between and the tracing was transcribed onto the metric graph
paper. The WSA was calculated by counting the number of square millimetres on the metric
graph within the wound tracing. The mean value of the three trials was calculated and taken
to be the WSA.</p><p>Wound appearance. Changes in wound appearance were evaluated at baseline and after 6 weeks
of treatment using a wound assessment tool, the Pressure Sore Status Tool (PSST), also
called the Bates-Jensen. It is valid and reliable measurement that characterises changes in
the appearance of wound by direct observation<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PSST is a pen-and-paper tool with 13 domains that use a scale
of 1&#x02013;5 to measure characteristics of wound size and depth, the viability of wound edges,
wound exudate, granulation tissue and epithelialization. A total PSST score between 13 and
65 is derived by summing the scores assessed for each of the domains. A lower total PSST
scores indicate better wound appearances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Paired t-tests were performed to examine and compare wound size and appearance within each

delayed caesarean section healing in diabetic women. At the end of the treatment program,
the results obtained showed that pulsed high intensity laser therapy produced a significant
difference in the wound size and appearance (p&#x0003c;0.0001) in comparison with the control
group. The mechanism of light action on the cellular level that supports its biological
effects is based on the photobiological reaction involving the absorption of a specific
wavelength of light by photoreceptor molecules<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. The resulting physiological effects included alterations in cell
membrane permeability with changes in intracellular calcium levels, increased cellular
metabolism, DNA and RNA synthesis, fibroblast proliferation, activation of T lymphocytes,
macrophages and mast cells, increased synthesis of endorphins and decreased bradykinin<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The observed results are in agreement with a previous study reported that low level laser
irradiation can be effective in promoting wound healing, and accelerating the caesarean
coetaneous wound healing in normal healthy women. However, larger controlled trials are
required to more evaluate this aspect of laser use in the wound healing process in normal
healthy people. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) given post-delivery has no negative effects
on lactation, and in fact, helps to modulate metabolic processes and improve wound
healing<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The observed results are in consistence with previous study suggested that semiconductor
laser irradiation might have auxiliary effects in the early and middle phases of wound
healing in diabetic rats<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also
been shown that laser therapy given three times per week at 4.71&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup> per dose
for diabetic burns, and three times per week at 2.35&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup> per dose for diabetic
wound healing are recommended for human clinical trials, especially after major surgery in
those with impaired healing, such as diabetics and the elderly<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, LLLT has been reported to accelerate the
healing process of chronic diabetic foot ulcers, and it can be presumed that LLLT may
shorten the time period needed to achieve complete healing<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>LLLT in the immediate postoperative period can enhance the tissue repair process in a
diabetes model. Similar effects were achieved with laser therapy applied in a single dose
with an energy density of 4&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup> and applied four times with an energy density

most important factor in the enhancement of the tissue repair process<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, another study reported that the wounds in
subjects treated with LLLT contracted significantly more than the wounds in the non-treated
group (40.24% vs. 11.87%, p&#x0003c;0.001), which indicates that LLLT is an effective modality to
facilitate wound contraction in patients suffering from diabetes and can be used as an
adjunct to conventional modes of treatment (dressings and debridement) for the healing of
diabetic wounds<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. LLLT has also been
shown to alter the expression of MMP-9, as well as accelerate the production of collagen and
increase the total percentage of collagen type III in diabetic animals<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, pulsed high intensity laser therapy is effective in the treatment of delayed
caesarean section healing in diabetic women and should be considered as a treatment method
to be used with other therapeutic modalities.</p><sec><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Blanc</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Capelle</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bretelle</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>[The worrying rise in the frequency of cesarean
