Its cardiovascular side effects are very small and therefore it is especially preferred in patients with unstable hemodynamic status. However, it has some side effects like injection pain, postoperative nausea/vomiting, electroencephalography (EEG) activation, adrenal suppression and myoclonus.

It was approved by the hospital's Ethics Committee (2008/35). Randomization was performed using sealed envelope method. Informed written consents were taken from 100 ASA (American Society of Anesthesia) I-II patients who were scheduled to undergo elective transurethral resection of prostate surgery and bladder cancer cystoscopy. Patients with serious heart failure, renal, pulmonary, hepatic and endocrinal diseases were excluded. Re-operated patients and those having coagulopathies or drug allergies were also excluded. No premedication was given before surgery.</p><p>In the operation room, patients were monitored on the table for standard electrocardiography, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse-oximetry. A 20-gauge intravenous catheter was placed on dorsum of hand. An anesthetist blinded to the study procedure prepared the drugs in 5 ml volumes inside coded injectors. Patients were randomized into two groups. The first group (M) received 2.48 mmol (60 mg) magnesium sulphate as intravenous bolus injection. Three minutes after magnesium, 0.3 mg/kg intravenous etomidate was administered as general anesthetic induction. The second group (P) received saline. In order to facilitate endotracheal intubation, 0.5 mg/kg intravenous atracurium was given one minute after etomidate. After intubation, maintenance was provided by 50/50 N2O/O2 and 2% sevoflurane (via inhalation).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> The presence of myoclonus was checked and recorded as &#x0201c;present/absent&#x0201d;. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures, heart rates, and peripheral oxygen saturations were recorded during pre-induction and post-induction periods, and also after intubation at 1st, 2nd, 5th, 10th and 20th minutes.</p><p>The incidence of myoclonus in the control group was expected to be 80% based on previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> A minimum of 30 patients in each group was required to detect a 50% difference in the incidence of myoclonus at a significance level of 95% and a power of 90%. We decided to include 50 patients in each group. SPSS 13 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. T-test was used for comparison of measured variables in the two groups with normal distribution. Two-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to detect the significance of variables at different time intervals. Mann Whitney U test was used to detect the difference between measurements. Pearson's chi-square test was used for cross-analysis of categorical data. Normality tests were conducted by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. The results are shown as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).

It also preserves the hemodynamic stability, which is the biggest advantage of etomidate. Moreover, no serious adverse effects were observed.</p><p>Although many drugs have been investigated for myoclonus, the mechanism of myoclonus due to etomidate is still not apparent enough. Doenicke et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> suggested that myoclonus does not originate from an epileptic focus, instead it arises because of subcortical disinhibition. Subcortical disinhibition also leads to irritable leg syndrome (ILS) during normal sleep. Myoclonus is very similar to ILS which is characterized by uncomfortable legs, irritability, disability to sleep, and numbness. However, the neurological examination is perfectly normal in this syndrome. In other words, cutting gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neuronal transmission leads to sensitization of pathways that control skeletal muscles and spontaneous neuronal discharge cause myoclonic contractions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Ates et al. revealed etomidate to have neuroprotective activity in diabetic rats.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Magnesium significantly decreased myoclonus incidence in our study. In a previous study, magnesium prevented myoclonus and magnesium has been suggested to have a different mechanism from other agents preventing myoclonus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Magnesium is an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Activation of this receptor leads to calcium influx into the cell and increased nitric oxide production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Moreover, nitric oxide is associated with nociception at venous system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Magnesium also blocks inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) mediated calcium chanels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> G&#x000fc;ler et al. compared low dose magnesium and ketamin in preventing the injection pain of etomidate and found ketamin to be superior. However, there were unwanted effects including respiratory depression and sedation in the ketamin group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>Memis et al. successfully used 2.48 mmol (60 mg) magnesium to prevent propofol injection pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Further studies are recommended with different doses of magnesium. In our study, we preferred magnesium a dose at which it is supposed to prevent propofol injection pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> It is already known that etomidate injection is painful, especially if it is administered through small veins. We have shown that this specific dose of magnesium significantly reduces myoclonus incidence after etomidate induction. Thus, there might be some correlation between the incidence of injection pain and myoclonus. Besides, in contrast with opiates, benzodiazepines and ketamine, magnesium does not cause respiratory depression or sedation.</p><p>In previous studies, pretreatment with opiates significantly reduced myoclonus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Although Stockham et al. did not find a significant decrease in myoclonus incidence using pretreatment with 100 &#x003bc;g fentanyl before etomidate, they observed significant decrease with higher doses. However, these high doses caused increased incidence of apnea at induction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Canessa et al. showed that fentanyl and alfentanil significantly reduced myoclonus after etomidate in elective cardioversion cases. However, they encountered residual respiratory depression after this procedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Schwarzkopf et al. observed decreased myoclonic incidence after midazolam (0.015 mg/kg intravenously). Although midazolam protected the hemodynamic stability advantage of etomidate, the disadvantages were respiratory depression and sedation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>Considering the adverse effects of drugs other than magnesium, prevention of myoclonus alone can be an advantage for magnesium itself. However, further studies are still needed to compare magnesium against midazolam and opioids.</p><p>We showed that myoclonus can be prevented using pretreatment with magnesium before etomidate induction. Hemodynamic data revealed no significant difference between groups and etomidate provided excellent hemodynamic stability. During general anesthetic induction, low doses of intravenous magnesium can be preferred to significantly reduce myoclonus side effects of etomidate. In addition, hemodynamic stability is preserved.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>BU carried out the design and coordinated the study.
