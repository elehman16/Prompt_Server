ADHD is associated with impairments in adaptive functioning and life skills, including problems with socialization, communication, and activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although clinical trials in children with ADHD have historically targeted ADHD symptoms, treatment-related effects may also extend to improvements in functional impairments, such as academic, social, and family functioning, all of which are common reasons for children with ADHD to be referred for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a study of 314 children referred to an ADHD diagnostic clinic, ADHD symptoms were only moderately correlated with global impairment as measured by a composite Global Impairment Index score, combining a number of parent- and teacher-rated competency scales of behaviors observed at home and school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While it is presumed that symptomatic improvement is generally associated with improved functioning, more work is needed to better understand the relationship between ADHD treatments, changes in symptoms, and specific areas of functional impairment.</p><p>The Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale&#x02013;Parent Report (WFIRS-P) is a brief, parent-reported questionnaire developed specifically for children and adolescents with ADHD. The WFIRS-P has been validated using data from seven randomized controlled clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Confirmatory factor analyses established item-to-scale relationships, with a root mean square error approximation &#x0003c;0.10, the cut-off statistic for acceptable model fit; the confirmatory fit index ranged from 0.80&#x02013;0.88, which is below the cut-off of 0.9 for acceptable model fit. Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was &#x0003e;0.7 for all six domains, and test&#x02013;retest reliability was &#x0003e;0.7 for all domains other than Risky Activities (intra-class correlation&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.57). Mean changes in domain scores were significantly different between responder and non-responder groups in the hypothesized direction. These results were also largely replicated in an independent validation of a translated version of the WFIRS-P in Turkish children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and other studies utilizing the WFIRS have noted good reliability of the scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The WFIRS-P has been used to examine functional impairment in observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], treatment studies of psychoeducational training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], behavioral therapy in a summer treatment program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and atomoxetine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] pharmacotherapy. The WFIRS-P has demonstrated sensitivity in evaluating domains of daily functioning often impaired in ADHD, and in detecting treatment effects of ADHD medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a recent study by Banaschewski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], treatment with either LDX or osmotic-release oral system&#x02013;methylphenidate for 7&#x000a0;weeks had a positive impact on functional impairment as measured by the WFIRS-P, with significant placebo-adjusted improvements observed in the Total score as well as in four of the six measured domains (Learning and School, Family, Social Activities, and Risky Activities). Furthermore, in a recent 9-week, head-to-head study of LDX and atomoxetine in children and adolescents with ADHD and an inadequate response to methylphenidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], improvements in functional impairment across all six domains were observed with both treatments, with LDX showing superiority over atomoxetine in the Total score as well as in two of the six domains (Learning and School and Social Activities).</p><p>There are several non-stimulants that are approved for use in ADHD. Guanfacine extended release (GXR) is a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist indicated for the treatment of ADHD in the USA in children and adolescents aged 6&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years, both as monotherapy and adjunctive to stimulant medications, and has received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use in the European Union for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. The efficacy and safety of once-daily morning administration of GXR has been established in children and adolescents with ADHD in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>A recent study examined the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily GXR monotherapy administered either in the morning or evening in children aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years with ADHD in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and found that administration in either the morning or evening resulted in significantly greater reductions in ADHD symptoms compared with placebo, as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale&#x000a0;IV (ADHD-RS-IV), which was the primary efficacy endpoint. The objective of the current substudy (a secondary efficacy endpoint analysis) was to determine whether once-daily GXR (1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mg/day) monotherapy, administered in the morning or evening in children aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years, impacts overall functional impairment, as measured by the WFIRS-P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An additional goal of this substudy was to examine the effects of treatment on specific domains of functional impairment. Finally, the relationship of functional impairment to clinical improvement was examined in a post hoc analysis of treatment responders versus non-responders by stratifying WFIRS-P scores based upon treatment response (defined by study endpoint scores on the ADHD-RS-IV and the Clinical Global Impressions&#x02013;Improvement Scale [CGI-I], a physician-rated measure of global improvement).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years with a primary diagnosis of ADHD (combined or hyperactive/impulsive subtype only) as defined by the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision</italic>, based upon the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia&#x02013;Present and Lifetime version. In addition, subjects were required to have an ADHD-RS-IV Total score &#x02265;28 and a CGI&#x02013;Severity of Illness score &#x02265;4 at baseline. Key exclusionary criteria included the presence of any current controlled or uncontrolled comorbid psychiatric diagnosis (except oppositional defiant disorder), history of or current suicide risk, and history of or current cardiac abnormalities or primary sleep disorder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>In this 8-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled dose optimization study, eligible subjects were randomized 1:1:1 via an interactive web response system to one of the following treatment arms: GXR&#x000a0;<sc>am</sc> (GXR administered in the morning and placebo in the evening), GXR&#x000a0;<sc>pm</sc> (placebo administered in the morning and GXR administered in the evening), or placebo (placebo administered in the morning and evening) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There was a 5-week dose-optimization period, a 3-week dose-maintenance period, and a 9-day dose-taper period. The starting dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/day was titrated upwards in 1-mg increments after a minimum of 1&#x000a0;week at the previous dose, based on clinical response and tolerability, up to a maximum of 4&#x000a0;mg/day (Visits 2&#x02013;7); optimal dose response was defined as the dose which produced a &#x02265;30&#x000a0;% reduction in ADHD-RS-IV Total scores from baseline and a CGI-I score of 1 or 2. After dose optimization, subjects were maintained on their optimal dose for an additional 3&#x000a0;weeks, during which time efficacy and safety were assessed weekly (Visits 8&#x02013;10). The final on-treatment timepoint was defined as the last non-missing, post-baseline value while on treatment (before dose tapering) with study drug [analogous to Visit&#x000a0;10, last observation carried forward (LOCF)].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy measure for the parent study was the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV Total symptom score; GXR treatment resulted in lower ratings of ADHD symptoms and significant reductions in ADHD-RS-IV Total scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This paper focuses on change in functional status with treatment, as measured by the WFIRS-P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The WFIRS-P consists of 50 items on which a parent or guardian rates his/her child&#x02019;s functioning; each question is scored on a 4-point Likert scale [0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x0201c;never or not at all&#x0201d; to 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x0201c;very often or very much&#x0201d;; not applicable (NA) is also an option], with higher scores reflecting higher levels of functional impairment. Questions are grouped into six domains: Family, Learning and School (divided into two subdomains: Academic Performance and Behavior in School), Life Skills, Self-Concept, Social Activities, and Risky Activities. Total and domain/subdomain scores, respectively, were the mean item scores across the whole scale or in each domain/subdomain.

WFIRS-P domain or Total scores were considered invalid if &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;% of the item scores used for calculation at baseline were missing or &#x0201c;NA&#x0201d; (with the exception of one question relating to siblings, for which a score of NA could contribute to the number of completed items); the number of NA scores had no effect on the results of the overall analyses since they were so few in number.</p><p>Safety evaluations, including assessments of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory measures, and physical examination findings, have been previously reported in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and therefore are not discussed here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data Analyses</title><p>The pre-specified exploratory analysis was conducted on all subjects who had taken &#x02265;1 dose of study drug.

Treatment with GXR, regardless of the time of dosage administration (morning or evening), resulted in significant improvements in functional impairment as measured by the WFIRS-P Total score, as well as the majority of domain and subdomain scores. The observed effect size values (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>) for GXR&#x000a0;<sc>am</sc> (0.42) and GXR&#x000a0;<sc>pm</sc> (0.48) WFIRS-P Total scores were in the moderate range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and slightly lower than those observed for ADHD symptom improvement with GXR&#x000a0;<sc>am</sc> (0.75) and GXR&#x000a0;<sc>pm</sc> (0.78) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Notably, improvements in family, school, social, and risk scores were observed with GXR treatment whether administered in the morning or evening (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.05 for both). Within the Learning and School domain, subdomain scores for both Academic Performance and Behavior in School also significantly improved compared with placebo (effect sizes ranged from 0.39&#x02013;0.41 for the all-active group). The effect sizes for these subdomain scores were expectedly smaller than the treatment effect size seen when using the WFIRS-P Total score, as the subdomain scores were based on fewer WFIRS-P items. These results suggest that, on the whole, treatment with GXR resulted in significant reductions in functional impairment after 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment when compared with placebo.</p><p>In contrast to the specific domains of impairment measured by the WFIRS-P that improved with treatment, both the Life Skills and Self-Concept domain scores did not differ from placebo at the final on-treatment assessment. While the Life Skills domain scores significantly improved for the GXR all-active group versus placebo at Visit&#x000a0;7, it remains unclear why this improvement was not observed at the final on-treatment assessment. These domains may be less sensitive to measuring change, or require more intensive or longer treatment for change to occur. It may also be that Self-Concept in clinical trial subjects improves for all regardless of treatment, given that these subjects often receive support and encouragement from trial staff for study participation and completion.</p><p>More research is needed to understand if improvement in the above domains is particularly resistant to change or measurement in a short-term trial. In a small single-center, open-label, non-randomized study of children with ADHD treated with atomoxetine (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], significant improvement on the WFIRS-P Self-Concept domain was not observed after 2&#x000a0;months of treatment. However, improvement in Self-Concept was observed after 6&#x000a0;months of treatment, and significant improvement in the Life Skills domain was detected at both 2 and 6&#x000a0;months after treatment; no significant improvements were observed in the Social Activities and Risky Activities domains. Thus, results from both the previous and current studies suggest that the time course for treatment-related functional changes may vary across domains of impairment, and also in relation to onset of symptom change. Perhaps the lack of GXR treatment-related improvement on particular WFIRS-P domains may signal the need for additional or more tailored psychosocial interventions targeting specific life skills and self-concept. It remains to be determined whether or not the GXR-related improvements observed for all other WFIRS-P domains would become larger with a treatment period &#x0003e;8&#x000a0;weeks or if they would appear within the Life Skills or Self-Concept domains; this requires further study.</p><p>Reductions in functional impairment were related to symptomatic improvement and global response. Of note, among responders, the degree of functional change reported on the WFIRS-P was found to be comparable between those on GXR and placebo. This suggests that perceived improvement in ADHD status is congruent with improvements in functional impairment regardless of the intervention, and even whether active medication is received. Among those on GXR, there was separation between responders and non-responders, and the effect sizes for improvement in WFIRS-P Total and domain scores were in the moderate to large range. Nevertheless, the effect size for functional improvement, even where demonstrated, was lower than that for ADHD symptoms. This difference is not surprising given that pharmacologic treatments are specifically targeted to improve symptoms; improvements observed in functional outcomes are a welcome secondary development, but are not necessarily expected. Moreover, given that function is a more distal concept, and that the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the current trial were created to identify subjects with ADHD symptoms and not functional impairment, it is expected that there will be a lesser impact on function in this population. What is remarkable is the strength of functional impairment that does occur in multiple studies and in most (but not all) domains. The fact that some domains do not improve with treatment suggests that when improvement does occur, it is not simply a function of the correlation between symptom measures and functional measures. It is possible that functional impairment in some areas improves more with other forms of treatment (e.g., psychosocial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]), whereas symptoms of ADHD may decrease more substantially with psychopharmacologic interventions. Regardless, both symptom and impairment measures are important outcomes for treatment and, although correlated, are not the same.</p><p>The results of the current study are similar to those obtained by Hervas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] in a recent phase&#x000a0;III study of dose-optimized GXR treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD, which found that subjects on GXR showed significant placebo-adjusted improvements in both the WFIRS-P Learning and School domain and Family domain (study key secondary endpoints) at the last on-treatment study visit prior to dose tapering (effect sizes&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.42 and 0.38 for each domain, respectively). Also, comparatively larger magnitude placebo-adjusted improvements on the WFIRS-P have been shown in subjects with ADHD after treatment with the stimulant LDX (effect size for WFIRS-P Total score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.924) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These prior findings, in combination with those of the current study, suggest that treatment with both non-stimulants and stimulants has a significant impact on functional impairment outcomes, as measured by the WFIRS-P.</p><p>The clinical relevance of identifying and targeting functional impairment is substantial. At home, ADHD may negatively impact a child&#x02019;s ability to follow family routines, straining relationships with parents and siblings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. At school, children with ADHD are more likely to display academic difficulties than those without ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and these difficulties are associated with decreased academic achievement and decreased vocational achievement later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Recent evidence using a large registry database also highlighted an increased incidence of accidental injury among children with ADHD; in children treated with ADHD drugs compared with matched untreated children, the prevalence of injuries was reduced by 31.5&#x000a0;% at age 10&#x000a0;years and 43.5&#x000a0;% at age 12&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Results from this study further suggest that treatment-related improvements may extend beyond core symptoms to include improvements in functional impairment, which presumably may lead to improved academic performance, better parent&#x02013;child relationships, and decreased incidence of accidental injury. It remains to be seen, however, if the improvements seen in short-term trials, such as the current one, can persist and be maintained in the longer term.</p><p>A number of study limitations should be noted. First, both the WFIRS-P and ADHD symptoms measures are largely based on parent report. Because they are observational only, the ratings may be subject to parental bias compared with more objective measures (e.g., grades, number of play dates). In addition, because both scales are completed by the same rater, there is potential for confounding; it would be important to determine if parent ratings of functional improvement are in agreement with scales completed by other informants, such as teachers. However, parent reports often drive referral for treatment, and identifying parent-reported improvement in functional status via the WFIRS-P represents some reassurance that improvement in symptoms translates to functional status; in this sense, using a measure of functional status together with traditional measures of symptomatic and overall response represents a step forward. Another limitation is that this study was not adequately powered to directly compare the GXR&#x000a0;<sc>am</sc> and GXR&#x000a0;<sc>pm</sc> groups, and the statistical tests conducted were not corrected for multiple comparisons, allowing for the possibility of type&#x000a0;I error. Third, the subjects predominately had combined type ADHD with moderate to severe symptom burden, which may limit the generalizability of the study results to children with less severe ADHD or those with the predominantly inattentive presentation. Finally, while these results suggest a significant relationship between improvements in symptoms and improvements in functional impairment, future research should more precisely examine the relationship between symptomatic and functional domains, i.e., whether symptom change mediates improvement in functional status, and whether there are baseline factors that moderate these relationships.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Once-daily GXR monotherapy administered in the morning or evening was associated with reductions in functional impairment in children with ADHD, as assessed by the WFIRS-P scale.
