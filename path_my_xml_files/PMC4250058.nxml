At 6 months since the first infusion, treatment was reversed (i.e., patients who received initial suspension media received cryopreserved MSCs and vice versa). Patients underwent bone marrow aspiration (80 to 100 ml) from the posterior-superior iliac spine under short general anaesthesia. Treatment sequence (active-control/control-active) was randomized following a computer-generated assignment list (M.A.S. v. 2.1, GSK). All patients and study personal, except for the haematologist (PM) and the nurse involved in the preparation of the dose and administration of the infusion, were blind to the treatment assignment at all timepoints, and until the last enrolled patient completed the 360-day visit, and all outcome data had been processed.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible participants were those with relapsing-remitting MS not responding to at least a year of approved therapy, defined by at least 1 clinically documented relapse and/or at least 1 gadolinium-enhancing lesion (GEL) on MRI within the last 12 months, aged 18 to 50 years, disease duration of 2 to 10 years and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) <xref rid="pone.0113936-Kurtzke1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> score between 3.0 to 6.5.

All patients gave written informed consent before study entry and approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01228266) and the official protocol (in Spanish, EUDRA-CT: 2009-016442-74) is accurately described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">methods</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study procedures and endpoints</title><p>MSCs were generated under good manufacturing practice conditions with standard operating procedures. Briefly, the mononuclear cell fraction was isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, AB). A number between 20&#x02013;60 millions of mononuclear cells were seeded per flask (175 cm<sup>2</sup>) with growth medium, which contained &#x003b1;MEM without ribonucleosides (Gibco), 5% platelet lisate, 2 un/ml Heparin, 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco) and 1 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2) (Sigma). The flasks were maintained in culture at 37&#x000b0;C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The growth medium was changed every 3&#x02013;4 days. About 10&#x02013;15 days later, colonies were formed. Then the cells were splitted with TrypLE Select (Life Technologies) and seeded at 3000&#x02013;5000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. The cells were grown to 70&#x02013;80% confluence and splitted again. When cellular doses were reached, the cells were resuspended at 10 million cells/ml in Ringer Lactate buffer containing 1% Human Albumin. Previously, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to confirm expression of CD90, CD73 y CD44 and absence of CD34 and CD45 surface markers. The cells were administrated in the first 24 hours postproduction (baseline) or cryopreserved for reversed administration at 6 months. A dose of 1&#x02013;2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> MSCs/Kg body weight or suspension media were slowly infused over 2&#x02013;4 min through a peripheral venous cannula at baseline. At 6 months, treatment was reversed compared to baseline and all patients received premedication with 2 mg dexchlorpheniramine, 1 g paracetamol, and 100 mg methylprednisolone to prevent infusion reactions.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>Clinical assessments were performed at screening, and at randomization (baseline), and study visits, including safety assessments, were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 7, 9 and 12 months after randomization. Relapses were defined by one of the participant neurologists as the development of new neurologic symptoms and confirmed signs at least 30 days after onset of last relapse. In case of corticosteroids treatment the MRI was delayed 1 month. The EDSS and the Multiple Sclerosis Scale Functional Composite (MSFC) z- score <xref rid="pone.0113936-Rudick1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> were evaluated every 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>MRI protocol and image analysis</title><p>Standardized MRI images were obtained at the screening visit, at baseline and every 3 months with a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany), using a 32-channel head coil. Two blinded MRI raters (SL and JB) identified enhancing lesions on axial T1-weighted sequence after gadolinium injection (GEL) and new lesions or enlarging lesions on serially registered long repetition time images (T2/FLAIR sequences). The volumetric measures included normalized T2 lesion volume, normalized gray matter volume, normalized white matter (WM) volume and percentage of brain volume change. Additional non-conventional quantitative MRI outcomes were used to evaluate the possible neuroprotective and repair effects of MSCs such as magnetization transfer ratio of GEL and of normal-appearing WM (NAWM), diffusion tensor imaging of NAWM and N-acetylaspartate levels (for more details on the MRI methods see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113936.s004">Appendix S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Optical coherence tomography (OCT)</title><p>Spectral Domain retinal OCT (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering) was performed for each eye based on previously reported protocols <xref rid="pone.0113936-Gabilondo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> by a blinded trained neurologist (IG) at baseline, after 6 and 12 months.

Secondary endpoints included clinical outcomes (number of relapses, change in the EDSS and MSFC z- score), MRI-based measures (listed in the MRI protocol) and OCT measures between groups of treatment during the first 6 months and at the end of the study. Exploratory analysis included the immunological evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The trial was planned to randomize 16 patients as suggested by the IMSCTSG. No power calculation was attempted. However, the enrollment accrual of 0.7 patients per month dropped 1 year after initiation, coincidental with the approval of fingolimod as second line therapy in Spain, and only one more patient was randomized from November 2011 to June 2012 and it was decided to end the recruitment. Analysis was performed based on the intention to treat with last observation carried forward (LOCF) to impute missing values. The primary endpoint of cumulative number of GEL at 6 months (sum of the number of GEL on T1-weigthed MRI brain scans at months 3 and 6) was estimated by means of a negative binomial regression model <xref rid="pone.0113936-VelezdeMendizabal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> with adjustment for baseline number of GEL. A sensitivity analysis was also done without LOCF imputation for missing data introducing as offset variable the natural log of the number of scans performed in the first 6 months. Additionally, the effect of MSCs vs placebo on GEL at 6 months was also analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test as change in the number of GEL with respect to baseline. The primary endpoint of change in the number of GEL in the complete period of the study was analyzed by the non-parametric Wilconxon's rank test for paired samples (MSCs period vs placebo period). To identify a possible carryover effect of the MSCs therapy, we also compared the cumulative number of GEL during the first 6 months (sum of the number of GEL at months 3 and 6) and during the second 6 months (sum of the number of GEL at months 9 and 12). For those variables expressed as a change at 6 months the analysis was calculated with respect to baseline. Treatment comparison for the secondary endpoints at 6 months and for the complete period was analyzed as reported in the primary MRI outcome. MSFC disability outcome was analyzed by Z-score conversion as indicated. The statistical analysis of immunologic studies was performed using SPSS 17.0. Mixed effects models including carryover effect and subject as random variable was fitted to the frequency of immune system cells in the blood flow versus the treatment (placebo or treatment with MSCs). A subdivision has been done regarding treatment period (first period, from month 0 to month 6 or second period, from month 6 to month 12).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 15 patients were assessed for eligibility, 10 were eligible and 9 patients were enrolled in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the study profile). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113936-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the baseline participants' characteristics.</p><fig id="pone-0113936-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113936.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study profile.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0113936.g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="pone-0113936-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113936.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Patients characteristics at baseline.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0113936-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0113936.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of patients</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender ratio, Female/Male</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years);

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the individual clinical evolution. At 6 months, there was a trend to lower mean of cumulative number of GEL in patients treated with MSCs (3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1&#x02013;8.8 vs 12.3, 95% CI 4.4 to 34.5, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.064). This trend was also confirmed after analyzing the mean change in the number of GEL (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.06) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113936-t002">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, the sensitivity analysis without the LOCF strategy also showed a trend to lower accumulate number of GEL at 6 months in the MSCs group (1.53, 95% CI 0.53&#x02013;4.42 vs 6.15, 95% CI 2.19&#x02013;17.28, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.065). At the end of the study the patients during the period of MSCs therapy had a trend to significant reduction in the mean number of GEL in comparison with the period of placebo (&#x02212;2.78&#x000b1;5.89 vs 3&#x000b1;5.36, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.075) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113936-t002">Table 2</xref>). The analysis of the cumulative number of GEL between the first and the second period of treatment showed a significant trend to lower mean number of GEL in the second period suggesting a potential carryover effect of MSCs administration (13.33&#x000b1;20.5 vs 9.78&#x000b1;20.02, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.066).

Regarding clinical endpoints, 4 patients had relapses (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7) during the placebo period. One of them withdrew the study and did not receive MSCs (see before). Three patients had relapses (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4) during the MSCs period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g002">Figure 2</xref>), (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.11 at 6 months, and p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.6 between both periods). The EDSS score increased 1.0 point in the patient who withdrew the study, 0.5 points in one patient who had 1 relapse and decreased 0.5 points in 2 patients who did not have relapses along the study.

Patients treated with MSCs showed a non-significant decrease in the frequency of Th1 population in comparison with placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This decrease was maintained along time and persisted over the subsequent 6 months of placebo treatment, suggesting a carryover effect. Th17 population also showed a modest decrease in patients treated with MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Accordingly, Th1/Th17 ratio was decreased in patients treated with MSCs in comparison with placebo. Breg cell frequency showed an increase when patients were treated with MSCs in comparison with placebo treatment, even if the percentage of Breg respect to the total B population in MSCs treated patients was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g003">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We did not found differences regarding natural Treg and induced Treg populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g003">Figure 3E and F</xref>). To avoid the possible carryover effect we also compared the results between patients treated with MSCs and treated with placebo during the first period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g003">Figure 3</xref>, MSCs1 and P1), and we confirmed the non-significant reduced frequency of Th1 cells.

In fact, MSCs have prominent immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive properties <xref rid="pone.0113936-Uccelli1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113936-Rice1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The observation in the current study of a decrease in inflammatory MRI measures along with reduced Th1 proinflammatory responses would support this notion.</p><p>Our trial differed from previous studies in two aspects. First, we recruited a homogenous cohort of patients with active RRMS who failed to standard therapies to evaluate their effects on inflammatory MRI parameters. In contrast, most of the reported studies were phase I safety trials and included secondary progressive MS <xref rid="pone.0113936-Rice2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, progressive MS <xref rid="pone.0113936-Bonab1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS <xref rid="pone.0113936-Yamout1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and active but unspecified MS patients <xref rid="pone.0113936-Karussis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and a phase IIa trial on secondary progressive MS which included clinical (visual) and neurophysiological parameters of efficacy <xref rid="pone.0113936-Connick1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Moreover, in one of them the administration was intrathecal and 5 of the 15 patients also received additional IV MSCs <xref rid="pone.0113936-Karussis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Second, and more important, this is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Both factors may contribute to answer questions concerning the efficacy of the therapy. However, our study has in common with previous studies the small number of patients that were enrolled (median 10, range 6&#x02013;25). In agreement with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0113936-Karussis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113936-Connick1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the trial confirmed that MSCs are safe and their administration well tolerated.</p><p>Although we did not reach the statistical significance for the primary MRI-based endpoint, the trend to lower cumulative GEL at 6 months and the confirmation of GEL reduction at the end of the study support the suggested immunomodulatory effect of the MSCs <xref rid="pone.0113936-Rice1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>An unknown issue is how long the biological effect of a single dose lasts. That is why the primary endpoint was analyzed in two ways, at 6 months to avoid the possible carryover in the second period, and comparing each patient with him/herself in both periods of therapy. Indeed, our data suggests that the effect can last more than 6 months because the cumulative number of GEL was lower in the second period than in the first 6-month period. Additional evidence comes from the immunological analysis which showed the persistence of decreased Th1 population over the subsequent 6 months after MSCs therapy. Although the study was not designed to evaluate the effect of cryopreservation on the immunological functions of the cells, the observed effect on the MRI in the second period would support that the cryopreservation does not negatively affects the properties of the MSCs <xref rid="pone.0113936-Francois1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In fact, we did not find significant differences in the immunological profile of the patients treated with MSCs freshly infused or after cryopreservation.</p><p>This is the first longitudinal immunomodulatory data in MS on MSCs treatment <xref rid="pone.0113936-Uccelli1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113936-Karussis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113936-Darlington1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We observed immunological changes that were consistent with a lower proinflammatoty T cell profile, resulting from the decrease in the proportion of IFN-&#x003b3; and with lesser intensity of IL-17-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and a reduced Th1/Th17 ratio that could explain in part the MRI results we found considering that Th1 and Th17 responses have been linked to disease activity <xref rid="pone.0113936-Hedegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113936-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In contrast, we did not find changes in the frequency of cells associated with immune regulatory function <xref rid="pone.0113936-Karussis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Given the high variability of immunological data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113936-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and the restricted sample size we would have been able to detect only very strong effects which was not the case. It would also be of interest to analyze changes in antigen-specific cell frequency or function.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge the difficulties of conducting a placebo-controlled trial in very active RRMS patients, and patient 1 is one example. However, it allows identifying as regression to the mean <xref rid="pone.0113936-Bland1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> what could be misinterpreted as therapeutic effect in uncontrolled studies. For ex. four patients did not have any relapse during the trial although they had had a median of 1.5 relapses in the previous year.</p><p>Although the apparent benefit based on the effect on GEL, a surrogate marker of disease activity, we did not identify significant differences in other clinical, several quantitative MRI metrics <xref rid="pone.0113936-Barkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and OCT outcome measures that could be informative on the possible neuroprotective role of MSCs in addition to the showed anti-inflammatory effect. The limited number of patients included and the crossover design of the study may explain part of the lack of beneficial effects in these measures. Despite these limitations, our data provides justification for further clinical testing <xref rid="pone.0113936-Rice1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113936.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
