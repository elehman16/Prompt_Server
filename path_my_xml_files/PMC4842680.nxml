Observation group and control group operative time was no difference (P&#x0003e;0.05), hospitalization time in the observation group was shorter than the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Bleeding volume in the observation group was less than the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). A clearance rate in the observation group was higher than the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), the incidence of complications in the observation group was less than the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The difference was statistically significant. Significant effect of microchannel percutaneous nephrolithotomy is smaller surgical trauma and shorter hospital stay.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Urolithiasis</kwd><kwd>open stone surgery</kwd><kwd>microchannel percutaneous nephrolithotomy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
