Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent cancer worldwide with an incidence of 9.8% and a mortality of 8.0%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref> The recognized risk factors include westernized eating habits, obesity, drinking alcohol, insufficient PA level (PAL) and genetic factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> The inhibition of colorectal cancer by PA is based on the following 2 mechanisms. Peristalsis of the intestines is activated by PA and this eventually shortens the colon transit time (CTT). This reduces the time during which the carcinogens within the colon are in contact with the intestinal mucosa, thereby suppressing any carcinogenesis. Otherwise, peristalsis of the intestines is promoted or increased by the increased synthesis of prostaglandin within the body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> Hormones involved in the synthesis of bile acid, cholesterol converted into the bile acid in the liver, and substances involved in tumor growth, such as interleukin-1, are affected by physical exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> According to White et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> regarding the correlation between PA and the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, the risks of developing colorectal cancer were decreased in women aged 45 years or older who did physical activities for more than 4 hours a week, including walking or riding a bicycle, as compared with those who maintain daily lives in a sitting position. They also reported that high-impact PA was more effective than light PA in reducing the occurrence of colorectal cancer. In addition, case-control studies and cohort ones have also reported that insufficient PA raised the incidence of colorectal cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref> The importance of PA in the prevention of colorectal cancer has thus been well documented. To date, however, few studies have examined the effects of level or intensity of PA on CTT. Radio-opaque markers have frequently been used to measure colorectal motor function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> Accordingly, in the current study, CTT was measured by using a radio-opaque marker to identify the dependence of CTT on the level or intensity of PA. The study results were used to determine the appropriate PAL for the healthy colonic function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study subjects were 49 adults including 24 males and 25 females and the mean age was 37.4 years with a range of 20-59 years who voluntarily gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University (IRB No. 2010/1006). Of all potential subjects, those with a possible restriction in normal PA, cardiovascular or orthopedic diseases which might affect CTT, woman in the menstrual period, inability to take drugs due to functional stomach diseases, a prescription course of anti-constipation drugs and diabetes mellitus or hypertension were excluded from the current analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Physical Characteristics</title><p>Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Inbody, Biospase, Seoul, Korea) was used in the measurement of height, weight and body mass index (BMI). Blood pressure was measured using a sphygmomanometer (SPRIT CK-101, Sankei, Japan) in the prone position after a 5-minute rest. Attempts were made to rule out any extrinsic factors that might affect the blood pressure, such as temperature, degree of PA, smoking and diet.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Physical Activity Level</title><p>PAL was measured over a 1-week period using an accelerometer (Accelerometer, Mini mitter, Chicago, USA). For accurate PA measurement, the study subjects were advised to perform their daily physical activities freely. The accelerometer was attached to the iliac crest using a belt. Prior to the measurement, the age, sex, height and weight were entered. The total energy expenditure, activity energy expenditure, and time of activity depending on the PA intensity and frequency were individually measured according to the time. The results were automatically stored. Using the recorded data, the energy expenditure was calculated based on Mifflin's formula to calculate the basal metabolic rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> To differentiate the PA intensity according to the total activity count of all study subjects, the upper 25%, middle 50% and lower 25% were classified into the high (H), moderate (M) and low (L) PA groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Colon Transit Time</title><p>CTT was measured using a multiple marker technique with a radio-opaque marker. The subjects took one capsule containing 20 radio-opaque markers at the same time every day for 3 days (Kolomark&#x02122;, MI Tech, Pyeongtaik, Korea). On the fourth day following the first administration, a supine abdominal radiography was performed. Mean CTT (hour) was calculated by counting the number of radio-opaque markers that were left in the total colon and the segment of the colon and then multiplying it by 1.2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The study data, expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, were analyzed using SPSS PC+ for Windows version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To analyze the difference in CTT according to PAL between the 3 groups, one-way ANOVA was performed. LSD post-hoc analysis was performed on the variables showing a statistically significant difference. A value of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Physical Characteristics</title><p>The physical characteristics of the study subjects are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The mean age was 39.7 and 35.3 years in the male and female subjects, respectively. The variables associated with physical characteristics, such as the height, weight, BMI and blood pressures, were significantly higher in the male subjects than in the female subjects (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Level and Intensity of Physical Activity</title><p>The level and intensity of PA in the male and female subjects are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The values of total energy expenditure (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), total activity count (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003), energy expenditure of light intensity activity (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007) and energy expenditure of moderate intensity activity (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) were significantly higher in the male subjects than in the female subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Colon Transit Time According to Physical Activity Level</title><p>The mean total CTT (TCTT) was 16.8 hours, 25.8 hours in the female subjects and 7.4 hours in the male subjects. This gender difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Although there was no significant difference among the L, M and H groups in the male subjects, TCTT in H group of female subjects was significantly shorter than in L and M group. And also, TCTT in M group was shorter than in L group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The results for segmental CTT according to PAL are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. Following a comparison of the segmental CTT between the male and female subjects, right CTT (RCTT) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023) and recto-sigmoid CTT (RSCTT) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004) were more prolonged in the female subjects than in the male subjects. In regard to the difference depending on PAL in the female subjects, RCTT in H group was significantly shorter than that in M group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.048). In addition, RSCTT in H group was significantly shorter than in L group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The mean TCTT of 16.8 hours, 7.4 hours in the male subjects and 25.8 hours in the female subjects, was shorter than the 35 hours reported for Caucasian people by Martelli et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref> and the 33.4 hours reported by Chaussade et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> In addition, these study results are also shorter than the 21 hours for male subjects and 28 hours for female subjects reported for Asian people by Chan et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> This significant difference for the mean CTT of the male subjects compared to previously reported literature values could not be explained, although possible reasons include differences in occupational characteristics, eating habits, living patterns and genetic factors.</p><p>The previously reported factors affecting CTT include age, sex, BMI, dietary fiber, water intake and living habits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> However, controversy continues as to the effects of these variables on CTT. In a literature review on the factors affecting CTT, CTT was relatively shorter in male subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> According to 2 other studies, however, this gender difference was not statistically significant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> In our results, TCTT, RCTT and RSCTT were significantly shorter in the male subjects than in the female subjects. These results were analogous to reports that left CTT based on the segment was significantly shorter in male subjects than in female subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> and that RCTT was significantly longer in female subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref> In women, the prevalence of constipation is relatively higher. In association with this, although it is presumed that CTT might be prolonged during the luteal phase where the concentration of progesterone is elevated based on the menstrual cycle, some other studies have reported an absence of any correlation between the menstrual cycle and CTT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref></p><p>Controversy also continues as to the effect of PAL on CTT. According to several reports, PA or exercise had no effect on CTT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref> In addition, significant differences have been reported for the effects of living and eating habits in patients with chronic constipation, although exercise caused no significant difference in CTT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref> Some studies have reported that PAL affected the body constituents and eating habits, and hence CTT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> In the current study, there was a significant difference among the 3 subgroups of the female subjects. Furthermore, RCTT differed significantly between M and H groups. This might be not only because most of the studies chose PAL as a control variable but also because few quantitative studies have examined PAL. The current study was limited by the small sample size, which prevents any generalization of the study results, so further studies should be conducted with more variables and subjects.</p><p>Most of the health benefits attributed to increased PA have been reported to improve the physical fitness associated with health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> Thus, chronic diseases such as hypertension, obesity and osteoporosis can be prevented or treated. In addition, the effects of PA on colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal symptoms and constipation have also been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref> Physical inactivity is an independent factor that is associated with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in normal weight people and obese people.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref> It has been reported that regular PA changes the distribution of body fat while also decreasing the body weight, and it can thereby contribute to the prevention of adult diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref> Living and eating habits, which account for a major part of the maintenance of health, along with exercise, not only activate physical development but also resolve the defecation symptoms by ensuring a correct diet with balanced nutrients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref></p><p>The previous studies showed that women had lower amount of PA than man and tend to be sedentary. Women with lesser experience on PA showed more positive effect through the PA. This study also considered that sedentary women showed a positive tendency of the CTT through the intensive PA and men also needed to have more amount of intensive activity for CTT.</p><p>The current study was conducted to examine the effects of PAL on CTT. Of the powerful variables associated with CTT, however, those associated with food intake (ie, dietary fibers and water) were not included in the current study. This was a limitation of the current study.</p><p>Based on these results, mean CTT was 16.8 hours in 49 adults. The female, but not male, subjects showed significant relations between PAL and CTT. Finally, the female subjects showed a tendency, for moderate and high PAL to help colon transit.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial support: None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflicts of interest: None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ferlay</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Forman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathers</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Parkin</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name></person-group><source>GLOBOCAN 2008: Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide: IARC CancerBase No. 10</source><date-in-citation>Accessed December 2011</date-in-citation><publisher-loc>Lyon</publisher-loc><publisher-name>International Agency for Research on Cancer 2010</publisher-name><comment>Available from URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://globocan.iarc.fr">http://globocan.iarc.fr</ext-link></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobs</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Daling</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physical activity in relation to colon cancer in middle-aged men and women</article-title><source>Am J Epidemiol</source><year>1996</year><volume>144</volume><fpage>42</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8659484</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bartram</surname><given-names>HP</given-names></name><name><surname>Wynder</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physical activity and colon cancer risk?
