Although propofol has been accepted as a sedative intraoperatively, it can be associated with troublesome hemodynamic changes. Dexmedetomidine is a new alpha 2 agonist used widely for sedation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>In this study, we tried to compare equivalent doses of dexmedetomidine infusion with propofol with emphasis on their effect on the hemodynamics.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Settings and Design:</title><p>Prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a single blinded study, 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II patients scheduled for forearm surgeries under brachial plexus block were randomized to receive either propofol (Group I) or dexmedetomidine (Group II) infusion. Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block was given in all the patients. After confirming adequate motor and sensory blockade, they were administered an initial loading dose of the drug over 10 min followed by a maintenance dose till the end of the surgery. The rate of infusion was titrated to maintain Ramsay sedation score of 2&#x02013;4. Intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory effects were documented along with surgeon and patient satisfaction. Any adverse effect such as hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting was also noted.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Statistical Analysis Used:</title><p>The data collected were evaluated using Stata version 10. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Results:</title><p>Heart rate decreased significantly in Group II (dexmedetomidine) while mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in Group I (propofol).

These include an awake patient with patent airway reflexes and stable cardiovascular and respiratory parameters.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Managing an awake patient's stress and anxiety related to the surgery and unknown surrounding remains a challenge.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Various drugs and techniques have been used for this purpose. Propofol has been the gold standard of intraoperative sedation due to its rapid onset and offset of sedation and easy titratability.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The major disadvantage of propofol is its depressant action on the patient's hemodynamics and respiration.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha 2 agonist with many desirable properties such as sedation, hypnosis, analgesia, anxiolysis with rapid onset&#x02013;offset of sedation, and minimal effect on respiration.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Despite being used as a sedative widely, it is not free of adverse effects. Hypotension and bradycardia are the two commonly seen adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although there have been studies comparing both these drugs for Intensive Care Unit sedation, there are few studies comparing them in brachial plexus blocks.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In addition, there are no studies comparing them in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I/II patients undergoing surgeries in brachial plexus block. Hence, in this study, we aimed to compare both these drugs with emphasis on their effect on the hemodynamic and respiratory profile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After approval from Institutional Ethics Committee, sixty ASA I and II patients between the age group 18&#x02013;50 years were recruited for this randomized, single-blind, prospective study done over a period of 1 year. Inclusion criteria included ASA health status classes I and II patients undergoing forearm fixation surgeries under supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. Patients with a history of chronic systemic disease, drug or alcohol abuse, allergy to any of the study medications, second- or third-degree heart block, and bleeding disorders were excluded from this study. The sample size was calculated as 30 in each group. Randomization was done using computer-generated random number table. Sequence allocation was done using sealed, opaque envelopes that were opened just before the procedure by the floor nurse. The patients were allocated into either of the 2 groups: Group I patients received propofol infusion (loading dose 75 &#x000b5;g/kg over 10 min followed by 12.5&#x02013;75 &#x000b5;g/kg/min). Fifty milliliters 1% propofol was loaded undiluted in a 50 ml syringe. Patients in Group II received dexmedetomidine infusion (loading 1 &#x000b5;g/kg over 10 min followed by 0.2&#x02013;0.6 &#x000b5;g/kg/h). Two milliliters dexmedetomidine (200 &#x000b5;g) was diluted to 50 ml with 0.9% normal saline in a 50 ml syringe.</p><p>On arrival in the operating theater (OT) holding area, 18 gauge intravenous cannula was secured in the dorsum of the contralateral hand. Preloading with 15 ml/kg ringers lactate was done over half an hour. On shifting to OT, standard monitors including pulse oximeter, noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were connected. Nasal prong was inserted, and supplemental oxygen was administered at 2 L/min throughout the procedure. After recording baseline vitals, ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block was given using 20 cc of 0.5% bupivicaine. Sensory blockade was complete when there was complete loss to pinprick sensation along the distribution of radial, ulnar, and median nerve. Motor blockade was attained with the complete loss of finger movements. After confirming adequate sensory and motor blockade, drug infusion was started according to the group allocated A screen was applied, and the patient was unaware of the infusion being administered. Parameters including mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded every 5 minutes until the termination of the surgery.</p><p>Intraoperatively, target sedation Ramsay sedation score (RSS) 2&#x02013;4 was maintained by titrating the dose of the infusion (1 = awake, agitated, 2 = awake, cooperative, 3 = sleeping, responds to commands, 4 = sleeping, responds to loud verbal commands, 5 = sluggish response to auditory or light glabellar touch, and 6 = deeply sedated, no response) Adverse events including bradypnea (RR &#x0003c;10/min), desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;92%), bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;45 b.p.m), and hypotension (MAP &#x0003c;50 mm Hg) were recorded and treated with 4 L/min of oxygen via a nasal cannula, intravenous 0.5-mg atropine, and intravenous 10 ml/kg 0.9% saline, respectively. Pain on injection, dry mouth, nausea, and any event of hypertension (&#x0003e;20% increase in MAP) was also recorded. The surgeons were asked to rate their satisfaction immediately after the surgery using a 7-point likert-like verbal rating scale[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Patients rated their satisfaction 10 h after the surgery using the same scale.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Likert scale.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-201-g001"/></fig><p>A pilot study had been done earlier to determine the sample size of this study. The 10 case pilot study showed that the mean MAP in Group I (propofol) was 86.37 &#x000b1; 6.33 mm Hg and Group II (dexmedetomidine) was 80.42 &#x000b1; 6.36 mm Hg. Taking 6 mm difference of MAP as clinically relevant, the sample size estimated at 95% power and 5% level of significance was 29 in each group. Hence, we took a sample size of 30 in each group.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata Version 10 (Stata Corp, Houston, Texas, USA).

Alpha 2 agonists cause a temporary increase in blood pressure due to the activation of postjunctional alpha 2 receptors in the vessels. This is followed by decrease in the sympathetic outflow decreasing the blood pressure and HR both.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] There are studies which have utilized dexmedetomidine for hypotensive anesthesia during maxillofacial, middle ear, and nasal surgeries.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The incidence of hypotension has been reported to be more after the loading dose. In fact, few authors have recommended the omission of the loading dose.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study, we used the loading dose followed by maintenance dose with no significant hypotension. This could be due to preloading and inclusion of only ASA I and II patients. These findings are similar studies done by Yektas <italic>et al</italic>. and Shah <italic>et al</italic>. where there was no hemodynamic compromise despite using a loading dose.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Dinardo observed in their study that multiple bolus doses and less age are strong predictors of occurrence of the initial hypertension.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] We did not observe hypertension in our patients. This could be due to a single bolus dose used and the range of patients&#x02019; age (18&#x02013;50 years). Patients who were administered propofol experienced a decrease in MAP. The fall in MAP could be due to the powerful inhibitory effect on the sympathetic outflow propofol has.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>HR was significantly lesser in Group II (dexmedetomidine) when compared to Group I. This is due to the sympatholytic and vagal mimetic effect of dexmedetomidine. The results are similar to the studies done by Dinardo, Mahmoud <italic>et al</italic>., and Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>There are very few studies in which dexmedetomidine has been used for intravenous sedation during brachial plexus block, with only two emphasizing its effects on the hemodynamic profile. In a study done by Bondok <italic>et al</italic>., the HR and MAP decreased in both the groups with no significant increase in bradycardia or hypotension in either of the groups. This is similar to the results in our study.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In a study done by Rutkowska, dexmedetomidine was used as a sedative in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing surgeries in brachial plexus block.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although there was decrease in HR and MAP, no significant increase in incidence of hypotention and bradycardia was noted. Both of these studies were done in patients with systemic renal or cardiac disease on various medications. Our study included only ASA I/II patients.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine has not been associated with respiratory depression despite profound levels of sedation.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In our study also, there was preservation of respiratory function with the use of dexmedetomidine. Few reports describe the incidents of respiratory depression during infusions of propofol for sedation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, in the present study, patients receiving propofol did not have significant respiratory depression. This preservation of respiratory function may be related to the frequent queries by the observers in the intraoperative period to assess the RSS. Each time the patient was evaluated for RSS score, the basal respiratory pattern would be affected.</p><p>Another finding in our study was that the surgeon's satisfaction score with patient's sedation was similar for both groups. Patient's satisfaction score with the anesthetic technique was higher in the Group II (dexmedetomidine) when compared to the Group I (propofol). This can be attributed to dexmedetomidine mimicking the natural sleep pathway.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Dry mouth is a known side effect of &#x003b1; 2 agonist.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] This was also seen in our study where there was significant increase in dry mouth in Group II (dexmedetomidine). There was a significant increase in pain on injection in Group I (propofol). This is attributed to the lipid solvent of propofol which activates the plasma kallekrein&#x02013; kinin system producing bradykinin.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The strength of the study was the inclusion criteria: ASA I/II patients. The studies done earlier included patients with ischemic heart disease or end-stage renal disease. Hence, the results in such studies might not be generalized to ASA I/II patients.</p><p>One of the drawbacks of the study was that RSS was used as a sedation scale. This was due to unavailability of the BIS (bispectral index) monitor in our institute. RSS is a subjective score and requires repeated external stimulus by the observant.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] BIS provides real-time objective assessment of the patient's sedation.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The main aim of our study was to study both these drugs with emphasis on the hemodynamic parameters. We did not study the effect of both these drugs on analgesic requirements or sedation characteristics intraoperatively or postoperatively. This study was a single-blind study not double blind.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Dexmedetomidine can be used safely as a sedative in orthopedic forearm surgeries under brachial plexus block without significant compromise on the patients&#x02019; hemodynamic and respiratory profile.
