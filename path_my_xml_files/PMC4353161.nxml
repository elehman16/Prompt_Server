It is a very complex and difficult task. Attention should be paid to wean off the ventilator as quickly as possible after the conditions that warranted placing the patient on the ventilator begin to resolve and stabilize.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Delayed or unnecessarily prolonged weaning increases length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, health-care cost, decreases the ICU bed availability and adversely affects patient outcome.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Aggressiveness in weaning off the ventilator, however, must be balanced against the possibility that premature discontinuation may occur. Premature discontinuation carries its own set of problems, including difficulty in reestablishing artificial airways and compromised gas exchange, etc.</p><p>Majority of ICU patients who are on ventilatory support require intravenous (i.v.) sedative and analgesic medications to facilitate mechanical ventilation, improve tolerance to the endotracheal tube, the invasive procedures, physiotherapy, tracheal suctioning, turning postures, changing of dressings, allays anxiety, blunts excessive hemodynamic, and metabolic responses.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Two major classes of medications used for this purpose in ICU are the sedative hypnotic agents and opioid analgesics. Benzodiazepines are the agents most commonly used to provide sedation in ICU.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Lorazepam given by intermittent boluses or continuous i.v. infusion was recommended in the Society of Critical Care Medicine, 2002 consensus guidelines, as the preferred sedative drug for ICU patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Whereas, midazolam was recommended only for short term (&#x0003c;48 h) sedation because of concerns for unpredictable awakening observed after prolonged infusion.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Midazolam causes a fall in systemic vascular resistance that is more evident when vascular resistance is raised, such as in hypertensive patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It produces some respiratory depression and also apnea when given along with opioids. Its elimination is prolonged in critically ill patients resulting in prolongation of its actions and extubation failure.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist dexmedetomidine is a newer sedative and analgesic agent used for ICU sedation for up to 24 h after surgery.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It provides a hemodynamic stability[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and appears to have no clinically important adverse effects on respiration.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Its sedative properties are unique in that it produces only mild cognitive impairment, allowing easy communication between health-care provider and patient in the ICU.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] It does not affect the respiratory drive and therefore, it should not interfere with weaning from mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we compared the efficacy of dexmedetomidine with midazolam to facilitate extubation of patients from mechanical ventilation in terms of the sedative properties, cardiovascular responses, ventilation, and extubation characteristics and safety profile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in a randomized, open labeled manner on 40 adults, aged 18-60 years. All these patients were postabdominal surgery patients, being mechanically ventilated for &#x0003c;96 h prior to start of study drug infusion, and were anticipated to be weaned-off mechanical ventilation in next 24 h. A written informed consent was taken from legally acceptable relatives of all patients.

To check the readiness for weaning all these patients were subjected to daily sedation interruptions and were assessed hourly for wakefulness, defined as Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) score 1-4 and ability to perform at least 3 of the following on request: Eye opening, tracking, hand squeezing, and toe movement. Patients were subjected to a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Patients who successfully completed a 2 h trial of spontaneous breathing were further tried for discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and possible extubation depending upon their ability to maintain and protect airway and their ability to cough and clear secretions. On the other hand, SBT was discontinued if there was tachypnea (RR &#x0003e;35/min for 5 min), hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 90%), sustained changes in heart rate and blood pressure of more than &#x000b1;20% or increased anxiety and diaphoresis. The patients who failed SBT were randomized into two groups of 20 patients each to receive either of the study drug infusion protocol using computer-generated random numbers.</p><p>

It should have a short elimination half-life with no accumulation on repeated or continuous administration,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and should be metabolized by pathway not dependent on renal, hepatic, or pulmonary functions. Etomidate, opioids, benzodiazepines, thiopentone, and ketamine are few examples which individually lacked some of these desirable properties and hence failed to become the drug of choice.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In daily practice of intensive care, the trend has been to use a combination of opioids and benzodiazepines. Opioids in the usual dose are excellent sedatives, analgesics, producing euphoria, and drowsiness with little effect on arterial blood pressure. However, opiates by themselves are not appropriate for prolonged, continuous sedation because of the number of side-effects such as decreased intestinal motility, tolerance, withdrawal after discontinuation of drug, and possible influence on immune status.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Benzodiazepines such as diazepam or lorazepam act rapidly, but the presence of active metabolites prolongs recovery. Midazolam a water-soluble benzodiazepine with sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties, with low toxicity[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] has been used as a sedative in ICU, but it produces respiratory depression, delayed recovery and hypotension.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A &#x0201c;midazolam infusion syndrome&#x0201d; resulting from high doses, is characterized by delayed arousal after discontinuation, leading to an increase in the length of ventilatory support.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine a new, potent alpha-2 agonist acting in the locus ceruleus, inhibits sympathetic stimulation, and provides analgesia and sedation without respiratory depression and hemodynamic instability.

Following the start of dexmedetomidine infusion, there was no difference in the percentage of time within the target RSS range (96.6% in dexmedetomidine group vs. 87.6% in midazolam group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). There were 3.3% and 8.3% patients who were inadequately sedated in dexmedetomidine and midazolam group respectively. There were 4.2% patients over-sedated midazolam group and none in dexmedetomidine. Our study is in accordance with that of Riker <italic>et al</italic>., who reported that there was no difference in the primary efficacy outcome in terms of percentage of time within the target Richmond agitation sedation scale (RASS) range (77.3% for dexmedetomidine - treated patients and 75.1% for midazolam - treated patients; difference, 2.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), &#x02212;3.2-7.5%]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.18).[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The MIDEX trial comparing midazolam with dexmedetomidine with respect to the proportion of time at target sedation level (measured by RASS) in ICUs of 44 centers in nine European countries concluded that dexmedetomidine/midazolam ratio in time at target sedation was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.97-1.18).[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the time to extubation in the dexmedetomidine group (24.210 &#x000b1; 1.6651 h) was found to be significantly lower (7.14 h) than in the midazolam group (31.350 &#x000b1; 3.3447 h). Venn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in 2000 compared dexmedetomidine with propofol for sedation in the ICU. They showed that the extubation times were similar and rapid with the use of both sedative agents (median [range] 28 [20-50] and 29 [15-50] min [<italic>P</italic> = 0.63] for the propofol and dexmedetomidine groups, respectively). Shehabi <italic>et al</italic>. in 2004 showed that mean time to extubation was shorter in dexmedetomidine group (24.21 h [22-28 h]) than midazolam group (31.35 h [26-38 h] [<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05]).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Despite the similar levels of target sedation achieved by patients treated with dexmedetomidine and midazolam, several important differences were noted. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 17% in dexmedetomidine group and 5% in midazolam group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas the mean diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 13.97% in dexmedetomidine group and 9.26% in midazolam group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In preextubation period, the mean heart rate remained lower in dexmedetomidine group than midazolam group at all times, but it was statistically significant at 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h of starting the infusion. In postextubation period, the heart rate was significantly lower in dexmedetomidine group as compared with midazolam group. A 28% reduction in heart rate from baseline was seen in dexmedetomidine group, whereas it was 7% reduction midazolam group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Venn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] also reported significantly lower heart rate in the dexmedetomidine group (mean [standard deviation] 75 [6] vs. 90 [4] beats/min) however, no significant differences were found in arterial pressures between the groups. Shehabi <italic>et al</italic>. in 2004 also reported a 16% reduction in mean systolic blood pressure and 21% reduction in heart rate over the first 4 h followed by minimal (&#x000b1;10%) changes throughout the infusion.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In 2008, Arpino <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also found that the heart rate trended down after dexmedetomidine initiation in most patients, but did not result in the discontinuation of dexmedetomidine in any patient. The addition of dexmedetomidine was associated with minimal changes in mean arterial pressure.</p><p>In our study, the mean SpO<sub>2</sub> levels in postextubation period remained significantly higher in dexmedetomidine group (98.7%) as compared with midazolam group (97.7%). Patients sedated with dexmedetomidine were easily arousable and cooperative with the procedures such as physiotherapy, radiology, suctioning, positioning, etc., without showing irritation. Dexmedetomidine treated patients showed rapid recovery in the level of consciousness after discontinuation of drug infusion as compared to midazolam where 10% of patients were over-sedated. All patients were successfully extubated without any weaning failure.</p><p>Though the baseline sedation score following daily sedation interruption in both groups were comparable, but still the midazolam infusion given prior to start of study drug infusion could also have resulted in delayed time to extubation in midazolam group. Other limitations of study are a small sample size and we also did not compare the severity of sickness and types, duration and severity of surgery in two groups. Future studies of ICU sedation must look beyond the quality of sedation to focus on additional important clinical outcomes like delirium and long-term cognitive functions, etc.</p><p>We hereby conclude that dexmedetomidine has clinically relevant benefits compared to midazolam in facilitating extubation because of its shorter time to extubation, more hemodynamic stability, easy arousability and lack of respiratory depression; hence, it can be used as an effective, and safe sedative agent to facilitate extubation in ICUs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>MacIntyre</surname><given-names>NR</given-names></name><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ely</surname><given-names>EW</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Epstein</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Fink</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Heffner</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Evidence-based guidelines for weaning and discontinuing ventilatory support: A collective task force facilitated by the American College of Chest Physicians;
