CKD is categorised into five stages, with stage 5 CKD, also known as established renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), comprising patients who may require renal replacement therapy (RRT) by dialysis or kidney transplantation. In 2009&#x02013;2010, the annual cost for treatment of patients with stages 3&#x02013;5 CKD in England was estimated at &#x000a3;1.45 billion, approximately 1.3% of the overall National Health Service (NHS) budget in that period; more than half of this was spent on patients requiring RRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The primary cause of mortality in patients with CKD is cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cardiovascular disease mortality in patients with CKD is not only related to the severity of kidney disease but also to an increased systemic inflammatory burden; biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are reliable predictors of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Consequently, identifying and targeting comorbid disease processes that contribute to systemic inflammation or oxidative stress burden, in patients with CKD, may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to reduce these burdens; an important strategy towards reducing mortality in such patients.</p><p id="Par31">Periodontitis is the most common chronic inflammatory condition in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and in its severe form is the sixth most common human disease, affecting 11.2% of the global population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Periodontitis is initiated by bacterial accumulation between the gingivae (gums) and teeth, which triggers an inflammatory-immune response within the host. In susceptible individuals, the initial acute inflammatory response fails to resolve and a dysregulated chronic inflammation ensues, which destroys the supporting connective tissues surrounding the teeth. This results in periodontal &#x02018;pockets&#x02019; forming, with chronically ulcerated pocket epithelium exposed to the microbial biofilm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). In severe disease the surface area of this ulcerated epithelium can be as large as 40&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Anatomy of a tooth and supporting structures depicting destruction of the periodontal architecture due to periodontitis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2236_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par32">Periodontal inflammation contributes to the systemic inflammatory burden, through acute-phase and oxidative stress pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as evidenced by increases in CRP, IL-6 and biomarkers of oxidative stress in the serum of patients with periodontitis. Successful periodontal therapy is associated with reductions in these inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The association between periodontitis and other systemic diseases (particularly CVD) is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and was recently reviewed in a joint European and American consensus workshop in periodontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Periodontitis may act as a comorbid chronic inflammatory disease in patients with CKD, contributing to increased systemic inflammation and the development of CVD.

For each tooth, PPD and recession will be measured at six sites &#x02013; the mesial, mid and distal aspects of the buccal and palatal/lingual surfaces.

At the 12-month time point, patients in the control arm will be offered intensive periodontal treatment allowing for assessment of their treatment response and reinforcement of oral hygiene instructions at the 15- and 18-month review appointments. Therefore, measurements at the 15- and 18-month time points represent post-treatment follow-up measurements for both arms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par91">Due to a lack of previous research to indicate a reliable primary clinical endpoint, a &#x02018;conventional&#x02019; sample size for a pilot study was chosen to obtain meaningful estimates of effect sizes for the various outcome measures. This sample size is also informed by the prevalence of periodontitis in an existing cohort of patients with high-risk CKD with the same recruitment criteria as employed in this trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par92">The randomisation uses permuted block-randomisation, with variable block size, stratified by CKD stage (stages 1&#x02013;3 vs. stages 4&#x02013;5) and smoking status (never vs. ever). The randomisation code will be held securely at the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU) at the University of Birmingham. After obtaining patients&#x02019; informed consent and completion of the baseline assessments participants can be randomised into the INSPIRED trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Allocation concealment</title><p id="Par93">Allocation concealment of the randomisation of participants in the INSPIRED trial to the immediate- or delayed-treatment arms will be ensured by using a centralised, telephone randomisation service provided by the BCTU. The random sequence will be generated by staff within BCTU and independently of the clinical trial staff. Research nurses involved in the trial will telephone the BCTU and will be informed of the treatment allocation of the patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par94">The assessor of periodontal health within this study will be blinded to the treatment allocation of the participants as the periodontal care will be provided by an independent operator. Blinding of patients or operator (dental hygienist) is not possible within this interventional trial. Blinding of the assessor of general health will not be possible for logistic reasons. The measurements taken by the assessor of general health, such as BP, PWV, body measurements, etc., are objective and hence will not to be influenced by knowledge of treatment arm. The medical assessor being unblinded negates the need for unblinding in the duration of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Anticipated compliance issues</title><p id="Par95">The successful maintenance of periodontal health relies heavily upon patients improving and maintaining their oral hygiene. There can be compliance issues associated with attaining and maintaining an adequate level of oral hygiene and home care on the part of the patient. Patients in either arm, following periodontal intervention, will be supported with this through reinforcement of oral hygiene instructions during treatment and follow-up visits along with maintenance periodontal therapy being provided as required.</p><p id="Par96">Compliance with meticulous oral hygiene will be assessed using plaque scores, a dichotomous measure of the presence or absence of supragingival plaque, and bleeding scores, a dichotomous measure of the presence or absence of bleeding on periodontal probing. These scores will be used in individualised biofeedback as patient motivation tools.</p><p id="Par97">With regard to compliance in maintaining appointments, patients will routinely be sent letters and text messages reminding them of their appointments. This will be reinforced by telephone calls to patients. We anticipate a retention rate of over 90% based on other RCTs carried out in the Periodontal Department of the Birmingham Dental Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This rate of retention is also an indicator of good compliance within research participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Recruitment and retention</title><p id="Par98">Data on the patients approached to enter the study will be analysed descriptively in terms of number of patients approached, number eligible and number randomised. Reasons for non-entry into the trial will be assessed, particularly in relation to patient eligibility criteria and reasons for patient refusal. Data on patients who do not complete the trial (e.g. withdrawals and those lost to follow-up) will also be collected throughout the study to allow assessment of patient retention rates, and reasons for non-completion of the trial.</p><p id="Par99">Dropouts will be analysed as the number and proportion of patients who did not complete the trial overall, and by trial arm. Reasons for non-completion will be analysed descriptively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Outcome data</title><p id="Par100">Outcome data collected will be summarised using summary statistics and an exploratory analysis will be performed using an intention-to-treat approach.

Appropriate graphical methods will be used in conjunction with these.</p><p id="Par101">The differences between the arms in the means and mean change from baseline to each time point will be calculated, along with the 95% confidence intervals. For dichotomous variables, changes in proportions, instead of means, will be analysed over time. This will help to determine the sensitivity of the outcome measures, such as eGFR, ACR, PWV and measures of inflammation or oxidative stress to change following periodontal therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Frequency of analyses</title><p id="Par102">Analyses will be carried out using data from 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18-month review appointments when patients retained in the trial have reached the 18-month review appointment. This will be done at the end of the trial and no formal interim analyses are planned as part of this pilot study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p id="Par103">The results from this pilot study will be disseminated via oral and poster presentations in national and international conferences in the dental and medical (renal) disciplines. If applicable, results will also be published as open-access publications in peer-reviewed journals in both the renal and dental communities.</p><p id="Par104">If appropriate, the wider dissemination of these results might take the form of a website for patients and practitioners to access. The European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) website will be utilised, in keeping with the EFP Manifesto (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.efp.org/efp-manifesto/manifesto.html">http://www.efp.org/efp-manifesto/manifesto.html</ext-link>), alongside media releases to a reporter with longstanding interest in periodontal and systemic health at Bloomberg News Centre and also via media outputs from the British Society of Periodontology (BSP). The dissemination amongst the renal community will be sought in conjunction with the British Renal Society (BRS).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec220"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par228">Patients with existing CKD are at an increased risk of progression and mortality, arising primarily from adverse cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The elevated risk is associated with an increase in the systemic inflammatory and/or oxidative stress burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which may be elevated by periodontitis as the treatment of periodontitis has been shown to reduce these systemic markers of inflammation in patients with and without CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The present pilot study aims to assess the feasibility of undertaking a larger scale study investigating the effects of successful periodontal treatment and maintenance of periodontal health on cardio-renal function, and ultimately on survival of patients with CKD. If this proves to be beneficial, then periodontal health may be an important factor in the management of patients with CKD.</p><p>This study is underway and challenges in recruitment and retention have already informed the management of the trial. Initially, this study was designed to employ a combination of a &#x02018;classical&#x02019; parallel group RCT design and a cohort multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], with the aim of recruiting patients from an on-going longitudinal cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] as a pool of eligible patients and controls. However, a greater than anticipated number of medical events, unrelated to periodontal treatment have been occurring in the longitudinal cohort study, resulting in insufficient patient recruitment. In addition to sourcing patients who fit the inclusion criteria from different sites, we also needed to relax the inclusion criteria from a &#x0201c;periodontal health&#x0201d; point of view. Initially, our data suggested sufficient patients would have disease that was sufficiently severe to allow for a threshold of cumulative probing depth of 40mm. This was relaxed to a cumulative probing depth of 30mm to allow for more patients to be eligible. The disadvantage of lowering the threshold is that, if a dose-dependent relationship exists between extent and severity of periodontitis and systemic ill-health, the treatment of periodontitis in such patients is likely to produce a lower magnitude of improvement in outcome measures than patients with more severe periodontitis. A change was also made in the total number of participants in each arm of the study. Initially, our data indicated 50 patients per arm would be achievable. This was scaled back to 30 patients per arm in response to the lack of eligible patients in the longitudinal cohort study. This will still be sufficient to inform a power calculation for a larger, multi-centre trial if such a trial appears to required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par105">As of September 2017, this trial is recruiting participants.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACR</term><def><p id="Par6">Albumin:creatinine ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCTU</term><def><p id="Par7">Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BOP</term><def><p id="Par8">Bleeding on probing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAL</term><def><p id="Par9">Clinical attachment loss</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEJ</term><def><p id="Par10">Cemento-enamel junction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CKD</term><def><p id="Par11">Chronic kidney disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p id="Par12">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par13">C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p id="Par14">Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eGFR</term><def><p id="Par15">Estimated glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESRD</term><def><p id="Par16">End-stage renal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCF</term><def><p id="Par17">Gingival crevicular fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDMS</term><def><p id="Par18">Isotope dilution mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-6</term><def><p id="Par19">Interleukin-6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INSPIRED</term><def><p id="Par20">INfluence of Successful Periodontal Intervention on REnal Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p id="Par21">National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OHIP</term><def><p id="Par22">Oral Health Impact Profile</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPD</term><def><p id="Par23">Probing pocket depth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par24">Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REC</term><def><p id="Par25">Research Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RRT</term><def><p id="Par26">Renal replacement therapy</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par106">This project is funded by a doctoral research fellowship grant by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), UK (grant reference: DRF-2014-07-109).
