Since these patients are often less knowledgeable or ready to pursue transplant, educational content must be simplified, made culturally sensitive, and presented gradually across multiple sessions to increase learning and honor where they are in their decision-making about transplant. The <italic>Explore Transplant at Home</italic> (<italic>ETH</italic>) program was developed to help patients learn more about DDKT and LDKT at home, with and without telephone conversations with an educator.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Study Design</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), 540 low-income Black and White dialysis patients with household incomes at or below 250&#x000a0;% of the federal poverty line, some of whom receive financial assistance from the Missouri Kidney Program, will be randomly assigned to one of three education conditions: (1) standard-of-care transplant education provided by the dialysis center, (2) patient-guided <italic>ETH</italic> (<italic>ETH</italic>-PG), and (3) health educator-guided <italic>ETH</italic> (<italic>ETH</italic>-EG). Patients in the standard-of-care condition will only receive education provided in their dialysis centers. Those in the two <italic>ETH</italic> conditions will receive four video and print modules delivered over an 8 month period by mail, with the option of receiving supplementary text messages weekly. In addition, patients in the <italic>ETH</italic>-EG condition will participate in multiple telephonic educational sessions with a health educator. Changes in transplant knowledge, decisional balance, self-efficacy, and informed decision making will be captured with surveys administered before and after the <italic>ETH</italic> education.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>At the conclusion of this RCT, we will have determined whether an education program administered to socioeconomically disadvantaged dialysis patients, over several months directly in their homes, can help more individuals learn about the options of DDKT and LDKT.

There are two options for ESRD patients to sustain life: dialysis or a kidney transplant from a deceased or living donor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Kidney transplantation, especially living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), offers ESRD patients 6 to 16 additional years of life and improved quality-of-life compared to remaining on dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the majority of ESRD patients&#x02013;450,000 as of 2013&#x02013; still remain on dialysis. Although dialysis is life-saving, it only replaces 10-15&#x000a0;% of normal kidney function and can lead to cardiovascular disease, infection, and other complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additionally, the chance of a dialysis patient being alive after 5&#x000a0;years without a transplant is only 40&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Acknowledging its benefits over dialysis, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has required that all dialysis patients receive transplant education and be informed of their option for transplant within 45&#x000a0;days of initiating dialysis.</p><p>In general ESRD patients who are Black and of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are significantly less likely to receive transplant education, pursue transplant evaluation, and receive deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKTs) and LDKTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In fact, patients with kidney disease from low-SES neighborhoods experience higher mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These patients may be more likely to have particular concerns about the costs of transplant medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], loss of disability benefits if they should receive a transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and limited access to adequate transportation to transplant appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many low-SES patients may receive treatment at dialysis facilities with systemic barriers, including limited staff availability to provide education about transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or limited access to transplant education materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Without information about the risks and benefits of DDKT and LDKT, dialysis patients who do not present at a transplant center are often unable to make informed decisions about how best to treat their kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In light of these barriers, a 2014 American Society of Transplantation Consensus Conference recommended multiple ways to improve educational outreach for ESRD patients who have not yet presented at a transplant center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These recommendations included repeating education multiple times and in settings prior to the transplant center, providing more culturally competent education at appropriate literacy levels, and using technology more effectively as an educational strategy. These approaches reflect a more general need to provide transplant education both consistently and gradually over time for patients who know less about it. Patients with significant barriers to learning about transplant also may benefit from support from a health educator, peer mentor, or social worker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], including repeated discussions and more opportunities to ask questions about their transplant concerns.</p><p>Given the pressures on dialysis providers&#x02019; time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] health insurance companies have incorporated the use of case managers or health educators within their organizations to distribute health information to patients via mail or over the telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Some approaches that have been used to reach patients in clinical settings outside of dialysis centers involve mailing videos and print educational content at multiple time points to reach patients and their support networks when they are home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], sending regular text messages to increase health knowledge and promote healthy behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and reinforcing educational content with a phone health educator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These approaches have been shown to be effective in identifying patients with chronic illness early in the course of disease progression and intervening to increase knowledge of the best treatment options available, bridge the gaps in access to care, facilitate effective communication between the patient and providers, advocate on behalf of the patient, and plan for successful treatment outcomes in a high quality and cost-effective manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Applying these educational strategies to transplant education for the first time, we describe the protocol of a randomized control trial (RCT) with low-SES, Black and White dialysis patients comparing the efficacy of two versions of the <italic>Explore Transplant at Home</italic> (<italic>ETH</italic>) educational program with standard education being provided within dialysis centers. The three education conditions include: (1) standard-of- care education provided within dialysis centers; (2) a video-guided four-part <italic>ETH</italic> program delivered via mail, plus optional texts [<italic>ETH</italic> Patient-Guided (PG)]; and (3) a video-guided four-part <italic>ETH</italic> program with discussion facilitated by a transplant educator via telephone [<italic>ETH</italic> Educator-Guided (EG)]. We will compare whether these three educational approaches improve Black and White patients&#x02019; transplant knowledge, self-efficacy, and informed decision-making. We will also explore which DDKT and LDKT action steps patients commonly take during an 8 month period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study Design and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Foundations of ETH</title><p>There is general consensus that interventions grounded in the best practices of behavioral change theories are more effective than those not based in theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Noting that many dialysis patients, especially racial minorities, are in early stages of decision-making to pursue transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], there is critical need for an intervention that can meet patients where they are in this process and gradually increase knowledge, leading them towards making informed transplant choices. Dr. Waterman and her team previously designed and tested the <italic>Explore Transplant</italic> (<italic>ET</italic>) program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], a program grounded in the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The TTM holds that not all patients are ready to begin taking actions toward health behavior change, and that patients&#x02019; decision-making is impacted by their level of motivation, their weighing of the Pros and Cons, and their self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It has been successfully used to understand the decision-making of patients considering whether to engage in over 50 health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], including decision making about organ donation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Through a group RCT, <italic>ET</italic> delivered face-to-face with patients while they were undergoing dialysis by transplant educators was shown to increase patients&#x02019; knowledge, informed decision-making, and pursuit of transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As a result, the <italic>Explore Transplant</italic> program won the 2009 National Association of Transplant Professionals (NATCO) Quality of Care Award.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and Advantages of Explore Transplant at Home</title><p>The original <italic>ET</italic> trial included four video and print educational modules: Exploring Transplant, Kidney Recipients&#x02019; Transplant Experiences, Living Donors' Donation Experiences, and Deciding What to Do. These modules were reviewed in person while the patients were undergoing dialysis within a one month period. Recognizing the significant barriers that disadvantaged dialysis patients face in pursuing transplant, the <italic>ETH</italic> modules were redesigned to be delivered by mail to patients&#x02019; homes, with content delivered more gradually, over an 8 month period, and in smaller educational increments using supplementary texts, postcards and, in one condition, telephone support from an educator (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Both <italic>ET</italic> and <italic>ETH</italic> were developed to encourage informed decision-making through a comprehensive explanation of the benefits and risks of dialysis, DDKT and LDKT.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Explore Transplant at Home mailed intervention materials</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Module</th><th>Brochures</th><th>Fact Sheets</th><th>Postcards</th><th>Videos</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="3">1</td><td>Explore Transplant: A Guide for Family and Friends</td><td>Transplant or Dialysis Fact Sheet</td><td>Your Exploration of Kidney Transplant Begins at Home</td><td>Exploring Transplant</td></tr><tr><td>Why People Donate Their Kidneys</td><td>Deceased or Living Donation Fact Sheet</td><td>Explore Transplant with Your Friends and Family</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Why Kidney Patients Get Transplants</td><td/><td>Learn How Life Can Improve After Transplant</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="3">2</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>Recipient Evaluation, Surgery and Recovery Fact Sheet</td><td>Learn Something New About Receiving a Kidney</td><td>Kidney Recipients&#x02019; Transplant Experiences</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Possible Risks to Kidney Recipients Fact Sheet</td><td>Compare the Risks and Benefits of Transplants</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Learn What Transplant Evaluation is Like</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="3">3</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>Living Donor Evaluation, Surgery and Recovery Fact Sheet</td><td>Learn What it is Like to be a Living Donor</td><td>Living Donors&#x02019; Donation Experiences</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Possible Risks to Living Donors Fact Sheet</td><td>Learn Why People Want to Be Living Donors</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Compare the Risks and Benefits of Living Donation</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="3">4</td><td>Deciding What to Do</td><td>Kidney Disease Resources Fact Sheet</td><td>Weigh the Pros and Cons of All Your Options</td><td>Deciding What to Do</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Missouri Transplant Centers Fact Sheet</td><td>Consider Living Donation</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Plan Your Next Steps</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>A Medical Advisory Board including social workers, case managers, nephrologists, kidney patients, and experts in health education reviewed and approved all components of the <italic>ETH</italic> educational intervention to ensure its cultural sensitivity and that the needs of low-income and low health literacy groups were addressed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Missouri Kidney Program</title><p>This study features a partnership between Dr. Waterman&#x02019;s transplant research team and the Missouri Kidney Program (MoKP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Established in 1968 to serve and educate Missouri&#x02019;s citizens with chronic kidney disease (CKD), MoKP subsidizes the costs of dialysis and transplant medication for low-income ESRD patients in Missouri, effectively operating as an insurance company would with respect to their 1,200 patient member group. MoKP also has strong, statewide partnerships with over 160 dialysis centers across the state of Missouri (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and fosters the exchange of medical, technical and administrative information among programs and professionals who treat patients in these dialysis centers.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Intervention region: Missouri dialysis centers</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12882_2015_143_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>ETH Educational Components</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Printed Materials</title><p>Many of the printed materials, including brochures and factsheets, used as part of the <italic>ETH</italic> education program are part of the original <italic>ET</italic> Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Every 8 weeks, within the educational intervention period, patients in the <italic>ETH</italic>-PG and <italic>ETH</italic>-EG intervention conditions will receive four educational print and video modules by mail. Transplant education postcards will also be mailed to patients every two weeks following the mailing of each of the four modules, for a total of 12 postcards over the course of 8 months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Videos</title><p>As part of their mailings, patients will receive four <italic>ET</italic> DVD videos, averaging 20&#x000a0;minutes in length, to review at home with people who help them make important health decisions. If patients indicate that they do not have a DVD player at home, one will be provided to them as part of the trial. The videos include the stories of 20 transplant recipients and living donors, and discuss the questions and fears they had before getting a transplant and why they became motivated to pursue transplant. The health professionals in the videos provide answers to common questions, including specifics about transplant evaluation, surgery and recovery processes involved with being a transplant recipient or a living donor. All videos are closed-captioned for the hearing impaired.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Text Messaging</title><p>Text messaging has become a popular form of communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and a common way to receive updates and important information quickly and conveniently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Healthcare providers are now utilizing these short messages to deliver reminders to patients about appointments, prescription medications, and health education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the United States, 89&#x000a0;% of households have access to a cell phone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

Patients will receive $25 for completing the baseline survey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Follow-up Survey</title><p>After the intervention period (approximately 8&#x02013;10 months post-baseline) a 35-minute follow-up survey will be completed over the phone to assess changes in patients&#x02019; level of transplant knowledge, decisional balance, self-efficacy, informed decision-making, decisional conflict, and any steps they may have taken to learn about staying on dialysis, DDKT, or LDKT. They will also complete a process evaluation about the helpfulness of the <italic>ETH</italic> program. Patients who are deemed ineligible for transplant or receive a transplant during the interim period between the baseline and follow-up surveys will be given only an abbreviated set of questions during the follow-up survey that excludes any questions about their pursuit of transplant. Patients will receive $50 for completing the follow-up survey.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Transplant Knowledge</title><p>Our primary outcome measure is level of DDKT and LDKT knowledge. Patients will be asked 17 true/false and 8 multiple choice questions about the basic facts, advantages, risks and outcomes of DDKT and LDKT to assess knowledge levels (e.g., &#x0201c;Transplant recipients are at risk of developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;The transplant team will let a living donor back out from donating on the day of the surgery&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Informed Decision Making</title><p>Informed Decision-Making will be assessed in two ways. First, patients will be asked three questions: &#x0201c;I have all the facts I need to make an informed decision about whether to pursue DDKT/LKDT/remain on dialysis&#x0201d; (agree/disagree). Each of these questions will be treated as an individual item and analyzed separately. We also will administer the decisional conflict scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] to assess factors contributing to patients&#x02019; uncertainty in making health-related decisions, and patients&#x02019; assessment of their perceived effective decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Small Steps toward DDKT and LDKT</title><p>Several action steps toward pursuit of both DDKT and LDKT will be assessed using validated measures (e.g., &#x0201c;Do you plan to call the transplant center to begin evaluation,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Do you plan to share your interest in living donation with your family and friends?&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], each of which the patient will report as having &#x0201c;already done,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;planning to do,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t plan to do.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Decisional Balance and Self-Efficacy</title><p>Validated Decisional Balance measures will assess patients&#x02019; perceived importance of the possible positive and negative outcomes of LDKT and DDKT. Patients will be given the prompt &#x0201c;How important is this statement to your decision about transplant?&#x0201d; and then be asked to respond to 24 positive and negative statements (e.g., &#x0201c;I would not have to be on dialysis,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;I would feel guilty having someone donate to me&#x0201d;). Patients will be prompted to respond on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;"Not important"&#x000a0;through 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;"Extremely important") [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. A Self-Efficacy scale measures how confident an individual is in their ability to pursue transplant if they encounter challenges along the way with 14 questions. Patients are asked, &#x0201c;How confident are you that you could get a transplant even if&#x02026;,&#x0201d; followed by a potential challenge, &#x0201c;You didn&#x02019;t have your own transportation to get to the transplant center?&#x0201d; Patients responses will range from (1) = " Not at all confident" to (5) = " Completely confident" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Predictors and Covariates</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>Demographics Clinical and Cultural Factors</title><p>Demographic clinical, and cultural characteristics will be assessed including age, sex, race/ethnicity, whether or not a patient is on dialysis and what type (i.e., hemodialysis or peritoneal), and patient comorbidities (e.g., polycystic kidney disease). Additionally, a patient&#x02019;s health-related quality of life will be measured with the use of the Health Related Quality of Life-4 (HRQOL-4) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and medical mistrust will be measured using the Medical Mistrust Index, a validated scale that assesses how much patients trust health care organizations (e.g., &#x0201c;When healthcare organizations make mistakes they usually cover it up&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Socioeconomic Transplant Derailers</title><p>We will also assess potential SES derailers that may influence patients&#x02019; experience with transplant evaluation including level of education, employment status (full time, part time, disability, other financial assistance programs, no employment), and the quality of health insurance they have (private, government, multiple sources, no insurance). Additional SES derailers assessed include feelings of safety in their neighborhood, family obligations, income vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and access to transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. We will also measure patients' access to multiple technologies and resources, such as having a computer or cell phone, access to the internet, and a DVD player.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Prior Transplant Education</title><p>As one of the primary outcome measures is transplant knowledge, patients&#x02019; level of prior LDKT and DDKT education will also be evaluated. Patients will be asked a series of four Yes/No questions about their past behaviors (e.g., &#x0201c;Have you read brochures about transplants?&#x0201d;), and if a patient positively endorses a statement, they will be asked how many hours they have dedicated to each educational activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Health Literacy</title><p>Patients will respond to two items: &#x0201c;How often do you have someone (like a family member friend, hospital/clinic worker or caregiver) help you read hospital materials?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;How confident are you filling out forms by yourself?&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Evaluation and Process Measures</title><p>In the follow-up survey, patients will be asked about the helpfulness of the <italic>ETH</italic> resources. Patients will also be asked whether they agree with 7 statements relating to how helpful they viewed the materials provided to them (e.g., &#x0201c;The materials were easy to understand,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;The materials were overwhelming&#x0201d;) and the educator conversations (e.g., &#x0201c;The Explore Transplant Educator was helpful&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;The Explore Transplant Educator listened to what I had to say&#x0201d;).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data Management and Statistical Considerations</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Data Management</title><p>To ensure participant confidentiality and privacy all data will be stored in university-maintained, secured servers. All study data will be captured in electronic databases within the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Study personnel can check on patients&#x02019; records by examining their data entry form or through reports generated in REDCap. The records of patients who refuse to participate or are never successfully recruited into the study will be retained in the REDCap registration database and de-identified at the end of the study so that patterns in recruitment can be analyzed and reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Power and Sample Size</title><p>Power analyses were based on changes in transplant knowledge, our primary study outcome. The study design and analyses were treated as a test of the differences in mean knowledge score change between patients in the <italic>ETH</italic>-PG, <italic>ETH</italic>-EG, and Control conditions, 8&#x02013;10 months post-baseline. Power calculations were based on the number of dialysis centers per condition, the number of individuals per dialysis center, the expected intra-class correlation, and the estimated variability of the outcome variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Based on the original <italic>ET</italic> trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], we estimated that a mean knowledge change score of 2.0 points would be needed to detect a significant difference between patients receiving standard-of-care, <italic>ETH</italic>-PG, and <italic>ETH</italic>-EG. It was assumed that patients coming from the same dialysis centers would have correlated knowledge scores. Since we are examining 3 conditions, a Bonferroni correction was required to adjust the Type 1 &#x003b1; for comparison of 3 group means (0.05/3&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017). Based on these assumptions, we calculated that a design of 150 patients per condition, 450 patients total, will be required to find a mean change of 2.0 points in knowledge between groups at 90&#x000a0;% power. Expecting an approximately 20&#x000a0;% attrition rate over time, we are oversampling (180 patients per condition) to ensure that we have sufficient power to be able to assess our primary endpoint at the completion of the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Where feasible and appropriate, multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Multilevel random effects models (MRMs) will also be used to account for correlated data (dialysis center clustering and serial measurement). We will compare the characteristics of patients who refuse to join the study or are never successfully contacted to those who do not, as well as patients who drop-out to those who do not, to determine if the patient selection procedure has biased the sample.</p><p>We will compare the difference in mean knowledge change, change in self-efficacy, and change in decisional balance (baseline to follow-up survey) of participants in the 3 study arms using MRMs with normal outcome distributions. A MRM with a normal outcome distribution will also be used to test for mean differences in the Decisional Conflict Scale at 8&#x000a0;months post-baseline, and Rao-Scott &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests adjusting for dialysis center clustering will be performed to test for differences in patients&#x02019; answers to the informed decision-making items on the follow-up survey: &#x0201c;I have all the facts I need to make an informed decision about whether to stay on dialysis/pursue DDKT/pursue LDKT&#x0201d; (agree/disagree). Rao-Scott &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests will also be used to test differences in the proportion of patients in each condition who took each small step toward transplant (e.g., &#x0201c;Do you plan to share your interest in living donation with your family and friends?&#x0201d;), operationalized as the number who had not taken each step at baseline but had at follow-up.</p><p>The heterogeneity of treatment effect will be tested using interactions between the educational condition patients are assigned to and their demographic, psychosocial, and clinical characteristics&#x000a0;(e.g., race, level of SES vulnerability, medical mistrust, health literacy), examining differences in changes in these groups' transplant knowledge, decisional balance, self-efficacy, small steps toward transplant, and informed decision-making using MRMs. These models will determine whether the <italic>ETH</italic> educational conditions are more or less effective for patients who: (1) have different SES barriers, (2) different levels of health literacy and medical mistrust, and (3) are Black or White. Finally, we will explore the impact of the text messages by comparing all study outcomes between patients who did and did not enroll in the texting program, stratified by whether the patient was randomized to the <italic>ETH</italic>-EG or <italic>ETH</italic>-PG condition, using MRMs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Kidney transplantation has clear survival and quality-of-life benefits for patients; however, patients within low-income and minority populations continue to have limited access to the information they need to make an informed decision about their CKD treatment options. With the majority of dialysis patients dying within 5&#x000a0;years of starting dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], the importance of these patients receiving comprehensive education prior to their presentation at a transplant center about their other treatment options&#x02013;DDKT and LDKT&#x02013;cannot be understated. Since these patients are often less knowledgeable or ready to pursue transplant, transplant educational content must be simplified and made more culturally sensitive to honor patients where they are in their decision-making process about transplant.</p><p>Two recent transplant education interventions using print education, videos, and educators have been implemented with kidney patients prior to presenting to a transplant center in an effort to reduce disparities in pursuit or receipt of transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Compared to patients receiving usual transplant education in dialysis centers, a patient navigator intervention where previous kidney transplant recipients led dialysis patients through taking different transplant steps during a 2&#x000a0;year period (e.g., increasing interest in transplant, getting on the transplant wait-list, receiving a transplant) significantly increased the number of steps patients actually took, and was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of wait-listing. A second trial examined the impact of an educational intervention on transplant pursuit for CKD 3&#x02013;5 patients recruited from community nephrology practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Compared to standard-of-care education, patients who received additional print and video education with support from a social worker were more likely to have discussions about transplant and take other LDKT steps (e.g., identify potential living donors). Also, the patients who only received educational materials were more likely to begin and complete transplant evaluation than the other two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>These studies show support for outreach-based, culturally-compentent educational approaches to be studied and further expanded in the <italic>ETH</italic> RCT described here. However, neither of these studies examined whether their respective interventions were effective when targeted toward low-SES patients. Since these patients may take more time to educate, we do not know whether it is feasible to overcome the greater level of challenges faced by dialysis providers in educating them about transplant.</p><p>Upon completion of this investigation, we will have assessed the effectiveness of a program that delivers health education directly to patients&#x02019; homes in small, digestible increments. Additionally, we will be able to explore the effectiveness of text messaging as a means of delivering health education to patients within a low-income population. Hopefully, these methods prove to be effective at alleviating staff burden within dialysis centers, educating patients in an engaging fashion, and providing a potentially cost-effective strategy for disseminating transplant education. Furthermore, through this trial, we will have developed an education program that could be delivered directly to patients through a healthcare organization, health insurance company, or other community partners&#x02014;all organizations that have continued access to patients as a result of the managed care they provide. Next steps will include examining the effectiveness of <italic>ETH</italic> educational approaches with Hispanics, the most rapidly increasing portion of the ESRD population in the United States [1] who may face particular challenges around pursuing transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and assessing the generalizability of these findings in other regions of the country.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ESRD</term><def><p>End-stage renal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CKD</term><def><p>Chronic Kidney Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDKT</term><def><p>Living donor kidney transplant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DDKT</term><def><p>Deceased donor kidney transplant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ET</term><def><p>Explore Transplant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETH</term><def><p>Explore Transplant at Home</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETH-PG</term><def><p>Explore Transplant at Home Patient-Guided Condition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETH-EG</term><def><p>Explore Transplant at Home Educator-Guided Condition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTM</term><def><p>Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p>Socioeconomic status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MoKP</term><def><p>Missouri Kidney Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REDCap</term><def><p>Research Electronic Data Capture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRM</term><def><p>Multilevel Random Effects Model</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors have no competing interests relevant to this manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript, and all authors made intellectual contributions to the design of the trial.
