Opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB) lead to further increases in immune activation and stimulate HIV viral replication <xref rid="pone.0009138-Lawn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Sulkowski et al. showed that successful treatment of opportunistic infections, excluding TB, led to declines in HIV load and decreased immune activation <xref rid="pone.0009138-Sulkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. One would predict that treatment of TB would also lead to declines in HIV load and increases in CD4 count, but studies addressing this question have been contradictory. Studies within the United States and Europe have shown a decrease in HIV load in response to TB therapy <xref rid="pone.0009138-Goletti1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009138-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

It is a similar story for CD4 counts. In HIV negative individuals active TB disease induces CD4 lymphopenia which is responsive to TB therapy <xref rid="pone.0009138-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, in persons with HIV/TB co-infection, treatment of TB has not impacted CD4 counts <xref rid="pone.0009138-Kalou1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009138-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Immune activation has been implicated as a critical driver of HIV disease progression. Expression of CD38 on CD8 T cells has been shown to be a strong predictor of HIV progression and death <xref rid="pone.0009138-Fahey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Despite multiple studies demonstrating increased CD38 and/or HLA-DR expression on CD8 T cells in persons with or without HIV co-infection during active TB there are few studies showing declines in these cellular markers of immune activation in response to TB treatment. Our earlier studies have shown that TB exerts its greatest effect on survival in persons with early stage HIV <xref rid="pone.0009138-Whalen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that TB therapy alone in TB patients with less advanced HIV would lead to measurable declines in immune activation and corresponding declines in HIV load. To test this hypothesis we prospectively followed a cohort of 38 HIV positive persons with baseline CD4 counts &#x0003e;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in Uganda who had smear and culture confirmed pulmonary TB and was placed on standard anti-TB therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We present a cohort study of participants in a phase 3 open-labeled randomized clinical trial measuring the impact of early HAART combined with standard TB therapy versus TB therapy alone in persons with pulmonary TB and HIV infection with high CD4 counts.

All subjects gave written informed consent. This sub-study focused on the anti-retroviral therapy na&#x000ef;ve HIV positive persons with smear positive pulmonary TB and CD4 counts &#x0003e;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> who were started on a standard regimen of directly observed TB therapy (two months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by four months of isoniazid and rifampin). Mid-way through study enrollment daily cotrimoxazole was added in response to new international guidelines.

For flow cytometry the following antibodies were used: anti-CD4 allophycocyananin (APC), anti-CD8 APC, anti-HLA-DR phycoerythrin (PE), and anti-CD38 phycoerythrin Cy5 (PE Cy5). Mouse monoclonal isotypic controls conjugated with PE, PE Cy5, and APC were used to determine non-specific binding and to set gating boundaries.

We did not observe decreased HIV load or increased CD4 counts in response to TB therapy.</p><p>Both HIV and MTB infection cause immune activation. How HIV infection leads to chronic immune activation is poorly understood. Depletion of gut mucosal lymphocytes and transudation of LPS into the systemic circulation has been postulated by some. Alternatively, HIV and its viral gene products can directly activate the immune system <xref rid="pone.0009138-Grossman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In active TB, macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;) in response to mycobacterial proteins and glycolipids, resulting in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte recruitment and activation at the site of infection and systemically <xref rid="pone.0009138-Toossi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. CD38 and HLA-DR expression on CD8 cells, markers of immune activation, are higher in HIV/TB co-infection than in persons with either HIV infection or TB alone <xref rid="pone.0009138-Hertoghe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In HIV/TB co-infection, TB leads to increased HIV viral replication both in the lungs and systemically. TNF-&#x003b1; produced in response to mycobacterial proteins induces HIV viral replication through nuclear factor kappa &#x003b2; (NFK-&#x003b2;) binding to the 5&#x02032; end of the long terminal repeat of HIV <xref rid="pone.0009138-Toossi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Immune activation and inflammatory cytokines induced by opportunistic infections such as MTB can drive HIV viral replication. Thus one would predict that TB treatment should lead to a decrease in immune activation and a corresponding decline in HIV load.</p><p>Our finding that reduced immune activation did not result in a reduction in HIV load suggests that there may not be a linear relationship between immune activation and viral replication in HIV/TB. The anti-inflammatory/-infective properties of cotrimoxazole and rifampin could contribute to decreasing immune activation. However, when data was stratified for cotrimoxazole use there was no impact on CD38 expression. The lack of a rebound six months after completing TB therapy argues against a role for rifampin. The possible disconnect between immune activation and HIV load is further supported by our observation that up to 24&#x00025; of HIV/TB co-infected Ugandans have low baseline HIV viral loads that are independent of CD4 counts and severity of TB <xref rid="pone.0009138-Srikantiah1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. While studies performed in the United States and Great Britain show that TB treatment decreases HIV load <xref rid="pone.0009138-Goletti1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009138-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, our study is consistent with similar work from sub-Saharan Africa that found no change <xref rid="pone.0009138-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009138-Lawn2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Our most striking finding was a clear decline in immune activation seen as early as 3 months into treatment. Percentage expression of both CD38 alone and co-expression of CD38/HLA-DR on CD8 T cells was significantly decreased after 3 and 6 months of standard TB therapy and remained decreased for at least 6 months after completion of therapy. Additionally, there was a trend towards decreased expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4 T cells. These findings are at odds with Morris et al. who failed to see a decline in immune activation in their sub-Saharan HIV/TB co-infected cohort <xref rid="pone.0009138-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although both cohorts were in sub-Saharan Africa, our cohort had much higher CD4 counts at baseline (mean of 642 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to the Morris cohort (mean CD4 count of 184 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>). It is quite possible that normal regulatory patterns that induce macrophages and T cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines are disrupted in advanced HIV disease and are less likely to normalize in response to TB therapy <xref rid="pone.0009138-Goletti2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In contrast, in less advanced HIV infection TB therapy may be more likely to re-establish normal cytokine responses leading to a corresponding decline in immune activation. Epidemiologic studies have shown that treatment of TB has a greater impact on survival in HIV infected persons with higher CD4 counts (&#x0003e;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), and little impact on those with more advanced HIV disease <xref rid="pone.0009138-Whalen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The failure of CD4 counts to increase in response to TB therapy is also intriguing. TB in non-HIV infected persons induces lymphopenia that returns to normal within one month of treatment <xref rid="pone.0009138-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This response may be offset by the increased T cell apoptosis in HIV/TB <xref rid="pone.0009138-Toossi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our findings are in-line with others who have shown no increase in CD4 counts with TB therapy in HIV infected individuals <xref rid="pone.0009138-Kalou1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009138-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Conversely one might argue that the relatively stable CD4 counts over 1 year, as opposed to a steady decline, are indirect evidence for further immunologic benefit.</p><p>Limitations of our study include the lack of control group and limited number of patients. The ideal control group would be similar persons with HIV/TB co-infection that are followed and do not receive TB treatment. For obvious reasons this study will not be performed. Alternatively, one might compare our group to those with HIV infection alone, but these persons even if having similar CD4 and HIV loads at baseline are unlikely to have similar baseline levels of immune activation <xref rid="pone.0009138-Villacian1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Despite following only 38 persons longitudinally we were able to find a measurable decline in immune activation. One cannot exclude the possibility that our study lacked the power to detect more subtle, but still significant changes in HIV load and CD4 counts.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that TB therapy in HIV/TB co-infected persons with CD4 counts &#x0003e;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> leads to significant declines in immune activation of CD8 T cells without a measurable impact on HIV load or CD4 counts. Our findings suggest that declines in immune activation rather than changes in HIV load or CD4 count may explain prior epidemiologic observations that TB treatment leads to survival benefits in HIV/TB co-infected patients with less advanced HIV disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009138.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol for the parent study.</p><p>(2.10 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009138.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009138.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009138.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009138.s003"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>IRB approval from the Ugandan Council of Science and Technology.</p><p>(0.03 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009138.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009138.s004"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>IRB Approval from the Joint Clinical Research Center in Kampala, Uganda.</p><p>(0.04 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009138.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009138.s005"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>IRB approval from University Hospitals-Case Medical Center.</p><p>(0.22 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009138.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009138.s006"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Enrollment Flow diagram.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009138.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was completed only through the dedicated work of many individuals.
