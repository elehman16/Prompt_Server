Standard treatment for infection, which includes parenteral treatment only, is often not available in low-resource settings. Infant mortality will not be reduced in developing countries without a reduction in deaths due to infection. We participated in a multi-site trial that demonstrated the effectiveness of three simplified antibiotic regimens compared to standard treatment (The AFRINEST Trial: parent study). For this report, we examined the site-specific data for the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC), the most impoverished of the countries that participated in the study, to determine if outcomes in the DRC were similar to outcomes across all sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The parent study was an individually randomized, open-label, equivalence trial. Infants with clinical signs of severe infection were randomized to receive one of four regimens: 1) injectable penicillin-gentamicin for 7&#x000a0;days (standard therapy; regimen A), 2) injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for 7&#x000a0;days (regimen B), 3) injectable penicillin-gentamicin for 2&#x000a0;days then oral amoxicillin for 5&#x000a0;days (regimen C), or 4) injectable gentamicin for 2&#x000a0;days and oral amoxicillin for 5&#x000a0;days (regimen D). In the DRC, we enrolled 574 infants, of whom 560 met the per-protocol criteria for analysis of treatment effect. The main outcome was treatment failure within the first week of enrollment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Treatment failure occurred in 52 (9.3%) infants: 17 (11.6%) with the referent treatment regimen, 13 (9.6%) with regimen B (risk difference [RD] -2.0%; CI -9.2% to 5.2%), 13 (9.0%) with regimen C (RD -2.6%; CI -9.6% to 4.4%), and 9 (6.7%) with regimen D (RD -5.0%; CI -11.7% to 1.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">As in the parent study, the risk difference between each of the experimental treatments and the reference treatment suggests equivalence. These findings suggest that the conclusion from the parent study, that a simplified antibiotic regimen can be used for the community-based management of possible severe infection in young infants where referral to a hospital for standard care is often not possible, is true in the DRC. We speculate that the widespread use of a simplified, community-based treatment could result in increased coverage with treatment and improved survival in poor areas.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12610000286044.aspx">ACTRN12610000286044</ext-link> on April 9, 2010.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Neonatal infection</kwd><kwd>Simplified antibiotic regimen</kwd><kwd>Community-based treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (US)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>World Health Organization (CH)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Reducing child mortality continues to be one of the most vexing challenges in this Sustainable Development Goals era. An estimated 5.6 million children died in 2016; approximately 2.6 million of these deaths occurred in the neonatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Of these child deaths, the proportion occurring in neonates and young infants (infants 0&#x02013;2&#x000a0;months) continues to rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Evidence-based research, policies, programs and advocacy that target this age group are urgently needed to combat this problem.</p><p id="Par14">Infections are among the leading causes of neonatal and young infant mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2012, over 0.66 million infants died of serious bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Until 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that all neonates and young infants with possible serious bacterial infections (PSBI) be treated in hospitals with injectable antibiotic therapy for 7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, this recommendation is difficult to implement in many low-income countries, particularly in rural areas. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), located in central Africa and the fourth most populous African country, is particularly vulnerable to the challenges of implementing these WHO recommendations. In the DRC, nearly all health care in rural areas is provided through health centers that do not typically provide inpatient care. Providers in health centers may refer some patients to their area hospital if inpatient care is advisable and feasible; however, distances from health centers to hospitals vary widely, ranging from less than one mile to 60&#x000a0;miles, the terrain is challenging and obtaining transport poses immense difficulties. For the patient who makes it to a referral hospital, the hospitals are lacking in sufficiently trained health care providers, and equipment and essential medicines are often absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As a result of these barriers, many infants with PSBI are not taken to hospitals, and if they do get there are either untreated or inadequately treated. These barriers and inadequacies of treatment contribute to the neonatal mortality in these regions.</p><p id="Par15">Because of these barriers to recommended treatment in the DRC and other resource-limited countries, a collaboration of investigators from the WHO and the Universities of Kinshasa and North Carolina participated in a multi-site study (five sites from three countries) that examined the efficacy of four simplified regimens of outpatient antibiotic therapy for the treatment of neonates and young infants with PBSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The results of the multi-center study (the African Neonatal Sepsis Trial: AFRINEST Trial) were published in the <italic>Lancet</italic> and suggest that these infections could be treated effectively outside of referral hospitals, in health centers or homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The WHO modified its recommendations for treatment of PSBI based, in part, on the results of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, each of the five sites had unique demography, geography and healthcare infrastructure that might predict variation in efficacy among sites. The objective of this report is to examine the DRC site-specific data from the multi-site study to determine the comparative efficacy of these treatment regimens in the cohort enrolled in the DRC, the most rural and impoverished of the study sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study site</title><p id="Par16">Our site was in rural areas of the North and South Ubangi districts in the province of Equateur in northern DRC.

In the parent study, the required sample for 90% power to demonstrate the similarity of any two treatments assuming that the true failure rates with the reference treatment and the experimental treatment regimens were identical (assumed to be 10%) was estimated to be a total 3040. An additional 560 infants were added to the planned enrollment to allow for failures of adherence to the protocol to allow for both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses. Sample size calculations for individual sites were not calculated because there was no a priori intent to perform sit-specific analyses. Therefore, the sample size for the DRC was the number enrolled at this site during the duration of the parent study.</p><p id="Par37">We conducted these single site analyses using STATA version 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). We analyzed the primary outcome (treatment failure) per-protocol, which is considered a more conservative analysis than intention to treat (ITT) analysis for equivalence studies. We evaluated the difference in the risk of treatment failure between the reference treatment (regimen A) and all other treatments together with a 95% confidence interval.

This study enrolled 3564 infants in five sites in three countries (Kenya, DRC, and Nigeria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the parent study, four week-long treatment regimens were compared. The outcomes of infants treated with three regimens of antibiotics that included combinations of parenteral (intramuscular) and oral antibiotics were compared to outcomes in a reference group treated with daily doses of parenteral antibiotics, the standard care. Treatment failure occurred in 6.8% of infants, but the risk differences between the experimental treatment regimens and the reference treatment were within the pre-specified 5% similarity margin. The conclusion from this study was that treatment with these regimens was equivalent to the standard care.</p><p id="Par43">The purpose of the study reported in this manuscript was to determine whether the results from this multi-national study could be reasonably extrapolated to the DRC. The DRC is a unique environment compared to the other sites for several reasons. First, mothers had less education compared to other sites. Second, the socio-economic status is lower in the DRC. Despite the abundant natural resources of the country, the population of the DRC is among the poorest in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to the 2013 Human Development Report, the DRC ranks last (186th) with a poverty ratio of about 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This compares to ranks of 153rd and 145th for Nigeria and Kenya. Third, the DRC has high fertility rates and bigger families. The total fertility rate in the DRC is 6.6, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] compared to 5.5 in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and 3.9 in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">As a participant in the multi-national study, we examined the safety and efficacy of simplified antibiotic regimens compared with the reference treatment for the management of neonates and young infants with PSBI among infants enrolled in the study. Our site-specific data demonstrated similarity between each of the experimental treatment regimens and the reference treatment. Treatment failure varied among groups from 11.6% to 6.7%. Treatment regimen D, which had only two injections of gentamicin, had the smallest proportion of treatment failure. The risk difference in treatment among the three simplified regimens and the reference treatment varied from &#x02212;&#x02009;2.0% to &#x02212;&#x02009;4.9%. The upper limits of the confidence intervals for all risk differences were less than the pre-specified limit that defined similarity (5%) with the exception of regimen B in which the upper limit of the confidence interval was 5.2%. As expected, the confidence intervals were greater in our smaller tudy population compared to the larger population in the multi-national study. However, it was encouraging to observe that, although the risk of treatment failure for all groups was greater than in the larger study population, all risk differences compared to the referent arm were negative.</p><p id="Par45">Most treatment failures occurred on day 4, and the most common reason for treatment failure was the persistence of the danger signs on day 4. Collectively, these findings are similar to those observed in the multi-national study. In view of these collective similarities with the multi-national, it can reasonably be inferred that treatment regimens for young infants with signs of serious bacterial infection tested in the multi-national study would be equally effective in the DRC.</p><p id="Par46">In response to the publication of the parent study, and a companion study investigating the effectiveness of a simplified antibiotic treatment regimen for fast breathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], several respondents expressed concerns about the context, observations and inferences drawn from these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These concerns included the unexpectedly low mortality rates in all arms of the study, the use of criteria for PSBI that have high sensitivity but low specificity, the inherent over-treatment of infants with viral rather than bacterial infection, and the potential for emergence of resistance to these antibiotics resulting from the widespread adoption of the simplified regimens. These concerns were addressed in a response by investigators from the parent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We can only add that the parent study was a pragmatic trial to determine if a simplified alternative to the recommended treatment for PBSI, that is not available to most infants in low resource environments, would be equally effective. Despite the limitations imposed by the study design, the WHO concluded that the evidence was sufficiently compelling to recommend the simplified regimens in low resource settings when the standard treatment is not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our site-specific analyses suggest that these recommendations should be adopted in the DRC, and perhaps other similarly impoverished and very low resource environments.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par47">This is the first study in the DRC that compared simplified treatment regimens utilizing oral antibiotic regimens in an outpatient setting for the management of neonatal SBIs. This study was conducted within the context of the existing health structure. However, the protocol was highly supervised; eligibility was confirmed by specially trained study nurses and assessment visits were conducted by the most qualified nurses among them who were not part of the clinical care team. This level of oversight was necessary to ensure the quality of the research but would not typically be available during standard clinical care. Therefore, although the study methodology could be used as a model for capacity-building of the existing health system, scale up might require additional resources. Absent these resources, it is possible that outcomes of simplified treatments might not have compared as favorably to standard treatment. With the support of the WHO, we are currently investigating the feasibility of scale up of simplified regimens in another low-resource area of the DRC. This ongoing study will help address concerns about feasibility. The study was conducted in one of the poorest regions of the country. The confirmation of effectiveness in this area suggests that the effectiveness of these simplified treatments can be generalized to more affluent areas of the country, where scale up might be more feasible.</p><p id="Par48">Although the multi-national study had sufficient statistical power to demonstrate equivalence between treatments, it was not powered for site-specific outcomes. Therefore, our results should be interpreted with some caution. In addition, the relatively low mortality rate among all treatment groups may reflect the intense surveillance of the population. This close surveillance may have resulted in earlier identification of high-risk infants and earlier referral for health care. Later identification might have occurred in the absence of the study resulting in more severe illness at the initiation of antibiotic treatment, and less effectiveness of simplified treatment regimens and higher mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Implications of the results</title><p id="Par49">Community-based treatments are more practical because they do not require inpatient care that is not available to many children in rural areas of the DRC. The most simplified treatment regimen may be particularly useful because it includes primarily on oral treatment. We speculate that the widespread use of this strategy for treating neonates and young infants with PSBI would result in more infants treated more effectively. This, in turn, would reduce mortality among young infants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par50">Simplified antibiotic regimens for treating infants in rural DRC with PSBI appear to be acceptable, feasible, safe, and effective. Since the most simplified regimen using mainly oral antibiotic and only two injections proved as effective as the WHO-recommended treatment, scaling up this regimen will more likely result in more infants treated effectively and result in reduced mortality in poor areas where hospital care is costly and inaccessible.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CHW</term><def><p id="Par6">community health worker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRC</term><def><p id="Par7">Democratic Republic of Congo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMCI</term><def><p id="Par8">Integrated Management of Child Illness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par9">Intention to Treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSBI</term><def><p id="Par10">possible serious bacterial infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBA</term><def><p id="Par11">Traditional Birth Attendant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par12">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par51">The study was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the World Health Organization.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par52">The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are not yet publicly available due ongoing analyses, but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AL, SQ, CE, CB, AT conceived of the study.
