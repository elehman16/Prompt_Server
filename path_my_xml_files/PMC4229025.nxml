It can manifest from few localized areas to complete body coverage, and can also primarily involve the hands and feet, including nails. Of the 1&#x02013;3% of the general population who have psoriasis, an estimated 3&#x02013;41% have chronic plaque psoriasis of the hands and/or feet,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and approximately 50% of psoriasis patients have nail involvement.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Despite the relatively small BSA that is affected by psoriasis of the hands and/or feet, quality of life for these patients can be disproportionally poor due to pain, discomfort, and limitations in performing activities of daily living.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Nail psoriasis can alter the sense of touch and reduce manual dexterity.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Psoriasis of the hands and/or feet can also cause embarrassment due to the unsightly appearance of scales and fissures on the skin, and pitting, discoloration and crumbling of the nail.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Published information related to specific treatment of hand and/or foot psoriasis focuses mainly on palmoplantar psoriasis. Although topical therapies, including corticosteroids, retinoids, calcipotriol, salicylic acid, and coal tar, are widely used, palmoplantar psoriasis is often resistant, and prolonged corticosteroid use can have undesirable side-effects.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Common light therapies, including topical psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet A (PUVA), broadband ultraviolet B, and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB), have also been used, but published, definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of NB-UVB on localized psoriasis are lacking.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In addition, the multiple clinic visits for treatment can be inconvenient.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Established systemic therapies are typically employed when the disease is severe or refractory to topical treatment. These include PUVA with oral psoralen, methotrexate, cyclosporine, and retinoids; however, adverse effects can limit long-term use in patients with psoriasis of the hands and/or feet.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Patients with localized psoriasis may need multiple treatment agents, which include a combination of topical and systemic medications, during the course of disease to achieve treatment benefit.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Biologics approved for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis have also been used successfully to treat hand and/or foot psoriasis, although none are currently approved specifically for this condition, and most of the evidence is limited to small clinical studies and case reports.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and modulates TNF-related biological responses, is approved in the United States and Europe for multiple indications, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Recently, REACH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT00735787), a phase 4, 16 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an additional 12-week open-label period, demonstrated that adalimumab was efficacious and well-tolerated for the treatment of psoriasis of the hands and/or feet for up to 28 weeks.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Following adalimumab treatment, significant improvements were seen in scores evaluating efficacy and pain. These included erythema, scaling, induration, and fissuring (ESIF); Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI); and plaque psoriasis and PsA pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores.</p><p>This post hoc analysis REACH evaluated the effects of baseline demographic and disease characteristics on the efficacy of adalimumab compared with placebo for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis of the hands and/or feet during the 16-week double-blind period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The REACH study design is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>; a detailed description has been published.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Patients had moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis involving the hands and/or feet. In the 16-week placebo-controlled period, patients were randomized 2: 1 (adalimumab:placebo) to adalimumab 80 mg at week 0, and 40 mg every other week from weeks 1&#x02013;15 or matching placebo. Washout periods were conducted for investigational and biologic agents, other systemic psoriasis therapies, phototherapy, excessive sun exposure or tanning-bed use, and topical therapies on the hands and feet.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design. <sup>a</sup>From week 1, after an 80 mg dose at week 0. <sup>b</sup>Primary Endpoint was proportion of patients with Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment of hands and/or feet (hfPGA) of clear or almost clear at week 16. <sup>c</sup>From week 17, after an 80 mg dose at week 16. n: efficacy analysis set.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jdv0028-0882-f1"/></fig><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Criteria for including or excluding patients have been previously described.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Briefly, patients were adult (at least 18 years of age) men and women who had been diagnosed with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the hands and/or feet for at least 6 months, and had evidence of psoriatic disease on at least one other cutaneous area. Patients had a baseline score of at least three on the Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment of hands and/or feet (hfPGA). A score of zero or one indicated either no signs of plaque psoriasis (&#x02018;clear&#x02019;) or perceptible erythema and scaling (&#x02018;almost clear&#x02019;), a score of two indicated light-pink erythema and minimal scaling with or without pustules (&#x02018;mild&#x02019;), a score of three indicated dull-red erythema with diffuse scaling, and some skin thickening with or without fissures or pustules (&#x02018;moderate&#x02019;), and a score of four indicated deep, dark-red erythema with obvious, diffuse scaling, thickening, and numerous fissures, with or without pustules (&#x02018;severe&#x02019;). The main exclusion criteria included previous treatment with adalimumab or the presence of palmoplantar pustulosis or other active skin diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary endpoint of REACH was the proportion of patients achieving an hfPGA score of clear or almost clear at week 16. The post hoc analyses reported here include evaluation of patients for the effects on the primary endpoint of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, including age (&#x0003c;40 years, 40&#x02013;64 years, and &#x02265;65 years), gender, weight (&#x0003c;88 kg, &#x02265;88 kg), Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score (&#x0003c;10, &#x02265;10), disease duration (&#x0003c;4.7 years, &#x02265;4.7 years), PsA history, prior systemic treatment, smoking history and nail involvement. The population median for bodyweight (88 kg) and disease duration (4.7 years) determined the dichotomization for baseline weight and disease duration.</p><p>All patients with nail psoriasis at baseline were also evaluated for improvement of target nail (most severely involved fingernail) at week 16 by NAPSI 50 response and concomitant improvement in psoriasis of the hands and/or feet. Patients were grouped by NAPSI 50 response at week 16; those who achieved or did not achieve NAPSI 50 (at least a 50% improvement from baseline in NAPSI score) were defined as &#x02018;Responders&#x02019; or &#x02018;Non-Responders&#x02019; respectively. At week 16, both subgroups were then evaluated for the proportion who achieved hfPGA score of clear or almost clear, and improvements from baseline in ESIF, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and plaque psoriasis and PsA pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores. Only adalimumab-treated patients were included in the subgroup analyses by NAPSI 50 response.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Due to investigator non-compliance at one study centre, all of that centre&#x02019;s patients (<italic>N</italic> = 9) were excluded from all analyses in REACH (decided pre-database lock), and were not included in this post hoc analysis.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Missing or incomplete data were handled using non-responder imputation for categorical data and last observation carried forward for continuous data.

Of the 72 patients, 31 (23 adalimumab, 8 placebo) with nail psoriasis at baseline and data available through week 16, were evaluated for nail improvement.</p><p>Overall, patient baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment groups (adalimumab and placebo) across the three studied populations (ITT, NAPSI 50 Responders, NAPSI 50 Non-Responders). The majority of patients had moderate disease and a relatively low percentage of affected BSA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). NAPSI 50 Responders reported a longer duration of psoriasis at baseline than NAPSI 50 Non-Responders (20.6 &#x000b1; 20.06 vs. 15.1 &#x000b1; 14.42 years). A greater percentage of NAPSI 50 Non-Responders compared with NAPSI 50 Responders had an hfPGA score of severe at baseline (47.1% vs. 14.3%) and psoriasis only on the palms (23.5% vs.

Adalimumab showed greater efficacy compared with placebo for the primary efficacy measure (hfPGA score of clear or almost clear), regardless of age, gender, weight, PASI score, disease duration, PsA history, prior systemic treatment, smoking history, or nail disease. This is the first analysis of the impact of baseline patient demographic and disease characteristics on the efficacy of a TNF-antagonist for hand and/or foot psoriasis in a double-blind, controlled trial. The clinical responses observed with adalimumab treatment are consistent with the overall results of the placebo-controlled period of REACH<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and with adalimumab data for the treatment of psoriasis elsewhere on the body. Adalimumab also was efficacious in treating nail disease in patients with hand and/or foot psoriasis; marked improvement in nail disease correlated with significant improvements in skin disease and patient-reported outcomes.</p><p>All patients demonstrated improved responses following adalimumab treatment, but greater response was seen in patients of younger age (&#x0003c;65 years), lighter bodyweight (&#x0003c;88 kg), with higher PASI scores (&#x02265;10), longer disease duration (&#x02265;4.7 years), history of PsA, prior systemic treatment, and nail involvement. Such response differences may be due to the small number of patients included in this analysis. Higher response rates have been reported in younger compared with older (&#x0003c;65 vs. &#x02265;65 years of age) adalimumab-treated patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis not limited to hands and/or feet.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Also, higher response rates in patients of lower weight have been reported in the treatment of psoriasis elsewhere in the body with adalimumab<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and with other fixed-dose systemic biologics such as alefacept and etanercept.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> While a higher response rate was noted in patients with PASI score &#x02265;10, this finding does not necessarily indicate that patients with more severe disease responded better to adalimumab compared with those of less-severe disease; this is based on limitations of the PASI scoring method (compounded weighted averaging of all components), which can hide potential response differences.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Patients with longer disease duration characteristically do not respond as well to systemic treatment as those with shorter disease duration. The results of this post hoc analysis, however, suggest that adalimumab is efficacious even in patients with well-established psoriasis of the hands and/or feet. Patients who had received prior systemic therapy also had a better response to adalimumab than patients with no prior systemic treatment, suggesting that patients had not become refractory to adalimumab treatment despite failing other systemic agents, including biologics. In patients with psoriasis, there is an increased prevalence of smoking, which is a known risk factor for incident psoriasis.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The response to adalimumab treatment in this analysis did not appear to be affected by patient smoking status, although the small number of patients does not allow a comparison to the general psoriasis population.</p><p>Nail involvement can contribute significantly to the burden of illness in patients with hand and/or foot psoriasis. In this study, nail psoriasis at baseline was identified for about half of all patients, which is similar to reports of nail involvement in patient populations with all types of psoriasis, including plaque psoriasis (35&#x02013;50%).<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A marked improvement in nail disease after 16 weeks of adalimumab treatment was associated with marked improvements in both skin disease (hfPGA) and in patient-reported outcomes (ESIF, DLQI, pain VAS scores). Several other studies of biologic agents, including TNF inhibitors, for treatment of patients specifically with nail psoriasis have shown concomitant improvements in nail response and psoriatic skin and/or quality of life.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> While NAPSI responses reported in this analysis are only through week 16, further improvements in nail psoriasis and quality of life with longer duration of adalimumab therapy have been reported.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Improvement in nail psoriasis has also been correlated with improvement in moderate-to-severe psoriasis elsewhere in the body following treatment with infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and with ustekinumab.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Small studies comparing the efficacy of anti-TNF agents in nail psoriasis show that patients treated with infliximab experience greater NAPSI improvement early in therapy compared with etanercept and adalimumab, although the differences among these biologics become less pronounced after 48 weeks of therapy.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Few large, prospective randomized studies have been published about the effect of biologic agents on psoriasis of the hands and/or feet.

Despite being a subjective scale, the consistent efficacy observed among adalimumab-treated patients through various secondary endpoints in REACH support the primary endpoint (hfPGA of clear or almost clear) result.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition, the use of this scale resulted in a more comprehensive assessment of localized psoriasis on the hands and feet, compared with other studies that mostly used the palmoplantar pustular PASI (PPPASI) score,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> or modification thereof.<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The PPPASI score evaluates only the palmar and plantar aspects of the hands and/or feet, and includes a score for pustules, which replaces the regular PASI score of induration. In a recent clinical trial, a measure similar to the hfPGA was used, but only for palmar and/or plantar evaluation based on a 5-point scale (0 = clear, 5 = most severe).<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>This study is limited by the small number of patients included in the analyses. As a result, statistical comparisons of responses could not be made between adalimumab and placebo-treatment subgroups for the primary endpoint, or between NAPSI 50 Responders and Non-Responders for improvements in patient-reported outcomes among patients with psoriatic nail involvement at baseline. In addition, patients with pustular psoriasis were excluded from the trial, which limits generalization of the results of this analysis to non-pustular forms of hand and/or foot psoriasis. Finally, the analyses were conducted within a relatively short period of 16 weeks during the double-blind controlled period of the trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Psoriasis affecting the hands and/or feet has a negative impact on patient quality of life due to its visibility and resultant disability. Thus, achieving optimal clearance of psoriatic lesions is of high importance for these patients. After 16 weeks, adalimumab was efficacious for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis of the hands and/or feet regardless of patient baseline demographics and disease characteristics. Adalimumab was also efficacious in treating nail disease, with a marked improvement in nail psoriasis correlating with significant improvements in both skin disease and patient-reported outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Angelika Freitag, former employee of AbbVie Deutschland GmbH &#x00026; Co KG, Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Hui Ding, MSc, current employee of AbbVie Deutschland GmbH &#x00026; Co KG, Ludwigshafen, Germany, for statistical analysis support for this manuscript; and Jody Bennett and Amy Gamelli, PhD, both employed by AbbVie, for writing and editorial assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Saraswat</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaur</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Palmoplantar lesions in psoriasis: a study of 3065 patients</article-title><source>Acta Derm Venereol</source><year>2002</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>192</fpage><lpage>195</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12353710</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jiaravuthisan</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sasseville</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Vender</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Psoriasis of the nail: anatomy, pathology, clinical presentation, and a review of the literature on therapy</article-title><source>J Am Acad Dermatol</source><year>2007</year><volume>57</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>27</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17572277</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Menter</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gottlieb</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 1.
