The use of thermal energy requires the instillation of tumescent anesthesia around the vein. Mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA&#x02122;) combines mechanical endothelial damage, using a rotating wire, with simultaneous infusion of a liquid sclerosans. Tumescent anesthesia is not required as no heat is used. Prospective studies using MOCA&#x02122; in both great and small saphenous veins showed good anatomical and clinical results with fast postoperative recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The MESSI trial (Mechanochemical Endovenous ablation versus radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of primary Small Saphenous vein Insufficiency) is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which a total of 160 patients will be randomized (1:1) to MOCA&#x02122; or RFA. Consecutive patients with primary small saphenous vein incompetence, who meet the eligibility criteria, will be invited to participate in this trial. The primary endpoint is anatomic success, defined as occlusion of the treated veins objectified with duplex ultrasonography at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up. Secondary endpoints are post-procedural pain, initial technical success, clinical success, complications and the duration of the procedure. Initial technical success is defined as the ability to position the device adequately, treat the veins as planned and occlude the treated vein directly after the procedure has been proven by duplex ultrasonography. Clinical success is defined as an objective improvement of clinical outcome after treatment, measured with the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). Power analyses are conducted for anatomical success and post-procedural pain.</p><p>Both groups will be evaluated on an intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The hypothesis of the MESSI trial is that the anatomic success rate of MOCA&#x02122; is not inferior to RFA. The second hypothesis is that post-procedural pain is significantly less after MOCA compared to RFA.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Trial registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/">NTR4613</ext-link> Date of trial registration: 28 May 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mechanochemical ablation</kwd><kwd>ClariVein</kwd><kwd>radiofrequency ablation</kwd><kwd>varicose vein</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>MOCA</kwd><kwd>outcome</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Varicose veins are common and symptoms range from cosmetic complaints to venous ulcers. The incidence increases with age and women are more affected than men. The majority of venous associated complaints are due to great saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency; however, in 15% of patients, small saphenous vein (SSV) insufficiency is the main cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>During the last decade, minimally invasive endothermal catheter modalities took over the role of surgical therapy in the treatment of small saphenous insufficiency. Surgery has been associated with high recurrence rates (25 to 60%), nerve injuries, and significant postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Success rates after endothermal catheter techniques, for example, endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), are excellent. At 1&#x000a0;year follow-up, the anatomical success rate of RFA is 88% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. RFA is associated with fewer procedure-related symptoms, superior cosmetic results and earlier resumptions of daily activity compared to traditional surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, to perform endothermal techniques, tumescent anesthesia is essential. Furthermore, heat-induced nerve injury and post-procedural pain is inherent to endothermal ablation and can become chronic. Nerve injuries after endothermal ablation of SSV are seen in up to 11% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA&#x02122;), using the ClariVein&#x02122; system (Vascular Insights LLC, Madison, CT, USA) was introduced in Europe in 2010. Mechanical injury to the endothelium by a rotating wire at the tip of a catheter is combined with an infusion of liquid sclerosans, without the use of tumescent anesthesia. In Europe, the ClariVein&#x02122; device was registered on April 26, 2010, CE 558723.</p><p>Recently, the authors published the first results of MOCA&#x02122; in SSV. Occlusion rates in 50 patients were 100% at 6&#x000a0;weeks follow-up and up to 97% at 1&#x000a0;year. In this cohort of SSVs, no major complications, including nerve injury, were seen. Minor complications, such as localized ecchymoses and superficial thrombophlebitis were seen in 12 to 14%. The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), an objective measure for varicose vein-specific symptoms, improved significantly from 3 (IQR 2 to 5) before treatment to 1 (IQR 1 to 3, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001) at 6&#x000a0;weeks follow-up. Clinical results were retained at 1&#x000a0;year after treatment (VCSS 1, IQR 1 to 2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001). Patients were satisfied after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Several other studies reported promising data on feasibility, safety, anatomical and clinical success regarding MOCA treatment in GSV insufficiency, without major complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The multicenter randomized clinical MESSI trial is designed to compare MOCA&#x02122; and RFA in the treatment of SSV insufficiency. Patients with primary SSV insufficiency, meeting eligibility criteria, will be included at the outpatient clinics of the participating hospitals after giving written informed consent. The procedures are performed or supervised by dedicated vascular surgeons, who have performed over 20 procedures of both treatment modalities.</p><p>The following Dutch vascular centers are participating in the MESSI trial: St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein, Rijnstate Hospital Arnhem and Rode Kruis Hospital Beverwijk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The aim of the study is to show that MOCA&#x02122; has no inferior anatomical success compared to RFA at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up. The secondary aim is to evaluate post-procedural pain, which is hypothesized to be significantly less after MOCA&#x02122;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Power analysis is calculated for anatomical success at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up after endovenous treatment of the SSV. The calculation is based on the hypothesis that MOCA&#x02122; will have no inferior occlusion rates at 1&#x000a0;year after treatment compared to RFA. The meta-analysis by Van de Bos <italic>et al</italic>. showed anatomical success rates of 88% after RFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our recent study on MOCA&#x02122; in SSV showed an occlusion rate of 97% in the group treated according to our current study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A Chi-square test with a one-sided 0.05 significance has a power of 80% to observe no difference between both groups, when each group consists of 74 patients (non-inferiority principle, range 2%). The study population of both groups will consist of 148 patients. Corrected for 7.5% lost to follow-up, the total study population will consist of 160 patients.</p><p>Pain is an important secondary outcome parameter. A sample size calculation is also performed for this endpoint based on the hypothesis that MOCA&#x02122; will have lower post-procedural pain scores, as measured by a 100-point pain score, during the first two weeks after surgery. To evaluate a 30 percent reduction in post-procedural pain, 58 patients per group are needed (alpha 5%, power 80%). This analysis will be performed after inclusion and randomization of at least 58 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint is anatomic success after treatment of SSV insufficiency with MOCA&#x02122; or RFA at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up. Anatomic success is defined as occlusion of the treated vein and proven with duplex ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>Post-procedural pain is evaluated using a 100-millimeter visual analog scale (VAS) during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks after treatment. The other secondary endpoints are initial technical success, clinical success, pain during treatment, complications and duration of the procedure. Initial technical success is defined as the ability to position the device adequately, treat the veins as planned and occlude the treated vein directly after the procedure proven by duplex ultrasonography. Clinical success is measured using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). Complications related to the endovenous treatment, that occur within 30&#x000a0;days after treatment, are divided between major complications (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, nerve injury, skin burn), minor complications (ecchymosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, hyperpigmentation, wound infection, prolonged pain &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;week) and sclerosans-related complications. Additionally, all endpoints will be evaluated at 2 and 5&#x000a0;years post-treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>A patient, who meets the inclusion criteria, will be fully informed about the trial and provided with a patient information and informed consent form.

The catheter is inserted into the vein and direct energy is delivered to the endothelium with collapsing and sealing of the vein as effect. During the MESSI study, all participating centers are using the VNUS&#x02122; ClosureFAST&#x02122; catheter (VNUS Medical Technologies, San Jose, California, USA). The VNUS&#x02122; ClosureFAST&#x02122; catheter contains a 7-cm long heating element at the end of the catheter, used for segmental ablation. Every 7-cm segment is treated during a 20-second treatment cycle in which a temperature of 120 degrees is maintained. Only the most proximal segment is treated during the two cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The insufficient SSV is punctured distally under ultrasound-guidance and a guide wire is inserted. An introducer sheath is placed over the guide wire. Subsequently, the RFA catheter is introduced and positioned approximately 2&#x000a0;cm distal to the saphenopopliteal junction using ultrasound guidance. Then, tumescent anesthesia is delivered along the entire SSV to be treated. The target vein is compressed circumferentially and positioned at least 1&#x000a0;cm below the skin, due to the tumescence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Mechanochemical endovenous ablation</title><p>The MOCA&#x02122; technique has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Briefly, the ClariVein&#x02122; device is a disposable 2.6&#x000a0;F single-lumen catheter for infusing liquid sclerosans. A metal wire, fitted distally with a small ball, runs through the catheter (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The motorized handle unit rotates this wire at 3,000&#x000a0;rpm. The purpose of this wire is to create intimal injury, to induce vasospasm and disperse the liquid sclerosans.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

Different endothermal techniques have been introduced and tested in many prospective and randomized studies. Although most research is performed in GSVs, limited data on SSV is available. The results of endothermal techniques have proven to be excellent with a long-term anatomical success rate over 90%; therefore, the aim for future studies, especially in SSV, is diminishing heat-related complications, for example, pain and nerve injury, without compromising anatomical and clinical success. Until now the gold standard for the treatment of SSV insufficiency remains unclear.</p><p>This trial is designed to compare the anatomical success at 1&#x000a0;year after MOCA&#x02122; with RFA.</p><p>A secondary aim is to investigate whether MOCA&#x02122; is associated with a significant reduction in post-procedural pain. A major point of discussion is the choice for RFA above EVLA techniques. Although the meta-analysis of Van de Bos <italic>et al</italic>. showed the superiority of endothermal ablation (EVLA) in terms of anatomical success at 1 to 5&#x000a0;years follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the more recent RCT of Rasmussen <italic>et al</italic>. has proven that the results of RFA using the ClosureFast device are at least similar to EVLT. In this randomized trial, RFA was associated with significantly less post-procedural pain compared to EVLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, an important consideration in choosing ClosureFast is the uniformity of this technique, while in the case of ELVA, discussion about different tip designs and wavelengths might occur.</p><p>It has been proven that minimally invasive techniques will lead to a lower incidence of nerve injury in the SSV compared to conventional surgery (11% versus 28%). However, sural nerve injury is still considered a major and potentially underreported complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Due to the fact that no heat and tumescent is used in MOCA&#x02122;, nerve injury after SSV ablation might become a redundant complication.</p><p>In conclusion, the MESSI trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial that aims to show a similar anatomical success of MOCA compared to RFA. Additionally, we hypothesize that this is accompanied by comparable clinical success and a reduction in post-procedural pain after MOCA&#x02122; compared with RFA.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p>The MESSI trial began including participants in the second quarter of 2014.
