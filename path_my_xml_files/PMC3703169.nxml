With aging, several changes occur that can place one at risk for insomnia, including age-related changes in various circadian rhythms, environmental and lifestyle changes, and decreased nutrients intake, absorption, retention, and utilization. The natural <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist and GABA agonist, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, seems to play a key role in the regulation of sleep.

Anthropometric confounding factors, daily intake of magnesium, calcium, potassium, caffeine, calories form carbohydrates, and total calorie intake, were obtained using 24-h recall for 3 days.

Insomnia is not necessarily an inevitable consequence of aging, but its prevalence increases with age[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and most elderly people who have not appropriate geriatric conditions, may suffer from major sleep disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In other words, aging itself does not lead to sleep disorders, and this problem is due to other factors associated with aging.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The most important age-related sleep changes include decreased sleep duration, decreased sleep efficiency (SE) (the percentage of sleeping time after going to bed), and decreased short-wave sleep, which all are categorized as insomnia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The prevalence of insomnia in all population groups is between 10% and 48%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] One population survey of insomnia prevalence in the elderly found that 42% of participants reported difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep. Following up, the results of the study for 3 years found that 15% of contributors who did not reported insomnia had disturbed sleep, suggesting an annual incidence rate of approximately 5 percent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In other statistics, the insomnia is estimated to be present in 40-50% percent of elderly people above 60 years of age.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>In all age groups, the individuals who suffer from insomnia show memory weakness, increased reaction time, short-term memory problems, and lowered efficacy level. However, insomnia is more problematic in elderly subjects, because it puts them at higher risk for falling, cognitive impairments, weak physical function, and mortality (from 1.3 to 3 times higher than normal subjects).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Sleep disorders are also related to decreased quality of life and general health and increased health costs, stress, and depression symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Currently, insomnia treatment includes medicinal and nonmedicinal treatments. Regarding the effects of nonmedicinal methods in insomniac individuals, there are low or medium quality evidences, or no important clinical results. In general, there is no precise information about the beneficial effects of these methods on insomnia treatment compared to control groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Medicinal treatment of insomnia is done through a broad spectrum of drugs; however, Sleep Disorders Conference of American National Institutes of Health has declared that drugs used routinely for treatment of sleep disorders have more hazards than benefits and are not recommended for elderly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Particularly, there is a concern about elderly people, since 81% of hypnotic drugs are used in daily and long-term patterns by them.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Magnesium is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and the second most abundant intracellular cation. It is involved in more than 300 biochemical reactions of the body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Magnesium is an essential cofactor for many enzymatic reactions, especially those that are involved in energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Aging is a major risk factor for magnesium deficiency. Numerous changes are occurring in magnesium status during elderly. Its total level reduces due to a decrease in bone mass which is the most important magnesium source in the body. Epidemiologic studies show that despite important physiologic role of magnesium, its dietary intake is inadequate in various societies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and some population groups, especially elderly people have low magnesium intake,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] which can be due to inability in using magnesium sources or their tendencies to consume more processed food and less whole grains and green leafy vegetables. However, it is shown that magnesium requirements do not change by aging.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Other alterations in magnesium metabolism, which are related to aging, are reduced magnesium intake, reduced intestinal uptake, increased urinal and fecal excretion, and drug induced.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Meanwhile, it seems that reduced magnesium intake has the most important role in age-related magnesium deficiency.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Dietary magnesium deficiency in the elderly is much higher than expected and its intake decreases continuously and exponentially with age, independent of gender and race.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] NHANCES III analysis shows that elders&#x02019; magnesium intake in United States is much less than recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and compared to recommended levels of 420 and 320 mg/day, respectively for men and women, is equal to 225 mg/day for men and 166 mg/day for women. Yet, little is known about the magnesium status in Iran, especially in elderly population. The only well-designed population-based survey in Iran of dietary magnesium intake was conducted from 1999 through 2001 (within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study). A striking result of an analysis of that survey was the lower mean magnesium intake among participants. In aforementioned study, 95% of subjects failed to meet magnesium requirements (137 &#x000b1; 28 mg/day).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>Although the effect of magnesium on neural function and sleep behaviors is not fully understood, magnesium has an essential role in ion channels conductivity, such as <italic>N</italic>-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor, and unilateral entrance of potassium channels. In addition, magnesium is essential for connection of monoamines to their receptors. Thus, this cation has a key role in neural transmission at cellular level, both in presynaptic membrane and postsynaptic membrane. Several studies have also acknowledged the role of magnesium in the regulation of central nervous system excitability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] Therefore, magnesium as a natural antagonist of NMDA and agonist of GABA seems to play a critical role in sleep regulation.</p><p>According to mentioned issues, if magnesium supplementation can prevent insomnia side effects through its improvement, it can be used as an alternative treatment of routine drugs or in combination with them in order to reduce their numerous side effects. For this purpose, the present study is conducted to determine the impact of magnesium supplementation on insomnia in elderly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Based on evidences in the literature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] and regarding to Held <italic>et al</italic>. study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] concentration of serum renin was chosen to estimate the sample size. Serum renin concentration was expected to have 0.6 mIU/ml difference between placebo and supplementation groups. A sample size of 21 participants per group has 80% power to detect such a difference and a significance level of 5%. To adjust for an expected drop-out rate of 10%, approximately 46 participants (23 per group) needed to be enrolled in the study. So subjects consisted of 46 volunteers, (23 women, 23 men; age 65 &#x000b1; 4.6) who entered the study after passing through psychiatric examinations and insomnia severity index (ISI) test, in order to confirm their primary insomnia (clinically moderate or severe), and their sleep time (ST) was registered in sleep log forms for 14 days, prior to begin supplementation (run-in phase). Investigators assigned consecutive code numbers to participants from a prespecified list. Simple sampling method was used to select patients who were then randomly allocated into the magnesium or the placebo group and received 500 mg elemental magnesium or placebo daily for 8 weeks. For those who were consistent with inclusion criteria and lacked the exclusion criteria of the study, the benefits, the aim, and duration of the study, and mode of intervention were described in a briefing. Criteria for inclusion in our double-blind randomized clinical trial included: Willing to cooperate, age 60-75 years, having insomnia according to ISI and sleep-log questionnaires, having body mass index (BMI) range of 25-34.9, dietary intake of magnesium under 75% RDA; serum magnesium level under 0.95 mmol/L, not receiving loop diuretics, cyclosporine, digoxin, amphotericin and any hormonal treatment, not having renal diseases, acute heart failure, sleep-related movement disorders (such as restless leg syndrome), and sleep-related respiratory disorders (such as sleep apnea). Reasons for exclusion from the study were: Psychiatric disorder history, recent stressful life events (e.g., divorce or death or acute illness of a family member), substance or alcohol abuse, and a transmeridian flight during last 6 weeks. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was approved by ethics committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design and measurements</title><p>The study was performed in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel design, in January to March 2012 in Health Divisions of Cultural Centers of Tehran's 1, 10, and 14 districts.

Questionnaires of ISI, physical activity, and sleep log were completed at baseline and after the intervention period. Anthropometric confounding factors, daily intake of magnesium, calcium, potassium, caffeine, calorie form carbohydrates, and total calorie intake, were obtained using 24-h recall for 3 days.</p><p>To analyze biochemical factors of contributors, they were asked to be fasted for 12 h. Then venous blood samples were collected by a trained nurse and cooled rapidly to 2&#x000b0;C, then within 2-3 h, the blood samples were centrifuged with 3500 g velocity for 15 min and the sera were put in a &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C freezer. The serum magnesium level was measured through atomic absorption spectrometry method and its cortisol, renin, and melatonin levels were measured through ELISA method. After collecting biochemical samples, anthropometric measurements were done by trained colleagues; so, according to WHO standards, the light cloth worn patients were weighted and their height were measured without shoes with a 0.5 cm accuracy wall meter. Using the weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) square formula, BMI was calculated and the obtained information was recorded in general information questionnaire of patients. These measurements were repeated at the end of eighth week of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Quantitative variables were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

In their study magnesium supplementation increased the quiet sleep and decreased the active sleep.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Also, the results of our study are consistent with <italic>Murck</italic> and <italic>Steiger</italic> study in which the most important effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation were an increment in spindle power during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and a change in delta power in the in the third sleep cycle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] In a study conducted by <italic>Held et al</italic>. to analyze magnesium supplementation effects on sleep EEG, plasma ACTH, cortisol, AVP, renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone in elderly, which showed that the most important Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation effect in healthy elderly subjects was short wave sleep (SWS) increment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Also, the results of our study are consistent with <italic>Rondanelli et al</italic>. study, which was done to investigate the effects of combined melatonin, magnesium, and zinc supplementation, which showed that the supplementation resulted in total score improvement of Pittsburg questionnaire compared to placebo, and suggested that treatment has beneficial effects on capability of recovering body activities through sleep.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, regarding to increase in SE &#x02014; as the best total scale of insomnia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] &#x02014; from 0.63 to 0.73 in supplement group, it can be concluded that despite lack of change in TST of each person, if ST and adequacy of sleep increased and SOL decreased, in the same range, there is no need to increase TST in order to relieve the fatigue caused by daily activities and to recover body's ability through sleep.</p><p>In the present study, serum magnesium level in supplement group tended to augment (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06); however, difference between two groups was just marginally significant at the end of the study. The method used for magnesium status assessment in the present study was the measurement of serum magnesium concentration. Since 99% of magnesium is in the bone and soft tissue, clinical assessment of magnesium status is difficult and has become now a challenge for clinical laboratories.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] Based on the observations of several investigations, currently serum magnesium analysis appears to be the most practical, accessible, and expeditious method of identifying changes in magnesium homeostasis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>] The obtained results from our study are consistent with the study of <italic>Hoogerbrugge et al</italic>. who investigated the effect of supplementation with 1 gram magnesium oxide for 6 weeks on Lp(a) level in hypercholesterolemic patients and did not observe a significant difference in serum magnesium increment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>] <italic>Held et al</italic>. also, in a study which dealt with magnesium supplementation in 12 healthy persons, could not recognize a significant difference between two groups, despite detection of serum magnesium tendency toward increase in the supplementation group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] The study of <italic>Rodriguez et al</italic>., which dealt with magnesium supplementation in the treatment of depression in diabetic elderly subjects, reported a significant difference in serum magnesium level in supplement group compared to placebo group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>] <italic>Haddad et al</italic>. also, in their study, reported a significant increase in serum magnesium of the group which received intravenous magnesium compared to placebo group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>] Guerrero and Rodriguez in their study to investigate the effect of magnesium supplement in lowering blood pressure of hypertensive diabetic patients, reported that during 4 month of supplementation with 450 mg/day elemental magnesium, serum magnesium concentration in the intervention group compared to placebo group, increased gradually and reached a significant level at the third month.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>] Regarding to this study and increment trend of serum magnesium in our study, this is possible that the duration of our study was inadequate to observe a significant difference in serum magnesium alterations. This resistance to change of serum magnesium levels could also be attributed to its important role as a cofactor and the need to precisely regulate its concentration.</p><p>The results of this study show that as compared to the placebo group, in the experimental group dietary magnesium supplementation brought about statistically significant increase in serum renin concentration (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). There is little information about sleep deficiency and HPA axis in scientific literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>] Simultaneous measurement of plasma renin level and changes in different sleep phases suggests a close relationship between renin, and REM and NREM sleep. NREM sleep occurred in association with increased plasma renin level, but decreased renin level is concurrent with lighter sleep. Spontaneous or stimulated awakening results in stopping the normal increase of the plasma renin. Therefore, plotting renin levels will show exactly the sleep phases. If the sleep cycles are normal, renin level fluctuates in regular periods, but in incomplete sleep cycles, the renin plot will reveal all structural sleep disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>] The results of our study are consistent with the results obtained from the study of <italic>Held et al</italic>. in which magnesium supplementation caused a significant increase in serum renin concentration in intervention group compared to placebo group. The proposed mechanism for this serum renin increment included sleep cycle alterations, and the endocrine glands which can affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity through altering electrolytes level, including magnesium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>] Some alterations occur in special regulatory pathways such as reduction of sensitivity to angiotensin II, due to sleep deficiency. Increased sleeping time, down-regulates inhibitory mechanism of renin release in kidney thus serum renin level increases. In adrenal cortex, it decrease aldosterone release and in hypothalamus, angiotensin II inhibits HPA axis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>]</p><p>The results of our study show that magnesium supplementation resulted in significant decrease in serum cortisol concentrations. The results of the present study are consistent with the results of Held study which showed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> supplementation caused significant cortisol reduction in the first half of the sleep.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] However, <italic>Cinar et al</italic>. reported that magnesium supplementation of 10 mg per kilogram of the body weight, for one month, if associated with physical activity could cause the increase in serum cortisol level in individuals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>] One possible mechanism for this reducing effect is that the NMDA antagonist properties of magnesium, reduce the activity and secretion of adrenocorticotropin from anterior hypophysis through down-regulation of corticotropin releasing factor and its transportation via the main capillary network of hypophyseal port to anterior hypophysis. Which in turn, causes adenylyl cyclase activity in cell membrane of adrenal cortex, then reducing the activity of protein</p><p>kinase A and decreasing conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone; the first and limiting reaction of cortisol synthesis. All mentioned actions are consistent with Mg<sup>2+</sup> antagonistic properties on NMDA. Beside NMDA antagonistic properties, Mg<sup>2+</sup> also has endocrine effects such as an ATII-antagonistic action[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>] and a dampening effect on HPA-system activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] which results in decrease in serum cortisol concentration. The results of our study was not consistent with <italic>Murck</italic> and <italic>Steiger</italic> study, which in their study magnesium supplementation did not resulted in any decrement in serum cortisol concentrations. The solution they used in the treatment condition contained Mg<sup>2+</sup> as well as glucose. So the question arises, whether the effects could be due to this agent. Regarding the endocrine changes, ACTH is known to be increased by hypoglycemia. The secretion of the releasing peptide for ACTH, corticotropin-releasing hormone, in isolated rat hypothalamus is stimulated by glucose levels under 5.5 mM. Above this level, the changes are small and not significant. Thus, it seems unlikely that glucose might contribute to the observed effects but this cannot be completely ruled out.</p><p>The results of our study showed that as compared to the placebo group, in the experimental group dietary magnesium supplementation brought about statistically significant increase in serum melatonin concentration (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007). Our result is consistent with the study of <italic>Zhao et al</italic>. which suggested that magnesium sulfate injection to experimental rats caused the stimulation and significant increase of melatonin secretion from pineal gland.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>] Also the results of this study are consistent with the results of <italic>Billyard's</italic> study which stated that magnesium deficiency led to plasma melatonin reduction in rats. The induced magnesium deficiency was medium in this study which then increases its capability to extend the results to human (because severe magnesium deficiency is rare in human). However, since only plasma melatonin was measured in this study, it is not clear that the melatonin reduction was due to reduced synthesis or increased destruction of melatonin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>] On the other hand, the results of <italic>Murck</italic> and <italic>Steiger</italic> study showed that no change was observed in cortisol, growth hormone, prolactin, and melatonin secretions due to magnesium supplementation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p><p>In general, studies show that magnesium deficiency affects circadian cycle, melatonin reduction, and sleep disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>] Morton and James suggested that the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in rat is increased after magnesium injection. Moreover, magnesium increases NAT activity in pineal gland <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the pineal gland, not another place of the body, is the affect site.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>] The mentioned findings implicates on possible magnesium deficiency role in reduced NAT activity and reduced melatonin production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Supplementation of magnesium appears to improve subjective and objective measures of insomnia in elderly people and may become a useful instrument in managing sleep disorders in the elderly, which could also be extended as a helpful aid to the general population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The study protocol was approved by Shahid Beheshty University of Medical Sciences (Reg.
