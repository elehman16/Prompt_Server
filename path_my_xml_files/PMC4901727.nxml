The following data were recorded prior to surgery and at follow-up: Penn, ASES and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores; range of motion (ROM) for shoulder flexion, external rotation (ER) at 0&#x000ba; and 90&#x000ba; abduction, and internal rotation (IR) at 90&#x000ba; abduction; shoulder strength (Lafayette Manual Muscle Tester) in empty and full can tests, abduction and ER at 0&#x000ba; abduction. Treatment (SR vs. DR) by Time (pre-op vs. post-op) mixed model analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of rotator cuff repair. It was estimated that with 20 patients per group a 10-point difference in improvement in ASES scores between SR and DR treatments could be detected at an alpha level of 0.05 with 80% power.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Outcome Scores: RC repair markedly improved Penn, ASES and SST scores (P&#x0003c;0.001), with similar improvement between single versus double row repairs (Treatment by Time P=.49 to P=.67), and excellent scores at follow-up (Double Row vs. Single Row: Penn 91&#x000b1;11 vs. 91&#x000b1;12, P=.98; ASES 92&#x000b1;9 vs 87 &#x000b1;15, P=.24; SST 11.2&#x000b1;1.2 vs. 11.4&#x000b1;1.0, P=.58). <italic>ROM:</italic> Patients with DR repairs lost ER ROM at 0&#x000ba; abduction (pre-op to final follow-up 7&#x000b1;10&#x000ba; loss, P=.013). ER ROM did not change with SR repair (3.9&#x000b1;15.6&#x000ba; gain, P=.24; Treatment by Time P=.017). This effect was not apparent for ER ROM at 90&#x000ba; abduction (Treatment by Time P=.26). IR ROM improved from pre-op to final follow-up (P&#x0003c;0.01, SR 17&#x000b1;18&#x000ba;, DR 13&#x000b1;23&#x000ba;, Treatment by Time P=.31). <italic>Strength:</italic> RC repair markedly improved strength in Empty Can (51%), Full Can (54%), Abduction (45%) and ER (31 %) strength (all P&#x0003c;.001), with no difference between SR and DR repairs (P=.54 to P=.81). Outcomes were not adversely affected by RC tear size, retraction, gender, or BMI. Patients &#x0003c;60 yo had better ASES scores than older patients (96&#x000b1;9 vs. 87&#x000b1;13, P=.021) but an age effect was not apparent for Penn (P=.14) or SST (P=.17).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Patients had excellent outcomes regardless of whether they had a SR or DR repair. Rotator cuff repair, and subsequent rehabilitation, markedly improved shoulder strength. DR repair was associated with a loss of ER ROM but this loss did not impact other outcome measures.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
