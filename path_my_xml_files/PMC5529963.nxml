Recent studies suggest that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) may lose its protective vascular phenotype in inflammatory conditions. However, the effects of common anti-inflammatory treatments on HDL function are not yet known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We compared the function of HDL in 18 patients with RA and 18 matched healthy controls. Subsequently, patients were randomised to (methotrexate+infliximab (M+I) (5 mg/kg)) or methotrexate+placebo (M+P) infusions for 54&#x02005;weeks. At week 54 and thereafter, all patients received infliximab therapy until completion of the trial (110&#x02005;weeks), enabling assessment of the impact of 1&#x02005;year of infliximab therapy in all patients. HDL functional properties were assessed at baseline, 54&#x02005;weeks and 110&#x02005;weeks by measuring the impact on endothelial nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and superoxide production (SO), paraoxonase activity (PON-1) and cholesterol efflux.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All HDL vascular assays were impaired in patients compared with controls. After 54&#x02005;weeks, NO in response to HDL was significantly greater in patients who received M+I compared with those who received M+P. Endothelial SO in response to HDL was reduced in both groups, but PON-1 and cholesterol efflux remained unchanged. All vascular measures improved compared with baseline after &#x02265;1 infliximab therapy in the analysis at 110&#x02005;weeks. No significant trend was noted for cholesterol efflux.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>HDL function can be improved with anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with RA. The M+I combination was superior to the M+P alone, suggesting that the tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; pathway may have a role in HDL vascular properties.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Conventional risk factors do not account fully for this, and increased levels of inflammation associated with RA may be an important determinant of CV outcomes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In a study of 651 patients, an elevated inflammatory state was associated with an increased CV event rate but a paradoxical reduction in circulating lipid levels.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This suggests that the relationship between lipid levels and increased CV disease is altered in RA and may be explained, at least in part, by qualitative changes to lipoproteins as a result of the inflammatory milieu.</p><p>High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been suggested to exert anti-atherosclerotic effects via reverse cholesterol transport and activation of protective endothelial pathways. In conditions such as RA however, HDL has been shown to acquire pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic phenotype that can promote atherogenesis and potentially increase CV risk.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A previous study from our group demonstrated that the beneficial function of HDL can be restored after resolution of acute inflammatory stimulus, suggesting that the modification of systemic inflammation offers potential for CV risk reduction.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>In our current study, we examined the influence of standard (methotrexate (MTX)) and novel anti-inflammatory treatments (infliximab) on HDL function in patients with RA in a randomised controlled trial over 1&#x02005;year. We also assessed the long-term effect of infliximab on HDL function and CV and RA risk factors. Our findings support the concept that HDL dysfunction can be improved by anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely used for RA therapy and this may confer CV benefit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population and protocol</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>RA population</title><p>We studied 18 patients with early erosive RA who were required to have (i) a diagnosis of RA according to the American College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria, (ii) symptoms for 6&#x02005;months&#x02014;3&#x02005;years, (iii) a minimum of two swollen metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints despite treatment with MTX and (iv) seropositivity for IgM rheumatoid factor.

Diminished production of NO may reflect endothelial dysfunction, an early step in atherogenesis, and represents a novel pathway by which HDL dysfunction can promote arterial disease in patients with RA.</p><p>We evaluated the potential for HDL function to be restored following treatment with RA anti-inflammatory therapies. MTX is commonly used as a first-line treatment in early RA. Observational studies have demonstrated reduced rates of myocardial infarction and stroke with MTX therapy and the ongoing CIRT trial is evaluating the drug in secondary CV prevention.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Its exact anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain uncertain, although it has been shown to mediate increased extracellular accumulation of adenosine around connective tissue and reduce levels of CRP and interleukin-6.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Biological inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; with infliximab in addition to MTX is a more effective approach for reducing RA disease activity. TNF-&#x003b1; is a proximal cytokine and its blockade has well-established anti-inflammatory actions and effects on lipid metabolism.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> At 54&#x02005;weeks, NO bioavailability was significantly improved in patients who received infliximab, but not with MTX. Infliximab has previously been associated with increased AKT/eNOS phosphorylation and improved endothelial function.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our study provides a novel mechanism by which infliximab can improve endothelial function and contribute to vascular protection by TNF-&#x003b1; inhibition.</p><p>After 1&#x02005;year of our double-blinded randomised trial, SO production was significantly reduced in both arms. MTX is known to inhibit several inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators, associated with increased lipid peroxidation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Oxidative modification of the HDL particle alters its protective phenotype.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Combination therapy with infliximab caused an additional reduction of SO production compared with MTX alone. Previous studies of infliximab in humans suggest that TNF-&#x003b1; inhibition protects against oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, and this may explain its additional efficacy in reducing SO production.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Despite a trend towards an increased benefit of infliximab therapy at 1&#x02005;year, between-treatment comparisons did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Assay of PON-1 provided an additional measure of the antioxidative function of HDL but no significant difference was found in the double-blinded randomised study in either arm at 1&#x02005;year possibly due to the small sample size. However, PON-1 activity was improved in the single-blinded study at 1 and 2&#x02005;years treatment of infliximab. While the effect of MTX on PON-1 activity has not previously been reported, infliximab is known to improve PON-1 activity through the reduction of lipid peroxidation including myeloperoxidase (MPO) pathways.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Site-specific oxidative modification of PON-1 by MPO impairs the enzymes ability to bind with APOA-1 and reduced MPO could explain the increased PON-1 activity in our patients.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>We did not demonstrate any differences in cholesterol efflux with either treatment regimen. This suggests that anti-inflammatory therapies have a more pronounced impact on the vascular properties of HDL than on its efflux capacity. These findings support previous reports from our group and indicate that the endothelial function of HDL may be more sensitive to modification than cholesterol efflux.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, anti-inflammatory treatments including MTX and infliximab have recently been associated with improved cholesterol efflux in patients with RA, and associated with CV disease in both healthy and at-risk populations.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> These differences may be due to methodological issues in the efflux measurement and their interpretation, and require further investigation.</p><p>Our study was not powered to assess the quantitative relationship between HDL function, inflammation and disease activity. This also limited our ability to test for between-treatment differences in the randomised study design, although combination therapy demonstrated a clear benefit in the single-blinded study. However, we have demonstrated that a range of vascular properties of HDL can be improved with anti-inflammatory drug therapy. HDL function did not return to normal levels following treatment, and this is likely to be as a result of the residual levels of inflammation even after 2&#x02005;years treatment (data not shown).</p><p>The ability of anti-inflammatory treatments to modify CV risk remains an intense area of clinical research. Currently, three anti-inflammatory agents are the subject of phase III trials; MTX (CIRT), Darapladib (SOLID-TMI and STABILITY) and canakinumab (CANTOS). Recently, both the STABILITY and SOLID-TMI trials reported that darapladib failed to reduce the risk of CV death and myocardial infarction in primary and secondary prevention.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The CIRT and CANTOS trials are due to report shortly, but our data suggest that monotherapy with MTX alone may not be sufficient. Inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1;, a broad immune effector, is more likely to suppress inflammation and may be a better strategy for CV benefit.</p><p>This study underlines the need to measure and better understand HDL function. It provides evidence for the use of anti-inflammatory treatments, particularly those modulating the TNF-&#x003b1; pathway, to restore the beneficial effects of HDL on the vasculature. Our findings are of relevance to many recent clinical trials evaluating both HDL elevation and anti-inflammatory therapies with the aim of reducing CV risk.</p><boxed-text position="float" id="bx1" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known on this subject?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Clinical trials aimed at raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol have thus far failed to improve cardiovascular (CV) outcome, and this may be explained by a dysfunctional HDL phenotype in disease.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What might this study add?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study underlines the need to measure and better understand HDL function.
