In recent years, nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed as an effective method for wound healing. This study was conducted to determine the effect of nitric oxide on pressure ulcer healing.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this clinical trial, 58 patients with pressure ulcer at hospitals affiliated to Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences were homogenized and later divided randomly into two groups of treatment (nitric oxide cream; n = 29) and control (placebo cream; n = 29). In this research, the data collection tool was the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH). At the outset of the study (before using the cream), the patients' ulcers were examined weekly in terms of size, amount of exudates, and tissue type using the PUSH tool for 3 weeks. By integrating these three factors, wound healing was determined.

The researcher was unaware of the group that the patient belonged to (treatment or control). The research assistant determined which cream (nitric oxide or placebo) was to be used for which patient. The samples were also unaware of the content of used cream. Studied population included all patients with pressure ulcer admitted in hospitals of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences. PUSH tools were used as a data collection tool in this study. Using this tool, three criteria of the size of ulcer, exudates amount, or tissue type in the ulcer were evaluated and scored.</p><p>The ulcer size was specified using a scaled ruler and by measuring the ulcer length and width (cm), so that the greatest ulcer length (top-down) and the greatest ulcer width (side-side) were measured. Its different forms measure from zero to more than 24 cm<sup>2</sup> and it is scored between zero and 10.</p><p>Exudate amount: Amount of exudate (drainage) present on sterile gauze after removal of the dressing and before applying new dressing to the ulcer and is scored as follows: In the absence of exudates, it is scored zero; in the presence of low exudates amount, it is scored 1; in the case of average exudates amount, it is scored 2; and in the case of very high exudates amount, it is scored 3.</p><p>The type of tissue or ulcer color is also scored as follows: Absence of ulcer is given a score of zero, epithelial tissue a score of 1, granulation tissue a score of 2, slough tissue a score of 3, and necrotic tissue has score of 4.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included:subjects over 18 years of age, having pressure ulcer with grade 2 and above, no cancer, not using drugs, such as nitroglycerin, that lead to increased level of nitric oxide, not using immunosuppressives, no smoking, no chronic diseases such as diabetes that affect ulcer healing process, and lack of severe vascular disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or renal failure. Exclusion criteria included death of the patient during the study and unwillingness to continue participating in the study for any reason. Fifty-eight patients with pressure ulcer grade 2 and above were identified and enrolled in the study by purpose-based sampling method and according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After explaining the purpose and methods, patients' written consent was obtained. In patients with loss of consciousness, consent of first-grade family members was obtained. Items such as age, body mass index (BMI), the ulcer site, the ulcer grade, and ward of patients were homogeneous. Then, by random allocation method, the samples were divided into two groups of treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 29) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 29). In practice, the sampling was gradual, which means that samples entered the study gradually. This means that for the first 29 patients who entered the study, 29 draws were done (once per person) which specified the group in which the patient is in (treatment or control). Then, matched Person each sample that were found placed in another group. In the control group, in addition to routine care (change positions, rinsing, and Comfeel dressing), placebo cream was used, i.e. when changing the dressing (before putting new Comfeel dressing), placebo cream (commercial cream base without additional substance) was used in the ulcer site. After 30 min, the ulcer site was rinsed and dried by physiological serum. Then, according to the ward routine, dressing was performed for each patient. In the treatment group, in addition to routine care (change positions, rinsing, and dressing) nitric oxide releasing cream [sodium nitrite 6% + citric acid (monohydrate) 9%] was used in the ulcer site. Each substance was prepared with a separate cream base. First, citric acid was applied on the ulcer surface and spread evenly over the ulcer. Then, equal amount of sodium nitrite was rubbed on the ulcer and gently mixed with citric acid.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] By acidification of nitrite (NO2), nitric oxide is released from dinitrogen trioxide interface (N2O3).[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</p><p>Nitric oxide that is released in this way is spread quickly in the tissue without causing tissue damage.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</p><p>After 30 min, the ulcer site was rinsed and dried. Then, according to the ward routine, dressing was performed for each patient. It should be noted that nitric oxide releasing cream was used for 3 weeks[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>](once per 2 days) and when changing dressing, in order to not disturb patients' routine treatment process. The researcher was unaware of the group that the patient belonged to (treatment or control). The research assistant determined which cream (nitric oxide or placebo) was used for which patient by drawing lots. Also, the samples were unaware of the content of the cream. In case of complete healing, the procedure was stopped early. Dressing change in both groups was performed by the researcher. In addition, every week at a specified time and before dressing change, the researcher visited the studied centers to determine patients' Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) score. Also, using PUSH every week for 3 weeks, the ulcer characteristics were measured. During the 3 weeks, all the information of patients in both the groups was recorded. In case of any complication, the procedure was stopped and the complication was completely treated. The researcher practically completed training of staging and scoring of the ulcer under the supervision of a specialist in ICU and skilled nurses in the field of pressure ulcer. In order to avoid any scientific and practical abuse of work in 10 ulcers, a specialist approved the PUSH score and it was compared with completed check list by researcher. Also, according to the equality (r = 91.5%), both checklists were prepared by the researcher. In the case of discharge, the patients were told to go to the hospital daily for dressing change and/or the treatment process was followed at home by the researcher. In the case of a patient's death before the second week, he was replaced by another patient; but when the patient died after the second week, he was not removed from the sample and the ulcer status comparison was done in the last week and week zero. Regarding patients' long-term follow-up, some changes might have happened in the dietary status, type of activity, and consciousness level that are inconsistent with their initial information. Therefore, regarding this, the dietary status, type of activity, and consciousness level more time experienced by a patient for a longer period of time during 3 weeks was considered for the patient. The ulcer status in different weeks was compared in both groups. Also, weekly changes in the ulcer were examined in both groups separately. Data were analyzed using software SPSS version 16. Descriptive and analytical statistics and <italic>t</italic>-test, chi-square, and repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for data analysis.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Approval for this study was obtained from Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences ethics committee.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, the characteristics of studied units in terms of age, sex, ulcer site, ward, BMI, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), mobility, nutrition method, and the ulcer stage are given.

In the present study, it was found that decrease in ulcer size (size) during 3 weeks was higher in nitric oxide cream group compared to the control group. In Phillips <italic>et al.</italic>'s study, in the first 6 weeks, the ulcer size reduced quickly and significantly in the group receiving nitric oxide releasing cream. Of course, the greatest change in the ulcer size happened in the first 3 weeks.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Also, in Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 's case study, foot ulcer Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, in a case study, non-healing foot ulcers were exposed to nitric oxide; on day 14, its size was significantly decreased.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Farsaei <italic>et al.</italic> stated that sildenafil (intensifying NO activity) decreases the bed ulcer level significantly in patients hospitalized in ICU, 14 days after the intervention.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Animal studies have also confirmed this. In Jones <italic>et al.</italic> 's study, it was found that in the group receiving nitric oxide releasing patch, the rate of ulcer closure was more.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Weller and Finnen stated that there was a significant increase in diabetic ulcer closure percentage in the group of mice receiving nitric oxide cream, after 2 weeks.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Also, decrease in the amount of ulcer exudates during 3 weeks was higher in the nitric oxide cream group compared to the control group. In other words, the amount of ulcer exudates from baseline to the end of the study showed a significant change in the nitric oxide cream group. In Miller <italic>et al.</italic>'s case study, foot ulcer exposed to nitric oxide gas was not healed; after 3 days of treatment, its exudates amount decreased and the ulcer's bad smell also disappeared.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Also, in the studies conducted by Ghaffari <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] Englander and Friedman,[<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] Hetrik[<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] kutner[<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and Martinez <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] the ability of NO as an antimicrobial substance to treat infections in chronic ulcers and later in healing them has been approved.[<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, it was found that the ulcer color (the tissue type) ulcer color mean is ulcer tissue type more during 3 weeks in the nitric oxide cream group compared to the control group. Zhu <italic>et al.</italic> 's study also found that nitric oxide, through processes such as angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, conducting the inflammatory mediators to the injury site, and regeneration of epithelium, heals burn ulcer in mice.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In Amadeu <italic>et al.</italic> 's study, it was found that the level of re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation in the group receiving hydrogel containing S-nitrosoglutathione and glutathione (releasing NO) was much higher.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Also, Georgii <italic>et al.</italic> stated that S nitrous and glutathione (releasing NO) cause re-epithelialization, increasing the collagen fiber density and decreasing the level of inflammatory cells and angiogenesis in ischemic ulcers in mice.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>In this study, it was found that the ulcer healing process during 3 weeks in nitric oxide cream group was significantly higher than in the control group. Phillips <italic>et al.</italic> concluded that nitric oxide releasing cream accelerates the ulcer healing process.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, in a case study, stated that 90% of foot ulcer had not been healed; 6 weeks after treatment, it healed with nitric oxide gas.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Farsaei <italic>et al.</italic> stated that sildenafil (intensifying NO activity) causes healing of bed ulcer in ICU patients.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Studies conducted on animals confirm this. Weller stated that nitric oxide releasing cream accelerates diabetic ulcer healing process in mice.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In Han study, it was found that nanoparticles releasing NO have the ability to set and accelerate the ulcer healing process.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Also, Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, in their study, stated that the patch releasing NO accelerates ulcer healing in rabbits.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Studies conducted by Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Masters on burns, diabetic and ischemic ulcers in animals show similar results (ulcer healing).[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In Farsaei <italic>et al.</italic> 's study, the follow-up period was 2 years, but in the present study, treatment was continued for 3 weeks with nitric oxide cream. Perhaps, if a longer time had been spent for the therapeutic method, better results would have been obtained. The present study and Farsaei <italic>et al.</italic>'s study were double-blind clinical trials, while Phillips <italic>et al.</italic> 's study was not double blind. Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 's study was also a case report and was done only on an ulcer. In our study, three factors of ulcer size, exudates amount, and color (the tissue type) were examined, and by integrating these three factors, ulcer healing (the ulcer total score) was determined. While in Farsaei <italic>et al.</italic> 's study, the pressure ulcer's surface, grade, and healing were examined and in Phillips <italic>et al.</italic>'s study, only the ulcer size and the amount of its healing were examined. In Farsaei <italic>et al.</italic>'s study, sildenafil cream (intensifying NO activity) was compared with the ward routine method separately. While in the present study, due to respecting ethical issues and not depriving patients of the ward routine treatment (dressing), we had to use the dressing along with nitric oxide cream (the treatment group) and placebo cream (the control group). Perhaps, if nitric oxide cream and the ward routine method had been compared separately and independently, better results would have been obtained.</p><p>However, in the size, the ulcer exudates amount, and color (the tissue type), no significant difference was observed between the two groups. But in the group receiving nitric oxide cream, the slope of PUSH score decrease in relation to the three factors was steeper during the studied weeks. This indicates that nitric oxide cream (size) decreased the ulcer exudates amount more than the control group and the ulcer color (the tissue type) also further heals. The slope of PUSH score decrease related to the ulcer total score (healing) in nitric oxide cream group was clearly steeper and the healing status was better, and a significant difference was observed between the two groups in the mean of the total ulcer score (healing). This indicates that nitric oxide cream accelerates the pressure ulcer healing process. The researcher stated that possibly, the slope of PUSH score decrease is steeper in nitric oxide group, which indicates that further healing in the group may be due to the effect of NO on re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, synthesis of fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, and growth factors. Also, NO increases blood flow in the ulcer, which reinforces the healing process. The limitation of the present study was that the researcher had to use the dressing along with nitric oxide cream (treatment group) and placebo cream (control group) in order to not deprive the patients from the ward routine treatment (Comfeel dressing).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>It can be concluded that nitric oxide cream can be used as a complementary method and facilitator of other therapeutic methods of pressure ulcer. It is recommended to compare nitric oxide cream and routine method in future studies separately and independently. May be by conducting further research in this field in the future, the therapeutic method may be considered as an independent and separate method. So, we can use this therapeutic method for better and faster healing of pressure ulcer in hospitals, nursing homes, and home. We can prevent the development of pressure ulcer and the complications and deaths caused by it, and also, the nurses' role as one of the most effective treatment team members in healing and caring pressure ulcer can be highlighted. Also, regarding the convenience of preparation and cost-effectiveness of nitric oxide releasing cream compared to current therapeutic methods, wastage of time, cost, and resources can be prevented and level of patients' health and finally community health can be further promoted.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This article was derived from the Master's thesis of Vahid Saidkhani with project number U-92220, Ahvaz University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.
