A total of 100 adult patients of either sex between the age group of 20 and 50 years, having physical status of Grade-I and Grade-II according to American Society of Anesthesiologists, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were enrolled in the study. Patients with anticipated difficult intubation, obesity, hypertension and bronchial asthma were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>It was a prospective, randomized and double-blind study. Randomization was performed by keeping 100 coded slips in the box and observer as well as the person giving the drug was blinded.</p><p>All patients were examined pre-operatively and details regarding clinical history, general physical examination were recorded and all routine investigations were carried out. They were kept fasting for 6 h prior to surgery and tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg on the night before surgery was given as pre-medication. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups of 50 each. Group A (<italic>n</italic> = 50) patients received oral clonidine 200 &#x003bc;g and Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 50) patients received oral gabapentin 900 mg, 90 min prior to induction of anesthesia with a sip of water. In the operating room, standard monitoring consisting of electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry SPO<sub>2</sub> and non-invasive arterial blood pressure was established. After the placement of intravenous line injection thiopentone sodium 5 mg/kg was used for induction followed by injection succinylcholine 2 mg/kg for intubation. All patients were manually ventilated using oxygen 33%, nitrous oxide 67% and halothane 0.5% for 90 s. Intubation was performed with size 7 mm internal diameter (ID) endotracheal tube (ETT) in female and 8 mm ID ETT in male patients. Laryngoscopy and intubation was performed by the trained observer in all cases for consistency of observations.</p><p>In the pre-anesthetic room, the Sedation Score,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Anxiety Score[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was noted under:</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Anxiety score</title><p>0 = Point &#x02013; patient quiet and comfortable</p><p>1 = Point &#x02013; patient uneasy</p><p>2 = Point &#x02013; patient worried or anxious</p><p>3 = Point &#x02013; patient very worried or very upset</p><p>4 = Point &#x02013; patient frightened or terrified.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sedation score</title><p>1 = Point &#x02013; wide awake</p><p>2 = Point &#x02013; sleeping comfortably but responding to verbal commands</p><p>3 = Point &#x02013; deep sleep but arousable</p><p>4= Point &#x02013; deep sleep but not arousable.</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters were noted just before the drug (basal-B<sub>1</sub>) and after the administration of drug on the operation Table (B<sub>2</sub>).

Similarly in Group B, there were minor complaints of headache, drowsiness and dizziness [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Comparison of side-effects in two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-8-172-g008"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The sympathoadrenal activation associated with laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation causes the rise in arterial blood pressure, tachycardia and dysrhythmias.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The achievement of a smooth induction with minimal reflex hemodynamic response during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation remains an important anesthetic goal. Several strategies have been evolved to blunt this undesirable hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, but each method has its own advantages and disadvantage.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine and gabapentin are drugs under intense investigation as an adjunct to anesthesia in various forms.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Clonidine originally introduced as antihypertensive drug, has analgesic, sedative and anxiolytic properties. It improves the quality of induction, maintenance and recovery from anesthesia. By its central sympatholytic action, it tends to attenuate the hemodynamic response to any surgical nociceptive stimulus and improve overall perianesthetic cardiovascular stability.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Prevention of tachycardia in response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation and the slowing of the HR induced by clonidine share a complex underlying mechanism. It consists of different components, centrally the activation of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors causes both a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone and an increase of vagally induced reflex bradycardia, peripherally stimulation of presynaptic alpha adrenoceptors leads to diminished release of nor epinephrine from the nerve endings toward the vasculature and to a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone toward the heart.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Similarly, gabapentin most recently has been evaluated as analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic or both perioperatively.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Role of gabapentin in obtunding hemodynamic response has been highlighted by Fassoulaki <italic>et al</italic>. and Memi&#x0015f; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] We evaluated and compared oral clonidine and gabapentin in abolishing the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.</p><p>In our study, both groups were comparable regarding age, weight and sex distribution. Our reason for studying the patients up to 50 years of age was that elderly patients more often are on drugs such as antidepressants, hypnotics and anti-hypertensives and also exhibit increased sensitivity to drugs.</p><p>Premedication with opioids like morphine and large induction dose of thiopentone sodium, propofol, which can largely increase the depth of anesthesia can indirectly influence this hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In our study, no additional premedication was given and fixed dose of thiopentone 5 mg/kg was used for induction in both groups to avoid this bias. It is known that response to laryngoscopy is dependent on the duration of laryngoscopy, peaking at 45 s.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this study, the mean duration of laryngoscopy and intubation did not exceed 11.35 s and was comparable in both groups.</p><p>Pre-operative anxiolysis and sedation are the main objective of premedication and both involve a number of possible mechanisms of action implicating central gamma amino butyric acids.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The sedation effect of clonidine may be due to decreased tonic activity of locus coeruleus, which modulates the stimuli arriving in the central nervous system and adrenergic receptor.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Raval and Mehta in their study comparing oral clonidine (200 &#x003bc;g) with diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) and a placebo group observed that clonidine produces significant sedation and analgesia, but when compared in-between group diazepam faired better.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The anxiolytic effect of gabapentin in patients with a variety of psychiatric disorder has been demonstrated in several clinical trials. Significantly lower pre-operative visual analog scale anxiety score (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) has been seen with gabapentin as compared with placebo in patients undergoing knee surgery.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Rorarius <italic>et al</italic>. found that 1200 mg gabapentin was less effective in inhibiting pre-operative anxiety as compared with oxazepam (15 mg), which was used as active placebo in the control group.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>We observed that both clonidine and gabapentin showed anxiolysis and sedation in a significant proportion of subjects. The anxiolytic and sedative effect was significantly more with clonidine than gabapentin. Our results are similar to the study of Faheim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] who used 600 mg of gabapentin and 300 &#x003bc;g clonidine orally.</p><p>In the present study, baseline hemodynamic parameters HR and MAP were comparable in both groups. Raval and Mehta[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] stated that clonidine (200 &#x003bc;g) results in persistent fall in MAP, but decreases HR only before and after induction. After intubation, HR increased marginally which is less marked and persisted for a very short period. The effect of clonidine (200 &#x003bc;g) on MAP and HR in our study was similar to the observations of Raval and Mehta gabapentin was used as premedicant by Memi&#x0015f; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and they observed complete attenuation of MAP and HR with 800 mg gabapentin when given 1 h prior to surgery. While Fassoulaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] observed that even higher doses of gabapentin, i.e., 1600 mg had no effect on the MAP and HR at 0-24 h after operation. In our study, we observed that 900 mg gabapentin ameliorates MAP, but not HR response. Faheim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Marashi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] after comparative evaluation of the two drugs reached an inference that both gabapentin and clonidine are equally effective in attenuating blood pressure response to laryngoscopy and intubation and further stated that in fact gabapentin was more superior. Our results are in contrast to the studies of Faheim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Marashi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Both clonidine and gabapentin have certain adverse effects inherent to their structure. Most common side-effects with clonidine are dry mouth and sedation documented in almost 50% of patients and less common are sexual dysfunction, hypotension and marked bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The most frequent side-effects reported with gabapentin are somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, uncontrollable back, fatigue, unsteadiness, nystagmus, headache, tremors, diplopia and nausea,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but depression, irritability and mood changes can also be there.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It is also pertinent to mention here that these side-effects are transient and usually abolish on their own.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>High incidence of dryness of mouth (68%) was reported with clonidine in our study, which is associated with the effect of drug on pre-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors in the brainstem as well as on parasympathetic nerves, which supplies the salivary gands.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Hypotension (10%) and bradycardia (2%) were the other associated side-effects observed with the use of clonidine. We also observed few cases of drowsiness (12%), headache (4%) and dizziness (4%) with gabapentin in our study, which clinically did not warrant any treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that oral clonidine 200 &#x003bc;g when given 90 min before anesthesia, provides good attenuation of hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation as compared with oral gabapentin (900 mg), which also fairly obtunded the hypertensive response, but not the tachycardiac response.
