These inflammatory mediators induce similar consequences as those seen in septic shock. Indeed, after an initial hypovolemic phase, patients with extensive burn usually present a shock with increased cardiac output and reduced systemic vascular resistances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In septic shock, the use of low-dose corticosteroids has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality and improve shock reversal. While debate still exists regarding the impact of this treatment on septic shock-induced mortality, low-dose corticosteroids have been shown to improve systemic hemodynamics and reduce the time on vasopressor treatment in septic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, stress-dose hydrocortisone was suggested as a means of improving outcome in the specific subpopulation of septic patients presenting with critical-illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Apart from some rare case reports, little is known about the influence of hydrocortisone administration in vasopressor-dependent severely burned patients with shock. Therefore, as described in septic shock, we tested the hypothesis that low-dose hydrocortisone could reduce shock duration after severe thermal injury.</p><p>Thus we designed a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the effect of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in reducing shock duration after severe burn injury. In addition, a subgroup analysis was performed in patients presenting with or without relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed on two parallel groups in the burn intensive care unit (ICU) of the university H&#x000f4;pital E.

Indeed, only two placebo patients (13%) were weaned of norepinephrine in the placebo group against eight patients in the low-dose hydrocortisone treated group (67%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

A descriptive analysis of the treatment effect was performed in each subgroup (Table S2 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: supplemental digital content 2). Due to the very low number of patients in the responder group, we cannot conclude about norepinephrine dosage and duration between these two groups of patients.

Indeed, widespread skin destruction induces a large necrotic mass that leads to an intense inflammatory reaction. This activates keratinocytes, endothelial cells and recruits neutrophils. Certain mediators (endothelin, histamine, bradykinins, serotonin and so on) are released in large quantities and act both at the site of burn and at distance. This results in hypovolemia associated with hemoconcentration, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia and myocardial malfunction. This hypovolemia can rapidly become irreversible if fluids are not administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Importantly, it has been shown that shock severity and duration are important surrogate markers of mortality after severe burn injury.</p><p>Current treatment of burn shock comprises both vasopressor agents and volume therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, any intervention strategy that is capable of reducing dose rates of vasoconstrictors as well as reducing volume substitution will likely improve prognosis and outcome of severe burn patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the need for vasopressor support prevents the transfer out of the critical care setting. This has implications both for the patients (reduced risk of iatrogenic adverse events) and for the health-care system (decreased costs and better allocation of scarce resources). Thus earlier reversal of shock is a clinically relevant end point to consider and may be a worthwhile goal after severe burn injury.</p><p>Low-dose hydrocortisone therapy may represent one such treatment. Indeed, this treatment has been shown to improve rapidly (1 hour after treatment administration) vascular responsiveness to catecholamines in septic shock patients and healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In septic shock patients, seminal studies by Annane <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] showed that low-dose hydrocortisone therapy reduced mortality and duration of vasopressor administration in these patients. Although the effect of low-dose corticosteroid therapy on septic shock mortality has been challenged within recent years, the effect of this treatment on shock reversal (duration of vasopressor treatment or cumulative dosages) has been confirmed by several meta-analyses. Indeed, in a meta-analysis published in 2012 for the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, Sherwin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported that, of the seven clinical trials they identified testing low-dose corticosteroids in septic shock patients, all seven trials reported shock reversal or the withdrawal of vasopressors. These seven trials included 1,005 patients with 505 and 500 patients in the intervention and control arms respectively. Pooled results revealed that the relative risk of shock reversal was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.28). Similarly, in a meta-analysis of RCTs from 1997 to 2008, Minneci <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] reported that low-dose steroids demonstrated a consistent improvement in shock reversal across the trials reporting this outcome. Finally, Sligl <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] identified six studies from 1998 to 2008 reporting appropriate data on this aspect. They observed a statistically significant difference in the incidence of shock reversal at seven days between the group that received corticosteroids and the control group. Subgroup analysis of four studies examining shock reversal in regard to adrenal responsiveness showed statistical significant effects in both responders and nonresponders. This demonstrates that, after septic shock, low-dose corticosteroids do reverse shock faster, therefore freeing valuable resources in the ICU.</p><p>Therefore, we designed this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to test the hypothesis that low-dose corticosteroid therapy may reduce shock duration after severe thermal injury. Only few studies and case reports investigated the influence of low-dose hydrocortisone administration in vasopressor-dependent burn patients. In a case report published in 2002, N&#x000e1;cul <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported that a three-day steroid treatment in a 39-year-old severely burned patient (80% TBSA) with hemodynamic instability and low response to intravenous fluid or vasopressors for 20 days in the ICU, led to blood pressure normalization without the administration of any vasopressor. James <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] demonstrated the beneficial role of hydrocortisone in a 75% burned patient with long-standing Addison disease. Similarly, in a prospective study including 14 consecutive severely burned patients with septic shock, Winter <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] observed that low-dose hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a significant reduction in norepinephrine dosages in surviving patients in association with a significant reduction in median fluid requirement. Finally, in a retrospective study including 19 burn patients with septic shock, Fuchs <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] showed a beneficial effect on both morbidity and mortality of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy compared with control patients. In this study, the median total time application of vasopressors was significantly reduced in the treated group of patients. Therefore, these preliminary data showed overall a beneficial effect of low-dose corticosteroid therapy on burn shock.</p><p>In line, our study is the first prospective randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to show that low-dose hydrocortisone significantly reduces vasopressor administration at 72 hours in severely burned patients. Indeed, we observed that median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was shorter in the hydrocortisone-treated group (57 hours) versus the placebo-treated group (120 hours) and that the norepinephrine treatment duration was significantly lower in the corticosteroid-treated groups than the placebo group (Mann-Whitney test: <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.036). These results are in accordance with previous studies in septic shock patients. For example, a single intravenous administration of 50 mg of hydrocortisone was shown to strongly improve norepinephrine and phenylepinephrine mean arterial pressure dose-response relationships in patients with septic shock, especially in those with RAI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear but an improved vasopressor responsiveness of peripheral vessels may play an important role. Indeed, hydrocortisone raises blood volume, increases vascular tone and enhances endothelial reactivity to vasopressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similarly, cortisol plays an important role in maintaining of vascular tone and myocardial contractility and has an important permissive effect on the action of catecholamine on vascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, at stress doses, corticosteroids have been shown to increase neutrophil activity, increase the homing of dendritic cells with preservation of monocyte and interleukin 12 (IL-12) functions, and attenuate the overwhelming inflammatory response that may lead to shock after severe burn injury.</p><p>An additional interesting result of our RCT is to show that low-dose corticosteroids may have such an effect in both responders and nonresponders to the corticotropin test. Indeed, we observed that norepinephrine was withdrawn earlier in the hydrocortisone-treated group (median norepinephrine duration&#x02009;=&#x02009;60 hours) than in the placebo group (117 hours) of patients with relative corticosteroid insufficiency (Figure S1 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), but it was also the case in responder patients (median norepinephrine duration&#x02009;=&#x02009;42 hours in the treated patients, vs 132 hours in the placebo group, Table S2 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Although the low number of patients implies this result to be confirmed, our data overall suggest that the corticotropin test may not be necessary to guide low-dose hydrocortisone replacement therapy in burn patients with severe shock.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/min vasopressor inclusion criteria led to a slow accrual in the study. Therefore, we did not reach the sample size calculated before the start of the clinical trial. This consequently decreased the statistical power of our study and we were unable to reach statistical significance in some of our analyses (RAI subgroup analysis). Second, we did not perform an intention-to-treat analysis because the inclusion of early deaths would have overestimated the difference in vasopressor treatment duration between the groups. In addition statistical analyses that may consider early deaths could not be performed because of the low number of patients included in the RCT. Third, the number of deaths is higher in the hydrocortisone group as compared with placebo-treated patients. This has to be put into perspective with studies in septic shock that showed an increased mortality in low-dose hydrocortisone-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, it is to note that inhalation injuries were more frequent in the treated versus the placebo group and that this may have participated in this higher mortality. Fourth, etomidate treatment was significantly different between groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, as etomidate injections have been shown to block cortisol synthesis and as this treatment was more frequent in the placebo group than in the hydrocortisone-treated group, this bias has to be taken into account in the interpretation of the report. In addition, this potential bias is supported by the observation of Vinclair <italic>et al</italic>. that one single etomidate injection upon initial intubation had a negative effect on cortisol synthesis for 48 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, whether this effect may occur in the particular context of burn patients remains to be investigated. Therefore, considering these limitations, we want to emphasize that results presented in this study are only preliminary and need to be confirmed through an intention-to-treat, multicentric RCT including a larger cohort of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT we show for the first time that the administration of low-dose hydrocortisone in burn patients with severe shock reduces vasopressor administration.
