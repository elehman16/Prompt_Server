Many equations based on plasma markers are in use for estimating GFR in different patient groups, but there is still a need for a specific and accurate equation for use in kidney transplant recipients.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Several equations are based on the endogenous substance creatinine.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> It is well known that the plasma level of creatinine is affected by muscle mass<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and ingestion of protein or creatine,<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> in addition to the GFR. Plasma creatinine is also somewhat limited as a marker for GFR since it is subjected to a certain degree of tubular secretion.<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Trimethoprim is known to inhibit tubular creatinine secretion leading to rapid and reversible increase in serum creatinine and falsely underestimation of GFR, at least in doses above 160 mg.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The endogenous protein cystatin C has also been used as a marker for renal function with the advantage that it is less dependent on muscular mass.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Thus, cystatin C can be used as an alternative, or incorporated as an auxiliary marker, for estimating GFR in patients with low muscle mass (children, elderly, patients with anorexia, amputations, or paresis) or high muscle mass (bodybuilders). Cystatin C is also less influenced by renal tubular secretion and may be a good alternative to creatinine-based equations in situations where tubular excretion of creatinine is affected (eg, drugs blocking the tubular creatinine transporter such as trimethoprim).<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, different studies have reported that cystatin C could be influenced by factors independent of GFR, such as the level of corticosteroids, thyroid hormones,<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> sex, diabetes, and inflammation.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> On the other hand, one study claims that the inflammatory status of a patient does not influence cystatin C levels.<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> If a more accurate determination of GFR is needed, an exogene marker should be used, such as clearance of the nonradioactive substances, like the contrast agent iohexol or inulin or radiolabeled agents, like <sup>51</sup>Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<sup>51</sup>CrEDTA), <sup>99m</sup>Tc-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (<sup>99m</sup>TcDTPA) or <sup>125</sup>I-iothalamate, but these techniques are invasive, time consuming and costly.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Several studies have evaluated the performance of different well-known GFR estimating equations (eGFR-equations), both based on creatinine and cystatin C or their combination, in kidney transplant recipients.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The most commonly used equations in kidney transplant recipients are the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)<sub>creatinine</sub> and Cockcroft-Gault equations.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The MDRD equation was derived from 1628 patients with chronic kidney disease. It is well known that the formula underestimates GFR in patients with high GFR values.<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The CKD-EPI <sub>creatinine</sub> equation was derived from participants with higher GFR, a mean GFR of 68 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Only a minor fraction (4%) of the cohort was kidney transplant recipients. The Cockcroft-Gault formula was generated from 236 patients, mainly males, but the method for measurement of creatinine was &#x0201c;Jaffe&#x0201d; which is subject to errors from interfering compounds. The Nankivell formula is the only equation derived from kidney transplant recipients, but only in 146 recipients and with repeated measurements. This equation does not include Cystatin C and is not widely used in follow-up of renal transplant recipients around the world.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>The purpose of our study was therefore to generate a new equation for use in adult kidney recipients and to evaluate the performance of different eGFR-equations, based on creatinine, cystatin C and a combination of both, with the measured GFR (mGFR) by <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA clearance. We also performed external evaluation in a different cohort of kidney recipients, not using trimethoprim, from a more recent period with iohexol-based GFR measurements as the standard.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>A total of 594 adult kidney recipients were included in the study between 2005 and 2009 at Oslo University Hospital. The examinations were done 10 weeks after transplantation in a stable clinical situation. At that time the immunosuppression consisted of either cyclosporine A or tacrolimus in combination with mycophenolate and steroids. Cyclosporine was C2 monitored with a therapeutic window of 1000 to 1200 &#x003bc;g/L and tacrolimus was C0 monitored with a therapeutic window of 5 to 10 &#x003bc;g/L. In combination with cyclosporine, 1.0 g mycophenolate mofetil was given twice daily and in combination with tacrolimus, the dose was 0.75 g twice daily. All patients received prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (80 mg trimethoprim per day) for a total of 6 months from the first day after transplantation. The study population was randomly divided into 2 groups; a reference group of 297 patients to generate a new equation, and a test group of 297 patients entirely used to compare the different estimating equations including evaluation of our new equation. Median prednisolone dose was 10 mg, both in the reference group and the test group. Cyclosporine was given to 57% of the patients, both in the reference group and the test group. Additionally, an external evaluation group consisting of 133 kidney recipients transplanted between 2014 and 2016 at Oslo University Hospital was included. The examinations in this cohort were performed 8 weeks and 1 year posttransplant. Measured GFR was determined by iohexol clearance in these patients and they received concomitant trimethoprim at the 8-week investigation, but not at the 1-year investigation. Immunosuppression consisted of steroids (median daily dose, 10 mg at 8 weeks and 5 mg at 1 year), tacrolimus (median concentration, 6.0 &#x003bc;g/L at 8 weeks and 6.2 &#x003bc;g/L at 1 year) and a median dose of 750 mg mycophenolate mofetil at both investigations.</p><p>Approval of the study was obtained from the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics, and the study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 2000 and Declaration of Istanbul 2008. All patients included in the analysis gave their written informed consent before their inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory Assessment</title><p>Serum creatinine concentration was measured by an enzymatic calorimetric method (reagents from Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreutz, Switzerland) IDMS traceable. The coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.7% or less. Serum cystatin C was measured by a turbidimetric immunoassay, traceable to the ERM-DA471/IFCC reference material (reagents from Gentian, Moss, Norway, CV &#x02264; 5.0%). Both markers were analyzed on Modular P8000 (Roche Diagnostics).</p><p>Blood samples for determination of clinical chemistry were drawn in the morning, after fasting (drugs and food) over night. Afterward, GFR was measured by <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA clearance in the first cohort. Patients were administered 1.0 mL <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA (100 &#x003bc;Ci/mL) intravenously (Amersham Int, Kjeller, Norway). Blood samples for determination of <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA plasma concentrations were drawn in 7-mL EDTA vacutainers before (0 hour) and then 2, 3, and 4 hours after administration of <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA. In patients with an estimated GFR (Cockcroft &#x00026; Gault-equation, commonly used at our hospital in that period) less than 30 mL/min, an extra sample was also drawn 6 hours after <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA administration. GFR was calculated according to the Br&#x000f6;chner Mortensen method.<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In the iohexol cohort mGFR was determined by iohexol clearance (Omnipaque 300 mg iodine/mL; GE Healthcare) with blood sampling 2 and 5 hours after the iohexol injection. When eGFR with MDRD equation or CKD-EPI<sub>creatinine</sub> equation was below 40 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the last blood sample was obtained 8 to 24 hours after iohexol administration. Serum samples were analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography system and calculated according to the Br&#x000f6;chner Mortensen method as previously described.<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The coefficient of variation of our serum method is less than 6%.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of a new Combined GFR-Estimating Equation</title><p>The statistical analyses were performed by the use of Microsoft Excel (version 2002 SP3), R version 3.3.2 and SPSS Statistics 18.

One study did not find any advantage of using cystatin C over creatinine; however, the analytic method they used was an ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which is not commonly recommended when generating different equations.<sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In a review, the performance of different cystatin C-based equations in kidney transplant recipients were evaluated, and they found that cystatin C-based equations showed improvements in accuracy compared with the MDRD equation.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Another study examined 670 kidney transplant recipients and found that both the CKD-EPI<sub>cyst C</sub> (mean bias, &#x02212;2.82; P30 81%) and the combined CKD-EPI<sub>creatinine+ cys C</sub> (mean bias, &#x02212;0.54; P30 86%) formula performed better than the CKD-EPI<sub>creatinine</sub> equation alone.<sup><xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p><p>The CKD-EPI<sub>creatinine+cys C</sub> formula was superior to the CKD-EPI<sub>creatinine</sub> equation in our cohort, but the CKD-EPI<sub>cyst C</sub> equation was not.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. All the patients were included consecutively in a single transplant center, representing the entire Norwegian population because this is the only hospital in Norway performing kidney transplantations. The creatinine and cystatin C measurements were calibrated against a standardized reference method, and measured GFR was performed with <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA clearance and iohexol; methods that are in good agreement with the gold standard inulin clearance.<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>The limitations of the study are that data is from the era when most of our patients used cyclosporine based immunosuppression while tacrolimus is primarily used at present. Both these drugs acutely affect renal hemodynamics and may hence influence the absolute GFR.<sup><xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> To our knowledge, there are however no clinically relevant differences between these drugs when it comes to induce renal vasoconstrictive effects.<sup><xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> However, in the external evaluation group of more recently transplanted kidney recipients, all patients received tacrolimus and the new formula also performed well in this cohort. We did not measure thyroid hormone status. A thyroid dysfunction can have an effect on cystatin C levels independently of GFR because of its modifying effect of cellular turnover and metabolism. This could ultimately result in increased cystatin C levels in hyperthyroidism and decreased levels in hypothyroidism. Thyroid dysfunction could also affect the glomerulus and kidney perfusion, thus affecting the creatinine levels, but not independently of GFR. Creatinine levels can drop in patients with hyperthyroidism due to the increased renal blood flow and GFR, and the opposite in patients with hypothyroidism.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, clinically, the patients were considered euthyroid. The patients in the <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA cohort received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; an antibiotic that could have a mild inhibitory effect on the tubular secretion of creatinine. This is standard prophylaxis in these patients during the first 6 months posttransplant, but the dosage was low; 80 mg trimethoprim. The exact effect of trimethoprim at 80 mg on serum creatinine concentration is not known, whereas the dose 160 mg increases creatinine by approximately 15%.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Therefore, in the iohexol cohort we evaluated the formulas against mGFR measured 1 year posttransplant, when trimethoprim had been discontinued in all patients. Trimethoprim did not influence the performance of the equations significantly in this cohort. Corticosteroids in small doses (median dose, 5-10 mg/day) were also administrated. Prednisolone may elevate cystatin C values,<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> but the impact in the current cohort is probably of minimal effect due to the low doses used. Interpretation of the compartment model regarding the <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA and iohexol methods may be challenged if the patient has edema and also in some patients with impaired graft function with very low GFR if samples are not taken later than 6 hours after <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA or iohexol administration.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, there were only few patients with very low GFR and in these cases extended sampling was applied. We do not have detailed information about the race, but the majority of the patients were white. The equations compared in this study are hence without correction factors for Black patients. Finally, the populations used to generate most of the other equations differed from our population. It is just the Nankivell equation that is generated from kidney transplant recipients. The new equation was generated from a cohort of patients in the same institution and laboratory as the <sup>51</sup>CrEDTA and iohexol cohort, but the equations were tested both at the timepoint 8 to 10 weeks and 1 year posttransplant, with different mGFR methods and somewhat different immunosuppressive regimens.</p><p>In conclusion, the new equation including both creatinine and cystatin C demonstrated the best accuracy of all compared equations, with a low bias as well as very good precision, in the renal function level relevant for renal transplant recipients (below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The MDRD equation was the most accurate of the creatinine-equations. Trimethoprim in doses used for prophylaxis in transplant recipients did not influence the performance of the equations. Further external validation of the new equation needs to be performed in other kidney transplanted populations outside Norway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to express their gratitude to the bioengineers Kirsten Lund, Els Breistein and May Ellen Lauritsen at the laboratory for renal physiology; Oslo University Hospital, for their excellent work on this project.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Published online 8 November 2017.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no funding or conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p>All authors made substantial contributions to the design and conception.
