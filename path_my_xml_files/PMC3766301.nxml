Therefore, we examined the protective effect of MRN-100 against &#x003b3;-radiation-induced lethality and damage to hematopoietic tissues in fish. A total of 216 Nile tilapia fish (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>) were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 served as a control that was administered no radiation and no MRN-100 treatment. Group 2 was exposed only to &#x003b3;-radiation (15 Gy). Groups 3 and 4 were pre-treated with MRN-100 at doses of either 1 ml/l or 3 ml/l in water for 1 week, and subsequently exposed to radiation while continuing to receive MRN-100 for 27 days. The survival rate was measured, and biochemical and histopathological analyses of hematopoietic tissues were performed for the different treatment groups at 1 and 4 weeks post-radiation. Exposure to radiation reduced the survival rate to 27.7%, while treatment with MRN-100 maintained the survival rate at 87.2%. In addition, fish exposed to &#x003b3;-radiation for 1 week showed a significant decrease in the total number of white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) series. However, treatment with MRN-100 protected the total WBC count and the RBCs series when compared with irradiated fish. Furthermore, significant histological lesions were observed in the hepatopancreas, spleen and gills of irradiated fish. However, treatment with MRN-100 protected the histopathology of various organs. We conclude that MRN-100 is a radioprotective agent in fish and may be useful as an adjuvant treatment to counteract the adverse side effects associated with radiation exposure.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hydroferrate fluid</kwd><kwd>radiation</kwd><kwd>survival</kwd><kwd><italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It is well known that ionizing radiation can cause a series of deleterious side-effects, including oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules and the demise of the hematopoietic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C3">3</xref>]. Therefore, several investigators have directed their research towards finding effective radioprotective treatments that can successfully prevent or minimize the damaging effects of free radicals caused by ionizing radiation. Several agents have been shown to have some preventative properties; these include the synthetic agents amifostine and ethiofos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C4">4</xref>], as well as several dietary supplements. Although these products help alleviate the side effects of radiation, the synthetic compounds themselves have been shown to cause some toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C4">4</xref>]. The radioprotective role of dietary agents including arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C5">5</xref>], genistein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C6">6</xref>], bael leaf (<italic>Aegle marmelos</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C7">7</xref>], <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C8">8</xref>], and eckol from marine alga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C9">9</xref>] were also investigated. Additionally, earlier studies indicated that antioxidants such as vitamin C and E can serve as effective radioprotectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C12">12</xref>]. MRN-100, an iron-based compound derived from bivalent and trivalent ferrates (hydroferrate fluid), demonstrated its effectiveness as an antioxidant by preventing the formation of free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>]. Therefore, it is of special interest to examine its ability to act as a radioprotector against &#x003b3;-radiation in the fish, <italic>Oreochromis niloticus.</italic></p><p>Our work, and that of others, has shown that fish are excellent models for studying radiation effects on life span and hematopoietic tissues. Different fish species were used, including <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C16">16</xref>], zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C17">17</xref>], Atlantic salmon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C18">18</xref>], and <italic>Tilapia mossambica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C19">19</xref>]. Our recent study demonstrated that daily supplementation of aged rats with MRN-100 resulted in recovery of age-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, MRN-100 provides a protective effect against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C20">20</xref>]. Since the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation on living cells are often mediated by increased production of ROS, this study was undertaken to examine the radioprotective effects of MRN-100 against &#x003b3;-radiation-induced lethality and damage to hematopoietic tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MRN-100</title><p>MRN-100 was prepared in distilled water (DW) with the concentration of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions at about 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> mol/l. MRN-100 is obtained from phytosin, a plant extract that contains iron and neutral lipid compounds and can be found in rice, wheat, or radish seeds. To start, 1 unit of phytosin is dispersed in 100 ml DW, and ferric chloride as FeCl<sub>3</sub>&#x02022;6H<sub>2</sub>O is added. The lipid compounds are removed through a liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction using a separation funnel. The remaining liquid is filtered with No. 5 filter paper and the filtrate is evaporated and condensed in a water bath. The iron compound obtained is subjected to fractional determination with respect to bivalent ferrate and trivalent ferrate in order to generate MRN-100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C21">21</xref>]. Briefly, the sample's Fe (II) quantity is determined using the o-phenanthrolin method. Hydroxylamine-HCl 10% solution is added to the sample liquid to reduce Fe (III) to Fe (II) beforehand. Subsequently, all of the ferrate quantities are determined, followed by the determination of the quantity of Fe (III). As a result, the iron compounds thus obtained turned out to be bivalent and tervalent ferrates. MRN-100 was provided by ACM Co., Ltd, Japan.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Radiation Schedule</title><p>Radiation was carried out with a &#x003b3;-ray source of 4-MCi <sup>137</sup> Cs (Radiotherapy Department, Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt). The radiation employed for the whole-body radiation was a single dose of 15 Gy with a target object distance of 27 cm and an exposure rate of 200 R/min. During radiation, each group was kept in small oblong-shaped glass vessels containing 2 l of aged tap water. Immediately after radiation, fish were transferred into large, 200-l tanks, and 10% of the water was changed every day until the end of the experiment. Survival of fish was monitored twice-daily at morning and at night for 27 days post-radiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Oreochromis niloticus</title><p>The <italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic> (6&#x02013;8 weeks old, &#x0223c;50 &#x000b1; 15 g body weight, length &#x0223c;16.5 &#x000b1; 10 cm) were purchased from a fish farm specializing in Tilapia (Iman Farm, Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt) and acclimatized for 1 week prior to experimentation.

Exposure of animals to ionizing radiation causes a series of physiological changes known as acute radiation syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C28">28</xref>], which may lead to death with doses &#x0003e; 1 Gy due to severe damage to the hematopoietic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C29">29</xref>]. Ionizing radiation is known to induce oxidative stress through the generation of ROS, resulting in an imbalance of the pro-oxidant and antioxidant status in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C31">31</xref>]. ROS, such as <sup>&#x02022;</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <sup>&#x02022;</sup>OH and <sup>&#x02022;</sup>NO<sub>2</sub>, play a critical role in cell damage by inducing lipid peroxidation, protein modification, DNA damage, and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C32">32</xref>]. The mechanisms by which MRN-100 protect against radiation-induced mortality in fish are not fully understood but could be attributed to the ability of MRN-100 to act as: (i) a potent antioxidant agent, and (ii) a protector of the gills from radiation damage. Regarding the antioxidant property, our earlier study showed that treatment with MRN-100 resulted in the recovery of age-induced ROS in rats. MRN-100 has proven effectiveness at increasing glutathione (GSH) concentration and antioxidant enzymes, accompanied by reduction in lipid peroxidation and free radical levels in the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>]. This finding is in agreement with research into other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, which have been associated with an increase in the survival of irradiated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C12">12</xref>]. In addition, the increased mortality among &#x003b3;-irradiated fish could be attributed to the significant damage to the gills, which include great destruction of the gill &#x0fb01;laments and secondary lamellae, thus significantly reducing the oxygen supply to the body. On the other hand, treatment with MRN-100 prior to irradiation resulted in the absence of histopathological lesions in the gills, gill &#x0fb01;laments and secondary lamellae. This indicates that treatment with MRN-100 provides protection for the gills from radiation damage.</p><p>The damage to the hematopoietic system is a major factor in mortality following acute radiation exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C29">29</xref>]. Our studies and those of others revealed atrophy of the hematopoietic tissues, a decrease in WBC counts, and immune dysfunction in fish and mammals during the first few days after radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C35">35</xref>]. In this study, fish exposed to &#x003b3;-radiation for 1 week showed a significant decrease in the total number of WBCs. The mechanisms by which MRN-100 exerts its protective effect could be attributed to its ability to alleviate oxidative stress in lymphocytes. MRN-100 inhibits the apoptotic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced signaling pathways by suppressing the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl-2, and upregulating the pro-apoptotic molecule, Bax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, oral administration of MRN-100 has resulted in a significant enhancement of natural killer (NK) cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C38">38</xref>]. These innate immune cells are capable of destroying viral-infected cells and cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C40">40</xref>]. This characteristic suggests that the use of MRN-100 may result in protection against radiation-induced immune dysfunction. In addition, MRN-100 protected the fish from radiation-induced destruction of melanin pigments in the spleen. This is of particular interest because these pigments may be involved in defense mechanisms against disease and tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C41">41</xref>]. The results of the current study demonstrate that treatment with MRN-100 provides protection for WBCs and melanin pigments.</p><p>Anemia is often seen in patients with acute radiation syndrome, which results in decreases in erythrocyte counts and RBC parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C43">43</xref>]. Our data shows that exposure to radiation caused significant reduction in the RBC counts, HGB, HCT, MCH and MCHC, as well as formation of histopathological lesions in the splenic tissues. However, fish treated with MRN-100 prior to irradiation demonstrated protection against radiation-induced damage to the parameters of the RBC series, as well as prevention of histopathological lesions in the splenic tissues. Although the mechanism underlying the effect of MRN-100 is not fully understood, it is thought to regulate the levels of free iron in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>].</p><p>Iron has the capacity to accept and donate electrons readily, thus it is the key catalytic site of many oxygen-transporting proteins and enzymes. This characteristic makes it a useful component of cytochromes and oxygen-binding molecules. Nutritional deficiencies, such as lack of iron, have been shown to induce oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C45">45</xref>], and the ability of iron to protect against oxidative stress has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C46">46</xref>]. Iron is known to interact with free radicals in the Haber-Weiss and Fenton reactions, producing highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and carbon-centered radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C47">47</xref>]. MRN-100 may exert its effect by preventing excess iron from taking part in the Fenton reaction by stimulating increased protein levels of the iron-binding compounds ferritin and transferrin. Iron captured within ferritin, a key cellular iron storage protein, does not generate the reactive radicals that it might otherwise form. Similarly, transferrin is responsible for sequestering and transporting iron through the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C48">48</xref>]. It has been shown that the increase in transferrin and ferritin protein levels after MRN-100 treatment reduces the levels of free iron, and therefore prevents the accumulation of reactive radicals, such as protein carbonyl groups, a principal product of metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>]. Additionally, it is known that radiation-treated rats release free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C50">50</xref>]. Although there have never been any direct studies on the protective effect of MRN-100 in irradiated mammals, our recent study showed that MRN-100 has an antioxidant effect in aged rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>]. This would suggest that in irradiated rats, MRN-100 could have a protective effect by scavenging free-radicals, which may explain the ability of MRN-100 to induce the protection of RBC series and splenic tissues in irradiated fish.</p><p>In fish, the liver is anatomically joined with the pancreas, forming a single organ called the hepatopancreas. The hepatopancreas is the main target tissue of research related to radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C51">51</xref>] and pollutants that induce oxidative stress in fish. The oxidative stress induced by exposure to chemical pollutants has been well documented in different types of fish. Several classes of pollutants, such as copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C52">52</xref>] and 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bromide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C53">53</xref>], lead to the formation of ROS in the hepatopancreas. Upon exposure to radiation, damage to hematopoetic tissue occurs due to a similar increase in the production of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C56">56</xref>]. Therefore, we thought it of particular interest to examine the damaging effect of radiation on the hepatopancreas. The results of this study show that exposure to radiation causes dramatic changes in the hepatopancreas, including pancreatic necrosis, severely degenerative hepatocytes, and loss of zymogen granules. In addition, elevated levels of SGPT were observed in the irradiated fish, which is in accordance with other studies that show irradiation causes increased levels of liver enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C61">61</xref>]. However, treatment with MRN-100 prior to radiation significantly reduced the levels of SGPT, and none of the histopathological lesions were observed in the hepatopancreatic tissue. Similarly, treatment of MRN-100 in aged rats showed the liver, which has more oxidative damage than younger rat livers, had a significant increase in GSH, total thiol contents and antioxidant enzymes, in addition to a significant inhibition in lipid peroxidation, biomarker malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and protein carbonyl groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>]. These findings may explain the protective effect of MRN-100 against radiation-induced damage to hematopoetic tissues.</p><p>The safety of radioprotectors is a major concern. The biosafety of MRN-100 has been studied in rats after 40 days of supplementation with no observable changes in animal behavior, body weight, or survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C13">13</xref>]. Additionally, earlier studies have shown that healthy subjects and cancer patients who were administered MRN-100 orally for up to 12 months showed enhancement of immune function, such as NK cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRT029C38">38</xref>].</p><p>We conclude that MRN-100 acts as a radioprotector by providing protection against radiation-induced mortality and radiation-induced hematopoietic damage in fish. This study suggests MRN-100 is a safe product that may be a useful adjuvant to counteract the severe adverse side effects that are associated with radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by Grant # C0030300 from ACM Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan.
