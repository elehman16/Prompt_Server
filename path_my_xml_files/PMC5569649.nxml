</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist with high affinity and selectivity towards the human GnRH receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Blockage of the GnRH receptor by degarelix results in decreased secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and, consequently, decreased release of testosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In contrast to GnRH receptor agonists, which cause an initial surge of testosterone followed by subsequent testosterone suppression, the direct receptor antagonism by degarelix results in rapid testosterone suppression, without any surge, to below castration level (0.5&#x000a0;ng/mL), the critical level in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer in need of hormone androgen ablation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Assessment of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a measure of the effect of a drug on cardiac repolarisation, and can be used as a substitute marker for the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, so-called torsade de pointes. Some drugs are associated with prolonged QT/QTc interval, and regulatory guidance for drug development therefore recommends a thorough investigation of the effect of an investigational drug on the QT/QTc interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">It is well known that testosterone deprivation in men to levels below the normal age-adjusted physiological range, irrespective of cause, is associated with prolongation of the QT interval, and is thus suggested to be a risk factor for cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Prolongation of the QT interval by approximately 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;ms has been associated with GnRH agonists, combined androgen blockade, and a GnRH antagonist in the treatment of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which has resulted in a &#x02018;Warnings and Precautions&#x02019; label regarding the effect of GnRH analogue products on the QT interval. Indeed, several studies have shown longer QT intervals in hypogonadal men after any intervention that reduced the level of testosterone, compared with men with more normal testosterone levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Many drugs that prolong the QT interval also block certain cardiac ion channels, mainly the so-called human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Preclinical investigations showed that degarelix had no effect on these channels (Ferring Pharmaceuticals, unpublished data), which supports the hypothesis that degarelix does not have any intrinsic QT prolongation properties.</p><p id="Par10">In the present thorough QT/QTc study, designed according to the ICH E14 guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the effect of the degarelix molecule by itself on the duration of the QT interval of the cardiac cycle was investigated in healthy men.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par11">This was a single-centre, randomised, placebo- and active-controlled, six-sequence, three-period, three-way crossover study comprising treatment with degarelix, placebo, and the positive control moxifloxacin.

The study documents were approved by the Yorkshire Independent Research Ethics Committee, Manchester, UK, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice at Covance Clinical Research Unit Ltd, Leeds, UK.

A semi-permanent skin marker was used to ensure consistent placement of the leads on consecutive study days. Recordings were performed 2&#x000a0;min apart and each ECG covered an approximate 10&#x000a0;s period. The timepoints for ECG recordings were chosen to ensure capturing of any direct and delayed effect on the QT interval occurring around the time of maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic>

(Philadelphia, PA, USA), for high-resolution measurement of the cardiac intervals and morphological assessment by a central cardiologist blinded to the study treatment. All ECGs for a given subject were analysed by the same reader.</p><p id="Par16">Interval duration measurements were collected using computer-assisted caliper placements on three consecutive beats. The cardiologist then verified the interval durations and performed the morphology analysis, noting any T&#x02013;U wave complex that was compatible with an effect on cardiac repolarisation.</p><p id="Par17">The measured QT intervals were corrected for heart rate (HR) using the Fridericia&#x02019;s (QTcF&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT/RR<sup>1/3</sup>) and Bazett&#x02019;s (QTcB&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT/RR<sup>0.5</sup>) correction formulae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], of which Fridericia&#x02019;s correction was defined as the primary assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The change in QTc from predose baseline was expressed as &#x00394;QTc for each timepoint, while the time-matched difference in &#x00394;QTc between degarelix and moxifloxacin on the one hand and placebo on the other was denoted as &#x00394;&#x00394;QTc.</p><p id="Par18">On-screen measurements of the RR, PR, QRS, and QT interval durations were performed, and variables for QTcF, QTcB, and HR were obtained for each 10-s ECG by the mean of three measurements. Each fiducial point (onset of P wave, onset of Q wave, offset of S wave, and offset of T wave) was electronically marked.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par19">The primary analysis was an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on QTcF adjusted for the baseline QTcF as a covariate, and period, sequence, and treatment as factors, with subject within sequence as a random effect (SAS PROC MIXED, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The effect of degarelix treatment on the QTcF interval was compared with the placebo effect at all nine postdose timepoints. For each timepoint, an upper bound, one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI; type I error <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5%) was computed for the treatment difference between degarelix and placebo using simulations. All nine upper bounds had to be below 10&#x000a0;ms in order to define the trial as &#x02018;negative&#x02019;, i.e. no effect of degarelix on the QTcF interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">In order for the results to be valid, the study had to provide evidence that it was sufficiently sensitive to detect an increase in the duration of the QTcF interval of approximately 5&#x000a0;ms using moxifloxacin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To establish assay sensitivity, at least one of the lower limits of the one-sided 98.3% CIs for the time-matched treatment differences between moxifloxacin and placebo had to be above 5&#x000a0;ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Three timepoints were selected for testing this endpoint, thus the overall type I error rate of 5% was protected by using a Bonferroni-corrected nominal error rate of 1.67%.</p><p id="Par21">The concentration&#x02013;response effect of degarelix on the QT interval was assessed for each subject for each degarelix concentration, by calculating the individual placebo-corrected change from the baseline of QTcF, i.e. &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF, and plotting the individual &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF values against the degarelix concentration.</p><p id="Par22">The exploratory concentration&#x02013;response analysis was performed by applying a repeated measures ANCOVA, modelling &#x00394;QTcF as being dependent on baseline QTcF, and concentration of degarelix as covariates, with timepoint of assessment and treatment as factors and subject within treatment as a random effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

The time-matched effect of degarelix on the QT interval, as adjusted for HR effects by Fridericia&#x02019;s correction equation, did not indicate any signs of QT interval prolongation, with the mean maximum baseline-corrected difference versus placebo being &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;ms, well below the limit of 10&#x000a0;ms as defined by ICH E14 to constitute a QT-prolonging effect. Furthermore, the exploratory concentration&#x02013;response analysis did not show any sign of increased QTcF interval when the degarelix concentration increased. The assay validity was corroborated by the positive control moxifloxacin, which produced the expected QTc prolongation of &#x02265;5&#x000a0;ms.</p><p id="Par38">The guidance on thorough QT/QTc studies requires supratherapeutic doses to be tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The median peak concentration of degarelix after a single subcutaneous administration of 240&#x000a0;mg of the clinical dose regimen in the treatment of prostate cancer was 66&#x000a0;ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Based on nonlinear mixed-effects modelling of the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered degarelix, and the intended clinical dose in the treatment of prostate cancer, i.e. 240&#x000a0;mg at 40&#x000a0;mg/mL followed by monthly maintenance doses of 80 mg at 20&#x000a0;mg/mL, the steady-state median peak value during the maintenance phase of the marketed 1-month depot was estimated to be 70&#x000a0;ng/mL, with the 95th percentile at 115&#x000a0;ng/mL (using population pharmacokinetic modelling). In the present study, degarelix was administered as a single dose of 2.8&#x000a0;mg infused intravenously over 60&#x000a0;min at a constant rate, which resulted in a median maximal degarelix plasma concentration of approximately 220&#x000a0;ng/mL. This was approximately threefold the median maximal concentration observed in the clinical settings with prostate cancer, covering at least 95% of the observed <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> values in the respective treatment regimens. This high degarelix concentration was well tolerated and did not cause any safety concerns in the healthy men.</p><p id="Par39">Administration of degarelix by the intravenous route was chosen in this trial since this is the only way to achieve concentrations that are multiples of the maximal concentrations seen in the clinical setting with subcutaneous injections. Degarelix forms a depot after subcutaneous injection, from which the drug is released into the circulation in two phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This biphasic pattern of disposition comprises a short initial fast-release phase followed by a second slow-release phase, the latter in which plasma levels display a half-life of several weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Due to these physicochemical properties of degarelix, it would be practically impossible to reach prostate cancer supratherapeutic plasma levels of degarelix by the subcutaneous route. In the clinical setting, a starting dose of 240&#x000a0;mg is administered in a total volume of 6&#x000a0;mL. Since increasing the concentration of the injection suspension was not possible due to the gel formation, an unacceptable large volume would have to be administered subcutaneously in order to achieve substantial multiples of the anticipated maximum therapeutic exposure. Moreover, the half-life of subcutaneously administered degarelix is several weeks due to its slow release from the in situ depot, rendering subcutaneous administration unsuitable for a crossover study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">In this validated study, the maximum change of the time-matched &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcF interval by a supratherapeutic exposure of degarelix was well below the limit for &#x02018;no effect&#x02019; as defined by the ICH E14 guideline, and neither were there any signs of concentration&#x02013;response effect on the QT interval of increasing degarelix concentrations. Thus, it can be established that degarelix by itself does not cause any clinically significant substance-related prolongation of the QT interval, and is unlikely to contribute to the QT prolongation observed by androgen deprivation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Mrs Charlotte Elfving, M.Sc., RN, for managing the conduct of the study, and all investigators and staff involved at the study centre and core laboratory.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par41">This study was funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S, Denmark.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="Par42">H&#x000e5;kan Olsson, Niclas Petri, Anders Malmberg and Lars Grundemar are employees of Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S.
