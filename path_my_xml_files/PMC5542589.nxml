One in three children has an episode of wheezing prior to their third birthday; almost 50% of children wheeze by six years of age[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While recent evidence suggests overall emergency department visits for asthma have decreased, visits for children with wheeze in the first four years of life have not[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Management of pre-school children who wheeze is controversial, with only supplemental oxygen, hydration and inhaled short acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists being widely accepted[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>A handful of recently published studies have investigated whether macrolide antibiotics are effective at reducing the duration of symptoms in infants with bronchiolitis and preschool-aged children with recurrent wheeze[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are several potential pathophysiological rationale for the use of macrolides in these populations of young children. The first is that recent studies suggest that bacteria or the co-infection of virus and bacteria may be present during wheezing episodes in children[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Carlsson et. al.[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] identified the coinfection of virus and bacteria in 55% of acute wheezing episodes among children under three years of age. Kloepfer et. al.[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported an increased detection of specific bacterial pathogens during rhinovirus infection in children (four to 12 years of age) with and without asthma diagnosis. As a result, macrolides&#x02019; antibacterial activit<italic>y</italic> may result in quicker resolution as compared with no antibiotic treatment[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The second rationale is that macrolides are widely recognized to have immune-modulatory and potential antiviral properties[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The efficacy of azithromycin in the absence of bacterial infection emphasizes the anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral properties of azithromycin[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Beigelman et. al.[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed a decrease in upper airway (nasal lavage) IL-8 levels after the administration of azithromycin for 14 days to infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. In eosinophilic asthmatics, clarithromycin improved symptoms and had a reduction of blood eosinophil and eosinophil cationic protein levels on serum and sputum[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Clarithromycin significantly reduced airway concentrations of interleukin 8 (IL-8), metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), neutrophil elastase, neutrophil numbers, in a randomized control trial of adults with severe, refractory asthma[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Although several recently published studies in infants with bronchiolitis treated with macrolides did not show a benefit[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], other studies have shown that the early administration of azithromycin in pre-school children with multiple recurrent wheezing episodes reduced the progression to or severity of lower respiratory infection[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We hypothesized that treatment of pre-school children 12 to 60 months of age visiting the emergency department, regardless of the severity or chronicity of previous wheezing episodes, with acute wheezing with five days of azithromycin would reduce the duration of their respiratory symptoms compared with children treated with placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Trial design and participants</title><p>We completed a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-control randomized trial of azithromycin among wheezy pre-school children (12 to 60 months of age) who presented to the Alberta Children&#x02019;s and Stollery Children&#x02019;s Hospitals&#x02019; emergency departments, between January 2011 to May 2014 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182411.s001">S1 File</xref></bold> presents the study design).

Our sample size is similar to most previous randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of azithromycin for respiratory symptoms[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] although the Bacharier study had a higher number of participants included in their analysis[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We completed a conditional power analysis using our study&#x02019;s results. Had we achieved our targeted sample size of 220 participants per group (azithromycin versus placebo) with the same intragroup differences, we would have achieved a 33.7% power to reject the null hypothesis. This analysis suggests that we would be unlikely to reject the null hypothesis even if we had achieved our proposed study sample size.</p><p>Macrolide resistance is a world-wide problem with increasing prevalence of resistance in China[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Japan[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Europe[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and North America[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The use of macrolides for the treatment of respiratory symptoms is not recommended without a clear bacteriological background[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The Bacharier study reported a slight increase in the number of subjects with azithromycin resistant organisms on patients treated with azithromycin. However, only one site with a total of 81 participants were included in the antimicrobial resistance analysis of the Bacharier study[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A recent published Cochrane review of macrolides for chronic asthma recommends that future research should focus on the measurement and report of resistance as an outcome[<xref rid="pone.0182411.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Future studies could evaluate changes in antibiotic resistance using the nasal swabs collected from all participants (azithromycin and placebo) before the administration of the intervention (enrollment) and 21 days after the first dose.</p><p>Our study has several strengths compared to the prior literature. First, enrolment in an emergency department allowed us to include patients evaluated in an acute care setting that attends patients from the general population and not specific sub-groups or high-risk populations such as children with a history of severe lower respiratory tract infections or those diagnosed with recurrent asthma-like symptoms. Second, we completed skin prick testing as an objective assessment of atopic status. Third, we were able to assess both short and long-term impact of azithromycin on respiratory symptoms. Fourth, our pre-planned sub-group analysis allowed us to determine if children with a history of recurrent wheeze responded differently than those children with their first episode of wheeze. Finally, we assessed the practical impact of treating these patients by assessing whether treatment altered children&#x02019;s daily activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a multi-center double-blind randomized control trial, azithromycin did not reduce the duration of respiratory symptoms, short-acting beta agonist medication usage after discharge, or time to a respiratory exacerbation among preschool children. We did not find any benefit among first-time or previous wheezers, or among atopic or non-atopic children in a secondary analysis. The number of adverse events in the azithromycin group was not different from placebo and none of the adverse events were serious or life threatening. Based on our data, we do not recommend azithromycin for the regular management of preschool wheezing children presenting to the emergency department.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182411.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting information.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182411.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182411.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182411.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182411.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>AZT protocol for publication submission.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182411.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0182411.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Martinez</surname><given-names>FD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Taussig</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Holberg</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Halonen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>Asthma and Wheezing in the First Six Years of Life</article-title>. <source>N Engl J Med</source>. <year>1995</year>;<volume>332</volume>: <fpage>133</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>138</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199501193320301">10.1056/NEJM199501193320301</ext-link></comment>
