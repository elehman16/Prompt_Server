Previous interventions informed by possible selves, a type of future-oriented self-representation, proved useful to increase physical activity in young adults. We thus wanted to explore if a similar intervention would yield favorable outcomes in new retirees. We also examined whether possible selves could help increase identity relative to the physical activity context. Identity circumscribes the meanings which help individuals define who they are in a given role (i.e., what it means to be a physically active person). The strength of identification as a physically active person increases when individuals endorse these meanings more strongly. Possible selves may be tied to identity as they allow individuals to imagine themselves as physically active, which has been argued to incite changes to one&#x02019;s sense of self. Hence, the overall aim of this study was to determine whether a possible selves intervention would increase physical activity behaviour and physical activity identity in a group of newly-retired individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 294 participants were randomized into one of three groups: (a) a repeated group with three possible selves image generation exposures, (b) a one-time group with one possible selves image generation exposure, or (c) a control group. Participants completed self-report measures at baseline and follow-up assessments were taken at weeks 4, 8, and 12 of the study. The measures for the outcomes of interest were the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire and the modified Exercise Identity Scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Repeated measures mixed-effects models analyses with maximum likelihood estimation revealed no significant differences between groups on physical activity behaviour (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.34) or physical activity identity (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97) at follow-up time points. However, a time effect was found for physical activity (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;.01) and physical activity identity (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;.01), which increased across time (baseline-to-12-week follow-up) in all three groups. Such a time effect (inconsequential to group assignment) suggests that the observed increases in physical activity and identity cannot be attributed to an exposure to a possible selves intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>While the intervention failed to significantly increase physical activity identity and physical activity in newly retired individuals, we suggest future research directions for interventions targeting new retired individuals.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Possible selves</kwd><kwd>Identity</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Retirees</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008572</institution-id><institution>University of Ottawa</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Retirement and self</title><p>From mid-to-late life, people&#x02019;s physical activity levels decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This decrease may result in older adults missing out on the benefits associated with regular physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Retirement may present older adults with an opportunity to thwart these age-related declines by affording them increased time to be physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, research examining the association between retirement and self-reported physical activity reveals that for many retirees, this life transition does not lead to increased physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Researchers highlight the need to understand the &#x0201c;personal factors&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] related to physical activity among retirees as they could be employed in interventions aimed at helping retirees transition into a physically active retirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. <italic>Self-perceptions</italic> are a category of personal factors that are central in understanding physical activity behaviour and behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and may be especially relevant to new retirees. Indeed, the transition from work to retirement is viewed as a period for self-exploration and enhancement during which retirees may self-reflect on their health and who they are (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). As such, we turn to one type of self-perceptions: possible selves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Possible selves</title><p>Possible selves are future-oriented self-representations which circumscribe the thoughts people have about their future and their potential related to specific roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Since possible selves are anchored in the future - and thus are not confined by what is factual in the present &#x02013; they represent malleable elements of the self [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Possible selves are not just <italic>any</italic> aspect of one&#x02019;s imagination, rather they usually hone in on individuals&#x02019; enduring hopes and fears for the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As per these authors, possible selves provide motivation and guidance for change. First, they provide a vivid snapshot of what is possible for someone (good or bad) which serves as a goal to be pursued or avoided. Secondly, possible selves provide a context to evaluate or interpret current behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Possible selves and physical activity</title><p>The possible selves construct has been employed in physical activity/exercise research. A cross-sectional study by Harju and Reed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found, in a sample of undergraduate students, that the supposed attainment of a possible self in the exercise purview positively coalesced with exercise behaviour, fitness, and self-efficacy for exercise. Additional cross-sectional findings from Whaley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] demonstrate how the reporting of possible selves pertaining to body image can distinguish inactive and active, middle-age women. Furthermore, Whaley and Schrider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed that older adults participating in a 10-week exercise program had well-articulated possible selves related to physical activity. Recently, possible selves have been assessed relative to the physical activity levels of new retirees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; these authors confirmed that newly retired individuals&#x02019; possible selves pertaining to physical activity were positively associated with concurrent physical activity. And this has been recently confirmed in a prospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As such, physical activity possible selves appear to be positively related to aspects of physical activity.</p><p>Possible selves have also been leveraged in <italic>interventions</italic> designed to increase physical activity. Ouellette, Hessling, Gibbons, Reis-Bergan, and Gerrard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] found that university students who thought and wrote about their exercise participation from a future perspective (i.e., possible self) reported increased exercise behaviour four weeks later. Subsequently, Murru and Martin Ginis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that inactive university students who read a script to help generate images of themselves in the future as either an exerciser or an inactive person reported greater physical activity four and six weeks post manipulation than participants in the control group. Similarly, Strachan, Marcotte, Giller, Brunet and Schellenberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] randomized insufficiently-active adults (aged 18&#x02013;64) to either a self-enhancing possible selves intervention (consistent with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) or an enhanced &#x0201c;self-regulatory&#x0201d; possible selves intervention (participants&#x02019; possible self image included the self-regulatory steps they would take to achieve their possible self). Participants in both conditions reported significantly higher physical activity than their control counterparts (at 4- and 8-week follow-up for the self-regulatory condition and at 8&#x000a0;weeks for the self-enhancing condition). These studies suggest that a <italic>one-time</italic> focus on images, including possible selves, can impact physical activity behaviour. Given the promising results of these studies, a possible selves intervention may represent a reasonable tool through which we can attempt to increase physical activity among retirees and by the same token, heed recommendations by Ouellette et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to examine the impact of such interventions on older adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Possible selves and identity</title><p>While possible selves interventions can lead to increases in physical activity, they also hold the potential to have another important impact, that of increasing the extent to which individuals identify with physical activity <italic>in the present</italic> (physical activity identity). Indeed, researchers argue that the consideration of possible selves can affect and lead to enduring changes in current self-views (i.e., identity; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]). Given that Markus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Burke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] have both commented that identities are resistant to change, individuals may require <italic>repeated</italic> occasions to reflect on a physically-active possible self for identity to be impacted. This assertion is consistent with that of Hoyle and Sherrill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] who argue that the <italic>chronic</italic> activation of a possible self can impact current self-representations (i.e., identity). No research to date has examined the effects of a physical activity possible selves intervention on physical activity identity or considered whether repeated exposure to the possible self image is necessary for a change in identity to occur.</p><p>If imagining oneself as a physically active retiree could encourage people to identify with physical activity, this consequence may represent an important way in which sustained physical activity behaviour change could be fostered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, the ameliorative influence of identities on physical activity/exercise is well documented (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]). Strength of exercise identity also positively relates to self-efficacy for exercise, exercise frequency, and the articulation and carrying out of exercise intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the positive relationship between physical activity identity and related behaviour is demonstrated in middle-aged and older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] as well as in recent retirees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, possible selves interventions may lead to changes in physical activity identity, a known correlate of physical activity behaviour. Further, testing the utility of possible selves interventions at increasing identity should also be of interest to scholars interested in identity change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Experimental purposes and hypotheses</title><p>The overall aim of this experiment was to determine if a possible selves intervention would increase physical activity identity and physical activity behaviour in a group of newly-retired individuals. One specific aim was to compare physical activity levels and identity across three conditions of an experimental design: a <italic>repeated</italic> possible selves intervention, a <italic>one-time</italic> possible selves intervention, and a control group. We hypothesized that participants in the <italic>repeated</italic> possible selves group would report higher levels of physical activity and identity over the course of the intervention than the <italic>control</italic> group (hypothesis 1) and the <italic>one-time</italic> possible selves group (hypothesis 2). The <italic>one-time</italic> condition was expected to report higher levels in physical activity identity and physical activity over the course of the intervention than the control group (hypothesis 3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 294 newly retired men and women were randomized in the present study. Specific inclusion criteria included confirmation of retirement status (i.e., collecting pension/retirement-like income, and considering oneself &#x0201c;retired&#x0201d;) and confirmation of current health status (allowing for increased physical activity). To allow for a focus on <italic>newly-retired</italic> individuals, we restricted eligibility to retirees within three years of retirement. This cut-off is consistent with past research on new retirees&#x02019; leisure experiences (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). Further, we focused on recently-retired, as opposed to all retired individuals, based on the assumption that the physical activity patterns and self-perceptions related to this role of newly-retired individuals should be less entrenched than those of more &#x0201c;seasoned&#x0201d; retirees. Moreover, individuals exercising four times per week or more or reporting a strong physical activity identity were excluded as they were deemed not likely to benefit from the intervention.</p><p>The average age of the participants in the sample (i.e., across conditions) was 63.4&#x000a0;years old.

The decision to run these models was predicated on the nested nature of the data (i.e., time points nested within participants), which introduces within-subject correlation between repeated measures of the outcome. Mixed-effects models allow for statistical dependence between observations within subjects and incorporates it into the model estimation algorithm, thereby providing unbiased effect estimates and appropriate standard errors. Furthermore, mixed models are increasingly used in longitudinal studies as they allow the inclusion of participants with missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].

Further, Hoyle and Sherrill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] argue that recurrently thinking about a possible self and its consequences can bring about changes in self-representations. From this theoretical perspective, we speculated that possible selves might bring about changes in identity and that repeated possible selves activation should have the greatest impact on identity. One possible interpretation of our findings of null effects of the intervention on identity is that a physical activity possible selves intervention is not an effective way to increase identity. Considering that no other possible selves intervention, to our knowledge, has attempted to increase identity in the physical activity purview, dismissing the possibility seems premature. Perhaps a hybrid and multifaceted approach is needed to truly impact identity. We offer a few possibilities of such approaches.</p><p>An imagery intervention conducted by Cooke, Duncan, Hall, and Rodgers [unpublished observations] shares with our study, the idea that the act of imagining oneself as an exerciser can be a fruitful way to increase identity. In their 36-week exercise program for female exercise initiates, individuals who underwent an exercise imagery intervention in addition to exercise reported significantly stronger exercise role identity at 9&#x000a0;weeks than those within an exercise plus attention control condition. The findings from this study lead to two pertinent observations. First, the guided imagery intervention used in the Cooke et al. study and our possible selves image generation task shared similarities in that both involved evoking images of the self as an exerciser. Giacobbi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] have even commented on the close ties between mental imagery and possible selves. However, the imagery intervention used by Cooke et al. (i.e., script and lab procedures) provided more elaborate and multifaceted imagery sessions (e.g., more frequent exposure; conducted within the laboratory) than the present possible selves protocol; a more elaborate possible selves image generation task may have led to increases in identity in our study. Second, the study by Cooke et al. included, in addition to the imagery intervention, a physical activity component. As noted by Cooke et al., and others (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]), physical activity participation alone may not coalesce with increased identity and the addition of the imagery component in the study by Cooke et al. appeared to help increase identity. Indeed, previous research has pointed to the likely reciprocal relationship between physical activity and identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Increases in identity are often tied to greater behavioural output - wherein physical activity levels increased significantly. Herein, the image generation tasks were not part of an exercise intervention or program. Future research should consider whether a possible selves intervention combined with a physical activity intervention/program will yield gains in identity and which one has the greatest effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Effects of the possible selves intervention on physical activity</title><p>Markus and Nurius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] argue that possible selves encourage behaviour change by providing motivation and guidance in the form of standards for comparison.

We are therefore surprised that, in the present study, participants exposed to a physical activity possible selves intervention did not report more physical activity than controls.</p><p>Methodological considerations offer potential explanations for why we failed to find group differences in physical activity patterns, where others did. Ouellette et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] found that university students who participated in a exerciser possible selves intervention, and scored high on consideration of future consequences, increased exercise behaviour at four weeks post intervention. However, their study did not include a control group, so it is unclear if the effect is attributable to the intervention. Interestingly, without a control group, our findings would also suggest an effect of the possible selves interventions, as we too found changes in physical activity amongst all participants. Murru and Martin-Ginis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that university students exposed to a possible selves image generation task exercised more at 4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks follow-up than those exposed to a control activity. These researchers employed a more stringent eligibility criterion than we did (i.e., less than three versus less than four 30&#x000a0;min bouts of physical activity per week). Our slightly more active participants had less room to increase their physical activity making it more difficult for us to detect a change due to the intervention. Recently, Gunnell, Crocker, Mack, and Zumbo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] also failed to find a possible selves intervention effect on physical activity in a community sample in which no limits were imposed on baseline physical activity levels. These findings suggest that physical activity possible selves interventions may work best for those who are inactive. Finally, in a study by Strachan, Marcotte, Giller, Brunet and Schellenberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] we note that participants were instructed to read the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] prior to partaking in one of two possible selves image generation tasks. Perhaps the exposure to the physical activity guidelines (i.e., messaging), coupled with the future perspective of the PSs task (i.e., seeing oneself engaging in regular physical, five to ten years from now) highlighted participants&#x02019; discrepant physical activity behaviour (or lack thereof), which in turn galvanized their behaviour. The purported impact of being presented with physical activity guidelines is, of course, speculative.</p><p>The finding that <italic>all</italic> participants reported increased physical activity suggests that we cannot attribute physical activity increases to exposure to a possible selves intervention. All participants may have been disposed to a form of measurement reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. For example, participants likely engaged in self-monitoring through self-reporting their physical activity at several time points via a questionnaire. If participants noticed low or reduced physical activity levels, this awareness may have energized them to increase their physical activity. In a similar vein, having participants complete questionnaires about physical activity (e.g., their intentions, thoughts, etc.) may have increased their chance of performing that behaviour &#x02013; something known as question-behaviour effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This effect, documented in the physical activity/exercise purview, operates by making individuals&#x02019; underlying attitudes about a particular behaviour more accessible which, in turn, can lead to the behaviour being enacted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Our questionnaires, asked of all participants, included such measures. Considering that we cannot attribute the sample-wide increase in physical activity to our intervention activities, we speculate that some of these measurement aspects may be responsible for the small increase in physical activity reported across our sample.</p><p>When considering the null results for <italic>both</italic> identity and physical activity, we ponder whether our approach, while inspired by previous studies, was appropriate for newly retired individuals. Hooker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] opined: &#x0201c;Goals in later life may be less normatively structured than early and midlife [&#x02026; and as such] their (older adults&#x02019;) activities are the most likely to be motivated by their own personal agendas&#x0201d; (p. 111). Herein, and in line with past studies targeting younger adults (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]), we utilized the same, broadly-defined possible self (i.e., physically active retiree) across groups partaking in the image generation tasks. Perhaps the one-size-fits-all nature of our intervention materials lacked personal meaning, thus dissuading participants from engaging fully in the tasks. Two recent reviews on the features of effective physical activity interventions in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] point to the importance of personalizing of interventions. In the possible selves purview, this suggestion could take the form of allowing participants to articulate and or revise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] their own physically active possible self for retirement. Such an individualized approach may be appropriate for retirees for whom generalized possible selves may lack relevance. In the same vein, McDonald, O&#x02019;Brien, White, and Sniehotta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] further confirm that &#x0201c;routes to retirement are highly individualistic&#x0201d;. Engagement in physical activity may thus be influenced by personal preferences, obligations, and other competing goals. Therefore, personalized interventions may prove more helpful in getting retirees physically active. Finally, we cannot dismiss the possibility that image generation may become more difficult for older adults. In their article on motor and exercise imagery, Kalicinski and Lobinger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] review mixed evidence linking motor imagery ability deterioration due to age. However, it is &#x0201c;unclear whether this deterioration is selectively influenced by age&#x0201d; (p. 66). For now, though, linking age and difficulty in imagery tasks in the exercise purview is quite speculative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The present study draws strength from its innovation. The study was the first, to our knowledge, to carry out a possible selves intervention in older, retired adults, in contrast to previous inquiries conducted in younger populations. Our research also proved innovative through its focus on physical activity identity in addition to physical activity, which has typically been the outcome of interest of physical activity possible selves interventions. Conducting the intervention entirely online was also novel as this, to the extent of our knowledge, was only the second time a possible selves intervention was delivered online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Finally, in terms of design and analytic strengths, we assessed and controlled for personal characteristics (i.e., imaging ability, consideration for future consequences) and data were analyzed through mixed-effects modeling, which is increasingly advocated over traditional ANOVA-based techniques (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]).</p><p>The strengths, however, must be considered in light of limitations. The demographics of participants (female, Caucasian, and well-educated) limit the generalizability of our findings. Further, our eligibility criteria pertaining to physical activity and identity allowed already fairly active retirees who somewhat identify as physically active to participate in the study, making it difficult for us to find effects. Another notable limitation concerns the use of a self-report physical activity measure which was predicated on practical considerations. Objective measurement was prohibitive given the online nature of the study. Further, we opted for the GLTEQ since it was previously validated against objective measures of physical activity and proven reliable in test-retest methods (for a review of these studies, please see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]). Finally, the GLTEQ has been used with older adult/retired samples [20;21;36;57]. While our choice to use a validated measure of physical activity addresses some of the measurement limitations noted by Barnett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], our physical activity measure is limited in that it relies on self-report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study was the first, to our knowledge, to test a possible selves intervention targeting physical activity identity and physical activity in a sample of recent retirees. While we did not find the expected differences between groups, marginal improvements in physical activity identity and behavior were observed over time (regardless of group assignment). We opine that interventions based on self and self-perceptions - like possible selves - may be relevant for new retirees (i.e., exploring/revisiting different roles), and as such, warrant further investigation. We hope our intervention can serve as a launch pad for future intervention efforts.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFC</term><def><p>Consideration of future consequences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLTEQ</term><def><p>Godin leisure time exercise questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IAQ</term><def><p>Imaging ability questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCAR</term><def><p>Missing completely at random</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>URL</term><def><p>Uniform resource locator</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>Not applicable</p><sec id="FPar8"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by internal funding received from the University of Ottawa (Research Development Program and the Faculty of Health Sciences).
