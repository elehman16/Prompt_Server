Prior research on human&#x02013;wind interaction has focused on comfort levels in urban settings or knock-down thresholds.

Wind speed perceptions mediated the direct relationship between actual wind speeds and perceptions of risk (i.e., the greater the perceived wind speed, the greater the perceived risk). The number of tropical cyclones people had experienced moderated the strength of the actual&#x02013;perceived wind speed relationship; consequently, mediation was stronger for people who had experienced fewer storms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings provide a clearer understanding of wind and risk perception, which can aid development of public policy solutions toward communicating the severity and risks associated with natural disasters.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors thank the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes (FLASH; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flash.org">http://www.flash.org</ext-link>) for supporting the research.

Prior experimental research on wind&#x02013;human interaction has focused on pedestrian &#x02018;comfort&#x02019; in urban areas <xref rid="pone.0049944-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049944-Penwarden1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> by establishing wind speed thresholds that make daily tasks challenging, uncomfortable, or cause people to feel unsafe <xref rid="pone.0049944-Bottema1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Findings were largely based on two-choice semantic responses (e.g., gentle-violent, calm-gale, pleasant-annoying <xref rid="pone.0049944-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049944-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) or characterizations of physical responses (e.g., loss of balance, shifts in footstep trajectories <xref rid="pone.0049944-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049944-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). Surprisingly, however, empirical research is lacking on (a) people's accuracy in perceiving wind speed while they are experiencing it and (b) people's perception of personal risk in response to wind. Understanding people's perceptual accuracy of extreme wind speeds is important because storms often cause massive power and communication disruptions that leave people without official weather warnings or reports. The effectiveness of weather warnings in conveying the actual risks associated with extreme wind events may be suboptimal even if information regarding wind speed severity is made available <xref rid="pone.0049944-Slovic1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049944-Dow1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Our goal in the present experiment was to address these shortcomings by exposing people to various wind speeds to gain a better understanding of wind and risk perception&#x02014;factors that could be key in developing better policy and warning systems for extreme wind-related events. This might include supplementing extreme wind-related warnings by framing them in familiar contexts (e.g., &#x0201c;a wind of this speed or greater is enough to knock over a person&#x0201d;).</p><p>This present experiment examined human perception of extreme winds and associated risks. Because prior research in established perceptual domains (e.g., vision, audition, just noticeable differences in weight perception) has shown human perception to be a nonlinear transform of physical stimuli (e.g., Weber&#x02013;Fechner law), we predicted that people would overestimate wind speeds at higher velocities, and that risk perceptions would follow a similar accelerating trajectory. We also expected that wind speed perception would mediate the relationship between actual wind velocity and perceptions of risk; overestimates of wind speed would relate to more perceived risk. On an exploratory basis, we also examined the extent to which individual differences in prior storm experience moderated these relationships.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethical standards outlined by the American Psychological Association were followed in the conduct of this research, which was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board.

Participants were first given surveys on their prior experiences with and beliefs about extreme weather phenomena and associated decision-making. Next, participants donned protective gear (goggles, waders, and hooded raincoats) and a harness that attached to a handrail system located 8 ft downwind of the jet, which they were allowed to hold. Participants were then exposed to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mph (4.5, 8.9, 13.4, 17.9, 22.3, and 26.8 m/s) wind speeds for 20-s intervals in predetermined randomized orders (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0049944.s001">Video S1</xref>). In between each wind exposure event (which lasted &#x02248;10 s), participants communicated their estimate of the wind speed and their estimate of personal injury risk on a scale of 0 (<italic>no perceived risk</italic>) to 10 (<italic>dangerous</italic>) to an observer standing outside the wind field. Thus, the total experiment duration was &#x02248;3 min for each participant. The testing conditions (wind speed intensities, total exposure time, gear) were identical for all participants; only the order of wind speeds was randomized to control for possible order effects. Participants were given no information on the wind speed intensities to prevent possible bias; however, they were informed of the wind speeds after the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Wind Apparatus</title><p>Eight 54-in (1.37-m) diameter vaneaxial fans forced air through a 10-ft&#x000d7;10-ft (3.05-m&#x000d7;3.05-m) square jet to generate the wind field in the test chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049944-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The study results indicate that on average (a) people overestimate higher wind speeds (&#x02265;20 mph or 8.9 m/s) but are reasonably accurate at judging lower wind speeds, (b) the simple relationship between wind speed and perceived risk becomes increasingly positive at higher wind speeds, (c) wind perception mediates the relationship between actual wind speed and risk, and (d) this mediation pattern is stronger among people with no prior experience with tropical cyclones and weakens with exposure to each additional storm.</p><p>The new knowledge generated by this research is useful not only because it expands our understanding of how people perceive wind and wind-related risk on a psychological level, but also because it has potentially life-saving public policy implications on how information is communicated prior to and during extreme weather events (e.g., tornadoes, hurricanes). Although the average person overestimates higher wind speeds (e.g., they perceive 60-mph [26.8-m/s] winds to be 75 mph [33.5 m/s]), this relationship is moderated by individual differences in storm exposure; with each addition tropical cyclone people experienced, people made more accurate wind speed estimates on average. This suggests that exposure to real storms may help calibrate people's perceptions regarding higher wind speeds. With some exposure, people may be able to gauge wind speeds more accurately. Future research should strive to examine the processes by which individual differences in perceptual and risk judgments form. Nevertheless, our results also highlight a disconnect between wind perception and reality, perhaps because of people's lack of exposure to high-velocity wind speeds. For example, in Florida&#x02014;the most hurricane-prone state in the U.S.&#x02014;many coastal residents hail from outside the state <xref rid="pone.0049944-Tobin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and thus have no prior experience with landfalling hurricanes. The findings indicated that people who have not experienced sustained tropical storm or hurricane-force winds are more prone to overestimating wind speed, which may negatively affect their decision-making about preparation and evacuation. For example, a major civil problem with government-issued evacuations is the phenomenon of &#x0201c;shadow evacuation,&#x0201d; in which people who do <italic>not</italic> need to evacuate chose to do so anyway, thereby unnecessarily exacerbating traffic jams along evacuation routes, and filling limited spaces in shelters and hotel rooms <xref rid="pone.0049944-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Further research is required to validate these findings, not only with a more diverse sample, but also with a more specific measure of risk that can distinguish between probability and severity.</p><p>Although additional research needs to be done before we can make any strong recommendations regarding public policy, the present research may suggest the possibility for introducing a risk metric or contextual aid to characterize wind speeds in storm advisories, particularly given that the difference between perceived and actual wind speed can be shown to be interpreted as a difference of one or two categories on the Saffir&#x02013;Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale&#x02014;a five-category classification system for hurricane intensity based on wind velocity. Such a dual system is used for hail advisories, where the U.S. National Weather Service reports both hail diameter information (in fractional inches) and the size of a common object (e.g., &#x0201c;dime-sized,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;quarter-sized,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;softball-sized&#x0201d;). Perhaps wind speeds could be accompanied by relevant information such as &#x0201c;this wind speed is sufficient to knock over the average person.&#x0201d; Nevertheless, we caution that the present research is preliminary, and additional research that focuses on public policy applications will need to be undertaken before any recommendations can be made. We hope our novel experimental findings on wind perception will inform not only the psychology of risk but also future research on the broader policy implications extreme weather preparation and response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0049944.s001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p>
