The aim of this study was to investigate the fracture resistance of overtly flared root canals filled with Resilon as compared to similar root canals filled with gutta-percha (GP).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Sixty single-rooted premolars were divided randomly into six groups. Group 1 served as control group. The control group was sub-divided into two groups, a negative group and a positive group. The negative group consisted of root canals that were only cleaned from residual pulpal tissues, however, the positive group had prepared and overtly flared root canals without obturation. Groups 2 and 4 were shaped using 0.04 taper rotary files, while groups 3 and 5 were shaped using 0.06 taper rotary files. Before obturation, the last four groups were further flared coronally with a reverse cone diamond bur. Groups 2 and 3 were obturated with GP and a resin-based sealer, while groups 4 and 5 were obturated with Resilon and Epiphany self-etching primer and Epiphany sealer. Roots were then fixed into a universal testing machine and vertically loaded until fracture.

Different endodontic filling materials and technologies have been introduced to improve the apical seal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The most popular is the combination of a zinc oxide-eugenol sealer with gutta-percha (GP) filling material. The use of sealers along with well-adapted GP gives the optimum chance of success.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] However, endodontic therapy may also weaken the tooth. Factors such as trauma, over-preparation of canals cervically, removal of previously placed posts, previous endodontic treatment, and internal resorption[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] may lead to thinner and weaker canal walls, increasing the risk of vertical root fracture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and ultimate extraction of the tooth. Consequently, filling such radicular defects with restorative materials, such as glass-ionomer cement, phosphate glass-polycaprolactone-based composite and composite resin has been suggested to reinforce weakened roots.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>In order for the adhesive dental material to reinforce the tooth structure, it must bond to dentin through its hydrophilicity and ability to infiltrate dentine surface. The bonding concept of GP is hampered by the lack of a chemical union between the polyisoprene component of GP and resin-based resin sealers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In 2004, Resilon was introduced under the name RealSeal (Pentron Clinical Technologies, Wallingford, CT) containing Resilon and a resin-based sealer. Resilon is a thermoplastic synthetic polymer-based root canal filling material. Based on polymers of polyester, Resilon contains bioactive glasses and radiopaque fillers. It performs in a similar way to GP, has the same handling properties, and for retreatment purposes may be heat-softened or dissolved with solvents such as chloroform. The RealSeal sealer is a dual curable dentin resin composite sealer and may be used in conjunction with Resilon points. Recent studies have compared the fracture forces of roots obturated with Resilon and GP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] but no studies yet have compared the fracture force of weakened roots obturated with these materials.</p><p>The aim of this <italic>in-vitro</italic> study was to evaluate the effect of Resilon and GP obturating materials on vertical forces at fracture of overtly flared root canals. Additionally, this study analyzed teeth which were prepared either using 0.04 taper or 0.06 taper rotary instruments before additional coronal flaring and obturation. The null hypothesis was that there are no differences in the vertical forces of fracture between materials or taper preparation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Teeth collection and sample selection</title><p>Sixty sound extracted human single-rooted mandibular premolars were used. Immediately after extraction, the teeth were stored at room temperature in hermetically-sealed vials containing physiological saline. The teeth were examined under digital stereomicroscope (Motic Digital Microscope, Micro-Optic Industrial Group Co. LTD, France) to rule out any pre-existing root fractures. The premolars were sectioned at the cemento-enamel junction to remove the crowns using high-speed hand piece and diamond disc under water cooling. Root samples had the same curvature (0-5&#x000b0;) using Schneider technique and apical foramen equals to file size 15 in diameter. Preoperative periapical radiographs were taken to ensure that root samples had normal canal shape and adequate thickness of dentinal walls. The samples were randomly divided into six groups. Each group consisted of 10 samples (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Each sample was marked by a unique identification number.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>The working length of all the root canals was established at 15 mm using size 15 K Flex file (DENTSPLY Maillefer, Tulsa, OK). The working length was then set at 1 mm shorter than the apical foramen. In Group 1 (negative and positive control groups), the root canals of the negative control group (10 samples) were cleaned from pulpal residuals, but neither prepared nor obturated, while the remaining other groups were cleaned and shaped using Profile rotary instruments. In the positive control group (10 samples) the samples were instrumented and overtly flared without obturation. In groups 2 and 4 (20 root samples) were instrumented with NiTiProFile 0.04 (DENTSPLY Maillefer) tapered rotary files with crown-down pressure-less technique to size 35 master apical file. Similarly, the canals in groups 3 and 5 (20 root samples) were instrumented with NiTiProFile 0.06 tapered rotary files. The canals were irrigated during instrumentation with 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL) and then rinsed with 5 ml of 17% ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) to remove the smear layer, and followed by 5 ml of distilled water to remove the residue of NaOCL and EDTA. The canals were enlarged using Gates Glidden drill size 6 for 10 mm of the working length and then the cervical 5 mm was flared using a reverse cone diamond bur size 023HP [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">b</xref>]. After total instrumentation the root samples were irrigated with distilled water. Instrumentation of root canals was standard throughout the study and completed by one investigator.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Schematic diagram shows the steps of flaring a root canal, apical part (5 mm of the working length) prepared with NiTiProFile 0.04 or 0.06, mid and cervical parts (10 mm of the working length) enlarged using drill size 6.

The sealer was mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions and placed into the canals with a lentulo spiral (DENTSPLY Caulk, Milford, DE). Tapered GP master cones were placed and condensed at the appropriate working lengths (15 mm). Then accessory cones were placed and condensed using a finger spreader (Miltex, Inc., York, PA). The excess GP was removed with a hot instrument and condensed vertically with a plugger to the level of the canal orifice. Root canals in Group 4 (ProFile 0.04 taper, <italic>n</italic> = 10) and Group 5 (ProFile 0.06 taper, <italic>n</italic> = 10) were obturated with Resilon, Epiphany self-etching primer and Epiphany sealer (Pentron Clinical Technologies LLC). The primer was inserted into the root canals and the excess was removed with dry paper points (DENTSPLY Maillefer). Epiphany sealer was mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions and inserted into the root canals with a lentulo spiral. Resilon master cones, size 35, with appropriate taper (according to the ProFile taper used) were placed and condensed at the appropriate working length (15 mm). The accessory cones were then dipped in the Epiphany sealer and condensed using lateral condensation with a finger spreader. Excess Resilon cones were removed with a hot instrument and condensed vertically with a plugger to the level of the canal orifice.</p><p>Postoperative periapical radiographs of the roots samples were taken to ensure that the canals were completely obturated without any voids. All the samples were stored in distilled water for two weeks to allow complete setting of the sealer. After two weeks the root samples were mounted in acrylic resin blocks of 30 mm length and 35 mm diameter to avoid slipping of the sample during force-loading measurements. The apical part of the samples was embedded in acrylic resin blocks leaving 2 mm of the cervical part un-embedded. A pendulum scale was used to ensure vertical alignment of the long axis of the samples during acrylic resin polymerization.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sample holder</title><p>A special sample holder was fabricated from stainless steel. The sample holder consists of two cylindrical screw type bars mounted on the Universal testing machine. The upper bar ends with small ball (3 mm in diameter) directed precisely over the canal orifice of root sample, which imbedded in acrylic resin block seated on the lower bar seat. The sample holder was designed to standardize measurements, to protect acrylic resin blocks from tilting during measurements and to provide good visibility of the sample throughout the measurements.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Force-loading measurements</title><p>The measurements were carried out at room temperature using a computer-controlled, Universal Testing Machine (DARTEC, USA Model Company). The testing machine employs workshop 96, tool kit 96 and data manager software to analyze the measured data and plot the graphs. Acrylic resin blocks were grasped by the lower bar of the sample holder and the ball of the upper bar was directed precisely over the canal orifice. A continuous load was applied along the long axis of the root at cross-head speed of 1.0 mm/min until a fracture sound was indicated by the testing machine [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].

In the presence of an adhesive interface, the higher load to fracture in Resilon-filled roots was expected. Although numerous studies have investigated the reinforcement of weak tooth structure and root canals by using adhesive materials, their reports appear to have conflicting results. In a recent study, Nagas, <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] compared the root reinforcement potential of three different intraorifice barriers (mineral trioxide aggregate, resin-modified glass ionomer, and fiber-reinforced composite) placed over root canals obturated with GP or Resilon. Fracture resistance of roots was significantly improved by the ionomer and composite intraorifice barrier but not by the type of obturation system used. Although these results lend support to the reinforcement through adhesion hypothesis, they may not be comparable to the present study since entire canals were obturated with no barriers and the canals were overtly flared before obturation.</p><p>Other studies including Stuart <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and Grande <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] demonstrated that the flexural properties of both Resilon and GP were too low to reinforce the root canals. The study by Grande <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] in 2007 was carried out on milled dentine samples with constant root canal diameter of 1.3 mm while Stuart <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] used unmodified roots but with a constant diameter or 1.5 mm. Although this may have provided good standardization for a small sample group, the results may not be as applicable for natural root surfaces with continuously tapering canals as used in the current study.</p><p>The results regarding Resilon were in accordance to two previous studies. Teixeira, <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] and Hammad, <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] reported higher mean fracture load values for resin-based obturation groups compared to the GP obturation groups. Although both studies did not use overtly flared canals, the results were similar. The present study adds new evidence that Resilon material increases the resistance to fracture of overtly flared root canals, especially when the canals are shaped by using ProFile 0.06 taper. This could be attributed to the increased bulk of Resilon material in obturated roots.</p><p>Experimental techniques for investigating root fracture have generally involved the generation of force over the obturated canal. Loading force measurements have been shown to be a powerful tool for investigating the mechanical properties of human teeth samples. A number of studies have used vertical loading force measurements to test fracture resistance successfully.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] However, loading force experiments require controlled standards of sample preparation and experimental protocol to get meaningful results. During selection of teeth, some dimensions of the specimens were controlled (e.g., root length and internal diameter and taper). Teeth were as similar as possible and were randomly assigned to groups. Sodium hypochlorite at 1% concentration was used as the irrigant of choice during preparation of the canals because it is the most commonly used irrigant. A low concentration was used to minimize the adverse effect on dentine mechanical properties. The canals were rinsed with EDTA as a final flush according to the manufacturer's instructions because any remaining sodium hypochlorite might inhibit the setting of resin materials. The loading force measurements in this study revealed a significant difference in resistance to fracture among experimental groups (ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). These results suggest that Resilon increased the fracture resistance of endodontically treated roots to internally generated stresses.</p><p>The mean forces at fracture reported vary in previous studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and the mean forces at fracture reported in the study are well within that wide range. The wide range may be because of the type and dimensions of the teeth selected for the study, protocol followed for cleaning and shaping of the roots, and protocol followed for fracture resistance measuring.</p><p>Root canal instrumentation is an essential stage in endodontic treatment. Studies showed that instrumentation alone has been found to significantly weaken roots. It seems logical to remove as little dentine as possible during instrumentation without jeopardizing long-term success. Any material that can compensate for this weakening effect would be useful. It would be advantageous if the root canal obturation, in addition to providing an adequate seal, could contribute to the reduction in the incidence of vertical root fractures. In the current <italic>in vitro</italic> study the Resilon 0.06 taper group (Group 5) behaved similar in resistance to fracture as the unprepared control teeth. Though positive, these results warrant further testing to confirm any root reinforcement capability of Resilon in canals with thin and weak walls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the present study roots obturated with Resilon required a higher loading force to fracture compared to those obturated with GP. Pending further investigation, obturation with Resilon and resin-based sealer may increase the fracture resistance of overtly flared canals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to convey their sincere thanks and gratitude to Dr. D.
