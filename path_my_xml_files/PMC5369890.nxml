The trial was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of The People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

These findings are consistent with those of other studies showing that remifentanil could reduce pain and increase maternal satisfaction.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> In addition, analgesia with remifentanil could also improve the success rate of ECV.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Although several previous studies have reported that analgesia can be effectively used for multiparous women for correcting BP during the period of ECV,<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> no study has focused on the use of remifentanil for pain relief during ECV for BP in nulliparous women at term. Of the previous studies, 1 study found that remifentanil is an effective intervention for reducing pain, achieving successful ECV, and increasing maternal satisfaction during ECV, and is generally well-tolerated without additional adverse effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Another study demonstrated that remifentanil could effectively decrease pain, but found no difference in the success rate of ECV between patients who received remifentanil and those who received placebo.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> A similar result was reported by Burgos and colleagues,<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> although they also found an increased frequency of mild AEs.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>Although several systematic reviews concluded that regional analgesia could significantly enhance the success rate of ECV,<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> controversy still exists because of the different techniques, drugs, and doses used during the procedure of ECV. Of all those factors, dose difference may be the most important. Previous studies found that higher doses could generate a higher degree of motor blockade on the abdominal muscles during ECV, and thus could prevent involuntary abdominal tensing.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, only mild and infrequent AEs were found, which suggests that remifentanil has an acceptable safety profile for pain relief during ECV for BP in nulliparous women at term. The most common AEs were nausea, dizziness, and transient fetal bradycardia, in both groups. No significant differences in any AE were found in both groups.</p><p>Despite revealing the efficacy and safety of remifentanil for ECV in nulliparous women at term, this study still has several limitations. First, this study was conducted only at the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and most of the participants were Uyghur Chinese, which may have an influence on the generalizability of our findings to patients in other hospitals and of other ethnicities. Second, pain relief was evaluated by using the VAS, which is a subjective tool and may be affected by multiple unknown factors. Finally, although all investigators underwent training before this study, the variety of their experience levels may still cause bias in the pain experience of patients and the success rate of ECV.</p><p>The results of this study showed that the administration of remifentanil for ECV in nulliparous women at term could not only achieve pain reduction and enhance maternal satisfaction, but could also facilitate a successful ECV and has few AEs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AEs = adverse events, BP = Breech presentation, ECV = external cephalic version, ITT = intention to treat, VAS = visual analog scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><italic>Authorship</italic>: Z-HW and G-PX conceived of the study, participated in the coordination and design of the study, and wrote the paper.
