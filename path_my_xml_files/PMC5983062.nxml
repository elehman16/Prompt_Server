The trial was carried out in the Republic of Belarus at a time when few mothers breastfed exclusively, and half discontinued breastfeeding completely by 3 months postpartum. Hence a breastfeeding promotion trial provided great potential to increase exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Units of randomization for the study were maternity hospitals and their associated polyclinics. These units were randomly assigned to a control group, consisting of continuation of breastfeeding practices and policies in effect at the time of randomization, or an experimental intervention based on the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative developed by the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund to promote and support breastfeeding, particularly among mothers choosing to initiate breastfeeding.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The trial results are based on 17,046 healthy breastfed infants from 31 units, born at term (&#x02265;37 completed weeks gestation) in 1996/97 and enrolled during their postpartum stay. Trial inclusion criteria required infants to be healthy, singleton, birthweight &#x02265;2.5 kg, Apgar score &#x02265;5 at 5 minutes, and mothers to have initiated breastfeeding and no condition known to impede breastfeeding.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><sec id="s2a"><title>Follow-Up</title><p>The mother-infant pairs were followed up frequently for 12 months from the time of birth.

Each child was seated with the head positioned using chin and forehead rests, with eyes aligned with the eye mark, while observing a nonaccommodative target (red Maltese cross) at 3 m through the viewing window. The accuracy and vertex distance of the instrument were set to the default settings of 0.25 diopters (D) and 12 mm, respectively. Given the use of autorefraction without cycloplegia and the distance of the accommodative target (3 m) we defined myopia as a spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of &#x02212;1.00 D or worse in either eye (using autorefractor measurements in negative cylinder form), which is more conservative compared to definitions used previously with SER of &#x02212;0.50 D or worse.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The maximum positive (least negative) of five readings in each eye was used; cycloplegia was avoided to maximize participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Baseline Covariates</title><p>Data on urban and rural location of polyclinic, maternal age at birth, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal and parental education, child's sex, birthweight, and number of older siblings were recorded from earlier phases of the study.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The parent or guardian provided information on current family size.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Analyses were carried out using statistical software (STATA version 13; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The distributions of covariates in children in the intervention and control groups were compared. The primary outcome was logMAR acuity. However, the distribution of logMAR acuity showed a highly positive skew, heavily truncated at high levels of acuity, which could not be readily transformed to normalize the distribution. Hence, logMAR acuity was dichotomized, with low vision defined as unaided vision of Line 6 (logMAR 0.3, equivalent to Snellen 6/12, 20/40) or worse in either eye.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Other dichotomized outcomes included anisopia, and normal vision (defined above). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for these outcomes were calculated to examine the degree of clustering. The primary intention-to-treat analysis used multiple variable logistic regression to obtain odds ratios for vision outcomes by intervention groups, accounting for clustering of children within clinics (using meqrlogit, multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression). Consistency of effects by sex were examined by multiplicative interaction terms. Secondary analyses additionally adjusted for stratum-level variables (urban versus rural and residence in West versus East Belarus), and for early-life factors (birthweight, birth order, family size) and parental factors (maternal age at birth, maternal and paternal education), which, given the small number of clusters randomized, could theoretically confound the effect estimates observed.</p><p>Comparisons between the intervention and experimental groups were based on children with observed vision outcomes without imputation, owing to the very high participation rates in this cohort. As intention-to-treat analysis systematically underestimates the effect of actual breastfeeding duration and exclusivity on vision outcome, owing to substantial overlap in feeding practices between the randomized groups, we applied instrumental variable methods to account for this overlap.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> We used randomization status as the instrument, since it is independent of any confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship and is related to the outcomes only via its effect on breastfeeding, which we dichotomized as &#x02265;3 vs. &#x0003c;3 months of exclusive breastfeeding. We performed instrumental variable estimation of the low vision dichotomous outcome using probit regression (ivprobit command in STATA) with robust standard error estimation to allow for clustering by hospital. We did not carry out multiple imputation for missing outcome data given the high level of follow-up and lack of vision measurement in earlier phases that we could use to impute vision at 16 years.</p><p>We also used multivariable logistic regression in observational analyses (i.e., disregarding randomization status) to examine the associations of other infant (birthweight, breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, maternal age and smoking at birth), child (sex, number of older/younger siblings) and familial (maternal/paternal education, urban-rural East-West residence) factors with vision outcomes. We also carried out an observational analysis in the sub-set who underwent autorefraction to examine the effect of breast feeding duration and exclusivity on measured myopia (defined as a SER of &#x02212;1.00 D or worse in either eye) and astigmatism (defined as &#x02212;1.00 DC of astigmatism or more in either eye). We categorized durations of any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding as less than 3 months (reference standard), 3 months to less than 6 months, and 6 months or more.

We examined the effect of a breastfeeding promotion intervention on visual development in adolescence; the intervention had a small but nonsignificant beneficial effect on a number of vision outcomes; nor was there any association with breastfeeding duration or exclusivity in observational analyses. In contrast, other observational findings show that factors such as sex, parental education and place of residence have far greater influences on visual outcome in early life, suggesting that early visual development might be more strongly patterned by other (besides infant feeding) potentially modifiable environmental factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Relation to Earlier Studies</title><p>Several previous observational studies have suggested better visual outcomes in infancy and early childhood among children who were breastfed compared to those formula-fed.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> However, not all such studies have been as supportive; some suggest no effect<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> or associations that might be partially or wholly explained by residual confounding.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Our finding of similar levels of low vision amongst children from maternity hospitals and clinics randomized to breastfeeding promotion or continued standard practice suggests that longer duration and more exclusive breastfeeding has little effect in patterning vision outcomes into late childhood.</p><p>An effect of breastfeeding is biologically plausible, given the abundance of n-3 LCPUFAs in breast milk, which are needed for early neurocognitive development.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In utero exposure to LCPUFAs is particularly important in the last trimester of pregnancy.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> This has been hypothesized as the reason why randomized clinical trials of LCPUFA interventions in preterm infants have been more likely to show beneficial effects, compared to interventions in healthy, full-term infants.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> However, beneficial effects that have been observed are modest at best and do not appear to persist.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>The effects of infant feeding in the present study were small and dwarfed by observational findings for other sociodemographic and environmental factors.

The procedure of randomization, which occurred early in life without the mother's choice or knowledge of health outcome, succeeded in achieving two highly comparable groups, wherein intention-to-treat analysis demonstrates the unconfounded effect of a marked difference in exclusive breastfeeding duration (43% vs. 6% exclusively breastfed at 3 months, 7.9% and 0.6% at 6 months) on vision and other health related outcomes.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> High response and participation rates (consistently 80% or above at all follow-up phases)<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> minimize the risk of selection bias in comparisons between intervention groups. The large number of participants improves statistical power to detect a true association, if one exists.</p><p>However, PROBIT is a randomized trial of breastfeeding promotion, with considerable overlap in breastfeeding durations, and hence does not allow experimental comparisons between breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding groups. Such interventions are limited, given that it is infeasible and unethical to randomize healthy infants to different feeding practices. The study population is well-nourished and well-provided with healthcare services and child immunization programs. Hence, the lack of a strong association between intervention groups may not be generalizable to less privileged/well-nourished populations. A further potential limitation is the use of vision cut-offs as a proxy for refractive status, which may have also weakened the presence of any underlying association, if an association truly exists. However, the detection rate of myopia has previously been shown to be reliable in this age group<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and was validated in a large sub-sample who underwent open-field autorefraction (<italic>n</italic> = 963). While cycloplegia was avoided to encourage participation, this may have resulted in overestimation of myopia and underestimation of hyperopia in this study population. However, overestimation of myopia is less likely in older children, and levels of presumed myopia (i.e., low vision) were consistent with recent estimates for white European children of this age: 20.6% (95% CI: 19.0%&#x02013;22.2%) in PROBIT as a whole, and 21.6% (95% CI: 19.1, 24.3%) in the PROBIT subsample with autorefraction versus 16.7% (95% CI: 10.6%&#x02013;24.5%) in white Europeans aged 15 years (although estimates at 16 years are likely to be marginally higher).<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> It is noteworthy that any potential overestimation should be equally represented in both the intervention and control groups and is therefore unlikely to have biased the associations observed.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Moreover, consistency of effects with secondary vision outcomes, including anisopia and normal vision, and with other sociodemographic variables further supports the validity of the methodology used and associated findings. Associations with sociodemographic variables are consistent with earlier findings in differing geographical locations, time periods and study designs, and collectively this accumulation of evidence provides support for causal associations.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An intervention to promote prolonged duration of exclusive breastfeeding has no significant effect on vision, suggesting that modifying infant feeding is unlikely to have an appreciable impact on refractive error amongst well-nourished populations. While urbanicity is environmentally determined, associations with parental education may reflect environmental patterning of visual behavior or genes (or a gene-environment interaction), perhaps elicited by increased education and near-vision activities which are established risk factors for myopia.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-59-7-2670-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, rapid rises in myopia, and the emergence of geographic differences suggest that the environment has an important role to play in determining vision outcome, patterning the development of refractive error into later life.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="iovs-59-06-43_s01"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="iovs-59-06-43_s01.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP-53155); the National Institutes of Health (R01 HD050758); U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Development (K24 HD069408); supported by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) and the University of Bristol (Grant Code: MC_UU_12013/1-9; RMM).
