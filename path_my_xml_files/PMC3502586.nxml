Monitoring MVD by recording the lateral spread response (LSR) intraoperatively can predict a successful clinical outcome. However, the rate of the LSR varies between trials, and the reason for this variation is unclear. The aim of our trial is to evaluate the rate of the LSR after intubation following treatment with succinylcholine, vecuronium, or no muscle relaxant.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>This trial is a prospective randomised controlled trial of 96 patients with HFS (ASA status I or II) undergoing MVD under general anaesthesia. Patients are randomised to receive succinylcholine, vecuronium, or no muscle relaxant before intubation. Intraoperative LSR will be recorded until dural opening. The primary outcome of this study is the rate of the LSR, and the secondary outcomes are post-intubation pharyngolaryngeal symptoms, the rate of difficult intubations, the rate of adverse haemodynamic events and the relationship between the measurement of LSR or not, and clinical success rates at 30&#x02009;days after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aims to evaluate the impact of muscle relaxants on the rate of the LSR, and the study may provide evidence supporting the use of muscle relaxants before intubation in patients with HFS undergoing MVD surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trials registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/">http://www.chictr.org/</ext-link> ChiCTR-TRC-11001504 Date of registration: 24 June, 2011.</p><p>The date the first patient was randomised: 30 September, 2011.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hemifacial spasm</kwd><kwd>Microvascular decompression</kwd><kwd>Muscle relaxant</kwd><kwd>Succinylcholine</kwd><kwd>Vecuronium</kwd><kwd>Intraoperative monitoring</kwd><kwd>Lateral spread response</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Primary hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a disorder that causes frequent involuntary contractions in the muscles on one side of the face, due to a blood vessel compressing the nerve at its root exit zone (REZ) from the brainstem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Numerous prospective and retrospective case series have confirmed the efficacy of microvascular decompression (MVD) of the facial nerve in patients with HFS with low rates of symptom recurrence and transient complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In 1985, M&#x000f8;ller and Jannetta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] showed that in HFS, stimulation of one branch of the facial nerve activates facial muscles innervated by another branch, thereby producing abnormal muscle responses (AMR). These AMR are known as the lateral spread response (LSR) and can be recorded from one muscle innervated by the superior branch of the facial nerve when the inferior branch is stimulated or vice versa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Due to the fact that the LSR disappears instantly in most patients when the offending vessel is moved off the facial nerve, monitoring the AMR can guide the surgeon during MVD, which results in a better post-operative outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although the practical value of the LSR disappearance as a method to evaluate MVD efficacy is still controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], in most cases, LSR monitoring is an effective tool to predict outcome after MVD for HFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration shows the stimulation and recording electrodes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-13-160-1"/></fig><p>However, an accurate estimate of the LSR rate is not yet known; the rate varies from 75% to 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] between trials. Patients without the LSR would not benefit from this technology.</p><p>The reasons why the LSR is not detectable in some patients are unclear. Kong <italic>et al</italic>. hypothesised that the absence of the LSR was associated with the dosage of the muscle relaxant or the insertion site of the needle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; other researchers hypothesised that it was related to a process of denervation-reinnervation caused by preceding botulinum toxin injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, these hypotheses have not yet been verified. While consulting the literature, we found that the muscle relaxants used in the various trials differed, which might be an important factor associated with the LSR rate. In most studies, short-acting muscle relaxants were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Sekula <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] indicated that non-depolarising muscle relaxants should be used. While other studies described that muscle relaxants were used for intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], they did not identify which muscle relaxants were used. Among the studies in the literature, several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] performed the train of four (TOF) test to measure the degree of neuromuscular blockade and maintained the ratio at a level of 0.5 to 0.75.</p><sec><title>Succinylcholine</title><p>Succinylcholine (Sch) is an ultra-short-acting depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA). This agent inhibits the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. At a dose of 1&#x02009;mg/kg, the onset time of Sch is 4&#x02009;seconds; the time to 25% recovery is 10&#x02009;minutes, and the time to 95% recovery is 12 to 15&#x02009;minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Vecuronium</title><p>Vecuronium is an intermediate-acting non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent.

Standard clinical monitoring is performed. After preoxygenation through a face mask for 4&#x02009;min, anaesthesia is induced with propofol (target-controlled infusion (TCI) 4 to 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml), sufentanil 0.3 to 0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/kg, midazolam 2 to 3&#x02009;mg, and either succinylcholine 1 to 1.5&#x02009;mg/kg (G1), vecuronium 0.1&#x02009;mg/kg (G2), or no muscle relaxant (G3). Tracheal intubation is attempted 90&#x02009;s after the administration. Intubation is always performed by an experienced anaesthetist using endotracheal tubes (Lo-Contour; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland) with an internal diameter of 7.0&#x02009;mm for female patients and 7.5&#x02009;mm for male patients. Mechanical ventilation is controlled, with end-tidal carbon dioxide being maintained at 30 to 40&#x02009;mm Hg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Anaesthesia is maintained using total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and sufentanil.</p><p>After intubation, a bipolar subdermal needle electrode is inserted subcutaneously over the zygomatic branches of the facial nerve on the side of HFS with a 0.5 to 1&#x02009;cm spacing. Another bipolar needle electrode is placed in the mentalis muscles for LSR recordings. Electrical stimulation, consisting of square-wave pulses (intensity: 5 to 15&#x02009;mA; duration: 0.2&#x02009;ms) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings, are filtered through a 30&#x02009;Hz to 3&#x02009;kHz band pass (gain: 500&#x02009;mV/division; analysis time: 50&#x02009;ms) (Axon Epoch 2000 Systems, Hauppauge, NY, USA). To avoid nerve fatigue, the LSR is evoked with a 2&#x02009;min interval until dural opening.</p><p>The LSR is defined as the EMG response recorded from the mentalis muscle by electrical stimulation of the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve, usually with a latency of approximately 10&#x02009;ms.</p><p>The secondary outcomes for this study are post-intubation pharyngolaryngeal symptoms, ease of intubation, haemodynamic responses, clinical success rates and its relationship to the measurement of LSR or not at 30&#x02009;days after surgery, as described below:</p><p>1. Post-intubation pharyngolaryngeal symptoms are defined as hoarse or sore throat 24&#x02009;h after extubation. The severity of the complaint is assessed on a 101-point numerical rating scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no discomfort, 100&#x02009;=&#x02009;extreme discomfort).</p><p>2. The rate of difficult intubations is defined as an IDS score &#x0003e;5. The IDS (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) is the sum of the seven following variables: number of tracheal intubation attempts, number of operators who attempted intubation, number of alternative techniques used, glottic exposure (as defined by the Cormack and Lehane classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]), intensity of lifting force (normal or increased) applied during laryngoscopy, necessity for external laryngeal manipulation, and position of the vocal cords (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>3. The rate of adverse haemodynamic events is defined as hypotension and bradycardia and the need to administer ephedrine or atropine.</p><p>4. Clinical success is defined as HFS relief at 30&#x02009;days after surgery.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>IDS Score</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Parameter</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Score</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Number of attempts&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N1<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Number of operators&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N2<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Number of alternative techniques<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N3<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cormack grade<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N4<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lifting force required<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02002;Normal<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N5&#x02009;=&#x02009;0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02002;Increased<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N5&#x02009;=&#x02009;1<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Laryngeal pressure<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02002;Not applied<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N6&#x02009;=&#x02009;0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02002;Applied<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N6&#x02009;=&#x02009;1<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vocal cord mobility<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02002;Abduction<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N7&#x02009;=&#x02009;0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02002;Adduction</td><td align="left">N7&#x02009;=&#x02009;1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>We performed a pilot study of the LSR rate (following the same protocol as the proposed study) before writing the protocol.

We monitor the LSR from intubation to the dural opening, not during the whole surgery. Because the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid also causes a temporary shift in the neurovascular relationship equivalent to decompression, the LSR may disappear after the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].
