Insomnia is related to greater mortality and morbidity, with four times the risk of mortality for sleep times below 300&#x000a0;min. However, insomnia medications are used with caution in COPD due to their potential adverse effects. While cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective for people with primary insomnia and people with other chronic illnesses, the efficacy and mechanisms of action of such a therapy are yet unclear in people with both insomnia and COPD. The purpose of this study is to rigorously test the efficacy of two components of insomnia therapy &#x02013; CBT-I and COPD education (COPD-ED) &#x02013; in people with coexisting insomnia and COPD, and to identify mechanisms responsible for therapy outcomes. The rationale for the proposed study is that once the efficacy and mechanisms of CBT-I and COPD-ED are known, new and innovative approaches for insomnia coexisting with COPD can be developed to non-pharmacologically minimize insomnia and fatigue, thereby leading to longer, higher-quality and more productive lives for people with COPD, and reduced societal cost due to the effects of insomnia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We are conducting a randomized, controlled, parallel-group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;35 each group) comparison of CBT-I, COPD-ED and non-COPD, non-sleep health education Attention Control (AC) using a highly efficient four-group design.

This design will allow completion of the following specific aims: (1) to determine the efficacy of individual treatment components, CBT-I and COPD-ED, on insomnia and fatigue, (2) to define the mechanistic contributors to the outcomes after CBT-I and COPD-ED.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the usual insomnia therapy, namely by testing traditional CBT-I with education to enhance outcomes. The work proposed in aims 1 and 2 will provide systematic evidence of the efficacy and mechanisms of components of a novel approach to insomnia comorbid with COPD. Such results are highly likely to provide new approaches for preventive and therapeutic interventions for insomnia and fatigue in COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01973647">NCT01973647</ext-link>.

Insomnia is related to greater mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with studies showing <italic>four times the mortality risk</italic> for sleep times below 300&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Insomnia also produces morbidity &#x02013; insomnia sufferers generate 75&#x000a0;% greater healthcare costs than individuals without insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Lost productivity from insomnia is estimated at US$63.2 billion annually in the US alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. People with COPD experience debilitating fatigue and a gradual decline in function that are partly related to insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, insomnia medications are used with caution in COPD due to potential respiratory effects, hypoxia and effects on cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Common features of COPD, such as dyspnea, chronic inflammation and emotional arousal (anxiety and depression), also affect insomnia and can interfere with therapy outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), a therapy that provides guidance on changing unhelpful sleep-related beliefs and behavior, is a promising non-pharmacological treatment that has demonstrated effectiveness for insomnia, but the efficacy of components and mechanisms of action of CBT-I have not been thoroughly examined in people with insomnia coexisting with COPD.</p><p>Insomnia is prevalent in people with medical disorders, and therapy for insomnia might improve these medical disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, there are only a limited number of randomized, controlled studies in this area. Although evidence obtained from studies that included participants with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], osteoarthritis, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] support the notion that CBT-I is effective in reducing insomnia when coexisting with chronic illness, no studies to date have examined CBT-I specifically for people with COPD. It is yet undetermined whether improving self-efficacy for the medical illness (i.e., COPD) mediates outcomes after CBT-I, but our preliminary data suggest that education on COPD topics, such as management of dyspnea and COPD exacerbations, may improve self-efficacy and reduce depression, indirectly reducing insomnia and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Our long-term goal is to help develop safe and effective non-pharmacological interventions to minimize insomnia and its consequences in people with COPD. The purpose of this study is to systematically test the efficacy of two components of therapy for people with coexisting insomnia and COPD &#x02013; CBT-I and COPD education (COPD-ED) &#x02013; and to identify the mechanisms responsible for therapeutic outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that both CBT-I and COPD-ED will have positive, lasting effects on objectively and subjectively measured insomnia and fatigue. This hypothesis is consistent with preliminary data from our pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] comparing CBT-I and COPD-ED in people with insomnia coexisting with COPD. The pilot study results demonstrated feasibility of the two components and provided preliminary evidence of positive effects on outcomes, which differed in men and women. Given the prevalence of insomnia and its consequences, it is important not only to identify the most effective approach to minimize insomnia for those with COPD but also to identify the mechanisms responsible for the outcomes, as not all patients will benefit from CBT-I. The rationale for this study is that once the efficacy and mechanisms of CBT-I and COPD-ED are known, new and innovatively tailored interventions can be developed to non-pharmacologically minimize insomnia and fatigue, thereby leading to longer, higher-quality and more productive lives for people with COPD, and reduced societal cost due to the effects of insomnia. The clinical gains could be, unlike those of pharmacotherapy, sustained following treatment discontinuation. We are testing our central hypothesis by completing a randomized, parallel-group, 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design which results in four groups (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;35 each group): CBT-I, COPD-ED, both CBT-I and COPD-ED, and neither [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Results from previous studies of predictors of positive outcomes of CBT-I suggest that mechanisms include changes in sleep-related beliefs, sleep habits, emotional arousal and self-efficacy for sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, our contribution here is expected to be knowledge of the efficacy and mechanisms of the components of a novel insomnia therapy for people with COPD and a detailed understanding of which patients are most likely to benefit from the therapy. This contribution will be significant because it is a necessary step in the development of effective non-pharmacological therapies for insomnia coexisting with COPD. Once such advances in therapy for insomnia coexisting with COPD become available, results can be used to further develop and make available effective and efficient insomnia therapies for people with COPD. Components of therapy found to be most important for positive outcomes can be included in new, more efficient therapies. It is expected that what we learn will be equally applicable to the prevention of insomnia and fatigue in people with COPD, potentially leading to them having longer, higher-quality and more productive lives and to society having to burden lower costs related to insomnia in COPD.</p><p>We are testing components of a novel therapy (CBT-I and COPD-ED) in an understudied population using a highly efficient study design. Despite the established need for such a therapy for people with COPD, this group is understudied, perhaps because of challenges such as recruiting subjects with COPD and managing periodic exacerbations of COPD that could occur during treatment. Furthermore, people with insomnia coexisting with COPD are subject to exacerbations of their illness that predispose them to recurrent insomnia and may interfere with CBT-I outcomes. The research represents a new and substantive departure from the usual insomnia therapy, specifically by combining traditional CBT-I with disease-specific education (COPD-ED) to enhance self-efficacy for the management of COPD. Enhancing self-efficacy for COPD is likely to reduce insomnia and fatigue by attenuating the anxiety and depressed mood associated with the disease.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim 1</title><p>To determine the efficacy of individual treatment components, CBT-I and COPD-ED, on insomnia and fatigue. Our hypothesis is that both components will decrease insomnia and fatigue at the end of the six-session treatment period, and that these differential effects will be sustained for at least 3&#x000a0;months post treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim 2</title><p>To define the mechanistic contributors to the outcomes after CBT-I and COPD-ED. Our hypothesis is that CBT-I and COPD-ED components impact insomnia and fatigue through complementary mechanisms. Positive changes in beliefs about sleep, sleep habits, self-efficacy for management of COPD (SEC) and sleep (SES), and reduced emotional arousal (EA) will mediate the improving conditions in insomnia and fatigue and that gender, inflammation and functional status will moderate the outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods: participants, interventions and outcomes</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conceptual framework</title><p>The conceptual framework (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) for this proposal has its foundations in social learning theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and cognitive behavioral theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which emphasize the interplay of cognitive, behavioral and environmental factors. According to these theories, in order to participate in behavioral change, persons must possess the knowledge, skills and confidence necessary to self-regulate behavior and have a firm belief in their ability to initiate change and change these behaviors. All individuals have personal traits that influence their predisposition to insomnia by impacting the degree to which they are physiologically, emotionally or cognitively hyper-aroused and unable to sleep. In our conceptual framework, COPD-related factors contributing to the illness burden can be predisposing or precipitating factors for insomnia. Cognitive factors, such as dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, emotional arousal such as anxiety and depression, and low self-efficacy for sleep and self-management of COPD, can also contribute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For people with COPD, insomnia is likely to increase symptom burden and affect the ability to function in daily life. The components of our intervention target the factors that contribute to insomnia and promote its chronicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The efficacy of CBT-I on outcomes in COPD is unclear but must be clarified to develop effective non-pharmacological interventions specifically for insomnia coexisting with COPD. Future CBT-I programs will benefit from this information, which will provide guidance on potential components to include in CBT-I.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1334_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p>We are conducting a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial randomized trial where participants are randomized into four groups created by crossing the two factors, CBT-I versus Attention Control (AC)1 and COPD-ED versus AC2 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;35 each group).

The sessions are provided by clinicians trained in CBT-I, COPD-ED and the AC health education. Although the intervention period is relatively brief, we expect that some subjects will miss sessions. Subjects are allowed to make up classes within 2&#x000a0;weeks, for up to two sessions.

The COPD education component (COPD-ED) is modeled after the COPD education program used in a previous study. Briefly, topics include how the lungs work; overview of COPD; managing COPD, including techniques for managing dyspnea; discussion of COPD medications; preventing and coping with exacerbations, flu and colds; and preventing complications of COPD. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the components of the CBT-I and COPD-ED interventions. These topics are presented using brief PowerPoint presentations, discussion and handouts. The CBT-I&#x02009;+&#x02009;COPD-ED intervention is a combination of CBT-I and COPD education. Each intervention session contains a CBT-I segment and a COPD education segment, for a total of approximately 75&#x000a0;min (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Topics include managing insomnia and COPD using strategies known to be effective. The AC intervention is comprised of six sessions of social support and general health education.

Participants respond to one item per tablet computer screen and selection of the next item is guided by the participant&#x02019;s response to a previously administered item.</p><p>The PROMIS Fatigue item bank evaluates a range of mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion. The depression item bank assesses self-reported negative mood, views of self, and social cognition, as well as decreased positive affect and engagement. Somatic symptoms (changes in appetite, sleeping patterns) are not included, which eliminates consideration of these items&#x02019; confounding effects when assessing patients with comorbid physical conditions. The anxiety item bank measures self-reported fear, anxious misery, hyper-arousal, and somatic symptoms related to arousal. The physical function item bank measures self-reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. CAT is appropriate for the adult general population and adults with chronic health conditions. CAT is generic rather than disease-specific and assesses the previous 7&#x000a0;days.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcomes (dependent variables)</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Insomnia</title><p>We objectively assess insomnia using the Actiwatch-2&#x000ae; (MiniMitter, Philips Respironics, Carlsbad, CA, USA) actigraph.

The accelerometer is worn on the non-dominant wrist for a minimum of 4&#x000a0;days at each data collection. Insomnia variables measured include sleep onset latency (SL, minutes to fall asleep after lights out), wake after sleep onset (WASO, minutes spent wake after sleep onset), number of awakenings after sleep onset (NA), total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE, time spent asleep divided by time in bed).</p><p>We subjectively measure insomnia severity using the Sleep Impairment Index (SII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and a sleep diary. The SII includes seven items, each rated on a 5-point scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;extremely) to evaluate: sleep onset severity, sleep maintenance, early morning awakening problems, satisfaction with current sleep, interference with daily functioning, impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and level of distress caused by the sleep problem. Total scores range from 0 to 28, with high scores indicating greater insomnia severity. Validity and reliability were demonstrated in older people with insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A 6-point reduction is recommended to represent a clinically meaningful improvement in individuals with insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The sleep diary is completed by all CBT-I participants in the morning at breakfast time for a 1-week baseline period. Subjects receiving CBT-I complete sleep diaries daily during the six-session intervention period, for 1&#x000a0;week at the end of the intervention; and for 1&#x000a0;week at the 3-month follow-up. The sleep diary is completed by participants not receiving CBT-I for 1&#x000a0;week at baseline; 1&#x000a0;week at the end of the intervention; and 1&#x000a0;week at the 3-month follow-up. Sleep variables as above including SL, WASO, TST, EMA and SE are derived from the diary. Variables are calculated for each night and a weekly mean is computed.

Based on combined data from our pilot study measures, the minimum detectable difference (MDD) for the treatment main effects will be clinically meaningful. For example, we will be able to detect a 2.3-point difference in insomnia severity between those receiving COPD-ED versus those not, averaged across the other treatment conditions. The MDD for other outcomes includes Actiwatch&#x000ae; sleep efficiency&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.72, CRQ-F&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.51, and the Profile of Moods States Fatigue subscale (POMS-F)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.76. Between-group effect size estimates from our pilot study ranged from 0.35 for sleep efficiency to 1.03 for insomnia severity, comparing the proposed treatment components. Path models using 7&#x02013;14 parameters can be estimated according to the sample size convention of 10 to 20 cases per parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], thus, our simple path models can be estimated. We further conservatively estimate an attrition rate of 15&#x000a0;% by the end of the study.

We contact local pulmonologists to recruit subjects through their medical practices. We also use online recruitment strategies such as Research Match. There is a focused recruitment for minorities by placing advertisements in newspapers that serve predominantly the minority communities. Similar techniques are used for women, placing advertisements in publications predominantly read by women. We employ a number of retention strategies that were successfully implemented in our pilot study.</p><p>Subjects are initially contacted by mail or advertisement, which will provide a brief description of the study. Potential subjects are asked to return a &#x0201c;Permission to Contact&#x0201d; form with their phone number so the researcher can contact them about the study. The researcher explains the study and answers questions over the phone. If the caller is interested in pursuing the study further, a preliminary health screening is conducted over the phone to determine their potential eligibility for participation. An information brochure is mailed to the home when callers want time to think before making a decision. They contact us again if they decide to pursue being in the study.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Methods: assignment of interventions</title><p>A randomization schedule was developed using Excel whereby the four treatment groups were randomly ordered in blocks of four and sequentially assigned through REDCap according to stratum. We have four strata defined by sex and COPD severity (two levels); this process is managed separately by site. The complexity of the design (four treatment arms&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;four strata&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;two sites) is assumed to reduce predictability for the sequence of group assignment for any given participant. Non-blinded study staff generate allocation by REDCap and assign participants to interventions. Personnel administering and scoring the PFTs, actigraphy and posttest/follow-up sleep diaries are blinded to group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Methods: data collection, data management and analysis</title><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data collection</title><p>Screening procedures include an initial telephone screening to determine eligibility. Potential subjects are then scheduled for their first screening visit, which takes place at the CNSHR. At that visit, after informed consent is obtained, PFTs are performed, followed by questionnaires. Reliability and validity of pulmonary function testing have been previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] is administered to screen for major depressive symptoms. The HADS was designed for outpatients with medical illnesses, and it has been widely used in people with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].

A cutoff score of 11 on the HADS depression subscale is used for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. A clinical questionnaire is completed at this visit to characterize the sample in terms of demographics and health history. Blood specimens are sent to Quest Diagnostics&#x000ae; for measurement of C-reactive protein and ferritin level. These tests are done in order to rule out anemia and to adequately describe the sample and may be used as covariates in the analyses.</p><p>The screening includes a one-night sleep study at home or at the UIC Sleep Science Center or the Hines VA Sleep Laboratory. The sleep study is used to screen potential subjects for sleep apnea, and low SaO<sub>2</sub> during the night. Objective evidence of any primary sleep disorder according to standard clinical criteria is used to exclude subjects. The remaining subjects receive instructions for continued actigraphy monitoring by wearing an actigraph on their non-dominant wrist at home for a total of 1&#x000a0;week. They are instructed on how to complete the daily sleep diary.</p><p>Excluding the screening, participants have a total of eight or nine laboratory visits (six intervention, pretest, posttest and follow-up). The 3-month follow-up is completed at home or in the laboratory. After the 1-week at-home monitoring period, they are scheduled for the baseline (pretest) visit at either the UIC CON Center for Narcolepsy, Sleep and Health Research (CNSHR) or the Hines VA. Upon completion of the baseline testing, subjects are randomly assigned to group. Subjects recruited from the Hines VA attend the six intervention visits there. Subjects recruited from outside of the VA attend the six intervention visits at the UIC CNSHR. For the 3-month follow-up, subjects either come to UIC or Hines VA for a final visit or they are mailed a packet containing an actigraph, questionnaires and a self-addressed, stamped return envelope. We track attendance using attendance records and the sleep diary. All tests are performed in the same order for each subject. Tests and questionnaires are administered in a private, comfortable room. We make every attempt to minimize selection and performance bias, attrition and missing data. Selection bias is minimized by use of the randomized controlled trial design. Staff performing data analysis are blinded to group assignment. We use strategies to reduce attrition such as good communication between research staff and participants, minimizing participant burden by the use of PROMIS CAT instruments, and monetary incentives. When subjects do not complete the study, we document the reasons data are missing in order to evaluate the missing data using justified assumptions.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Enactment and fidelity</title><p>The clinician interventionalists are trained in CBT-I, COPD-ED, CBT-I&#x02009;+&#x02009;COPD-ED, and the AC education topics by experts. They observe several sessions being conducted by a clinician experienced in the interventions and practice the interventions under supervision. They use a manual developed during the pilot research to guide the sessions. In order to assure high-quality sessions, samples are reviewed and scored for adherence to the protocol. Subject adherence is also tracked. Adherence to stimulus control and sleep restriction is assessed at each session using the sleep diary and/or actigraph. Evaluation of adherence to stimulus control is assessed by examining responses to a sleep diary question that asks how the participant managed periods awake during the night. Evaluation of adherence to sleep restriction is assessed by comparing the recommended time in bed to the reported time in bed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data management</title><p>Data are entered onto a REDCap application and stored on a secure server with daily back-ups.

Necessary transformation and imputations are conducted based on the raw data distribution. Baseline adjustment for covariates (e.g., age, COPD severity (PFT), and gender) will be incorporated into the main effect analyses to reduce error variance and improve statistical power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Data analyses is performed using SAS 9.3 statistical software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Mplus 6.0 (Muth&#x000e9;n &#x00026; Muth&#x000e9;n, Los Angeles, CA, USA). All tests will be two-sided and an error rate of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The test of each specific aim is described below, and all statistical analysis will employ an intent-to-treat approach. A fully specified statistical analysis plan will be written before unmasking.</p><p>Aim 1: to determine the efficacy of individual treatment components, CBT-I and COPD-ED, on insomnia and fatigue. In this 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 design, participants are randomized into four groups created by crossing the two factors, CBT-I versus AC1 and COPD-ED versus AC2 (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We hypothesize that both components will improve insomnia and decrease fatigue following the six-session program, and that participants will maintain these gains at 3&#x000a0;months post intervention. Our factorial design permits the test of an interaction between the two treatment components, and we will assess for the presence of a strong interaction effect. However, we do not anticipate a strong synergy of the treatments since our pilot work showed that both had within-group improvement, and the hypothesized mechanisms for change differ. If the interaction is negligible, we will proceed with the interpretation of averaged main effects as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The statistical tests for both components will be more robust than tests against a simple control condition because they are averaged across the levels of the other treatment. That is, the effect of each component will be tested controlling for the effect of the other. This is an efficient design because all subjects will be used to test both components. Finally, it may be more acceptable to participants since all receive supportive contact and only one out of four conditions does not receive a component hypothesized as an active treatment for insomnia in COPD patients. We will employ mixed-effects models using insomnia and fatigue as time-varying dependent variables and treatment groups as fixed effects. Demographic and clinical characteristics will be entered as time-invariant covariates if baseline group differences are observed despite randomization. Individuals&#x02019; baseline sleep measures and change over time (i.e., intercept and slope) will be modeled as random effects. The null hypothesis will be rejected if a significant treatment&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;time interaction is observed. For example, a significant CBT-I&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;time effect in the hypothesized direction would mean that participants receiving CBT-I improved more than those who did not, averaged across the other conditions. The mixed models will be run using PROC MIXED SAS 9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and estimated by residual maximum likelihood (REML). Covariance pattern structures (compound symmetry and unstructured) will also be examined, and models will be compared using likelihood ratio tests or Akaike&#x02019;s Information Criteria (AIC) which is a function of the log likelihood and can be compared across models.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study design</th><th>CBT-I</th><th>AC1</th><th>Main effect COPD-ED</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>COPD-ED</td><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>AC2</td><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Main effect CBT-I</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

We hypothesize that CBT-I and COPD-ED components impact insomnia and fatigue through complementary mechanisms. We have previously shown that CBT-I was related to beliefs about sleep, sleep habits, self-efficacy for sleep, and that COPD-ED was related to management of COPD and emotional arousal, thus making them both appropriate candidates for an insomnia treatment approach for COPD patients. We will employ path analysis to test the conceptual model illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The model will test whether each treatment component is related to change in the hypothesized mediator, and whether that change is associated with improvement in the outcome. Direct and indirect treatment effects will be estimated. We will conduct path analyses as follows: (1) specification, (2) identification, (3) estimation, (4) testing of fit, and (5) respecification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Potential moderators suggested by our previous work include gender, initial insomnia and fatigue severity, and inflammation and will be tested as interactions of the effect of each treatment component on the outcomes. Variables found to be a significant moderator of treatment will be tested further to determine if the effect is due to a moderated impact on significant mediator variables. Path models assume that variables used to describe relationships are manifest variables and measured without error. While we recognize that it would be preferable to estimate a measurement model, the feasible sample size for this study precludes more complex modeling. Thus, we acknowledge this limitation and will restrict path analysis to reliably measured variables, that is, with internal consistency of 0.80 or higher. Mplus (version 6) will be used to estimate the path models. The root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) and Bentler&#x02019;s Comparative Fit Index (CFI) will be reviewed to assess model fit. An adequate fit of the data to the model is indicated by a RMSEA value less than 0.08 and a CFI greater than 0.90.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Missing data</title><p>For missing data, we will determine whether missing data are MCAR (missing completely at random), MAR (missing at random), or NMAR (not missing at random).

If NMAR, we will use the &#x0201c;pattern mixture&#x0201d; approach to compute a &#x0201c;weighted average&#x0201d; of the parameters associated with the missing data to estimate treatment effects.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="Sec33"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study protocol is approved by the Institutional Review Board Office for the Protection of Research Subjects of the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Institutional Review Board of the Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital.
