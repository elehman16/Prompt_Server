Although the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is the preferred approach for superiority trials, its role in non-inferiority trials is still under debate. This has led to the use of alternative approaches such as the per-protocol (PP) analysis or the as-treated (AT) analysis, despite the inherent biases of such approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using simulations, we investigate the effect of 2%, 5% and 10% random and non-random crossovers prior to radiotherapy initiation on the ITT, PP, AT and the combination of ITT and PP analyses with respect to type I error in trials with time-to-event outcomes. We also evaluate bias and SE of the estimates from the ITT, PP and AT approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The AT approach had the best performance in terms of type I error, but was anticonservative as non-random crossover increased. The ITT and PP approaches were anticonservative under all percentages of random and non-random crossover. Similarly, lowest bias was seen with the AT approach; however, bias increased as the percentage of non-random crossover increased. The ITT and PP had poor performance in terms of bias as crossovers increased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>If minimal crossovers were to occur, we have shown that the AT approach has the lowest type I error rates and smallest opportunity for bias. Results of trials with a high number of crossovers should be interpreted with caution, especially when crossover is non-random. Attempts to prevent crossovers should be maximised.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>STATISTICS &#x00026; RESEARCH METHODS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Using simulations, we investigated the effect of crossovers on various analysis populations in non-inferiority trials with time-to-event outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We considered random and non-random crossovers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Simulations were limited to clinically plausible non-inferiority trials of radiotherapy in women with early stage breast cancer.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adjustment of baseline covariates was not considered in the analysis.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The non-inferiority randomised trial design is frequently used to compare novel experimental breast radiation regimens with standard breast irradiation for the prevention of local recurrence in patients with breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. For example, hypofractionated radiotherapy that delivers a high dose of radiation per fraction and therefore requires a shorter duration of treatment resulting in greater convenience for the patient is often compared with standard radiotherapy using a non-inferiority design.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> The challenges in the design, conduct and analysis of such trials have been discussed by several authors.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref> These include the determination of the non-inferiority margin and issues related to assay sensitivity, biocreep and the choice of the analysis population.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;14</xref></p><p>Typically, in breast cancer radiotherapy trials, prior to beginning treatment, the patient undergoes a planning process to establish the treatment fields to target the tumour and avoid radiating normal tissue. Such planning generally occurs after randomisation. Sometimes, planning may reveal that it is not possible to deliver the experimental regimen, and therefore the patient is treated with standard therapy. In some cases, after being randomised to experimental radiotherapy, the patient decides to be treated with standard radiotherapy instead. In a trial of 1234 women comparing hypofractionated radiotherapy with standard radiotherapy for the prevention of local recurrence, the crossover percentage was 1.2%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Generally, in trials evaluating new experimental radiotherapy techniques (that are not currently available as part of usual care), patients are not permitted to cross over from standard therapy to experimental therapy.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In randomised superiority trials, it is well established that the analysis should be performed based on the <italic>intention-to-treat</italic> (ITT) principle&#x02014;which states that patients are analysed according to the group they were randomised to regardless of the treatment they received. An ITT analysis tends to produce diluted treatment effect estimates and therefore is considered a conservative approach in analysis of superiority trials, but is anticonservative in demonstrating non-inferiority.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This has led to the use of a <italic>per-protocol</italic> (PP) analysis where the analysis set comprises only patients who fully comply with their assigned treatment,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or an <italic>as-treated</italic> (AT) analysis which groups patients according to the treatment they actually received,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> despite the inherent bias of such analyses.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Several researchers have investigated the effect of non-compliance on the ITT and PP analyses in non-inferiority trials with binary or continuous outcomes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref> This research has focused mainly on issues such as dropouts, missing data and treatment discontinuations. Literature on the effect of crossover bias in non-inferiority trials is limited. Sheng and Kim<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> showed that both the ITT and PP can be biased in trials with binary outcomes. Matsuyama<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> studied the effect of crossovers to the other treatment after initiating the assigned treatment in the time-to-event situation, and suggested that the PP analysis should not be used. Similarly, others have studied the effect of switching treatments mid-trial (ie, after receiving at least some of their original allocated treatment) in the context of superiority trials.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;29</xref> However, the effect of crossovers prior to treatment initiation such as in radiotherapy trials is unknown.</p><p>Some authors have suggested performing the analysis using the ITT and PP populations, and that non-inferiority should only be concluded if the null hypothesis is rejected using both analyses.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products Points-to-Consider states that &#x02018;&#x02026; similar conclusions from both the ITT and PP are required in a non-inferiority trial&#x02019;.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, this has not been investigated comprehensively for trials with time-to-event outcomes with crossovers.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on non-inferiority trials of radiotherapy with a time-to-event outcome in patients with early stage breast cancer. Using simulation, we investigate the effect of patient crossover from the experimental to standard therapy (prior to initiation assigned therapy) on the analysis using the ITT, PP and AT and the combination of ITT and PP analysis sets with respect to type I error, bias and SEs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Intention-to-treat</title><p>The ITT approach uses all patients who were randomised to the study and analyses them according to their assigned treatment group regardless of whether they actually received or complied with the treatment. This is advantageous because it preserves the integrity of randomisation and therefore ensures that, on average, the treatment groups are comparable. In addition, since it includes all patients, it helps prevent bias which may occur when excluding patients.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, the ITT approach will produce results that are likely to be observed in the clinic.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use also states: &#x0201c;however, in an equivalence or non-inferiority trial use of the full analysis set (ITT) is generally not conservative and its role should be considered very carefully&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Per-protocol</title><p>The PP approach excludes patients who have not completed their assigned treatment based on the study protocol.

<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We considered two non-inferiority trials with a 5-year local recurrence rate of 5%, a one-sided &#x003b1;=0.025, 90% power, 4&#x02005;years of accrual and an additional 3&#x02005;years of follow-up.

Enrolment times were generated using the uniform distribution from 0 to 4 corresponding to 4&#x02005;years of accrual. Patients were censored at the end of the trial if they remained event-free at that time.</p><p>We evaluated scenarios where the percentage of patients who crossed over from experimental to standard therapy was 2%, 5% and 10%. For each of these, we considered the following situations: (1) the crossover of patients was random, and (b) the high-risk patients were more likely to cross over (ie, non-random). This was simulated assuming that 50% of the crossover patients were high-risk patients.</p><p>For each approach, computation of the 100(1&#x02013;2&#x003b1;) CI of the estimated HR, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014006531ileq8.jpg"/></inline-formula>, was performed using the Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH) model with &#x003b1;=0.025. We carried out 10&#x02005;000 replications for each trial giving an SE of the estimate of type I error of 0.15%. The one-sided type I error was calculated as the proportion of trials that had the null hypothesis of inferiority rejected, that is, the proportion of trials in which the upper CI was less than M.

In such situations, the ideal population for the final analysis is unclear. We evaluated the performance of the ITT, PP, AT and combined ITT+PP approach under various crossover scenarios.</p><p>The AT approach had the best performance under all scenarios in terms of type I error rate. However, it can only be recommended for situations where the crossover is random. Patients who crossed over had their hazard of outcome determined by that of the standard group, and were analysed accordingly by the AT approach. Considering this and the fact that the crossover was random, it is not surprising that the AT approach had near nominal type I error rates under these situations.</p><p>Moreover, the combined ITT+PP approach performed better than the ITT and PP approaches separately. This is due to the fact that the ITT+PP approach requires both analyses to reject the null hypothesis prior to non-inferiority being concluded, hence adding an extra level of testing compared to individual ITT and PP approaches, and therefore making it <italic>harder</italic> to conclude non-inferiority. Interestingly, neither the ITT nor the PP approach can be recommended under simulated scenarios, adding to the literature that both approaches could provide increased erroneous results.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>We also observed that the AT approach had the lowest bias of the HR estimate across all crossover percentages. Moreover, the biases of the ITT and PP approaches were comparable across all scenarios. For all three approaches, the bias is in the negative direction, and generally increases as the crossover percentage increases, except for the AT approach under the random crossover scenarios where it is not affected by the percentage crossover. Reasons for this observation are similar to that of its performance in terms of type I error under the same scenarios.</p><p>The biases for all methods are larger in scenarios where the true HR is larger because this reflects a greater hazard of events in the experimental arm. Therefore, the crossover patients have a greater impact on the estimated HR, driving it closer to the null than in situations where the true HR is smaller.</p><p>Since the assessment of non-inferiority is based on the CI approach, a combination of greater bias in the negative direction and smaller SEs would yield a lower upper limit of the 95% CI, which is more likely to fall within the non-inferiority margin. Therefore, it is no coincidence that in general the scenarios with the greater bias and smaller SEs corresponded to the scenarios with larger type I error rates. We observed that within each approach, the SEs were comparable for random and non-random crossovers, but the bias was larger for non-random crossover, suggesting that the bias had a greater influence on the type I error rate when comparing non-random versus random crossover within each method.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. The generalisability of our findings may be limited since we studied trials with event rates that are pertinent to radiotherapy trials in patients with early stage breast cancer. However, our methodology and results can be applied to other clinical settings where crossovers occur prior to initiation of treatment. In diseases where the event rates differ from the ones evaluated in this research, further simulations would be required to evaluate these approaches. For simplicity, we assumed that non-random crossover was based on a single covariate. However, non-random crossover can occur for several reasons and, depending on the reason the for crossover, the hazards may also differ. We did not consider adjusting for baseline covariates in the analysis, which may improve the estimation of the treatment effect. However, this is less likely in large RCTs. We did not evaluate the causal proportional hazards estimator<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> because it is not readily available in standard statistical software. Other complex methods based on the counterfactual framework, such as the randomised-based analysis which employs <italic>g-estimation</italic> methods, were also not evaluated.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>The choice of analysis population for non-inferiority trials is a difficult issue. We have shown that the AT approach preserves type I error under scenarios of random crossover. However, it is difficult to prove that crossover is random, and therefore assuming a random crossover may not be appropriate leading to concerns about the validity of the inference test. Moreover, the PP approach, which excludes patients, is likely to disturb the prognostic balance achieved by randomisation, which can also cause erroneous trial results. The advantage of the ITT approach is that it preserves the advantages of randomisation and mirrors what will happen in practice, and therefore is pragmatic. On the other hand, it can be anticonservative in situations where crossover is high. In our experience, the crossover percentage in radiotherapy trials in patients with early stage breast cancer is less than 2%, and we have shown that the AT and combined ITT+PP approaches are better at handling crossovers than the ITT and PP approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The design, conduct and analysis of non-inferiority trials should be performed with extra rigour and to the highest standards. Attempts to prevent crossovers and other protocol deviations such as dropouts and losses to follow-up should be maximised. If a minimal percentage of crossovers were to occur, we have shown that the AT approach had the lowest type I error rates and smallest bias. A sensitivity analysis using the combined ITT+PP approach may also be warranted. In addition, both the ITT and PP results should be reported with details of the patients who crossed over.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e206" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006531.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e207" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006531.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SP, JAJ, CG, LT, TJW and MNL conceived the study.
