An open-label companion study examined the efficacy and safety of DD in 36 patients with skin biopsies containing &#x0003c;&#x02009;20% CD25 cells by immunohistochemistry staining (CD25 low expression). Patients received DD 18 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/day for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks for up to eight courses. The primary endpoint, overall response rate, was 30.6% (95% confidence interval: 16.3, 48.1), 33.3% for stage IIA or lower disease, and 26.7% for stage IIB or greater disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was &#x0003e;&#x02009;487 days, and median time to treatment failure was 68.5 days. No difference in PFS by disease stage was observed. The safety profile of DD in CD25 low-expression disease was similar to that in CD25+ disease. These findings suggest that CD25 low expression does not preclude a meaningful clinical response to DD in patients with CTCL.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Denileukin diftitox</kwd><kwd>antigens</kwd><kwd>CD25</kwd><kwd>mycosis fungoides</kwd><kwd>S&#x000e9;zary syndrome</kwd><kwd>cutaneous T-cell lymphoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="ss1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are characterized by the accumulation of malignant T lymphocytes in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. The most common variants are mycosis fungoides (MF), featuring characteristic skin patches, plaques and tumors, and S&#x000e9;zary syndrome (SS), a leukemic variant featuring diffuse erythroderma with circulating malignant lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. Approximately 50% of all cases of MF/SS express the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, with high expression correlated with advanced-stage disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Depending on the presence of three subunits &#x02013; alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and gamma (CD13) &#x02013; the affinity of the human IL-2 receptor is defined as low (CD25+ only), intermediate (CD122+/CD132+) or high (CD25+/CD122+/CD132+) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Both the intermediate- and high-affinity receptors cause internalization and signal transduction, whereas the low-affinity receptor does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>].</p><p>Denileukin diftitox (DD; Ontak; Eisai Inc., Woodcliff Lake, NJ) is a genetically engineered fusion protein designed to target malignant or activated T cells based on their expression of the IL-2 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. It combines the cytotoxic and membrane-translocating domains of the diphtheria toxin with human IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. Denileukin diftitox is approved in the USA for patients with relapsed CTCL that expresses CD25 on at least 20% of T cells in skin lesions analyzed by IHC (CD25+ disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. The availability of antibodies to the CD25 subunit, the expression of CD25 in higher quantities on cells than the CD122 subunit, and the inability of CD132 to be used as a selective marker (as it is a common subunit for many cytokine cell surface receptors) led to the use of CD25 screening as a tool for identifying patients who might respond to DD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Based on IHC expression, patients with CD25+ skin lesions were assumed to express the high-affinity IL-2 receptor necessary for a response to DD, whereas patients with skin lesions exhibiting less than 20% CD25 expression (CD25 low-expression disease) were presumed to be unresponsive to DD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. This assumption may be incorrect for a number of reasons. First, the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor (CD122+/CD132+) can still cause internalization and signal transduction despite not expressing CD25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. Second, the 20% cut-off for CD25 expression is arbitrary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Third, the IHC assay is technically challenging and results can vary substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Finally, CD25 expression can be variable at different tumor sites within the same patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>].</p><p>Following an early case report of a response to DD in a patient with refractory CTCL (peripheral T cell lymphoma variant) and 50% CD25 positivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>], a study of CD25 expression and response was published. In this study, patients with CD25 low expression (&#x0003c;20%) demonstrated a 20% response rate to DD compared with a 79% response rate in patients with CD25+ disease (<italic>p</italic> =&#x02009;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Moreover, there was marked discordance in CD25 expression results between the reference laboratory (using fresh, frozen biopsies) and a local laboratory (using paraffin-embedded fixed tissue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Questions remain as to whether DD should be restricted to patients with CD25+ disease. The insensitivity of the IHC assay to detect CD25 expression in skin biopsies suggests that it is an inadequate screening tool for excluding patients with CD25 low-expression lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that, in the absence of the CD25 subunit, high levels of the other subunits can result in sufficient binding of DD to achieve cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>].</p><p>In a pivotal phase III trial (93-04-10) of two doses of DD (9 vs. 18 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/day), an objective response of 30% was reported in 71 patients with stage IB&#x02013;IVA CTCL (MF Cooperative Group staging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]) and CD25+ disease based on representative skin biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>].

Efficacy assessments were performed every 4 weeks for 12 months and every 3 months thereafter. Assessment of response was based on the percentage change in tumor burden at each study visit relative to baseline based on a global score of skin and, where applicable, lymph node and blood involvement. For patients with skin lesions involving more than 10% of the body surface area (BSA), all skin lesions were measured and multiplied by a weighting factor (1 for patch lesions, 2 for plaque lesions and 4 for tumors) to document disease extent in accordance with the severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]). For patients with 10% or less BSA involvement, the sum of the areas of up to five representative skin lesions was determined and weighted for severity. Photography also was used to document the extent of skin disease. For patients with skin lesions and at least 20% abnormal peripheral lymphocytes at baseline, levels of circulating abnormal peripheral lymphocytes (CD3+/CD4+/CD7&#x02212;), as calculated by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, were determined monthly from baseline. Computed tomography was performed at baseline to document visceral disease and baseline lymph node involvement. The percentage change from baseline in tumor burden was based on the average percentage changes in skin lesions weighted for severity and on levels of abnormal peripheral lymphocytes. Patients with lymph nodes at baseline who developed biopsy-proven lymph node histology stage of LN3 or higher, indicating PD or relapse, had the biperpendicular diameters of up to five representative nodes assessed by palpation or, in the case of an objective response, by computed tomography scan. The change in the sum of the biperpendicular diameters from baseline was used to assess tumor burden. The average of the sum of the percentage change from baseline in skin score and, if relevant, the change in node and/or blood score was used to determine overall change in tumor burden and, hence, response.</p></sec><sec id="ss7"><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>Response was determined at each disease assessment time point and compared with baseline. The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR, defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR; no clinical evidence of disease based on tumor burden assessments and photography corroboration with biopsy-confirmed absence of atypical cells by histopathology), clinical CR (CCR; no clinical evidence of disease based on tumor burden assessments and photography corroboration with either biopsy-confirmed presence of atypical cells by histopathology or no histopathology available) or partial response (PR; &#x02265;&#x02009;50% reduction in measured tumor burden, but without meeting the criteria for CR or CCR). PD was defined as a 25% or greater increase in measured tumor burden compared with baseline, appearance of a new skin tumor lesion, appearance of newly involved lymph nodes (histology of LN3 or greater) or development of visceral disease. Stable disease was defined as an insufficient change in tumor burden to qualify for CR, CCR, PR or PD.</p><p>Each patient's response status at each study visit was to be reviewed by a Data Endpoint Review Committee (DERC) comprising CTCL experts who did not participate in the study.

In the placebo-controlled trial (L4389-11), an ORR of 49.1% was reported in patients with CD25+ disease who received DD 18 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Of note, the placebo group in this trial had an ORR of 16%, and there was no difference between early- and advanced-stage disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. In another study, response rates of 78.5% and 20% were reported for CD25+ patients and for patients with CD25 low-expression disease, respectively, who were receiving DD 18 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Thus, not unexpectedly, response rates in our analysis of patients with CD25 low-expression disease appear to be lower than those reported in patients with CD25+ disease. These response data with DD are comparable to those observed with other available treatments, including the oral selective retinoid bexarotene, with a 45% response rate reported in patients with advanced CTCL who were refractory to at least one prior therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]; the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat, with a 30% response rate reported in patients refractory to two prior therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]; and the histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin, with a 34% response rate reported in patients refractory to at least one prior therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>].</p><p>Median PFS was not reached at the time of the last data point and, therefore, was not estimable for either the CD25 low-expression group or the comparable DD group in the placebo-controlled trial (L4389-11). However, PFS at 200 days was approximately 50% in the CD25 low-expression group compared with approximately 70% in the placebo-controlled trial. While the outcome with CD25 low-expression patients was somewhat less favorable, a substantial proportion of these patients gained a meaningful clinical benefit, with an estimated median duration of response of 340 days (&#x0003e;11 months). In addition, both patient-reported and physician-reported benefits to patients were associated with documented responses to DD.</p><p>These outcomes suggest that screening patients by IHC for CD25 by a reference laboratory does not predict who will respond to DD. In this scenario, the IHC screening assay appears to be intrinsically insensitive or unreliable, suggesting that levels of CD25 expression might be misinterpreted in some patients. For example, in the pivotal phase III trial (93-04-10), 58% of all skin samples of patients with MF/SS screened for inclusion in the study were CD25+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. However, results from multiple biopsies taken from different anatomic sites on different days from the same patients showed variable results, with 14 of 32 (44%) patients having conflicting results regarding CD25 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Another study found a poor correlation between the reference laboratory and a local laboratory when patients&#x02019; biopsies were divided into two, with one half sent to each laboratory and assessed for CD25 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>].</p><p>Whether this variability is biologic or secondary to the inherent insensitivity of the screening assay is unclear. A study assessing the immunophenotype of T-cell tumors simultaneously sampled at different sites found that CD25 expression was highly variable, suggesting that biology accounts for at least some of this variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. CD25 was expressed most intensely by lymphoma cells in the epidermis and peripheral blood. Moderate CD25 intensity was found in tumor cells within the dermis and lymph node sinusoids. The lowest levels of CD25 intensity were found in tumor cells in the lymph node parenchyma. Moreover, when IL-2 antibody titers were assessed (as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]), CD25 low expression did not affect anti-IL-2 antibody titers (data not shown). Similarly, CD25 receptor status did not influence the anti-denileukin diftitox antibody.</p><p>In the open-label study reported here (L4389-14), the highest tested dose (18 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/day) of DD from the initial pivotal trial (93-04-10) was used because, in earlier studies, this dose showed a numerically higher documented response rate (36%) with tolerable AEs, compared with the response rate with 9 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/day (23%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. However, this difference did not reach significance, possibly owing to the small sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. In the present study (L4389-14), DD 18 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ kg/day had an acceptable safety profile in patients with CD25 low-expression disease, consistent with other studies of DD. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, were reversible, and declined notably after the initial 2&#x02013;3 courses of DD. Moderately severe or severe capillary leak syndrome occurred in two of 36 (5.6%) patients, but was monitored and managed with limited or no interruption of DD treatment. Denileukin diftitox did not appear to be immunosuppressive. The incidence of all AEs, including infections, did not increase in frequency with continued DD exposure.</p><p>The results from this study demonstrate that documented responses with DD are achievable and durable for patients with MF/SS who express CD25 on less than 20% of tumor tissue T cells, and highlight the need for better biomarkers that can predict the response to DD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Kara Nyberg, PhD, of Sui Generis Health and Yvonne E.
