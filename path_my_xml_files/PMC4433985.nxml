training (TRT) based on visual biofeedback (VB) on the upper extremity (UE) function of
hemiplegic subjects. [Subjects and Methods] Forty subjects between six and eighteen months
post-stroke were enrolled in this study. They were randomly allocated to an experimental
group (EG, n=20) and a control group (CG, n=20). All subjects received an hour of routine
therapy for stroke three times a week for four weeks. Subjects in EG received additional
spatial TRT based on VB using a 2-dimensional motion capture analysis system. Both groups
were tested at pre and post-intervention. The motor function of each subject&#x02019;s UE was
assessed using the Fugl-Meyer (FM) test of UE and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). The
reaching speed, angle and maximum reach distance were recorded using the motion capture
analysis system. The experimental data were analyzed using the paired and independent
t-tests. [Results] The mean change scores of the FM Test of UE and WMFT show there was
significantly more improvement at post-intervention in EG than in CG. Also, the speed and
angle reached showed significantly more increase in the EG compared with the CG.
[Conclusions] The findings indicate that UE motor recovery of hemiplegic stroke patients
can be enhanced through the use of TRT based on VB.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Target reaching training</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity function</kwd><kwd>Visual biofeedback</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Most patients who survive a stroke experience persistent impairment of upper extremity (UE)
movement<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. UE paresis post-stroke is a
leading cause of serious long-term disability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cirstea and Levin<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that abnormal post-stroke UE movements contribute to pain,
joint contracture and discomfort, which may lead to limb disuse and impede long-term
functional recovery. Furthermore, reduced UE function affects stroke victims&#x02019; ability to
perform activities of daily living<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>,
reduces their independence, and increases the burden of care for caregivers. Following
stroke, victims manifest a complex pattern of UE motor impairments resulting in loss of
functional abilities, such as reaching<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the development and refinement of rehabilitation strategies post-stroke have the
potential to improve stroke patients&#x02019; function as well as decrease the burden on caregivers
and on the health care system.</p><p>Various rehabilitation approaches have been used to improve skill reacquisition of the
impaired arm<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. New therapeutic strategies
are under investigation in an effort to improve the functional outcomes for UE, including
abduction and flexion training<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, robotics<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, constraint induced movement therapy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and electrotherapeutics<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these,
task-related reaching training (TRT), practice of goal-directed functional movements in a
natural environment, has recently become a common rehabilitation approach that addresses
these goals. TRT involves a variety of practice to help the individual develop optimal
control strategies for solving motor problems<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. For UE function, a case study of hemiparetic patients using a
variant of TRT found improvement in clinical outcome measures. Furthermore, previous studies
involving serial positron emission tomography found that TRT elicits brain plasticity in
stroke patients<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, TRT is expected to promote the recovery of reaching in
hemiparetic subjects.</p><p>Feedback movements are controlled via online sensory feedback that is used to correct
ongoing movement<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Biofeedback has been
applied to many aspects of stroke rehabilitation, with mixed results. This is largely due to
the varying modalities, differences among study designs, and methods of measuring success
and progress<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Ottawa Panel
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for post-stroke rehabilitation recommends
biofeedback for the management of several conditions post-stroke<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. One benefit of using biofeedback in stroke rehabilitation
is that it can give the patient and practitioner access to information about physiological
functioning in various domains that might otherwise be too subtle to detect or too
subjective to accurately assess and consciously manipulate through visual or auditory
feedback. Especially, visual biofeedback (VB) has been adopted in various fields as a motor
learning method for acquiring and enhancing motor skills<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. A meta-analysis of biofeedback concluded the use of VB for the
rehabilitation of UE mobility is appropriate<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Only a few investigators have used TRT combined with simultaneous VB. There is also some
controversy about its functional effects on UE of hemiparetic patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to determine the effect of spatial TRT based on VB on UE function
of hemiparetic patients. In this study we examined the effect of clinical evaluation and
kinematic analysis, in order to explore the possibility of detecting whether functional
improvement is accompanied by a change in motor control during the spatial TRT process based
on VB. Assessments were made using the Fugl-Meyer (FM) test of UE, the Wolf Motor Function
Test (WMFT), and a 2-D motion capture analysis system to measure the reaching speed (m/s),
range of angular shoulder movement (deg), and maximum reach distance (mm).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis were recruited from a stroke rehabilitation
institute for this study. All procedures used in this study were approved by the local
ethics committee of Human Research Sciences registered with the University Clinical Trials
Registry. Before the experiment, subjects were provided with sufficient explanation about
the study. The subjects signed a consent form before the experiment was conducted. The
sample size estimate was based on data collected from previous studies<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A priori power
analysis determined that a sample size of 20 post-stroke subjects in each group was required
to obtain a statistical power of 0.85 using the general power analysis program 3.1
(University of Kiel, Germany). This was based on an analysis using the independent t-test to
compare two groups, with a predetermined coefficient of reliability of 0.90<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lesion locations were ascertained by
computed tomography or by magnetic resonance imaging. The subjects were randomly allocated,
20 subjects each, to an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). Inclusion criteria
were as follows: ischemic or hemorrhagic post-stroke hemiparesis; discharge from
rehabilitation services after first stroke 6 to 18 months earlier; a score of &#x02265;26 in the
modified mini-mental status examination Korea version (MMSE-K); Brunnstorm stage III or
above for reach of the proximal and distal parts of the arm; no excessive spasticity in the
more affected arm, defined as a score of &#x02264;2 on the Modified Ashworth Spasticity scale<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>; and no excessive pain in the more affected
UE, defined as &#x02264;4 on a 10-point Visual Analog Scale<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects were excluded if they had previous neurologic disorders,
musculoskeletal abnormalities, confusion, or unilateral neglect. Unilateral neglect was
tested by the Star Cancellation Test of visuospatial neglect. Those scoring less than 47
were excluded from the study<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Motor control and functional performance of UE were evaluated using clinical evaluation and
kinematic analysis before and after the four-week intervention period. Two physical and
occupational therapists blinded to group allocation conducted the evaluations. Prior to
administration of the clinical measures, these blinded evaluators received a 6-hour training
session in the administration of the FM test of UE<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and the modified WMFT<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rater competence was assessed by the primary investigator who has
seven years experience of using these measures. The evaluators were trained to conduct the
kinematic analysis in accordance with the standardized procedures described below. Subjects
were asked not to indicate their treatment assignment to the evaluator.</p><p>Post-stroke UE motor impairment was assessed using the UE subsection of the FM assessment
test by physical therapists<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The evaluator rated the &#x0201c;normalcy&#x0201d; of 30 voluntary upper
extremity movement patterns using a 3-point ordinal scale (0=unable, 1=partial performance,
2=near normal performance) and tested the excitability of 3 tendon-tap reflexes using a
2-point ordinal scale (0=no response, 2=normal or hyperexcitable). Traditionally, the
assessment is scored by summing item ratings and reporting the aggregate score out of 66
points, with higher scores representing greater UE motor ability<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The occupational therapists used WMFT to assess the UE
motor function. In this test, the participants are timed as they complete 15 activities that
involve progressively more difficult arm movements and interactions with objects such as
lifting a soda can, stacking checkers, and folding a towel. We report the average times to
perform the 15 items<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, and performances
were rated using a 6-point functional ability scale. The summary score of functional ability
is the mean of the item scores. The summary score of the performance time is the median
because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean score.</p><p>Kinematic analysis was performed using a lateral dynamic reach task<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the task, subjects sat on a chair with the seat
height adjusted to 100% of the lower leg length, measured from the lateral knee joint to the
floor while the subject was standing. The trunk was secured to the chairback with a harness
in order to minimize compensation movements of trunk flexion and rotation. Adjacent to the
chair was a table with its height adjusted to 5&#x02005;cm below the elbow. The subject rested the
affected hand on a pressure sensitive hand switch located at the edge of the table and in
line with the subject&#x02019;s coronal plane. A beverage can, 8&#x02005;cm in diameter and 12&#x02005;cm in height,
positioned in the patient&#x02019;s coronal plane, was used as the common target in order to provide
the same measurement environment. The reaching distance to the can was standardized to the
subject&#x02019;s arm length (from the medial border of the axilla to the distal wrist crease). If
the maximum distance the subject could reach was less than the arm length, the reaching
distance to the can was adjusted to the maximum reachable distance. Subjects were instructed
to reach for the can at a self-paced speed. A start signal was provided to indicate the
start of the task. After one practice trial, three trials were performed and averaged for
the analysis. Data were collected using a digital camcorder and a 2-D motion capture
analysis system (Dartfish 2-D, KOREA Inc., Seoul, Korea) which was used in conjunction with
a personal computer to capture the movement of reference markers during the task and to
simultaneously collect one channel of analog signals. The sampling frequency was 240&#x02005;Hz. The
analog signal was the hand switch used to determine the movement onset. The reference marker
attached to the can was used to determine the movement end. Thus, movement recording began
when the subject&#x02019;s hand moved off the switch and terminated when the marker attached to the
can moved. Five non-invasive, small, infrared light-emitting diode (LED) markers were
attached to the ulna styloid process and lateral epicondyle of each subject&#x02019;s hemiparetic
arm, sternum, and both glenohumeral joints; and a scanner unit tracked the movement of the
markers<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The following 3 measurements were taken during the reaching task.
The speed (m/s) to complete the task; the range of angular shoulder movements (deg), defined
as the maximum minus the minimum angle recorded as an individual reached to the farthest
point; and the maximum distance reached (mm) to complete the task. The task was repeated 3
times in succession, and the average of the 3 readings of each of the measurements was used
in the data analysis<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A flow diagram of the test procedure is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

marked with either 1 or 2. This was a double-blind study: the subjects and therapists were
not aware of their grouping. Over a 4-week period, the subjects in the CG received one hour
daily of routine physical and occupational therapy, consisting of compensation techniques
for activities of daily living, UE strength, and range of motion and traditional
positioning. Subjects in the EG received a half daily routine of physical therapy which
included half an hour of TRT based on VB using a 19-inch computer LCD screen connected to
the 2-dimensional motion capture analysis system. The training took place in a clinical
setting and the subjects performed 12 sessions (30&#x02005;min each, 150&#x02013;180 movements per session).
Subjects were seated in an armless chair with their trunk restrained to prevent compensatory
trunk movement<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Corrective feedback was
given when compensatory movements were observed. Other tasks were used to minimize
compensatory movements. For example, if excessive shoulder abduction or internal rotation
occurred, reaching was intermittently carried out with the paretic arm next to a wall to
prevent compensatory movement<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
subjects looked down onto the 19-inch LCD screen, which was placed on top of a wooden stand,
and connected to the 2-dimensional motion capture analysis system<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the
reaching task training, familiar objects were used that varied in size, shape, and weight
(56&#x02013;453 g) including: coffee mugs, teacups, plastic balls, books, pitchers with handles<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were required to look down
at the screen during the reaching task training and were only allowed to reach in the
frontal plane. Training involved only the paretic limb. The subjects were instructed to move
at their preferred speed and to increase that speed as training progressed. In TRT, subjects
reached to contact objects that differed in size, shape, and weight.</p><p>Data were analyzed by using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The values of the
experimental and control groups are expressed as means and standard deviations. Since the
data samples of this study showed a normal distribution as determined by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, parametric methods were used. The independent t-test (age, weight,
height, duration, T1&#x02013;L5 spine and arm length, and star cancellation test) and the
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (gender, side of hemiplegia, and type of stroke) were used to compare
the demographic characteristics of the subjects of the two groups. For each group, the
difference between the pre-test and post-test results was analyzed using the paired t-test.
Comparisons of each variable between the groups were made with the independent t-test. The
significance level was chosed as 0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Forty subjects (16 females, 24 males) were recruited for this study, and their

The prognosis for UE recovery following stroke is poor. A systematic review<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that complete motor recovery of
the UE occurs in less than 15% of patients with initial paralysis. Of stroke victims, 30 to
66% continue to experience UE motor dysfunctions for &#x0003e; 6 months<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the subjects of this study, who were more than six
months post-stroke, had UE motor dysfunctions. One goal of rehabilitation after stroke is to
enhance motor recovery of the paretic UE<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the inability to perform tasks
involving reaching is a common problem for stroke patients. Reaching is a fundamental
component of daily movement that requires the coordination of multiple UE segments<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, assisting individuals&#x02019;
adaptation to deficits can improve their function and social participation. On the basis of
background information, we carefully applied the spatial TRT based on VB to investigate its
effect on the UE function of hemiplegic subjects. Our primary findings indicate that the FM
test of UE and WMFT scores showed significantly more improvement in the EG than in the CG.
Also, reaching speed and angle showed significantly more improvement in the EG. These
results suggest that use of TRT based on VB elicits improvement in the UE function of
hemiplegic stroke patients.</p><p>We chose to study lateral reaching as a representative movement task because: reaching
requires the coordinated movement of multiple UE segments, reaching is a fundamental
component of many activities of daily living, and reaching has been extensively studied in
adults who are healthy and in people with chronic hemiparesis to better understand UE motor
control<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reaching with the impaired limb improves when familiar objects are
used every day and functional goals are emphasized during a single test session<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. All the subjects involved in this study
used familiar objects to improve reaching with the paretic arm. The functional use of the UE
is impaired after loss of movement of approximately 80% of abduction and 40% flexion<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.This limits effective movements and the level of activity and
participation. It is therefore essential to develop ways of improving paretic arm movement
to restore function and minimize disability. The strategy of incorporating muscle activation
of abduction and flexion into training therapies may improve paretic arm function. Subjects
in this study performed lateral reaching forward in their frontal plane. Previous studies
have shown that shoulder abduction and flexion training can lead to improvement in
unilateral paretic arm function.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>Feed-forward movements are performed using a motor plan that is established before movement
onset, and an internal model is needed to execute them accurately. On the other hand,
feedback movements are used to correct ongoing movement<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are various kinds of feedback movements: auditory, EMG,
kinetic or force feedback<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among them,
visual biofeedback shows the error of movement allowing the subjects to correct abnormal
movements. It can also provide support and enhance the movement of subjects with reduced UE
function. The positive outcomes of research studies support the use of VB in clinical
practices related to the development and recovery of active movement of the UE of stroke
patients<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, VB was
provided by a computer LCD screen which was placed on top of a wooden stand and connected to
a 2-dimensional motion capture analysis system when subjects performed the TRT. We modified
the methods of previous studies<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Activities such as reaching require the
neural system to preplan a motor plan(s) (i.e. feedforward control) and use sensory feedback
(i.e. feedback control) to monitor motor errors and modify ongoing movements<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients demonstrate temporal
inefficiency in preplanning and executing movements and rely heavily on feedback control in
reaching<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study used clinical evaluations (FM test of UE and the WMFT) and kinematic analysis to
investigate changes in functional performance and control of reaching after TRT based on VB
therapy. By combining kinematic analysis and clinical evaluation it is possible to examine
whether functional improvement is accompanied by a change in motor control<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most studies have reported composite
scores of standardized tests, such as the FM test or WMFT, rather than determining how the
motor control or coordination of arm movements has changed<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impairment and disability in clinical settings is generally
assessed by ordinal scales such as the FM test and WMFT. Although valid clinical measures
were used in these studies, kinematics may also provide a more objective, direct, and
quantitative method of measuring UE motor changes. Kinematics analysis is a feasible way of
measuring motor change, distance, speed, and angles of subjects&#x02019; movements. Many studies
have used kinematic analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal control of UE reaching
movements<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. Over the past decade,
kinematic studies of subjects with chronic hemiparesis have yielded significant information
about how movement control is altered after stroke and provided insight into compensatory
movement control strategies<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared
with clinical rating scales, kinematic studies offer a sensitive, quantitative assessment of
the components of abnormal motor performance. Kinematic measures also enable the assessment
of spatial and temporal movement characteristics and might thereby provide insights into the
spatiotemporal control of movement<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of
the many variables that can be used to quantify reaching performance using kinematic
techniques, we chose to quantify the speed, angle, and maximal distance of the reach. We
considered these 3 movement characteristics to be important because, presumably, once in a
community setting, patients will not use their arm if the movements are not timely or
accurate, or if it takes too much effort or too many attempts to perform the movement<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup>. Descriptions of the kinematics of
reaching from the acute to the subacute phase after stroke are provided elsewhere<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the following considerations. The present study
incorporated critical factors related to motor relearning after stroke, such as type, timing
and frequency of feedback, and initial motor and cognitive impairment levels. The relatively
small sample size limits generalization of the results. The lack of use of objects of
different sizes to investigate the treatment efficacy of reaching might be a limitation in
our study. The use of smaller objects might be a more sensitive way of differentiating
possible changes after treatment. Further studies are necessary to assess the long-term
effects of TRT based on visual biofeedback on the control of reaching using a wider variety
of tasks that involve target objects of different sizes. Since training benefits are
dependent on the initial level of impairment, further research should systematically
evaluate the efficacy of TRT based on VB therapy for stroke patients with different degrees
of motor impairment and differences in relevant neurological factors (e.g. neurological
severity of stroke). Also, this study did not measure biomechanical parameters, such as
relative joint moments and inter-joint coordination of UE. Future studies should employ
direct qualitative assessments during fully supported trajectory tracking measurements of
the biomechanical parameters and electromyography recordings of the UE muscles. Future
trials of TRT based on VB therapy should also incorporate speed and accuracy demands into
the training program using individually tailored protocols to investigate their effects on
movement efficiency and smoothness.</p><p>In conclusion, it is important to establish the efficacy of treatment approaches that are
appropriate for post-stroke patients who have UE impairments. This study had provided
evidence of greater improvements in UE functional performance of daily activities and motor
control during reaching movements after TRT based on VB versus traditional rehabilitation.
Based on the findings of the clinical evaluation and kinematic analysis, the use of TRT
based on VB appears more effective than traditional rehabilitation at promoting UE
functional improvement. Subjects who received TRT based on VB therapy exhibited more
efficiency in preplanning the movement of reaching, as indicated by clinical evaluations,
and depended more on motor control during reaching, as reflected by the reaching speed and
angle variables of kinematic analysis, than those who received traditional rehabilitation.
Future research should investigate the benefits of incorporating various task demands into
TRT based on VB therapy for task-specific training of movement performance in stroke
rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to all the subjects involved in this study as well as
