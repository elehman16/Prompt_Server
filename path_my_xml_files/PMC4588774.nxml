The study recruited 20 patients (10 males and 10 females, aged 18-56 years, with a mean age of 37.79 &#x000b1; 10.58 years), with no dropout. All patients treated were medically stable, non-smokers with no contraindications to periodontal surgery, had not been subjected to any periodontal therapy for at least 6 months prior, and had no history of antibiotics use within 6 months prior to treatment.</p><p>To be included in the study, patients had to have radiographic evidence of at least two identical bilateral suprabony pockets with horizontal bone loss pattern, patients having an adequate band of keratinized tissue for ease in surgical manipulation and suturing. Following the initial therapy, the selected sites displayed probing pockets depth of &#x02265;4 mm and clinical attachment loss of &#x02265;4 mm and horizontal bone loss detected by radiographic examination (alveolar crest level [ACL] - cementoenamel junction [CEJ] distance &#x02265;4 mm) at three adjacent posterior teeth. Based on inclusion criteria, an informed consent was obtained from patients selected for study. Initial therapy included scaling and root planning followed by oral hygiene instructions. Post 6 weeks of Phase 1 periodontal therapy, re-evaluation of patients was done. Based on inclusion criteria, before periodontal flap surgery, baseline parameters were recorded.

This study was a longitudinal 12 months test conducted with a prospective controlled, randomized design. The intent of the study was to clinically evaluate that, if the use of SECTG in conjunction with OFD versus the classically used approach of OFD in treatment of horizontal osseous defects, could lead to better clinical, and radiographic results; i.e. greater RAL gain, reduced PPD, decreased post-surgical gingival recession and supracrestal bone growth in the maxillary posterior, as well as the mandibular posterior region.</p><p>At the baseline examination, the various clinical variables did not show a statistical difference between the two groups. All participants of the present study showed good oral hygiene levels and healthy gingival conditions throughout the entire study period of 12 months as indicated by ancillary clinical parameters of PI and PBI scores. There were no significant differences in PI and sulcular bleeding index observed between control and experimental sites at any point during the study, suggesting that the different amounts clinical attachment gain between control and experimental sites were a result of the different treatment modalities tested and therefore unrelated to the amount of gingival inflammation present during healing.</p><p>Results revealed that both surgical treatments (OFD + SECTG and OFD alone) significantly improved the clinical parameters compared to the pre-surgical conditions; however, the addition of SECTG resulted in a significantly greater reduction in PPD and gain in RAL and a significantly lower gingival recession or apical displacement of GML both at 6 months and 12 months post-surgically.</p><p>The added benefit provided by SECTG is suggested by the greater RAL gain scores and the overall proportion of pockets undergoing complete closure (significantly greater).</p><p>SECTGs may have acted as a &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; autogenous GTR membrane in this case, possibly allowing periodontal ligament cells, osteoblasts, and cementoblasts to repopulate the apical part of the wound.</p><p>The good results for RAL improvement obtained by using a connective tissue graft could be explained by the fact that in addition to providing a space for regenerating cells, the connective tissue graft may have better supported and protected the wound of the surgical site during the healing period.</p><p>A primary goal of periodontal therapy is to reduce PPD so as to limit the risk of local re-infection. Shallow pockets display a highly negative predictive value for future disease amelioration, whereas deep pockets in treated areas are a risk indicator for periodontal disease progression.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In the present clinical study with an initial pocket range of 4-7 mm.

The present results agree with those previously reported in literature which demonstrate the efficacy of both treatment approaches, though statistical differences have been found with respect to improvement of various parameters between both arms of the experimental groups, long-term studies need to be conducted to prove the added benefits using SECTG in conjunction with OFD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the confines of the present study, results revealed that the use of SECTG along with OFD compared to OFD alone resulted in significantly higher RAL gain and significantly lower post-surgical gingival recession. However, both techniques failed to show significant supracrestal bone growth. Therefore use of SECTG along with OFD, followed with regular maintenance therapy, has clinically predictable results in the treatment of periodontal horizontal osseous defects.
