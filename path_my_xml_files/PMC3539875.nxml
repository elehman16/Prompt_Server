[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; Oswald, Heil &#x00026; Goldbeck
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Although placement in foster care usually protects them against further exposure to child maltreatment, children have often been psychologically scarred by these experiences and as a consequence show behavioral problems (Minnis, Everett, Pelosi, Dunn &#x00026; Knapp
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Pears, Kim &#x00026; Fisher
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]) and attachment problems (Smyke, Dumitrescu &#x00026; Zeanah
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; Zeanah, Scheeringa, Boris, Hellers, Smyke, &#x00026; Trapani
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Placement in foster care most often implies that children are separated from the biological parent, which may evoke negative reactions as well. All this jeopardizes the success of foster care placements and placement failure may start a vicious circle in which the chance of another failure increases with every breakdown (Rubin, O&#x02019;Reilly, Luan &#x00026; Localio
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; Oosterman, Schuengel, Slot, Bullens &#x00026; Doreleijers
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). The final option, institutional placement, is wrought with its own risk for pathological outcomes, e.g. compared to children in foster care institutionalized children show more cognitive delays (Nelson, Zeanah, Fox, Marshall, Smyke &#x00026; Guthrie
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]), attachment disturbances (Smyke, Zeanah, Gleason, Drury, Fox, Nelson, Guthrie
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) and developmental delays (Curtis, Alexander &#x00026; Lunghofer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). To stop this vicious circle, these children and their foster parents need intensive support (Chamberlain, Price, Reid, Landsverk, Fisher &#x00026; Stoolmiller
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Especially children with very severe behavioral problems are in need of spezialized foster care interventions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These children are at high risk for placement instability (Aarons, James, Monn, Raghavan, Wells &#x00026; Leslie
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]), because they have problems that may be too taxing for regular foster parents. To help foster parents provide these high-risk children with the positive and stimulating setting they need, foster parents need to learn effective behavioral management strategies and learn to provide emotional support (Fisher, Burraston &#x00026; Pears
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). To address these needs, a multidimensional treatment program for preschool foster children has been designed Chamberlain &#x00026; Fisher

Foster parents are taught effective strategies to promote positive behavior and effective limit setting for problem behavior. Concurrently children receive individually tailored behavioral interventions, focusing on problem-solving skills and prosocial behavior. Although MTFC-P is quite successful in the U.S. (see Table&#x02009;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and transportability of the MTFC model for older children has been shown in Swedish context (Westermark, Hansson and Olssen
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), the efficacy of the preschool version has not been replicated in other countries where implementation challenges and cultural differences may play a role.

Within this covenant, agencies agreed that residential placement of preschool-aged children should be prevented. At that time there were no evidence-based alternatives available for preschool-aged children with behavioral problems, hence MTFC-P was implemented. Complete implementation services are provided by TFC Consultants, Inc. (see
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mtfc.com">http://mtfc.com</ext-link>). An important focus of these services is the treatment adherence of foreign MTFC-P staff. TFC Consultants, Inc. has set some standards that prospective MTFC-P staff has to achieve, before a team is certified and allowed to use the name Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care. The purpose of TFC Consultants, Inc. implementation services and certification is to achieve positive outcomes that are similar to the outcomes previously achieved by its developers.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of intervention</title><p>MTFC-P is an intensive behavior focused program for young foster children (3 to 6 years of age), aiming to decrease children&#x02019;s problem behavior and increase social behaviors, in order to promote further placement stability. MTFC-P is a treatment for children new in foster care, reentering foster care or moving between placements, all showing many problems that put them at risk for placement instability. Children are excluded from enrollment when they have an IQ &#x0003c;80 or when they have severe physical or psychiatric problems. Prospective MTFC-P foster parents need to attend two-day training, have to share the treatment philosophy and be willing to closely work together with MTFC-P staff. MTFC-P is delivered through a treatment team approach. A program supervisor organizes the treatment. Children receive individual training and weekly therapeutic playgroup from a skill trainer. Therapeutic foster parents participate in weekly group meetings and receive frequent home visits and ongoing support from a foster parent consultant. A family therapist supports important members of the biological family, e.g. providing biological parents with parent management strategies and concurrently guiding parent&#x02013;child visits. For nine months, children are placed in a therapeutic foster family. From developmental perspectives, the family setting is considered the primary learning environment of preschool-aged children (Fisher, Ellis &#x00026; Chamberlain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). To stimulate pro-social behavior and diminish behavioral problems, children receive behavioral interventions that are based upon Patterson&#x02019;s theory of coercion with its principles of social learning (Patterson
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). A key notion is that behavioral problems result from enforcing negative behavior and lack of modeling of positive behavior. To tackle this, MTFC-P makes use of two principal techniques. Firstly, skills trainer and therapeutic foster parents consequently reward positive behavior. Secondly, therapist and foster parents ignore negative behavior, instead they offer an alternative or put the child on a short time-out from contact. Therapeutic foster parents are responsible for the continuity of children&#x02019;s behavioral interventions. To maintain a beneficial treatment setting for children, therapeutic foster parents are encouraged to stay consistent and responsive toward the child. Therapeutic foster parents receive parental strategies to encourage positive behavior and effective non-abusive limit setting for problem behavior (Chamberlain &#x00026; Reid
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; Patterson, Reid &#x00026; Dishion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). After the initial 9 months, children are transferred to an after care setting (permanent foster family, biological parent). Here, the skills trainer continues children&#x02019;s training and (foster) parents receive parenting practices to reinforce positive behavior for approximately 3 months. The children&#x02019;s transfer to the permanent aftercare setting is facilitated by cooperation&#x02019;s of foster care services surrounding the child, to preserve positive outcomes (Besier, Fegert, Goldbeck
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Problem behavior</title><p>The Child Behavioral Checklist for ages 1.5 to 5 (CBCL1.5-5; Achenbach &#x00026; Rescorla

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]) were filled out by foster parents to assess emotional and behavioral problems. Foster parents were asked to rate 113 items on a three point scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all true, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;somewhat true, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;very true), to assess internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Prior studies regarding Dutch populations found evidence for the validity of the CBCL 1.5-5 and 6&#x02013;18 (Koot, Van den Oord, Verhulst &#x00026; Boomsma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; Verhulst
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). With regard to the present study, internal consistency for the CBCL 1.5-5 broad band syndrome scales was .75 for internalising problems (36 items), .60 for externalising problems (24 items) and .84 for total problems (73 items). Internal consistency of the CBCL version 6&#x02013;18 years was good for the broad band syndrome scales externalising problems (28 items, .84) and total problems (77 items, .78). Internal consistency for internalising problems was low (32 items, .36).</p></sec><sec><title>Attachment disturbances</title><p>The Disturbance of Attachment Interview (DAI: Smyke &#x00026; Zeanah
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) is used to assess symptoms of the Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4<sup>th</sup> edition &#x02013; text revision
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). Eight items of the DAI indicate symptoms of inhibited (5 items) or disinhibited attachment (3 items). Items are coded 0 if the symptom is definitely not present, 1 if there is some evidence for the symptom and 2 if the symptom is definitely present (Oosterman &#x00026; Schuengel
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Criteria for a RAD classification is a score of 2 (symptom definitely present) on one of the items of the subscales. Oosterman &#x00026; Schuengel
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have suggested to exclude item 4 (&#x02018;responds reciprocally with familiar caregivers&#x02019;), due to insufficiently loading on any of the DAI subscales. Two trained interviewers administer the interview to one of the foster parents, the interview is then double coded. Intraclass correlation for single measure (2-way random effects) was estimated based on the degree of agreement between the two interviewers, for the subscale Inhibition (ICC[95%]&#x02009;=&#x02009;.83), Disinhibition (ICC[95%]&#x02009;=&#x02009;.86) and Secure Base Distortion (ICC[95%]&#x02009;=&#x02009;.79). Previous research has revealed acceptable validity, internal consistency and satisfactory interrater&#x02019;s reliability (Smyke, Dumitrescu &#x00026; Zeanah

Assessment of behavioral problems was scheduled one month after placement because children were placed in new foster families when entering the program. A new foster setting is often accompanied by a temporary decrease or increase of problems. The DAI was scheduled within the third month after children entered their new foster family, assuming this is a plausible period for the development of an attachment relation between child and foster parent (Stoval &#x00026; Dozier
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Child maltreatment was registered based on records from child protective services at the end of the treatment. To examine the development of behavioral problems over the course of the intervention, a trained caller administered the PDR, to the MTFC-P foster parents daily by telephone at weekdays.

Our study was further limited in that we only used self-reports of therapeutic foster parents on a single measure, the PDR. However, we suggested that the therapeutic foster parents would be the most reliable coders for problem behavior as they operate as semi-professionals and are best aware of children&#x02019;s behavior. Furthermore, we choose the PDR, as this daily assessment of problem behavior is least biased by time of recall. The use of multi-informant (Lanktree
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) and multi-method assessment (e.g. observations, physiological measures) would have been advisable, but these limitations are according to the typical characteristics of a pilot study. Nevertheless, these are promising results, consistent with findings in more rigorous studies of MTFC-P showing that, relative to children in regular foster care, children in MTFC had less resistant behavior
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and at the end of MTFC-P children had more desired outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Notwithstanding these limitations, our study was able to demonstrate that MTFC-P is a promising intervention when provided to a group of children with severe problem behavior and attachment disturbances in the Netherlands. Nonetheless, further studies towards MTFC-P are recommended to include a randomized and controlled research design to examine generalizability of treatment outcomes. The present study is a small step towards more knowledge about treatment of young foster children and a promising intervention for young foster children with severe behavioral problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>Recruitment of participants, data gathering and data analyses are executed by C.S.
