Diclofenac sodium and 5-Fluorouracil are effective, non-invasive and easy-to-apply
topical treatment options. </p></sec><sec><title>OBJECTIVES</title><p> To assess and compare the effectiveness of 3% diclofenac sodium associated with
2.5% hyaluronic acid and of 5% 5-Fluorouracil for the treatment of actinic
keratosis, as well as the patient's degree of satisfaction and tolerability. </p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p>28 patients with a clinical diagnosis of actinic keratosis were randomized to
receive diclofenac sodium or 5-Fluorouracil and were clinically assessed before
and after treatment as well as 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Modified
versions of the Investigator and Patient Global Improvement Scores were used. </p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p> The average number of lesions in the diclofenac sodium group before and after
treatment was 13.6 and 6.6 (p&#x0003c;0,001), respectively, while it was 17.4 and 3.15
(p&#x0003c;0.001) in the 5-Fluorouracil group. There was a significant reduction in the
number of lesions in the 5-Fluorouracil group in relation to the diclofenac sodium
group (p&#x0003c;0.001). To the non-blinded physician, there was a higher satisfactory
therapeutic response in the 5-Fluorouracil group (p&#x0003c;0.001); to the blinded
physician, there was a higher satisfactory response in this same group, although
not statistically significant (p=0.09). There was a high degree of satisfaction in
both groups (73% in the diclofenac sodium group and 77% in the 5-Fluorouracil
group; p=0.827). Regarding adverse effects, the diclofenac sodium group presented
a higher degree of satisfaction (93.3% vs 38.4%; p=0.008). Erythema, edema, crusts
and itching were significantly higher in the 5-Fluorouracil group. </p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We concluded that 5-Fluorouracil was more effective; however, it showed lower
tolerability than diclofenac sodium.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="pt"><sec><title>FUNDAMENTOS</title><p> Ceratose act&#x000ed;nica &#x000e9; uma les&#x000e3;o frequente que ocorre em &#x000e1;reas de exposi&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o solar.

clinical stage of a biological <italic>continuum</italic> that can culminate in squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> They usually result from prolonged exposure to
non-ionizing radiation, especially from ultraviolet rays of the sun.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup></p><p>These lesions are very common, being the third main reason for consulting a
dermatologist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> In Brazil,
according to the latest census carried out by the Brazilian Society of Dermatology, in
2006, it is the fourth reason for visiting a dermatologist, representing 5.1% of
visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup> Between 1990 and 1999,
AK was diagnosed in over 47 million patients in the U.S. With more than one million new
cases reported each year, it represents approximately 14% of the visits to the
dermatologist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup> In Australia,
the estimated prevalence of AK is between 40 and 50% of the population over 40 years
old. Other studies in the USA and Australia have shown a lower prevalence, between 11
and 26%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> In terms of incidence, a
study showed that 60% of the people aged 40 or older with a history of AK developed new
lesions in 12 months, while only 19% of the people who had no actinic keratosis at the
beginning of the study showed new lesions after 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup></p><p>Besides its epidemiological impact, AK is also a marker of photodamage, identifying risk
groups not only for the development of squamous cell carcinoma, but also for basal cell
carcinoma and even melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> It is
the main risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> The probability that actinic keratosis (AK) will evolve into
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was estimated at 0.075-0.096% per lesion per
year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup> Thus, for a person with
an average of 7.7 lesions of actinic keratosis on the skin, the incidence of squamous
cell carcinoma would be 10.2% in 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup> In 1995, Hurwitz and Monger reported that 97% of cases of SCC are
associated with previous actinic keratosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup> However, they may also regress spontaneously or remain unchanged; its
course is unpredictable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup></p><p>The most important risk factors for actinic keratosis are the following: white
population (Fitzpatrick skin types I and II), age (generally over 30 years old,
depending on skin type), sex (higher occurrence in males), geographic areas with higher
solar radiation, lifestyle (cumulative exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and
absence of preventive measures) and immunocompromised patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup></p><p>The typical primary lesion is characterized by a rough erythematous papule covered with
a white to yellow scale which can range from millimeters to confluent plaques of several
centimeters in diameter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> AK usually appears as multiple
lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> These lesions are
typically concentrated in areas of higher sun exposure, with 80% of them being located
on the head, neck and upper extremities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> There are other variations in their clinical presentation. They may
manifest as hyperkeratotic, pigmented, lichenoid, and atrophic AK as well as actinic
cheilitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> Most lesions are asymptomatic, but some may cause itching
or a burning sensation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup></p><p>The main changes in histopathology are atypical keratinocytes, hyperkeratosis,
parakeratosis, especially covering atypical keratinocytes, lichenoid or perivascular
lymphocytes, and solar elastosis in the dermis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup></p><p>Actinic keratosis may be treated for aesthetic reasons and for relief of symptoms, when
they are present. However, the main reason for treatment is to prevent the occurrence of
squamous cell carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> Various
types of therapy are currently available. Among the destructive options are cryotherapy,
curettage, excision, dermabrasion, chemical peeling, laser and photodynamic
therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup> Classic topical
options are 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5% imiquimod and 3% diclofenac sodiumgel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> The latter are the
treatments of choice for multiple and microscopic actinic keratosis, for they are easy
to apply and effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup> Other topical
agents that are under investigation for the treatment of AK are ingenol mebutate,
resiquimod , betulinic acid, piroxicam, 5-FU combined with salicylic acid and the green
tea <italic>epigallocatechin gallate</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup></p><p>A comparison of these treatments may help dermatologists to choose the best treatment
option for their patient. Considering clinical response, cost and incidence of adverse
effects, it is important to compare the results of these methods.</p><p>Topical 5% 5-FU is a well-established treatment for actinic keratosis and is approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It inhibits thymidylate synthetase, an enzyme
required for DNA synthesis, causing cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> It is usually applied twice daily for a period of 2-4
weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> The most
common adverse effects are irritation, erythema, dryness and a burning sensation in the
skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> 3% diclofenac sodium
associated with 2.5% hyaluronic acid also showed to be effective in the treatment of
actinic keratosis in randomized, double-blind, gel vehicle-controlled studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup> Its mechanism of action is not fully
understood, being attributed to a decrease in the formation of arachidonic acid
metabolites through inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Some of these metabolites
inhibit apoptosis and immune surveillance and increase angiogenesis and the invasive
ability of tumor cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> It is approved by the FDA, and its use
is recommended twice daily for 60 to 90 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup> The adverse effects described in the literature include itching,
dry skin, erythema and rash.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup></p><p>The general objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the
treatment with 3% diclofenac sodium associated with 2.5% hyaluronic acid gel (DFS) and
of 5% 5-fluorouracil cream (5-FU) in the treatment of actinic keratosis on the face
and/or scalp and/or back of the hands. The specific objectives were to evaluate and
compare tolerability and to assess and compare the patient's degree of satisfaction
regarding the efficacy and side effects of these treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>We conducted a randomized, parallel-group clinical trial with a sample of patients of
both sexes, over 18 years old, with at least 5 actinic keratosis located on the face
and/or back of the hands and/or scalp who sought medical care in a Dermatology Clinic
from January to July 2011.</p><p>The study excluded pregnant or lactating women, patients on immunosuppressive,
immunomodulatory, cytotoxic, retinoid and systemic steroid drugs, patients on some
investigational medication or even patients who received treatment for their lesions in
the 4 weeks preceding the study. It also excluded volunteers who had other skin diseases
in the area to be treated, known sensitivity to any component of the medications under
investigation, and patients with less than 5 AK (because topical treatment is indicated
for multiple lesions).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup></p><p>In total, 31 patients were selected and randomized into two groups: Group 1 was
instructed to apply 3% diclofenac sodium associated with 2.5% hyaluronic acid gel
(formulated at Farm&#x000e1;cia de Manipula&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o B&#x00026;S, Brazil) twice daily for 12 weeks, and
Group 2 was instructed to apply 5% 5-Fluorouracil cream (Efurix; Laborat&#x000f3;rio Valeant)
twice daily for 4 weeks. The length and frequency of the treatment and the vehicles are
in accordance with the literature. All patients were instructed to avoid direct sunlight
exposure and to use sunscreen.</p><p>A non-blinded dermatologist (investigator) evaluated the patients before treatment,
reaching the clinical diagnosis of actinic keratosis. The dermatologist determined the
exact number of lesions and their location through mapping, marking their location in
the drawing contained in the medical evaluation form, and through photographic image
(Sony Cyber-Shot 7.2 Mega pixels).</p><p>The same dermatologist evaluated the patients immediately after treatment and verified
the presence of adverse effects and the patient's degree of pain (rated on a scale of 0
to 10). The dermatologist also evaluated the patients eight weeks after the end of
treatment and recorded new photographic images (under the same conditions of light and
distance that the first ones were taken) and performed new mapping and counting of the
lesions, evaluating improvement of the lesions according to the modified Investigator
Global Improvement Score (unchanged, &#x02264; 50% of the lesions were healed, &#x0003e; 50% of
the lesions were healed, all lesions were healed) and the patient's degree of
satisfaction through the modified Patient Global Improvement Score (unchanged, &#x0003c; 50%
of the lesions were healed, &#x0003e; 50% of the lesions were healed, all lesions were
healed), based on the model of the Patient Global Improvement Index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup></p><p>A blinded dermatologist evaluated the photographs before and 8 weeks after the end of
treatment and rated the improvement of the lesions through the modified Investigator
Global Improvement Score, based on the model of the Investigator Global Improvement
Index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup> The established
criteria for cure are characterized by disappearance of the lesion, presence of mild
erythema with no desquamation on the site (it was considered cure with residual
erythema) or presence of non-focal, diffuse fine desquamation with no erythema involving
the area treated (it was considered cure with presence of xerosis in the region). A
satisfactory response was obtained when improvement of the lesions was &#x0003e; 50%, and an
unsatisfactory response was obtained when improvement of the lesions was &#x02264; 50%.</p><p>The estimated sample size was 52 volunteers, with 26 cases (A) and 26 controls (B),
including 10% for possible losses. We used SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences) version 15.0 and PEPI (Programs for Epidemiologists) version 3.0 in the data
analysis.</p><p>In the statistical analysis, we used the t-test for independent and paired (only when it
was necessary to compare the results before and after treatment in the same group of
volunteers) samples and the chisquare test. The significance level was set at 5% (p
&#x0003c;0.05). Some data, after being analyzed, had their results expressed in frequencies,
percentages, means and standard deviations.</p><p>The project was approved by the Ethics Committee, and the volunteers completed the
Informed Consent Form, being notified of the research objectives and having their
confidentiality guaranteed during the processes of collecting, storing and analyzing
data. All patients were assured that they would receive the necessary care even if
unwilling to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty-one (31) patients were initially selected. Three patients in the group treated

efficacy, but the 3% diclofenac sodium group presented milder adverse effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref></sup> In 2007, Krawtchenko <italic>et
al</italic>. conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing 5% 5-Fluorouracil,
cryosurgery and 5% imiquimod and showed the superiority of the latter in maintaining
cure rates 12 months after treatment as well as in terms of aesthetic results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup> In 2008, Kose <italic>et al</italic>.
compared the use of 3% diclofenac sodium gel with 5% imiquimod cream and found similar
effectiveness between the groups, with low rates of complete remission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref></sup> In 2011, Akarsu <italic>et al</italic>.
conducted a study comparing the use of 3% diclofenac sodium and 5% imiquimod and found
similar cure rates at the end of treatment in both groups, but with a higher rate of
recurrence in the diclofenac sodium group 12 weeks after treatment completion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup></p><p>This was a parallel-group study and not a bilateral one and it showed a significant
reduction in the number of lesions eight weeks after treatment in both groups, but the
group treated with 5-FU showed a greater reduction (an average reduction of 7 lesions in
the group treated with DFS and 14.25 lesions in the group treated with 5-FU, p
&#x0003c;0.001). It also showed lower tolerability to treatment in the group treated with
5-FU, considering the significantly higher presence of adverse effects in this group at
the end of treatment.</p><p>According to the literature, treatment with 5-FU should last between 2 and 4
weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> In this study,
patients were instructed to follow the treatment for four weeks. However, the average
number of days was 20.3 days, and no patient followed it for less than 14 days. In all
cases, the reason why the patients did not comply with the indicated treatment duration
was the presence of adverse effects. In the group of volunteers treated with DFS, all
patients completed 90 days of treatment, as recommended.</p><p>Regarding the evaluation of the medical researchers, the non-blinded dermatologist
considered 5-FU the best treatment, since all patients achieved an improvement &#x0003e; 50%
in their evaluation and there was a statistically significant difference compared to the
group treated with DFS. However, according to the blinded dermatologist's evaluation,
there was no statistically significant difference between the treatments, but only a
trend toward 5-FU.</p><p>It is important to note that the non-blinded dermatologist personally assessed the
patients, while the blinded one assessed them only by photographic images. Another
interesting fact is that, according to the non-blinded dermatologist, only two patients
achieved complete healing of the lesions.</p><p>Regarding the patients' evaluation, most were highly satisfied with the improvement of
the lesions in both groups, with no statistically significant difference. When
considering the degree of improvement, more than half of the patients (54%) in the group
treated with 5-FU considered themselves to be fully healed, compared to 20% in the group
treated with DFS. The results, however, are different when assessing satisfaction in
relation to adverse effects. While 93.3% of the patients in the group treated with DFS
are highly satisfied, only 38.4% of the patients in the group treated with 5-FU have the
same opinion.</p><p>One possible limitation of our study was the lack of a histopathological confirmation of
the diagnosis of AK. Furthermore, it is important to note that the results are based on
a smaller sample than that calculated as appropriate for the study. Thus, the results
could mean a tendency, which could be confirmed if this requirement were met. As the
follow-up period of this study was short (eight weeks after completion of treatment), we
suggest that further studies with a longer follow-up period be carried out to assess the
permanence of the beneficial effects of the treatments.</p><p>It is important to mention that some factors observed in this study may characterize
information bias, such as the difficulty in evaluating the degree of improvement of the
lesions on the part of the blinded physician, who used photographic images only, and the
likely embarrassment of some patients in reporting, to the doctor, the adverse effects
experienced during the treatment as well as absence of improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Based on the results of this study, despite its limitations due to its sample size, we
conclude that both treatments were effective. However, when comparing the two
treatments, 5-FU had a tendency to be more effective.</p><p>Tolerability was lower in the group treated with 5-FU.</p><p>Patient satisfaction, considering improvement of the lesions, was high in both groups
and did not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups. A higher
percentage of patients considered their lesions to be healed in the group treated with
5-FU. However, regarding adverse effects, satisfaction was higher in the group treated
with DFS, which showed to be the treatment that was better tolerated by the
patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn01" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Financial support: none</p></fn><fn id="fn02" fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflict of interests: none</p></fn><fn id="fn03" fn-type="other"><p>* Work conducted at the Outpatient Clinic of Sanitary Dermatology (Ambulat&#x000f3;rio de
