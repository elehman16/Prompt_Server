Therefore, according to the mechanism of muscle contraction in vasospasm, using a drug which inhibits the release of calcium from intracellular sources is necessary. Although many studies have been conducted on the effect of this drug on the reduction of artery vasospasm,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] the result are not the same. available treatments for cerebral vasospasm are limited, consisting of hypervolemic hypertensive therapy and cerebral angiography with intervention, which have the risks of pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, stroke, vessel rupture with death and are labor-intensive and expensive.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Alternative treatments for cerebral vasospasm offer the hope of improving outcome.there is evidence that dantrolene is neuroprotective.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, there is no internal study that has examined the effects of these drugs in native patients. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of dantrolene on the reduction of vasospasm following from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) caused by cerebral aneurysm in AL-Zahra educational and medical center.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized double-blinded clinical trial study was conducted in AL-Zahra educational and medical center during 2011-2013 Isfahan/Iran. The studied population included patients with cerebral aneurysms who were admitted to the ICU. Inclusion criteria were all patients with cerebral aneurysms confirmed by angiography or CT angiography along with vasospasm conditions (these conditions include as follows (a) 50% increase in MFV (mean flow velocity (cm/s) is calculated as EDV (end diastolic velocity) plus one-third of the difference between PSV and EDV. the EDV lies between 20% and 50% of the PSV values) than basis MFV which is achieved in the first 24 hours of admission; (b) PSV (peak systolic velocity (cm/s) is the first peak on a transcranial Doppler wave form from each cardiac cycle) 200 cm/s or greater in MCA or ACA artery or 3 &#x0003c; Lindegaard (V MCA/V ICA &#x0003e;3 consistent with vasospasm) (17); (c) Psv &#x02265; 120 cm/s in the basilar or PCA artery; (d) any daily 100 cm/s PSV increase from the previous day; (e) a linear increase in MFV &#x02265;80 cm/s, older than 18 years, no pregnancy, no use of verapamil, no history of cirrhosis and negative hepatitis B and C. Also, patients with SAH caused by trauma and those who have high level of liver enzymes (alanine transferase greater than 165 units per liter, aspartate transferase greater than 120 units per liter and alkaline phosphatase greater than 345 units per liter) were excluded from the study. Sample size of the study was estimated through the Gehan sample size estimation table by considering the confidence level of 95%, test power of 80% and the consideration of 80% least significant difference at PSV before and after the injection of dantrolene which was considered and estimated in 16 patients in each group. The procedure was in a way that 32 patients with proven aneurysms who were admitted to the intensive care unit and had inclusion criteria were selected and randomly divided into two groups. Randomization of the samples was in this way that a ballot was taken in order to place the first patient in the first group and the next patients sequentially were distributed in the second until achieving the sufficient sample size. In all patients, daily transcranial Doppler sonography was performed and as soon as the diagnosis of vasospasm onset in the first group (target group), in addition to conventional treatment of vasospasm (infusion of normal saline 150-200 cc per hour, %5 albumin 250 cc every 6 hours, Nifedipine 60 mg tablets every 4 hours, and maintain the mean arterial blood pressure &#x0003e;100 mmHg and in the case of any need Dopamine and phenylephrine was used) 2.5 mg/kg Dantrolene was infused within 60 minutes and while the blood pressure and heart rate of patient were monitored and, arterial flow velocity changes i.e. PSV and MFV were measured by transcranial Doppler sonography in 45, 90 and 135 minutes. In the second group, which was considered as the control group, the conventional treatment of vasospasm was given to the patient and arterial flow velocity changes i.e., MFV and PSV were measured by transcranial Doppler sonography by the same technician and the results of two groups were compared. After the collection, data were entered into the computer and analyzed by SPSS version 22 and Chi-square, Student t, Mann-Whitney and ANOVA tests with repeated observations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, 32 patients with vasospasm were randomly distributed into two groups of 16; target group received dantrolene and the control group didn&#x02019;t receive dantrolene. The mean age of the patients in target and control groups was respectively 56.4 &#x000b1; 12.2 and 52 &#x000b1; 6.3 years; according to the T-test there was no significant difference between the age of groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.11). The female/male ratio in the target group was 10/6 and in the control group was 9/7 and according to the Chi-square test gender distribution was not significantly different in the two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.68). According to the results obtained, the aneurysm site in nine patients (28.1%) MCA, in seven patients (21.9%) ACOM, in nine patients (28.1%) PCOM, in three patients (9.4%) A1 in one patient (3.1%) carotid bifurcation, in two patients (6.3%) cavernos carotid and in one patient (3.1%) was A2. Frequency of aneurysm site in both target and control groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Fisher's exact test on the data showed no significant difference in the site of the aneurysm in these two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.89).

According to the results, the most common site of aneurysm in our study was PCOM, MCA and ACOM aneurysm (%78.1) but site distribution of aneurysm in these two groups was not significant. The age and sex distribution of patients in both groups had no significant difference; thus, the confounding effect of above factors in this study was neutralized and the observed results most likely related to the effect of the drug. According to the results obtained, the PSV index was not different between the two groups before treatment and amount of its changes was not significant up to 45 minutes between two groups, but in the 90<sup>th</sup> minute the difference between two groups reached to the significant level so that its average in the dantrolene receiving group was 120 &#x000b1; 27.4 and in the control group was 139 &#x000b1; 21 and this difference also existed in 135<sup>th</sup> minute but at the same time, the change process of PSV index while intervening period between two groups was not different. On the other hand, MFV index at the beginning of treatment and up to 45 minutes was not significant between two groups but at 90 and 135 minutes in the Dantrolene receiving group a more favorable decrease and changes between two groups were significant. In other words, the use of dantrolene in patients with cerebrovascular vasospasm can significantly affect the PSV and MFV patients. Other studies have also shown the anti-spasmodic nature of dantrolene and its impact on sarcoplasmic reticulum that inhibits the release of calcium from intracellular sources and thus reduces the contraction of vessel wall of muscle cells.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Soydan <italic>et al</italic>. study in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> rat model showed that the use of dantrolene with nimodipine, inhibits the vasoconstriction and significantly increases the efficacy of Dantrolene.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Also, in Muehschlegel study it was observed that the use of dantrolene reduces the vasospasm resulting from SAH.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The result of our study were in line with the results obtained by Muehlschlegel <italic>et al</italic>. in which it showed that the use of dantrolene can significantly reduce the MFV and PSV.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Therefore, the overall conclusion that can be derived from this study is that using of dantrolene in patients with artery vasospasm significantly reduced artery spasm and increased the patient recovery; therefore, if there is not contraindication for its use, according to the medical discretion its use in patients with vasospasm resulting from SAH caused by cerebral aneurysm is recommended.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hop</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Rinkel</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Algra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>van Gijn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Case - fatality rates and functional outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage: A systematic review</article-title><source>Stroke</source><year>1997</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>660</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9056628</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rosamond</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Flegal</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Furie</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Go</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Greenlund</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Haase</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>; American Heart Association Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics Subcommittee.
