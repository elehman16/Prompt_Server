The standard treatment of CAP has not changed for the past fifty years and its mortality and morbidity remain high despite adequate antimicrobial treatment. Systemic corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects and are therefore discussed as adjunct treatment for CAP. Available studies show controversial results, and the question about benefits and harms of adjunct corticosteroid therapy has not been conclusively resolved, particularly in the non-critical care setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This randomized multicenter study compares a treatment with 7&#x000a0;days of prednisone 50&#x000a0;mg with placebo in adult patients hospitalized with CAP independent of severity. Patients are screened and enrolled within the first 36&#x000a0;hours of presentation after written informed consent is obtained. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical stability, which is assessed every 12&#x000a0;hours during hospitalization. Secondary endpoints will be, among others, all-cause mortality within 30 and 180&#x000a0;days, ICU stay, duration of antibiotic treatment, disease activity scores, side effects and complications, value of adrenal function testing and prognostic hormonal and inflammatory biomarkers to predict outcome and treatment response to corticosteroids. Eight hundred included patients will provide an 85% power for the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This largest to date double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial investigates the effect of adjunct glucocorticoids in 800 patients with CAP requiring hospitalization. It aims to give conclusive answers about benefits and risks of corticosteroid treatment in CAP. The inclusion of less severe CAP patients will be expected to lead to a relatively low mortality rate and survival benefit might not be shown. However, our study has adequate power for the clinically relevant endpoint of clinical stability. Due to discontinuing glucocorticoids without tapering after seven days, we limit duration of glucocorticoid exposition, which may reduce possible side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>7 September 2009 on ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00973154">NCT00973154</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Corticosteroids</kwd><kwd>Community-acquired pneumonia</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary infection</kwd><kwd>Emergency medicine</kwd><kwd>Intensive care</kwd><kwd>Glucocorticoids</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Respiratory infections, consisting mainly of pneumonia, are the third leading infectious cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the main cause for sepsis and septic shock, both of which carry a high risk of long-term morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The standard treatment of CAP has not changed for the past 50&#x000a0;years, and its mortality and morbidity has remained high at 5 to 15% despite the availability of broad-spectrum antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Systemic corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] which, in CAP, attenuate the systemic inflammatory process which may have a detrimental impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] on the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, adjunct treatment with corticosteroids has been discussed since the 1950s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As early as 1955, favorable effects of corticosteroids were reported in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A small-sized multicenter randomized trial showed a significant reduction in hospital mortality in severe CAP with a seven-day continuous infusion of hydrocortisone (240&#x000a0;mg/day), although this study was not powered for mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Another large, but retrospective, single center study evaluated more than 300 patients and demonstrated in multivariable analysis that use of corticosteroids was associated with a lower mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. More recently, two randomized placebo-controlled trials involving 200 to 300 patients showed controversial results, one study showing no benefit of adjunct prednisolone treatment and one study showing a significant reduction in duration of hospital stay using dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Three systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and one meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] concluded that the available evidence suggests that administration of corticosteroids in patients with CAP might be beneficial. However, a large and adequately powered randomized trial is warranted to support or refute this beneficial effect before recommendations can be made with regard to use of corticosteroids in the treatment of CAP. In addition, as the potential harmful effects of corticosteroids in high-dose and long-term treatment are well-known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], special attention has to be given to the side effects of corticosteroid treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Objective and design</title><p>The objective of this trial is to evaluate whether treatment with prednisone for seven days in patients with CAP as compared to placebo reduces time to clinical stability.</p><p>This is a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Eligible patients are asked for their informed consent and are then centrally randomized to either 50&#x000a0;mg prednisone or to placebo, taken orally for 7&#x000a0;days in a ratio of 1:1. If the patient is not able to give informed consent at the time of hospitalization due to severity of CAP, informed consent from next of kin and an independent physician is obtained.

Our primary hypothesis is that adjunct corticosteroid treatment in patients with CAP will result in a reduced time to clinical stability compared to placebo treatment. To estimate the frequency of our primary endpoint, we used data of CAP patients from our completed studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] which were performed in the same study centers. Based on these previous trials, we assumed a mortality rate of 10% in the placebo group and 7.5% in the corticosteroid group over 14&#x000a0;days of follow-up with a proportion of 75% survivors being clinically stable after 7&#x000a0;days in the corticosteroid group. Estimating a decrease in the risk of non-stability after 1&#x000a0;week among survivors by 25% through adjunct corticosteroids, a sample size of 800 patients followed for at least 14&#x000a0;days after randomization will be needed to achieve a statistical power of 85% and a sample size of 700 patients to achieve a statistical power of 80% (2-sided type 1 error of 5% in both scenarios). We intend to recruit 800 study patients from December 2009 to April 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Intention-to-treat and per-protocol population</title><p>Following the intention-to-treat principle, all patients receiving at least one dose of study medication will be included in the analysis with group allocation as randomized; patients violating inclusion criteria or meeting exclusion criteria due to information that was not available at study entry will be excluded post randomization in a blinded manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Criteria for exclusion of patients from the per-protocol analysis are, in addition, withdrawal of informed consent or non-compliance with study medication or the concomitant procedures. Therefore, patients stopping or pausing the study medication at any time point, be it due to corticosteroid contraindications or due to active indication for glucocorticoid treatment, will not be considered in the per-protocol analysis. A patient will not be followed up if he withdraws informed consent for all study measures; in all other cases, follow-up will be performed as planned.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We will enter all relevant clinical and laboratory data obtained by interview, clinical tests, and reviewing of the medical records into an online database. Statistical Analysis System (SAS&#x000ae; Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R for Windows (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) and STATA 9.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) will be used for data analysis.</p><p>The primary analysis population is the full analysis set which includes the intention-to-treat population. Every effort will be made to minimize the number of losses to follow-up by recording phone numbers before discharge, thereafter by repetitive follow-up calls by home or cell phone contact, or alternatively by contacting the primary care physician. For the primary outcome of time to clinical stability, we consider losses to follow-up in this sample of hospitalized patients as unlikely. If losses to follow-up do occur, patients will be censored at time of last assessment for clinical stability. A secondary analysis population, the per-protocol population, will exclude patients not treated according to the protocol (that is protocol violators). For the primary endpoint, we will calculate an unadjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval by means of a Cox proportional hazards model. The primary objective is to show superiority of the corticosteroid group at a 2-sided 5% alpha-level with 85% power following the intention-to-treat principle. As a sensitivity analysis, the primary analysis will be repeated on the per-protocol patient population. As a further sensitivity analysis, a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted with treatment group, patient age, and PSI scores as independent variables. This model will adjust the treatment effect for the potentially important confounders age and PSI score. Moreover, we plan to investigate whether the treatment effect varies among different degrees of severity of CAP (low-risk group: PSI I to III, and high-risk group: PSI IV to V), between patients with and without underlying COPD, and between bacteremic versus non-bacteremic patients. COPD will be defined by post-bronchodilator spirometric criteria, according to the GOLD guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], as a FEV1/FVC ratio below 70% and the severity categorized according to the GOLD criteria. In patients with a clinical history of COPD or smoking, lung function at the time of inclusion will not be mandatory. We will conduct the pre-specified subgroup analyses by including appropriate interaction terms in the above described multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.Complete case analyses will be used for secondary endpoints. For all secondary endpoints, we will calculate unadjusted and adjusted estimates of the effect size and corresponding 95% confidence intervals using linear, logistic, or Cox proportional hazards regression (as appropriate).

Corticosteroids have been proved to block several arms of the inflammatory cascade. Available evidence so far, derived from a few, mainly small randomized controlled trials, suggests that corticosteroid treatment might be beneficial in terms of survival in patients with CAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Most studies showing a beneficial effect of corticosteroids in patients with CAP only included severe pneumonia, as defined with a PSI class IV and V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In these patients, reviews and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] pointed to a possible benefit of corticosteroids on either length of stay or mortality without evidence of more complications. However, insufficient data on non-severe CAP are available. Recently, two randomized double-blind controlled trials including 200 to 300 patients with all severities of CAP found controversial results: the first study using 40&#x000a0;mg of prednisolone for seven days showed no effect on time to clinical stability, with a higher rate of late failure in the corticosteroid group, defined by recurrence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia after 72&#x000a0;hours of admission after an initially beneficial response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The second study using 4&#x000a0;days of 5&#x000a0;mg of dexamethasone intravenously showed a significantly shorter duration of hospital stay in patients treated with corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In view of these controversial findings, a large prospective and adequately powered trial should conclusively determine the risks and benefits of adding corticosteroids to the treatment of patients with CAP.</p><p>In the current trial, we will include all severity levels of CAP (PSI I to V) requiring hospitalization. This will lead to a lower mortality rate than observed in previous studies only including severe CAP patients, and our study will not be powered to show a survival benefit. We therefore chose as primary endpoint time to clinical stability, which is a less stringent but still clinically relevant endpoint. By reducing the time to clinical stability and consecutively also length of stay (LOS), nosocomial complications like infections, thrombembolic events, worsening of pre-existing frailty or delirium may be prevented. This leads to better allocation of resources at the hospital and to a marked reduction of costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. While Meijvis <italic>et al</italic>. looked at LOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], our primary endpoint will be time to clinical stability, as defined by IDSA/ATS guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As we have previously observed, LOS itself in community-acquired pneumonia may be confounded and prolonged by medical or organizational problems unrelated to CAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We believe that by measuring time to clinical stability, we will be looking at a clinically relevant parameter, as patients are able to switch to oral antibiotics and ready for discharge once they reach stability.</p><p>Inclusion of all patients with CAP will increase the generalizability of the findings and allow retrospective evaluation in exploratory analyses as to which patients indeed profited most from corticosteroid treatment.</p><p>In our study, we administer an oral dose of 50&#x000a0;mg prednisone for 7&#x000a0;days without tapering. We opted for an oral formula, as the bioavailability of oral prednisone is excellent, it may be ground and is therefore applicable in patients not able to swallow, such as in patients on mechanical ventilation or older-aged patients. Furthermore, by choosing a uniform application formula, further bias, like the ability to blind and to secure provision of blinded study medication 24&#x000a0;hours on 7&#x000a0;days per week, was prevented.</p><p>The ideal choice and duration of corticosteroid treatment in critically ill patients and patients with CAP is currently disputed. Hydrocortisone is the natural corticosteroid and was used in some studies in critically ill patients, partly together with a mineralocorticoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Most patients in our study, however, will not suffer from critical illness and will be hospitalized outside the ICU on the wards where oral intake of treatment is preferred. Since hydrocortisone is only available in 10&#x000a0;mg tablets, patients would have to take 20 tablets a day, which does not appear feasible. Methylprednisolone and prednisolone have also been used in some studies including patients with CAP and ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], putting it forward as an alternative formulation for our study, as adequate oral formulations are available. Prednisolone is the pharmacologically active metabolite of prednisone, which was used in this study; both are used interchangeably except in patients with severe liver insufficiency, where prednisolone is preferred. Dexamethasone was not recommended by guidelines for use in septic shock and ARDS at the time of study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, a recent study showed a reduced length of hospital stay in CAP patients treated with dexamethasone as compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], also putting it forward as a possible type of corticosteroid in patients with CAP. The additional use of fludrocortisone as in the study by Annane <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] is currently considered optional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, the optimal duration of glucocorticoid treatment and mode of discontinuing (tapering or not) is not known and heavily disputed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>In high-dose glucocorticoid studies, which used as high as 1 to 3&#x000a0;g hydrocortisone per day, short-term complications, such as co- and re-infections, led to excess mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In so-called low- or physiological-dose glucocorticoid studies with 100 to 300&#x000a0;mg hydrocortisone-equivalent per day, the main adverse effects included hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and rebound pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although confusion, co-infection and gastrointestinal side effects were reported in association with glucocorticoid treatment, the incidence was not significantly higher in the steroid group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. While some authors advise five days of glucocorticoid treatment in critically ill patients without tapering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], others recommend tapering of glucocorticoids to avoid a rebound of inflammatory markers with consecutive rebound pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. However, it has been shown that glucocorticoids given&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;seven days lead to a worse clinical course measured by length of stay, clinical stability and mechanical ventilation, and more systemic complications when looking at shock and cardiac arrhythmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. From COPD studies, there is evidence that stopping glucocorticoids without tapering is safe without an increased recurrence rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. For these reasons, we decided against tapering of the glucocorticoid dose in order not to prolong glucocorticoid exposure.</p><p>In conclusion, this current large and adequately powered randomized trial will determine the risks and benefits of adding 50&#x000a0;mg of prednisone for 7&#x000a0;days to the treatment of hospitalized patients with CAP. Our hypothesis is that corticosteroid treatment will result in a reduced time to clinical stability in CAP compared to placebo treatment.</p><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>The results of this trial may only be valid for the specific type, dose and duration of glucocorticoid studied.</p><p>This study is powered for clinical stability, but not for mortality; at least 4,000 patients would be needed to be powered to detect a clinically relevant difference in mortality.</p><p>Furthermore, we also included lower severity CAP patients, which might weaken the effect of glucocorticoids. A conclusion for ICU patients might not be possible as the number of these patients included will be low. There is an ongoing ICU multicenter study (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT01448109) aiming for the goal of 4,000 patients that will hopefully answer this question for ICU patients with CAP.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting.
