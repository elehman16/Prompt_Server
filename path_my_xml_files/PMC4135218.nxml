motor group exercise based on motor development on chronic stroke patients&#x02019; joint, bone,
muscle, and motor functions and activities of daily living. [Subjects] Twenty-eight stroke
patients hospitalized at P municipal nursing facility for the severely handicapped were
randomly assigned to the gross motor group exercise group (experimental group, n=14) or
the control group (n=14). [Methods] The two groups performed morning exercise led by a
trainer for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 6 weeks in total. The experimental group
performed a gross motor group exercise in addition to this exercise for 50 minutes a day,
3 times a week for 6 weeks in total. Before the experiment, all subjects were measured
with the Modified Barthel Index (MBI) and for their neuromuscular skeletal and
motor-related functions according to the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health. [Results] Significant improvements were found in the experimental
group&#x02019;s neuromusculoskeletal and motor-related functions and MBI test, except for the
stability of joint functions. The control group showed no significant difference from the
initial evaluation. [Conclusion] The gross motor group exercise based on motor development
is recommended for chronic stroke patients with severe handicaps.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic stroke</kwd><kwd>Group exercise</kwd><kwd>ICF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional damage in stroke patients varies with regard to kind and level of seriousness,
requiring a more systematic and consistent functional evaluation. The World Health
Organization presented the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
Health (ICF) as a systematic tool and unified standard classification to express the status
of health and related matters<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ICF is
closely correlated with other existing other evaluation tools but is capable of further
explaining the kind and seriousness of a stroke patient&#x02019;s damage. Thus, it can be utilized
as an evaluation tool for functionality status<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies for improving joint and bone function, muscle function, and motor function in
stroke patients have been carried out. Previous studies on gross motor exercise using object
grasping<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and task-oriented training
focused on specific functional task performance by associating the musculoskeletal system
with the nervous system<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and Bobath&#x02019;s
techniques, which are well known as neurodevelopmental treatments, have proved the
effectiveness of these treatment methods. However, the effects of combined therapy composed
of gross motor exercise, task-oriented training, and neurodevelopmental treatment have not
been studied. Our hypothesis is that task-oriented gross motor group exercise that matches
the neurodevelopment stage is more effective.</p><p>Given the above, the present study sought to suggest an effective exercise method to
improve the joint, bone, muscle, and motor functions and performance of activities of daily
living (ADL) in stroke by assessment with the ICF tool.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study examined 28 stroke patients hospitalized in P municipal nursing center for the

were at least 5&#x02005;years after their stroke diagnosis, 2) those whose brain lesions degree was
1 or 2, 3) those whose Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean (MMSE-K) score was 20 or more,
and 4) those who understood the research experiment and were capable of communication.</p><p>This research was approved by the Sahmyook University&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board, and
informed consent was received from the subjects after providing them with a sufficient
explanation of the study.</p><p>This study was a single-blind study. The two groups underwent evaluation of joint and bone
function, muscle function, and motor function both before and after the experiment by
referring to the neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions in Chapter 7 of the ICF
and evaluation of their self-reliance in ADL by using the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). Both
of the groups performed morning exercise led by a trainer. For the morning exercise, the
subjects performed a video-based exercise program with the assistance of a trainer. They
performed the exercise program on their own bed in the morning for 30 minutes in total; the
program comprised an introduction, warm-up, flexibility and muscle exercise, and cool-down
segments, respectively, and included repetition. The actions performed included hand
clapping, clapping the back of the hands, trunk twists, back/leg stretches, shoulder
movements, and breathing.</p><p>The experimental group additionally performed the gross muscle group exercise for 50
minutes a day, 3 times a week for 6 weeks in total. The gross muscle exercise program
comprised the 1st phase of the sensorimotor stage (ages from 0 to 2), 2nd phase of
pre-operational stage (ages from 2 to 7), 3rd phase of the concrete operational stage (ages
from 7 to 11), and 4th phase of the formal operational stage (ages from 11 and over) based
on Piaget&#x02019;s cognitive development theory. Each phase consisted of elements such as power,
balance maintenance, transfer ability, and coordination. Thresholds for the study were built
for 6 areas: personal daily activity self-reliance, social sentiment, language development,
cognitive ability, gross motor ability, and fine motor ability development.</p><p>The results of this study were processed by SPSS ver. 12.0 to produce means and standard
deviations. Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed-ranks test and the paired t-test were conducted to compare the
groups&#x02019; pre- and post-experimental differences. To analyze the difference between the
groups, the independent t-test and Mann-Whitney test were run as well. The level of
significance was chosen as 5% for all statistical analyses.</p><p>The MBI was employed to assess ADL of the subjects. Items from Chapter 7 of the ICF for
neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions were used. Their subitems included
joint, bone, muscle, and motor function. This assessment tool has a high correlation with
other tools along with higher validity and has proved to be a useful evaluation device for a
stroke patient&#x02019;s functional status<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The gross motor group exercise group was found to have significantly increased MBI results,

post-training mobility of joint function, mobility of bone function, muscle power function,
muscle tone function, muscle endurance function, control of voluntary movement, and MBI test
(p&#x0003c;0.05). But no significant change was observed in stability of joint function.</p><p>The cause of movement disorder in stroke patients was considered to be spasticity until
recently, and thus spasticity treatment has been dominant. But more recently, the focus has
been placed on improving muscle strength, joint mobility, etc., to reach a normal level<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effect of elevated muscle strength was
larger on early-stage stroke patients and then decreased with stroke period<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there have been reports of a
strength improvement effect in chronic stroke cases<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the subjects had
been chronic stroke cases for 9&#x02005;years on average after stroke occurrence, and their muscular
function (b730&#x02013;b749) was improved significantly through the 6-week motor development-based
task-oriented gross motor group exercise. Similar to previous studies, the task in this
study was composed of power (strength of power) elements and muscular function. For this
reason, it is considered to have influenced muscular function.</p><p>The task-oriented program is a kind of treatment designed based on motor learning theory
and has been reported to trigger a sufficient amount of cortical sense stimulation in an
undamaged cortical circuit together with the damaged part and its adjacent areas to
facilitate terminal sprouting or functional connection reorganization<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Intentional and complicated multi-joint movements such as
object grasping require many components contributing to performance such as object gazing,
stretching hands out to the object, posture stabilization, and balance maintenance. Such
complicated components need to be controlled and coordinated by central regulation to be
aligned for the same movement goal<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
a way for task-oriented training, a previous study used a chair with an adjustable height to
let the subjects step on and grasp food stuff on a shelf<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Their results were measured 4 and 12 weeks later, respectively, and
the group that received stretch training showed improvement in symmetric weight
distribution. This indicates that diverse components such as stretching a hand out to an
object, posture stabilization, and balance maintenance were coordinated for the same single
movement goal.</p><p>In this study, we found significant changes in the control of simple voluntary movement
(b7600), control of complex voluntary movement (b7601), coordination of voluntary movement
(b7602), and supportive function of the arm or leg (b7603). Such results, as shown in
previous studies, were possible because the present study&#x02019;s tasks were constructed with
coordination activities and because the efforts of the patients to pass the acceptance
criteria of these task affected the coordination function.</p><p>The stability of joint function test in this study, means the function to support the
structural frame of joints. This study found no significant change in joint stability
function from before and after the training intervention. This was possibly because
9.42&#x02005;years had passed on average since stroke occurrence. Suffering from power imbalance for
a long time caused them to experience structural changes or soft tissue property
changes.</p><p>When a stroke patient was trained with a task-oriented program, they showed significant
improvements in ADL, independent activities, bowel control, and transfer<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, a significant change was observed
in MBI score, and this was due to the task structure in this study, which was comprised of
sitting by placing an arm on the floor, standing up for a while alone, holding an object and
moving it to the other hand, standing up by using a support, standing up on one leg,
throwing away an object, and kicking a ball standing still, which is helpful for ADL
performance.</p><p>As this study looked into patients with first- and second-grade brain lesions only, it
would be difficult to generalize the study findings to all handicapped patients with brain
lesions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Stucki</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Cieza</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Melvin</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The International Classification of Functioning,
