among mirror therapy, integrated volitional-control electrical stimulation, therapeutic
electrical stimulation, repetitive facilitative exercises, and the standard training
method in post-stroke hemiplegia patients. [Subjects and Methods] Eighty one stroke
patients admitted to a convalescent rehabilitation ward were randomly allocated to the
above 5 treatment groups. Each patient performed functional training of the paralytic
lower limb for 20 minutes a day for 4 weeks, and changes in the lower limb function were
investigated using the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set. [Results] The hip and knee joint
functions did not significantly improve in the standard training control group, but
significant improvements were observed after 4 weeks in the other intervention groups.
Significant improvement was noted in the ankle joint function in all groups. [Conclusion]
Although the results were influenced by spontaneous recovery and the standard training in
the control group, the hip and knee joints were more markedly improved by the
interventions in the other 4 groups of patients with moderate paralysis, compared to the
control group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Motor paralysis</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Regarding rehabilitation of stroke patients, many studies reported improvement of

review of therapy for lower limb paralysis that an intervention combining different
approaches, such as a combination of gait training and muscle-strengthening exercise, is
more effective than waiting for spontaneous recovery without training. However, they
concluded that there is no evidence to identify a training method as effective among the
various methods available.</p><p>Regarding rehabilitation of stroke patients with lower limb motor paralysis, Sutbeyaz et
al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that mirror therapy of the
lower limbs improved motor paralysis and the walking ability on the paralytic side in stroke
patients, Merletti et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
therapeutic electrical stimulation of the ankle joint flexors improved motor paralysis of

the hip, knee, and ankle joints performed 100 times a day improved motor paralysis of the
lower limb and increased the muscle force on bending and extending the knee joint in stroke
patients.</p><p>Most previous studies compared the intervention and control groups, as described below, and
did not investigate which of the various training methods is effective.</p><p>In this study, to clarify differences in the motor paralysis-improving effect, the
following 4 interventions recently reported to be effective were compared with regard to
treatment of the paralytic lower limb in post-stroke hemiplegia patients, setting a control

admitted to a convalescent rehabilitation ward of our hospital between September 2009 and
July 2011 who did not meet the exclusion criteria described below. Attending physicians
explained the study to all patients meeting these conditions and their families, and
obtained consent. This study was performed after approval (No. 46) by the Ethics Committee
of our hospital.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: the time to admission from the onset is within 14 days,
difficult communication due to severe cognitive disorder, comorbidity index of 4 or
higher<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, necessity of high-level
consideration and caution for rehabilitation, and scores of Hip-flexion, Knee-extension, and
Foot-pat items of the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> lower than 2.</p><p>For the study design, a randomized controlled study by random allocation was adopted. In
randomization, the patients were allocated in the order of entry using a table of random
numbers. The training methods of the 5 groups were MT, IVES, TES, RFEs, and standard
training (control group: Con), respectively. The standard training was comprised of range of
motion and ADL training, and the training methods received by the other 4 groups were not
employed. This study attached greater importance to the balance with ADL training. Training
that can be completed within 20 minutes a day and has been reported to be effective by
studies on motor paralysis and randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving hemiplegia
patients was adopted. The time for physical, occupational, and speech therapies was set to
one hour each, and the assigned training method was performed during physical therapy to
standardize the training time. When no speech therapy was prescribed, the conventional
physical or occupational therapy was performed.</p><p>In MT, a self-made device was placed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>*Caption missing*</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-2947-g001"/></fig>, and the patients performed 3 types of exercise for 20 minutes (dorsiflexion of the
ankle joint, stepping over, and abduction/adduction of the hip joint) while reflecting the
non-paralytic lower limb in the mirror. On ankle dorsiflexion, the patients were instructed
to perform dorsiflexion of the non-paralytic ankle and simultaneously move the paralytic
side, during which the heel of the paralytic side was pressed to fix the leg position. The
patients performed 4 sets of 50 repetitions of this motion at a comfortable rhythm. On
stepping over, the patients stepped on and down from a wooden block in front (the square
timber on which the mirror was placed) with the non-paralytic leg. They were instructed to
imagine moving the paralytic side, not actually try to move it, and performed 2 sets of 50
repetitions of this motion at a comfortable rhythm. Abduction/adduction of the hip joint was
performed on the non-paralytic side, and the patients were instructed to simultaneously
imagine moving the paralytic side. Two sets of 50 repetitions of this motion were
performed.</p><p>In IVES, dorsiflexion of the ankle joint and extension of the knee joint on the paralytic
side were performed for 10 minutes, respectively, while sitting on a chair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>*Caption missing*</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-2947-g002"/></fig>), and electrical stimulation (low frequency) with 50 &#x003bc;s pulse width, 20 Hz frequency
bidirectional square waves was applied at an intensity proportional to the voluntary
myoelectric activity level on the paralytic side using the power assist mode of the Power
Assist Stimulator system (OG Giken, Okayama, Japan). All patients performed the exercise at
a comfortable timing. When movement paused and no voluntary electromyogram was detected,
electrical stimulation at the muscle contractile threshold was applied to facilitate
voluntary movement. The electrode was attached to the anterior tibial muscle on ankle
dorsiflexion, and rectus femoris and medial great muscles on knee extension.</p><p>In TES, electrical stimulation with 50 &#x003bc;s pulse width, 20 Hz frequency bidirectional square
waves was applied at the maximum acceptable intensity during 10 minutes each of paralytic
ankle dorsiflexion and knee extension exercises using the normal mode of the Power Assist
Stimulator system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Training scene of TES</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-2947-g003"/></fig>). A 5-second cycle comprised of 2 seconds of turning on and 3 seconds of turning off
electricity was repeated, and the patients performed voluntary movement when the electricity
was turned on. The electrodes were attached to the same sites as in IVES.</p><p>RFEs are treatment aiming at reconstructing and strengthening the motor descending tract
through repeating intentional movements of patients using the stretch reflex. The patients
performed ankle dorsiflexion 100 or more times during a 10-minute period in a supine
position using manual tapping stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.

exercise, extension/abduction-flexion/adduction exercise, and hip
extension/abduction/retention of external rotation/knee extension-hip
flexion/adduction/external rotation/knee flexion exercise in the remaining 10 minutes.</p><p>In Con (Standard training), only range of passive motion training and active assistive
movement other than the above 4 training methods were performed as functional training. In
addition, especial physical agents and facilitation techniques were not used. As for motion
exercise, physical therapy centering on the standard gait, standing, balance and ADL
training were performed. These training ratio has not been determined.</p><p>The SIAS Hip-Flexion, Knee-Extension, and Foot-Pat items were evaluated on admission and
after 4 weeks by the attending physicians and physical therapists. Patient information, such
as the age, gender, diagnosis, paralytic side, and time after onset, were investigated in
the medical records, and the mean number of physical therapy units performed per day in the
period from admission to 4 weeks was calculated.</p><p>Changes in the SIAS Hip-Flexion, Knee-Extension, and Foot-Pat scores over the 4 weeks from
admission were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. The gains were calculated by
subtracting the SIAS Hip-Flexion, Knee-Extension, and Foot-Pat scores on admission from
those at 4 weeks. These gains, the age, time after onset, and mean number of physical
therapy units performed were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the gender ratio
and rates of the paralytic side and diagnosis were compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
test.</p><p>For statistical analysis, SPSS version 16.0 for Mac (IBM Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was
used, and the significance level was set at less than 5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the initiation of training, 3, 6, 2, 2, and 1 patient dropped out from the MT, IVES,

limb, significant improvement of ADL and functional disorder with an increase in the
training time was noted, but the training method and level of intervention required have not
been clarified<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the
duration of physical therapy was the same in all groups, suggesting that factors other than
the training time influenced the improvement of paralysis. Since the interventions were
designed based on therapies reported to be effective<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, patients with a score of 2 or
higher in each of Hip-Flexion, Knee-Extension, Foot-Pat were selected. Thus, no patient with
severe paralysis was included.</p><p>Hip-Flexion and Knee-Extension significantly improved over the period from admission to 4
weeks in all 4 intervention groups excluding the control group. Improvement of lower limb
paralysis by MT, TES, and RFEs compared to the control group has been reported<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Significant improvement was also noted in
our study, clarifying that TES, MT, and RFEs improve lower limb paralysis. For IVES, no
study on improvement of lower limb paralysis has been performed, and its effect and
application criteria have not been clarified. Barth E et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that application of EMG-triggering electrical stimulation
during ankle dorsiflexion increased the range of active motion compared to those before
intervention in stroke patients, and Miyasaka et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that IVES applied to post-stroke hemiplegic upper limbs
improved paralysis in patients in whom voluntary contraction was detected. In our study,
patients with a detectable voluntary electromyogram were included in the IVES group,
suggesting that IVES is effective to improve paralysis in these patients. Since the patients
targeted by us are in the convalescent stage, the motor function may readily recover
spontaneously, but functional training of the hip and knee joints on the paralytic side may
more markedly improve the functions than spontaneous recovery.</p><p>On the Foot-Pat test, significant improvement was noted over the period from admission to 4
weeks in all groups, clarifying that there was no efficacy to improve paralysis in the
intervention groups. We provide a 3-hour training session per day, 7 days a week, and the
frequency and intensity of training are sufficient<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effect on the ankle joint may have been influenced by the
frequency and intensity of the standard training. The effects of the interventions were
noted only in the hip and knee joints, and this may have been due to the anatomy of these
joints: these attach to larger muscles than those attached by the ankle joint, in which the
effect of facilitation may be more easily obtained.</p><p>Based on our results, there were no significantly different effects among the 4 methods for
the hip and knee joint. However, between our evaluation of the admission and 4 week, there
was a significant change in the 4 method groups while there was no significance in the
control group. These differences of the course demonstrate the superiority of 4 intervention
methods to standard training in control group. For the ankle joint, it may be necessary to
develop a training method readily achieving facilitation, and increase the training time for
paralysis.</p><p>No significant difference was observed among the intervention groups. The interventions
were designed to complete in a short time (20 minutes) within the limited training time to
fit in the range allowable by the Japanese medical payment system. To obtain clear
differences in improvement, it may be necessary to investigate extension of the training
time. Moreover, it was unclear whether or not the patients performed voluntary training in
addition to therapy by therapists, and the content of voluntary training was also unclear.
These may have an influence on improvement of the motor function. It may be necessary to
investigate the content of training other than the specified intervention.</p><p>We are planning to investigate the selection of functional training corresponding to the
severity of paralysis and ratio of training time for paralysis to construct a system to
synergistically improve the functions and ADL.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Iwai</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Aoyagi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Tokuhisa</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The gaps between capability ADL and performance ADL of
