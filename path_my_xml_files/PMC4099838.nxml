Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized trial of target glucose ranges 5&#x02013;7 mmol/l or 8&#x02013;10 mmol/l.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>A 15-bed medical&#x02013;surgical ICU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We randomized patients ages &#x0003e;18 years if they were expected to be in the ICU for &#x0003e;72 hours and had serum glucose &#x0003e;10 mmol/l. Patients were excluded if they had diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, liver disease, or were palliative. Patients had concealed allocation to a target glucose range of 5&#x02013;7 mmol/l or 8&#x02013;10 mmol/l. Arterial catheters were used for sampling. Dedicated glucometers were calibrated daily to the laboratory measurement. We used enteral nutrition as early as possible; total parenteral nutrition was used in five patients. Insulin SC and oral hypoglycemic agents were prohibited. We mixed 50 U Humulin R in 50 ml 0.9% NaCl and began infusions at 0.5 U/hour; infusions were titrated according to pretested algorithms. Preceding this pilot was a survey of ICU staff, a glucometer reliability study, and a multidisciplinary educational program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The feasibility sample size was 20 patients. The APACHE II score was 32 (10.2); 14 were insulin-dependent pre-ICU, and all 20 patients were medical admissions. A total of 758 of 1607 values (47.2%) were in the 5&#x02013;7 mmol/l range, and 256 of 660 values (40.2%) were in the 8&#x02013;10 mmol/l range. Glucose &#x0003c; 2.5 mmol/l developed nine times; treatment included 0.5 A 50 g dextrose/100 ml H<sub>2</sub>O on six occasions and stopping the insulin infusion in each case. No adverse consequences were observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In ICU patients with high illness severity, glucose values were in two target ranges most of the time, using well-accepted initiation and maintenance insulin infusion algorithms. A large randomized trial of glycemic control is feasible in this population, examining clinically important outcomes. However, this will require more intensive measures to achieve target values.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowedgements</title><p>Supported by the Father Sean O'Sullivan Research Center, St Joseph's Hospital, Hamilton, Canada and Abbott Laboratories.</p></sec></back></article>
