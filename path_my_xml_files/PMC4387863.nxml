To do so, we examined whether the subjective evaluation of a target image is influenced by the valence of its preceding image, and/or its overall position in a sequence of images. Furthermore, we assessed if these potentially confounding contextual effects can be moderated by a common procedural control: randomized stimulus presentation. Four groups of participants evaluated the same set of 120 pictures from the International Affective System (IAPS) presented in four different sequences. Our data reveal strong effects of both aspects of temporal context in all presentation sequences, modified only slightly in their nature and magnitude. Furthermore, this was true for both valence and arousal ratings. Subjective ratings of negative target images were influenced by temporal context most strongly across all sequences. We also observed important gender differences: females expressed greater sensitivity to temporal-context effects and design manipulations relative to males, especially for negative images. Our results have important implications for future emotion research that employs normative picture stimuli, and contributes to our understanding of context effects in general.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>emotion</kwd><kwd>temporal context</kwd><kwd>presentation sequence</kwd><kwd>assimilation effect</kwd><kwd>contrast effect</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7545"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our evaluation of events is influenced profoundly by the context in which we encounter them (Barrett and Kensinger, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Anderson et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Barrett et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A long history of psychological research has demonstrated that our perception and attitude towards a given stimulus is altered by preceding or simultaneously presented stimuli. Evidence for such context effects has accumulated in a variety of literatures, such as those concerning perception (Brown, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1953</xref>; Parducci, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Ricci and Chatterjee, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Sarris, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), attitude measurement (Wittenbrink et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Blair, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), social cognition (Sherif and Hovland, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>; Herr, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Bless and Schwarz, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Todd et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and evaluative judgments (e.g., Zellner et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Cogan et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In particular, two kinds of context effects are reported consistently: contrast and assimilation. The former refers to diverging evaluations of two similar stimuli presented successively, while the latter involves the comparable evaluation of a target and its preceding stimulus despite their dissimilarity (Zellner et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p><p>Such <italic>temporal-context effects</italic> could present an important confound in research that seeks to quantify objectively an individual's affective response to emotional stimuli, especially since subjective evaluations (i.e., ratings) are the standard measurement for stimulus differentiation and selection. Surprisingly, however, the influence of temporal context on subjective emotional experience has not yet been addressed comprehensively. The present study set out to investigate the degree to which temporal context influences our experience of emotional stimuli, and to identify any variables that might modify such confounding effects.</p><p>Previous research suggests that temporal-context effects are indeed present during emotion processing (e.g., Flaisch et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Larsen and Norris, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Barrett and Kensinger, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). A series of studies have demonstrated that electro-cortical, autonomic and behavioral responses elicited by positive, negative, and indifferent<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref> images differ when they are preceded by emotional (positive and negative) compared with indifferent verbal descriptions (i.e., appraisal frames; Foti and Hajcak, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; MacNamara et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Such relativity of subjective evaluations of target images as a function of their preceding stimuli can be also inferred from studies that investigate affective priming: target emotional images are processed more efficiently (i.e., faster) when preceded by a prime with congruent relative to incongruent valence (e.g., Herring et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The opposite is true for primes with incongruent valence, whereby interference effects can be observed at the neurophysiological (Klauer and Musch, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and behavioral level (Herring et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, however, the majority of these studies only contrasted emotional with indifferent stimuli, and focused predominantly on psycho- and neuro-physiological responses. Either no information on subjective evaluations of target images was acquired due to the method of presentation (e.g., short stimulus durations; Flaisch et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>), or it is limited to basic contrasts between specific valence categories (i.e., positive, negative, and indifferent; Schupp et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) that are unlikely to detect subtle differences in evaluations. To the best of our knowledge, only Fujimura et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) investigated the effect of temporal context in psychophysiological and subjective responses to emotional stimuli, and performed contrasts between <italic>all</italic> valence groups. These authors report context-related modulations in both levels of measurement, especially when the temporal context involved negative preceding stimuli.</p><p>Research findings are far from consistent, however; other research indicates that emotional images are processed independently of the preceding context (Pastor et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Schupp et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Specifically, some studies report that while indifferent stimuli are vulnerable to context manipulations (Pastor et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; MacNamara et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), the processing of emotional stimuli is driven purely by the valence of the target image rather than its temporal context (Pastor et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Schupp et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, it is generally assumed that any potentially confounding effects of temporal context are controlled by using a random presentation sequence. Indeed, this is the approach taken by many studies, usually with a constraint of no more than two or three stimuli of the same valence category presented successively to avoid mood induction (e.g., Bradley et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2001a</xref>; Bublatzky et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The assumption that random presentation sequences minimize the confounding influence of temporal-context effects has not yet been tested empirically, however, nor is it clear what form of randomization is optimal&#x02014;a sequence randomized for each participant individually, or the same randomized sequence presented to all participants. Determining the effectiveness of different presentation sequences vis-a-vis their efficacy in accounting for temporal-context effects should therefore provide valuable information for the design of future experimental procedures.</p><p>An additional contextual factor likely to influence subjective evaluations is the number of stimuli encountered prior to a target. Studies that present the same stimuli repeatedly report habituation, whereby subjective ratings of valence and arousal become less extreme over time (Codispoti et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Wendt et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). On the other hand, repeated presentation of the same valence category&#x02014;and for negative images especially&#x02014;is reported to result in an increase in affective responses (&#x0201c;sensitization&#x0201d;; Bradley et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Since studies vary considerably with respect to the number of stimuli presented, the duration of their presentation, and the overall length of the experimental procedure, defining more precisely the time-course of subjective evaluations&#x02014;and any temporal-context effects&#x02014;would also offer valuable recommendations for future emotion research. Furthermore, since both normative valence and arousal ratings are considered when selecting stimuli for experimental studies, future emotion research will benefit from understanding how contextual influences modulate each dimension separately.</p><p>Finally, large inter-individual variability in the evaluation of emotional stimuli (see Hamann and Canli, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and subjective emotional experiences in general (Kuppens et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), should be considered when investigating context effects. Gender differences in the perception of emotionally evocative stimuli are reported consistently (Bradley et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2001b</xref>; Gard and Kring, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lithari et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), with evidence suggesting a greater sensitivity toward highly arousing negative stimuli in females (Gohier et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Further, emotion regulation is proposed to be a more automatic and unconscious process in males compared with females (Barrett et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). A comprehensive assessment of temporal-context effects must therefore explore if and how this potential confound influences these two groups differently.</p><p>We explored the potential influence of these factors on the subjective evaluation of emotional and indifferent images. First we examined the influence of <italic>Temporal Context</italic> directly, as defined by the valence of the image preceding a target stimulus. Subjective evaluations were measured by both valence and arousal ratings. We predicted that preceding pictures would influence the evaluation of subsequent stimuli to a larger degree when they were emotional, and such modulation should emerge in both dimensions. Considering their motivational and/or biological significance, we expected negative target images to be influenced much less by temporal context. For the same reason, we hypothesized that indifferent images would be affected to a much larger extent. In light of affective priming research, we also expected that context-target combinations of the same valence category (namely, positive-positive and negative-negative) will lead to congruency effects; that is, the behavioral response to an emotional target of the same valence as its preceding image will be potentiated. Secondly, to assess the time-course of any temporal-context effects, and the habituation or sensitization effects as they unfold throughout the course of an experiment, we examined whether subjective evaluations differed according to the position of target stimuli within a sequence (referred to herein as <italic>Trial</italic>). Lastly, we investigated whether these potential confounds are modulated by <italic>Gender</italic> and/or presentation sequence. Given the reported differences in emotion experience and response between males and females, we hypothesized that females would be influenced by temporal context to a larger degree than males, especially with regard to negative context. Four different presentation sequences were compared in terms of their ability to minimize these confounding effects. On the basis of current assumptions, we expected the least amount of temporal-context effects to emerge from a random presentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The sample consisted of 294 participants (96 males) who were allocated randomly to each of four groups defined by the sequence in which images were presented. The mean age of the sample was 24.46 [standard deviation (SD) = 6.97] years. There was no significant difference between males and females with respect to age in any of the presentation sequences: <italic>U</italic> = 8339.00, <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;1.18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.24, and all groups contained a similar male&#x02013;female ratio: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(3) = 2.57, <italic>p</italic> = 0.46. The sample comprised students and associates of Masaryk University, Czech Republic. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and reported no psychological or psychiatric disorders. Explicit informed consent was acquired from each participant before the procedure began. The study was approved by the Ethics Board of the Institute of Psychology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.</p></sec><sec><title>Stimuli</title><p>The stimuli comprised 120 color photographs<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref> from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The stimuli were defined as positive, negative and indifferent (mean valence = 7.42, 2.38, and 5.25, respectively), using a random selection from the available IAPS set within the limits for each valence category. This resulted in a total of 40 stimuli per valence category.</p><p>To investigate if and how <italic>Temporal-Context</italic> effects manifest in each presentation sequence, participants were allocated to one of four groups defined by the sequence in which stimuli were presented: <italic>Random<sub>FIX</sub></italic>&#x02014;The same randomized sequence<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0003"><sup>3</sup></xref> presented to all participants, in which no more than three pictures of the same valence category [negative (N), positive (P), and indifferent (I)] were presented successively; <italic>Random</italic>&#x02014;a randomized sequence generated for each individual, again containing no more than three pictures of the same valence category presented successively; <italic>Fixed<sub>INC</sub></italic>&#x02014;a fixed sequence in which each image was presented in order of increasing valence, within a set sub-sequence repeated 10 times (N-I-P-P-N-I-I-P-N-N-I-P; the most negative and least positive images presented at the beginning); <italic>Fixed<sub>DEC</sub></italic>&#x02014;a fixed sequence in which images were presented in the reverse set order of gradually decreasing valence (P-I-N-N-P-I-I-N-P-P-I-N). In all sequences, each of the 120 images was presented only once. With the exception of <italic>Random</italic>, the same sequence was presented to all participants.</p><p>All possible combinations of preceding and target image valence groups (referred to as context-target combinations) were calculated for sequences <italic>Random<sub>FIX</sub></italic> and <italic>Random</italic>: negative, positive, and indifferent target images were preceded by all three context valences (i.e., N-N, P-N, I-N; N-P, P-P, I-P; and N-I, P-I, I-I). As a result of the design, however, some context-target combinations were not presented in sets <italic>Fixed<sub>INC</sub></italic> and <italic>Fixed<sub>DEC</sub></italic>; namely N-P, I-N, and P-I for the former, and P-N, I-P, and N-I for the latter. Therefore, contrasting context-target combinations were missing for negative and positive targets in these respective sequences.</p><p>To assess whether or not overall sequence position influenced subjective evaluation of the target image, we examined the effect of their position relative to the other targets within that valence category (<italic>Trial</italic>; i.e., 1&#x02013;40).</p><p>The experimental procedure was written entirely in HTML, and participants completed the task at their own pace via an intranet website. Pictures were presented at a resolution of 1024 &#x000d7; 768.

The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM; Bradley and Lang, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) was employed to rate the stimuli. The dimension of dominance was not included in the study due to the relatively small amount of variance it explains (Bradley and Lang, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). The participants were na&#x000ef;ve as to the length and/or number of images presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22 Software. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used to investigate the effects of <italic>Temporal Context</italic> on subjective evaluations of target images (i.e., valence and arousal ratings).

To this end, we examined whether subjective evaluations of target images are influenced by the valence of their immediately preceding image and/or their position within a presentation sequence (temporal-context and trial effects, respectively). To assess this influence in a comprehensive manner, we examined whether these factors exert an influence in four different presentation sequences, and contrasted all possible context-target combinations; specifically, we applied general linear mixed models (GLMMs) to each sequence independently. Additionally, by treating males and females separately we were able to investigate the potential modulation of these contextual effects by gender. In the sections that follow, we present our findings according to these three main themes.</p><p>Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, our data provide evidence that temporal-context effects are present in some form for <italic>all</italic> the sequences considered. Both valence and arousal ratings of all target stimuli&#x02014;regardless of their valence category&#x02014;were modified according to the valence of the preceding image. This was true only for emotional preceding images, however, replicating prior research; neurophysiological studies have shown that emotional but not indifferent preceding images influence electro-cortical responses to target images (Flaisch et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), and report heightened emotional responses to stimuli with congruent emotional relative to indifferent contexts (i.e., N-N vs. I-N; P-P vs. I-P; Foti and Hajcak, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; MacNamara et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; but see Schupp et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, both indifferent and emotional targets were influenced by emotional preceding images. Further, no significant temporal-context effects were observed for indifferent targets in the random sequence, and the effects identified in the fixed sequences were comparable to that of emotional targets. This was contrary to our original expectations, and differs from the findings of previous studies (see Pastor et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; MacNamara et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It is likely that this discrepancy emerged because, unlike previous studies, we examined all possible temporal context-target combinations. This included emotionally congruent (N-N, P-P) and incongruent context-target combinations (P-N, N-P), allowing us to explore the influence of negative context on positive targets and vice versa.</p><p>We also observed significant temporal-context effects for <italic>both</italic> emotional contrasts; that is, the influence of emotional temporal context was demonstrated in the ratings of target pictures preceded not only by negative but also positive images. This latter finding is contrary to the results obtained by Fujimura et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), who report that only negative preceding images influenced valence ratings of successive positive targets. We suggest that methodological differences may explain this inconsistency; while Fujimura et al. presented the same pictures repeatedly within varied contexts for a considerably longer period, we studied temporal-context effects across different images presented only once each. Therefore, our results indicate that positive temporal context also exerts a powerful influence on the evaluation of subsequent targets, even on those valenced negatively.</p><p>It is often reported that emotional responses to negative target stimuli are enhanced when preceded by images of the same valence (N-N; e.g., Wu et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Although we did not observe such a congruency effect frequently in our data, when it did emerge within our fixed sequences it included negative targets predominantly. Recent neurophysiological research suggests that such discrepancies between positive and negative emotional stimuli reported frequently in the literature might be due to differences in the time-course of neurophysiological responses to these two categories, rather than differences between the stimuli themselves (see Weinberg et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This potential neuroscientific explanation for the context effects we have revealed demands further investigation.</p><p>The second important finding to emerge from our study is that temporal-context effects manifest differently in different presentation sequences. When the same (fixed) randomized sequence was presented to the entire sample, temporal context exerted a large but transient effect that becomes progressively less pronounced over the course of the experiment. In contrast, within a random sequence generated separately for each participant, temporal-context effects were reduced yet consistent across trials. Notably, this modulating effect of sequence presentation emerged for emotional but not indifferent targets, and for <italic>negative</italic> target images especially. This finding was highly unexpected given the importance and biological relevance of negative stimuli in general, as indexed by the negativity bias phenomenon (e.g., Ito et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). As evidenced recently, however, the negativity bias is more likely to emerge under certain conditions (Weinberg et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hilgard et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>); namely, within oddball rather than random or blocked presentation sequences, and for emotional stimuli that differ with respect to motivational relevance (Hilgard et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, different sequences yielded different specific patterns of temporal-context effects. Although we observed assimilation (targets evaluated in line with the context) across the sequences more frequently than contrast (targets evaluated differently than their context), some temporal-context effects were reversed in sequences comprising only selected context-target combinations (e.g., only N-N and P-N). For example, the influence of positive context on negative target images (i.e., P-N) resulted in a contrast effect when only emotional context was available (P-N, N-N; i.e., <italic>Fixed<sub>INC</sub></italic>). In contrast, when all three context categories were presented, the same combination resulted in assimilation (i.e., <italic>Random<sub>FIX</sub></italic>). This diverges from the findings of Waugh et al. (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). These authors presented a sequence of three same-valenced images in succession, however, which is likely to induce different degrees of emotional responses compared to our design. We interpret this result as an indication of heightened perceived similarity of context and target stimuli when fewer context categories are presented.</p><p>It is important to stress that these reversed context effects appeared primarily at the beginning of the fixed sequences, at which point target images within each valence category had similar normative ratings. On the basis of our own observations and the findings reported by other groups (Anokhin et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Mormann et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Sakaki et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kuhr et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) we suggest that maximal contrast effects at the beginning of fixed sequences might be a result of shared semantic content of such similarly valenced images. More systematic investigations into contrast effects are needed to determine the conditions that give rise to this specific contextual influence.</p><p>The third finding to emerge from our study also has considerable implications for emotion research; namely, the number of stimuli that precede a target image influences subjective ratings of the target. This Trial effect manifests as both habituation and sensitization, which were identified not only in fixed sequences whereby valence was manipulated artificially, but also in the random sequence. This latter observation shows that ratings change gradually over the course of an experiment, irrespective of the specific sequence employed. Moreover, the Trial effect modifies the influence of the immediately preceding image: Temporal Context-by-Trial interactions were revealed in all fixed sequences, resulting in only transient influences of preceding images. This stands in stark contrast to the random sequence, in which the influence of the preceding image persisted throughout the entire task. This might be the result of reduced variability in valence and arousal ratings for the fixed sequences, whereby all individuals viewed the same context-target combinations in the same succession.</p><p>The transient nature of these temporal-context effects and the large repetition of presented stimuli comprising typical neurophysiological studies might contribute to the inconsistencies concerning the effect of temporal context. Analyzing datasets without taking into account the time-course of context effects may result in non-significant overall context effects. This aspect should be considered while designing future studies.</p><p>Finally, we identified differences in temporal-context effects in terms of gender. In general, females appeared to be more sensitive than males to these confounding influences. This was the case especially when considering negative target images and preceding stimuli. Such results were expected on the basis of existing evidence (Gard and Kring, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lithari et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Further, females were more vulnerable to design manipulations while evaluating the arousal of target images compared with males; specifically, when the Trial effect was introduced artificially in the <italic>Fixed<sub>INC</sub></italic> and <italic>Fixed<sub>DEC</sub></italic> sequences, females' arousal ratings decreased and increased, respectively, over the task more than males' for all target categories. This might be associated with known gender differences with respect to the relationship between valence and arousal in males and females in general (e.g., Bradley et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2001b</xref>); valence seems to be evaluated more independently from arousal in males relative to females. Interestingly, we also revealed opposing temporal-context effects, whereby females showed mostly contrast, while males expressed assimilation. This may indicate differences between genders regarding the conditions necessary for specific context effects to emerge.</p><p>The presence of gender effects reveals that the influence of temporal context manifests differently in males and females. This might indicate that temporal context manifests differently in other groups. Unfortunately we only collected demographic information from our sample, but future research could develop this finding by considering other groups defined more precisely, such as those defined according to personality, emotional and cognitive complexity, emotion regulation, or specific clinical samples. More emphasis should be placed on individual differences in future designs (Kuppens et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Correspondingly, we agree with Hilgard et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) that statistical techniques which account for variability between individuals should be the first option when analyzing data from emotion research (e.g., GLMM).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study conducted the first comprehensive assessment of the influence of context effects on subjective evaluation of emotional images. Taken together, temporal-context effects were revealed in all presentation sequences, with valence and arousal ratings of negative target images being influenced most severely by temporal context. Although the random presentation sequence eliminated the temporal-context effect for indifferent target images, this was not true for negative targets and only partly true for positive targets. In contrast, temporal-context effects detected in the random-fixed sequence manifested in a transient manner, with habituation present for arousal ratings of emotional target images. Further, some of the temporal-context effects were reversed in sequences where not all possible context-target combinations were presented. Interestingly, females appeared to be more sensitive to these temporal-context effects than males. This is the case especially when we consider negative target and preceding images. Moreover, females seemed to be more vulnerable to the influence of design manipulations while evaluating the arousal of target images; ratings increased and decreased for the fixed sequences (<italic>Fixed<sub>INC</sub></italic> and <italic>Fixed<sub>DEC</sub></italic>, respectively) in all valence categories, for females but not males. Opposing directions of temporal-context effects within some of the sequences also indicate differences between genders&#x02014;contrast effects were exhibited by females, while males expressed assimilation effects. We believe that these findings will contribute to future research on emotion and context. We have shown that it is more advantageous to employ fixed random rather than completely randomized sequences due to the transient nature of context effects they elicit. Introducing higher variability with completely randomized sequences does not eliminate context effects, while our artificial fixed sequences appeared to restrict these effects to the beginning of the task. It remains to be seen, however, whether the same findings are observed at other levels of emotion responding (e.g., neurophysiological).</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the project &#x0201c;CEITEC&#x02014;Central European Institute of Technology&#x0201d; (CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068) from European Regional Development Fund.
