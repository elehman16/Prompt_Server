For patients with type 2 diabetes, self-management support, which seeks to address ongoing patient needs for carrying out and maintaining self-care, is now a recommended standard of care along with diabetes self-management education (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Effective self-management support programs for diabetes may be especially important for populations of health disparity, who experience higher disease prevalence and morbidity, and are impacted by health care, societal, and systems barriers to self-care and outcomes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In a series of previous studies, we developed the Decision-making Education for Choices In Diabetes Everyday (DECIDE) program, which uses problem-solving training as an evidence-based behavior change skill to facilitate identifying and managing barriers to diabetes self-management (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The DECIDE intervention was initially tested for usability and effectiveness with people with low literacy and functional impairment, which can impede learning and self-management (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). DECIDE intervention acceptability and dose was demonstrated in a clinic-based sample of high-risk African American patients with diabetes within an urban health care system (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>However, to reach underserved populations in need of such programs, population health management seeks to disseminate interventions across diverse practice and community settings, which necessitates flexibility in the delivery modalities of evidence-based interventions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The purpose of this randomized trial was to test the DECIDE intervention in three different delivery formats: <italic>1</italic>) a self-study format that can be done in a home or community setting and does not necessitate an interventionist; <italic>2</italic>) an individual (one-on-one) in-person format with the patient and an interventionist, which offers directed attention and scheduling to suit the individual patient; and <italic>3</italic>) a group format with up to 8&#x02013;10 patients meeting in person with an interventionist according to a fixed meeting schedule. The trial was designed to compare the effectiveness of the three different DECIDE program delivery modalities with an enhanced usual care condition (UC), which used targeted educational materials suitable for people with low health literacy. In addition to comparing to the Enhanced UC, the focus of the study was to understand the effect of each DECIDE modality on clinical and behavioral outcomes. The study analyzed improvement in A1C as a primary outcome, and blood pressure, lipids, and behavioral skills (problem-solving, disease knowledge, and self-care activities) as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Intervention Development</title><p>The DECIDE program is a diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) education and problem-solving training that is based on a problem-solving model of chronic disease self-management (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The intervention addresses patients&#x02019; understanding of recommendations for diabetes and CVD self-management and trains patients in problem-solving as a core diabetes self-management skill that facilitates all other self-care behaviors (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). DECIDE uses a social problem-solving framework (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) adapted to diabetes and CVD health goals and everyday barriers to care (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The program comprises one module of Diabetes and CVD education, which reviews key diabetes self-management behaviors and American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations regarding clinical targets (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The educational module is followed by eight modules of problem-solving training, which focus on recognizing challenges and barriers to everyday self-management, understanding one&#x02019;s problem-solving orientation, applying effective problem-solving skill training, and learning from past experiences. Two patient workbooks accompany the program: Diabetes and Your Heart: Facts &#x00026; Information Patient Workbook and Hitting the Targets for Diabetes and Your Heart: Your Problem-Solving Workbook. All DECIDE program materials were previously adapted for low literacy using available consensus criteria (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and were tested for usability with people with low literacy and functional impairment that can impede the learning process (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Procedures</title><p>The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent. All study assessment and intervention visits were conducted at the Johns Hopkins study site. Participants were recruited using mailings, postings on institutional community research volunteer sites, and recruitment at church and community health fairs in downtown and East Baltimore. Interested individuals completed a telephone call with a research assistant, during which they received study information and were screened for study inclusion criteria (age 25 years of age or older, black/African American ethnicity, and diagnosed with diabetes by a physician) and exclusion criteria (pregnant, diagnosed with a life-threatening condition, or unable to attend study visits). People meeting inclusion criteria were scheduled for an in-person visit for anthropometry, phlebotomy, and blood pressure measurement to determine trial eligibility. Eligibility criteria were A1C &#x02265;7.5% (58 mmol/mol) and either suboptimal blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &#x0003e;130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &#x0003e;80 mmHg), based on ADA 2011 Standards of Care (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), or lipids (LDL &#x0003e;100 mg/dL or HDL &#x0003c;50 mg/dL for women and &#x0003c;40 mg/dL for men). In addition, patients with A1C 7.0&#x02013;7.5% (53&#x02013;58 mmol/mol) but who met eligibility criteria for both suboptimal blood pressure and lipid values were eligible for participation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Intervention Delivery</title><p>Eligible participants were randomized to one of the four study arms: <italic>1</italic>) DECIDE Self-Study; <italic>2</italic>) DECIDE Individual; <italic>3</italic>) DECIDE Group; and <italic>4</italic>) Enhanced UC. Intervention duration for each study arm was 18&#x02013;20 weeks, allowing for holidays.</p><p>Interventionists had bachelor's or master's degrees in health education, psychology, or social work and completed training in the DECIDE program and module content. For quality control, interventionists used an Intervention Manual for module-by-module program delivery. All group and individual sessions were audiotaped. Tapes were randomly selected for full review by the DECIDE intervention supervisor to determine fidelity to the protocol and workbooks.</p><sec id="s6"><title>DECIDE Self-Study</title><p>Participants were mailed the nine content modules from the DECIDE workbooks to review and apply in a self-directed format. With the first module, they received a schedule instructing them to complete one content module on a biweekly basis. Subsequent modules were mailed to participants following the biweekly schedule. Participants received one phone call midway through the intervention period to assess their use of the materials, but no training or education was provided by research staff during these calls.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>DECIDE Individual</title><p>Participants received one-on-one training with an interventionist to complete the nine education and problem-solving training modules.

This material was also mailed on a biweekly basis in order for participants to review the material on a biweekly schedule, similar to those in the DECIDE Self-Study arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Data Collection</title><p>During the eligibility screening visit, sociodemographic data, medical history, and clinical data were collected. Participants were asked to bring all of their medications to the assessment visits; medications were recorded by the data collector. The Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT-3) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) was used to assess literacy and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) was used to assess symptoms of depression. Blood samples were drawn for determining trial eligibility and for measuring clinical outcomes of the trial. A1C, LDL, and HDL were measured using standard techniques. Blood pressure was assessed using a random-zero sphygmomanometer, and the mean of three blood pressure readings was used.</p><p>Data collection visits occurred at baseline and at three follow-up time points. The two primary follow-up time points were at 1 week after the completion of the intervention phase (referred to as postintervention) and at 6 months after completion of the intervention phase (referred to as 6 months postintervention); the intervention phase was for 18&#x02013;20 weeks for each study arm. The postintervention data collection visit corresponded with 6 months from baseline. The 6-month postintervention corresponded with 1 year from baseline. There was also a data collection visit at 3 months postintervention to be consistent with the primary end point in the pilot study (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Data from this visit are used in statistical models for the purpose of improving modeling of change in the primary and secondary outcomes.</p><sec id="s11"><title>Health Problem-Solving Scale</title><p>The Health Problem-Solving Scale (HPSS) is a 50-item scale designed to assess positive/effective and negative/ineffective health-related problem-solving across three domains (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>): <italic>1</italic>) problem orientation/motivation, <italic>2</italic>) problem-solving skill, and <italic>3</italic>) transfer of past experience/learning. Participants respond on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &#x0201c;not at all true of me&#x0201d; (0) to &#x0201c;extremely true of me&#x0201d; (4). Scoring of the HPSS consists of summing positive/effective items with reverse-scored negative/ineffective items in each domain. Higher scores indicate more effective problem-solving. Psychometric properties of the HPSS have been published elsewhere (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For this current sample, Cronbach &#x003b1; was 0.93.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Diabetes and CVD Knowledge Test</title><p>Based on information for diabetes self-management from ADA <italic>Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), items assess knowledge of risk for CVD in people with diabetes, awareness of &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; cholesterol, clinical targets, and strategies for self-management (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Total scores range from 0 to 18. Reliability was &#x003b1; = 0.58 for this sample, reflecting differences in knowledge across content items (e.g., accuracy in identifying blood glucose targets vs. accuracy in identifying HDL target or types of foods high in fiber).</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale</title><p>The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale (SDSCA) was used to assess frequency of diabetes self-care behaviors with subscale items for diet, exercise, glucose testing, foot care, smoking, and medication taking (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Scoring instructions as provided by Toobert et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) were followed to obtain the mean number of days following a general diet, exercising, following a specific diet, and blood glucose testing. Cronbach &#x003b1; for the SDSCA subscales were as follows: general diet (0.85), specific diet (0.37), exercise (0.73), and blood glucose testing (0.90). The lower reliability coefficient for specific diet is deemed reflective of the observed differences individuals exhibit between behavior frequencies for very specific aspects of diet (e.g., high-fat food consumption vs. fruit/vegetable frequency or spacing carbohydrates).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to compare the means and SDs for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical variables for the total study sample and by intervention arm. Differences between intervention arms on these variables were assessed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables and general linear model for continuous variables.</p><p>Power for the trial was calculated using A1C as a primary outcome. A sample size of 240 (60 people per arm) was targeted for randomization, with a minimum sample size of 180 (45 people per arm) required to provide 80&#x02013;100% power to detect differences in a clinically meaningful change in A1C (0.5% or greater) and moderate effect sizes in the other outcomes while adjusting for multiple comparisons. Secondary outcomes were SBP, DBP, HDL, LDL, health-related problem-solving, diabetes and CVD knowledge, and subscales from the SDSCA.</p><p>Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effect of intervention on change in the primary and secondary outcomes at postintervention and at 6 months postintervention according to the intent-to-treat principle. Random effects were estimated for intercept only when modeling change from baseline to postintervention; models included the baseline and postintervention time points of the outcome. When modeling change from baseline to 6 months postintervention, models included all time points of the outcome (i.e., baseline, postintervention, 3 months postintervention, and 6 months postintervention). An unstructured covariance model was assumed. Random effects were estimated for intercept and slope, which allowed adjustment for any individual variability around the intercept and the slope of the outcome. The treatment arm was dummy coded with Enhanced UC as the reference for all analyses. Models were adjusted by age, years of education, and baseline PHQ-2 score. Missing data were handled by applying full information maximum likelihood. In addition, because of the intervention design, piecewise linear mixed-effects models were used. This allowed examination of change in the outcomes during the intervention period (baseline to postintervention) and maintenance of that change in the primary and secondary outcomes once there were no more intervention contacts (postintervention to 6 months postintervention). For each participant, a piecewise linear function was specified with an intercept at baseline and two slopes (i.e., baseline to postintervention and postintervention to 6 months postintervention). Thus, all analyses included baseline and follow-up values of the outcome. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 and Hierarchical Linear Modeling software version 6.08.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s15"><title>Results</title><sec id="s16"><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p>The CONSORT diagram is available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc16-0941/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>.

Findings reveal that the DECIDE training, in each delivery modality (Self-Study, Individual, and Group), increased participants&#x02019; health-related problem-solving ability and diabetes and CVD knowledge after intervention, and these skill improvements were sustained at long-term follow-up.</p><p>A1C improved in participants with suboptimal A1C (&#x02265;7.5%, 58 mmol/mol), between baseline and postintervention. Between postintervention and 6 months postintervention, with the exception of Group, there was no significant increase in A1C. The programs showed greater utility in people with poorer glycemic control. Improvements were found across DECIDE intervention arms in participants with suboptimal SBP and DBP. HDL improved in the Self-Study arm.</p><p>Of the DECIDE delivery modalities, the Self-Study modality demonstrated robust results across primary (A1C) and secondary (problem-solving, knowledge, SBP, DBP, and HDL) outcomes. This finding may indicate materials suitability for the educational and literacy levels in this community sample. The Individual modality appeared least robust of the DECIDE delivery modalities, both with regard to adoption (attendance rates were less than in the Group arm) and impact on primary and secondary outcomes. Prior literature has determined individual and group modalities of type 2 diabetes education to be comparable for knowledge and quality of life outcomes, with individual generally equal to usual care in A1C outcomes (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the body of literature remains small, and there is not as yet a body of evidence comparing modalities for psychosocial-oriented interventions or outcomes in diabetes. To our knowledge, there are no prior studies examining comparisons with a self-directed treatment modality.</p><p>Participants in this study were healthier than our previous urban, African American study populations. Based on our previous trials (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), we anticipated a 65% eligibility rate among those screened for suboptimal disease control. However, of those screened for the current study, we observed a 48% eligibility rate, indicating better disease control in this community sample. In addition, the community sample had higher education and literacy than our prior, clinic-based sample. This could reflect the difference between community samples (seeking health information/intervention) and clinic patients identified from an administrative database. The Self-Study delivery modality, with DECIDE program adaptations for usability and understandability, proved viable in this community sample.</p><p>Although it has been recommended that all patients, irrespective of disease control status, may benefit from receipt of self-management support services and programs over the course of their chronic disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), the DECIDE program was more effective with patients in suboptimal glycemic and blood pressure control, demonstrating better utility with patients identified as being at higher risk for adverse diabetes outcomes. Longer-term studies are needed to detect whether improvements in the behavioral skills confer clinical benefit over longer duration in patients with controlled blood glucose and blood pressure at the time of the DECIDE self-management training.</p><p>In people with type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of comorbid depression is &#x0223c;18%, with a 24% prevalence in women with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Comorbid depression has been shown to be associated with poorer self-management behaviors and quality of life in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We used the PHQ-2 as a depression screening instrument and found that 23% of the study sample screened positive. Problem-solving intervention has a long history as an evidence-based therapeutic approach for depression and other mental health conditions (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In the current study, higher depressive symptom scores at baseline in Self-Study were in fact associated with greater improvement in problem-solving after intervention, consistent with known benefits of this approach. With the exception of this finding, baseline PHQ-2 had no other impact on intervention outcomes.</p><p>The comparator condition, Enhanced UC, showed improvement in blood pressure over the study period. This is consistent with trends seen in other clinical trials with hypertensive African American participants. For example, Pavlik et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) reported that, based on three National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#x02013;funded cluster randomized trials of behavioral interventions for uncontrolled hypertensive African Americans (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), control groups are improving and can be expected to improve over the duration of a trial, due to health care initiatives in the current era of health care reform. Improvements in control conditions, as widespread, systematic interventions take place on chronic conditions, including hypertension and diabetes, have implications for researchers&#x02019; ability to detect the effectiveness of experimental study arms on outcomes that are targeted metrics in care delivery systems and surrounding communities. Interestingly, although A1C is also a targeted metric in current health care improvement initiatives, in the current study, the Enhanced UC condition did not demonstrate improvements in A1C in people in suboptimal glycemic control, whereas the DECIDE intervention arms did. Enhanced UC did show improvements in disease knowledge and problem-solving, which may be attributable to careful selection of publicly available diabetes and CVD educational materials that met many criteria for low literacy and patient engagement. The increased knowledge and problem-solving, however, were not accompanied by improved self-care behaviors or A1C.</p><p>One limitation of the study is the sample size. Although the achieved sample size of 180 provided adequate power for our primary outcome, a larger sample size would have conferred greater power for our secondary outcomes. While this study furthers available evidence of the DECIDE approach in an urban sample, there is also evidence of generalizability of this problem-solving intervention within populations including rural and underserved Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and Native American people at risk for CVD (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>A strength of this study is that it is among the first to compare various delivery modalities of a psychosocial intervention for diabetes self-management support. Moreover, the Self-Study modality, which emerged as the most effective of the treatment arms, is the lowest-resource delivery modality, requiring no intervention visits, allowing participants to complete the program in the home or community setting and in a self-directed manner. Ultimately, for dissemination of evidence-based interventions across clinical and community settings and populations, flexibility in efficacious modalities is optimal. It is recommended that future implementation work examine patterns of modality effectiveness across populations and settings in need of evidence-based, structured, approaches to patient self-management support.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
