The analgesia extends for variable duration in the postoperative period. It provides excellent pain relief as compared to intravenous or epidural route.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Neuraxial opioids have effective postoperative analgesia without sensory or motor blockade.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] But in spite of ease of administration and patient comfort, worrisome adverse effects like potentially catastrophic respiratory depression, urinary retention, vomiting, pruritus, etc., limit their use in rural health care setup.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] This has promoted researchers to investigate non-opioid compounds with analgesic property and less worrisome adverse effects.

This randomized, observer blind clinical trial was designed to assess the comparative efficacy, safety and duration of analgesia produced by low dose clonidine and preservative free midazolam when used as adjuvant for spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized, prospective, double blind, parallel group clinical trial was conducted during April 2009 and July 2011, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee. The plan of study, anticipated benefits and possible side effects were explained to the patients along with assurance that he/she can withdraw at any time from the trial. Written informed consent was obtained and use of Verbal rating pain scale (VRS) was explained during preoperative visit. Fifty American Society of Anaesthesiologist Grade I and II subjects of age between 20 and 65 years, presenting for lower abdominal surgery under spinal anesthesia from gynecology and general surgery at a tertiary health care center in a rural area were enrolled in the study. Patients with psychiatric disorders, chronic pain or any condition that precludes spinal anesthesia or those taking antihypertensive medication were excluded. Premedication with oral diazepam 5 mg administered at bed time, intravenous (IV) ranitidine 50 mg and ondansetron 4 mg was administered just before induction of anesthesia. Intravenous access was established with 18-G cannula followed by preloading with 10 ml/kg lactated ringers solution. Standard monitoring was used (ECG, noninvasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry) during surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Conduct of Study</title><p>Fifty subjects were randomly assigned into one of the two treatment groups, BM or BC using a random number table with allocation ratio 1:1. The serial number and group of allocation of each subject recorded in two separate papers which were packed in opaque envelop impermeable to intense light and sealed. The allocation sequence was concealed from the researcher enrolling and assessing the participants. Only the serial number was entered on proforma sheet of individual subject. The chits were put in the same envelop and stapled back to be reopened at the conclusion of the study. The investigator involved in sequence generation and allocation concealment was blinded to this process. The participant and data collector both were blinded to the test solution.</p><p>The test solutions were prepared in identical syringes by anesthesiologist not involved in patient monitoring. Spinal anesthesia (SA) was performed at lumbar 3-4 intervertebral space using 23-G disposable spinal needle in right lateral position. After free flow of CSF, one of the study solutions was injected intrathecally at the rate 0.2 ml per second. BM group (Midazolam group) received 15 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 2 mg preservative-free midazolam (Midazolam hydrochloride-5 mg/ml-Midosed, Neon laboratories) made 3.5 ml with normal saline whereas BC group (Clonidine group) received 15 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 30 &#x003bc;g preservative-free clonidine (Clonidine hydrochloride-150 &#x003bc;g/ ml-Cloneon, Neon laboratories) made 3.5 ml with normal saline. The time of intrathecal (IT) injection was noted and patient put in supine position. Sensory block was assessed by loss of sensation to pin prick at every 2 minutes intervals for 15 min, then every 10 min until maximum sensory level was achieved. Motor block was assessed as inability to move lower limbs. A dermatomal sensory loss from dorsal 8 to sacral 4 segments was considered satisfactory. The level of sedation was recorded every 15 minutes intraoperatively and postoperatively for 6 hours by sedation score described by Chernik <italic>et al</italic>. i.e., no sedation (wide awake), mild sedation (sleeping comfortably), moderate sedation (deep sleep but arousable) and severe sedation (deep sleep not arousable).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Supplemental oxygen via ventimask was given at 3l/minute during the procedure. Pulse rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was recorded every 5 minutes for 15 minutes, then every 10 minutes till end of surgery and 2,4,6,12,24 hours, postoperatively. IV fluids (crystalloids, colloids or blood) were administered for maintenance and according to surgical blood loss. Hypotension was defined as systolic BP &#x0003c;90 mmHg or 20% fall in systolic BP from baseline value, and treated with 250 ml bolus IV fluids and IV mephenteramine 6 mg. Bradycardia was defined as pulse rate &#x0003c;60/min and treated with IV atropine sulfate 0.6 mg. Each patient received intramuscular diclofenac sodium 75 mg postoperatively. Further analgesic dose was administered on patient's demand. If pain persisted (VRS &#x0003e; 5), tramadol 1 mg/ kg was administered intravenously.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was duration of postoperative analgesia i.e., time from IT injection till demand for rescue analgesic or VRS &#x0003e; 5. Pain score was recorded every 2 hours until first rescue analgesic dose. The total number of analgesic doses in 24 hours was recorded. Data was collected regarding the onset of sensory block (Time taken from IT injection to loss of pinprick sensation bilaterally at L1), maximum sensory level, time to achieve maximum sensory level, duration of sensory block (Time from IT injection to 2 segment regression) and duration of motor block (Time from IT injection till appearance of leg movements) Adverse effects like hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 90%) shivering, itching, drowsiness, headache bowel/bladder dysfunction, neurological deficit before discharge, etc. were recorded as and when they occurred. IV metoclopramide 10 mg was administered as rescue antiemetic. Each subject was observed for 24 hours after surgery. The recruitment stopped after enrolling 25 participants in each group.</p><p>The sample size of 25 subjects per group was necessary for detecting clinically significant difference of 60 minutes in duration of analgesia assuming a power of 90% and a significance level of 5% using the formula &#x02013;</p><p>n = (u + v)<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; (SD<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + SD<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>) / (&#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> - &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p><p>Where u=1.28 is the percentage point of normal distribution for power 90%, v=1.96 is percentage point of normal distribution corresponding to significance level 5%, SD<sub>1</sub>=2.51 hours is standard deviation of reference study for duration of analgesia in minutes for midazolam, SD<sub>2</sub>=44.34 minutes is standard deviation of reference study for duration of analgesia of 30 &#x003bc;g clonidine, &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> &#x02013; &#x003bc;<sub>2=</sub>60 minutes is the target difference in duration of postoperative analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The sample size was confirmed after statistical analysis using actual values obtained in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The data was analyzed using online statistical calculators GraphPad Quickcals 2005 by GraphPad Software Inc., USA and easycalculation.com.

We observed better quality of analgesia with IT midazolam with earlier onset, little time to reach the peak sensory level and, long duration of block as compared to IT clonidine. The postoperative analgesia was maintained for longer period along with significantly less pain score and less analgesic consumption. Additional analgesia was not required in any patient in this group. Thus the null hypothesis was rejected with effective analgesia of midazolam lasting for 391.64 minutes as compared to 296.60 minutes with clonidine. Our results correspond to previously reported data in different studies when IT midazolam or clonidine alone was compared with placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The peak sensory level attained was similar in both groups as the total volume and dose of bupivacaine injected was identical and not affected by either agent. We administered first dose of diclofenac 75 mg to all the patients immediately after shifting in ward for ethical reasons as per the standard protocol of our hospital. Further analgesic was administered on demand. This might be responsible for insignificant difference in amount of diclofenac requirement. But the effectiveness of midazolam was indicated by lower pain score in this group.</p><p>Several investigators have shown that intrathecal midazolam produces a dose dependent anti-nociception sufficient to produce anesthesia for abdominal surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Patients do not require opioid analgesic when subjected to painful somatic stimulus like leg surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] It also suppresses reflex response to visceral distension in rabbits and in humans during Cesarean section.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] It is effective in relieving chronic mechanical low back pain as well as pain due to metastatic bone tumors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Sympathetic nervous system function remains intact after intrathecal midazolam.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] This sparing effect on sympathetic nervous system may explain lesser degree of hypotension and bradycardia in midazolam group in our study.</p><p>Three possible mechanisms are suggested for the anti-nociceptive action of midazolam. First the benzodiazepine/GABA-A receptor complex mediated analgesia as they are abundantly present in lamina II of dorsal horn of spinal cord.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] It also causes release of endogenous opioid acting at spinal delta receptors as naltrinadole, a delta receptor opioid antagonist suppresses its analgesic effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Thirdly it inhibits adenosine uptake or enhances adenosine release.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The use of IT midazolam in humans is reported in at least 18 peer reviewed reports in about 797 patients since 1986. In a prospective observational study, 1100 patients received intrathecal midazolam for various surgical procedures under spinal anesthesia. Increase in symptoms suggestive of neurological impairment including motor or sensory changes and bladder or bowel dysfunction were not observed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Intrathecal midazolam has been shown to be free of neurotoxicity or other adverse effects up to 2-mg dose and in continuous infusion up to 6 mg/day for long periods in man.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] We did not observe any cloudiness or precipitation after aspiration of CSF during injection.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title/><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Clonidine Effects and Side Effects</title><p>Clonidine, a selective &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist produces analgesia by sympatholysis at peripheral level, decreased catecholamine release in the brain and suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha in plasma during perioperative period. Spinal clonidine produces dose dependent analgesia along with hypotension, bradycardia and sedation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Most of the studies using 37.5-50 &#x003bc;g reported significant hypotension and bradycardia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] A 30-&#x003bc;g dose provides maximum benefits and minimum side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] It also directly decreases mean arterial pressure by inhibition of preganglionic sympathetic neurons in spinal cord.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Decrease in heart rate is due to presynaptic mediated inhibition of norepinephrine release and by a direct depression of AV nodal conduction after systemic absorption. IT clonidine may be systemically absorbed; the hemodynamic effects after neuraxial administration begins within 20-30 minutes reach maximum effect within 1-2 hours after single injection. We observed some amount of bradycardia (36%) and hypotension (44%) with even low-dose clonidine. Sympatholysis of spinal anesthesia might have added to this effect. Sedation represents an &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic effect reversed by specific antagonist yohimbine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] We observed sedation in 20% subjects with IT clonidine. Although mild sedation is a desirable effect in postoperative patient, possibility of respiratory depression is well suspected. It has been reported that increase in baricity of clonidine solution or use along with hyperbaric bupivacaine reduces side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] We preferred to use sedation score and SpO<sub>2</sub> as the indicators of respiratory depression over respiratory rate. Therefore, hemodynamic depression after IT clonidine require careful monitoring of pulse rate, blood pressure and level of sedation for at least 1-2 hours as these events might be delayed till systemic absorption of drug. The incidence of PONV was reduced by both IT clonidine and midazolam from reported 45% to 28% in both groups.</p><p>All patients could be mobilized on first postoperative day. Neither midazolam nor clonidine was associated with bowel/bladder dysfunction or neurological deficit until discharge. Long-term neurological signs and symptoms could not be detected as the study period was short and due to difficulty in establishing neurotoxicity on clinical grounds. Also the study is not adequately powered to comment conclusively on adverse effects. Further trial using a larger sample size and follow-up for at least 6 weeks is required for this purpose.</p><p>Addition of intrathecal clonidine and midazolam to hyperbaric bupivacaine prolongs spinal sensory block and postoperative analgesia. Analgesia with clonidine is minor and short lived and associated with some bradycardia. Intrathecal midazolam provides superior analgesia without clinically relevant side effects. Although not registered for this purpose, intrathecal midazolam is used along with local anesthetic for SA and postoperative analgesia in many institutions in India. These effects may be valuable in prolonged surgeries.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Institutional support.</p></fn><fn
