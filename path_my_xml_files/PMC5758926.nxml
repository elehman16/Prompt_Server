Follow-up questionnaires were completed at 2, 4 and 6&#x02009;weeks following the delivery of the intervention and baseline data collection in the usual care only arm. Any patients who expressed any positive response to the PHQ-9 question regarding suicidal ideation were referred onto the hospice team and managed according to usual hospice practice. Full ethical approval for the study was obtained (Reference 13/NW/0203).</p></sec><sec id="section15-0269216317711322"><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients randomised to the intervention arm were offered, in addition to usual care, a focused narrative intervention. The intervention was developed from the literature reviews and expert clinician consensus and had been piloted and refined. A single semi-structured narrative face to face interview was carried out by trained researchers with a health background and experience in research with patients with advanced illness. The intervention was delivered either in the hospice or the patient&#x02019;s home. The interviews were, if possible, conducted within a week of the baseline data collection and of patients being randomised. The researcher prompted the patients to discuss perspectives on their sense of meaning regarding distress/depression and their physical, psychological and spiritual well-being, the emphasis being on allowing patients to share their thoughts and experiences in a supportive environment. Patients were encouraged to share what they felt had been the main contributing factor for depression and distress and to share what resources they themselves had employed in addition to any medical/professional care received, with emphasis being on helping patients to reflect on their own inner resources and coping methods. The pace, sequencing and duration of the interviews depended on the patients, with interviews lasting from 25 to 60&#x02009;min. A random selection of interviews was monitored by the chief investigator to ensure a consistent approach and to maintain fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="section16-0269216317711322"><title>Analysis</title><p>Any differences in the composition of the two trial groups were assessed by the application of the <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables.

A reduction of five points in PHQ-9 is defined as being a clinically significant response to depression treatment, and at each follow-up time point, a greater proportion of patients in the intervention group had a reduction in PHQ-9 scores of five points or more than those in the control group. Patients in the intervention group were more likely to have become depression non-cases by the end of follow-up.

A total of 16 patients (28%) died in the study observation period, and the median survival of patients in the intervention group was 157&#x02009;days compared to 102&#x02009;days for usual care group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07). This finding is of interest as survival is rarely included in palliative care studies. Patients randomised to the intervention group had significantly higher PHQ-9 scores than those in the usual care group, and depression causes earlier mortality in patients with advanced cancer;<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269216317711322" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> therefore, these findings are of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section22-0269216317711322"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The total study attrition was 49%, with 45% attrition in the intervention group and 58% in the control group, and it is unlikely that the intervention was responsible for the attrition. All of the trial patients were in the last weeks and months of life and many were undergoing palliative treatment, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, which accounted for attrition. Additionally, all were suffering from at least two known major co-morbidities (advanced cancer and moderate to severe depression) making compliance in any study challenging. We did not obtain ethical approval to either send reminder follow-up questionnaires or reminder phone calls, which would probably have reduced our rates of attrition. This study recruited advanced cancer patients from hospice day units only; a recent study of a psychotherapeutic intervention which recruited patients with stage 4 cancer from within oncology and palliative care settings reported higher attrition rates of 68%<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0269216317711322" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> than those observed in our study. This suggests that although patients in our study were all within the last weeks and months of life, the acceptability of the intervention enabled a greater proportion of patients to be retained within the study.</p><p>Our threshold for recruitment into the trial was a PHQ-9 score of 10 or more, but 50% of those eligible did not participate. We had ethical permission to interview patients who did not wish to participate in the trial (results will be published elsewhere), and this revealed that some patients believed that as they were already receiving holistic care and support from the hospice day care team, they should not ask or expect any further help or support for their depression &#x02013; a finding previously reported in a study of older people with depression.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0269216317711322" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> This issue would be addressed in any subsequent trial via a more detailed explanation of the intervention within patient information sheets at initial screening.</p><p>A key strength of this study is that we managed to recruit patients of all ages and diagnostic groups and patients with moderate to severe scores for depression using a well-validated tool, the PHQ-9. We acknowledge that PHQ-9 scores in the intervention group were statistically higher than those in the control group, and more intervention group patients had been prescribed antidepressants. We have attempted to control for these baseline differences within our regression analysis. However, we accept that our results may have been different if recruitment had included oncology clinics or primary care settings and that our trial sample was small with significant attrition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section23-0269216317711322"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our work suggests that palliative care patients with moderate to severe depression may benefit from a focused narrative intervention in addition to usual care, as evidenced by reduction in scores on PHQ-9. The follow-up of 6&#x02009;weeks was felt appropriate in patients with limited prognosis, and although depression scores fell in both arms of the trial, a greater number of patients in the intervention group had a reduction of more than five points in PHQ-9 which was sustained at final follow-up. We believe this pilot trial is unique as recruitment was within palliative care settings and our mean score of 16.4 on PHQ-9 at entry into the study is markedly higher than other intervention studies for depression in advanced cancer populations. Many therapeutic interventions trialled within palliative care have not been adopted within clinical practice, as they required professional qualifications to deliver the intervention. This intervention could be delivered by practitioners with health care&#x02013;related backgrounds and an understanding of both depression and the context of living with a terminal illness. We wish to further explore its utility as a potential cost-effective intervention for depression in this patient group.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was partly supported by Research Capacity Funding from Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group.
