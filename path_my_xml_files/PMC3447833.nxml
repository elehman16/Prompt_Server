Inflammation and oxidative stress are relevant factors in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Glomerulosclerosis, which is associated with a high amount of coagulating factors, is a major reason for nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). A novel therapy for DN might be anti-inflammatory treatment, which could be improving renal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Lifestyle modifications are first steps in controlling the complications involved in DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Recently, human studies have shown the association between dietary pattern and dietary components with inflammatory and coagulating markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In general, healthy dietary pattern may be favorably associated with inflammatory markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Soy protein intake potentially modulates inflammatory response among type 2 DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Some data are available regarding the beneficial effects of soy products on inflammatory markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), coagulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and oxidative stress indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>In most previous studies, only soy ingredients were recommended for patients with DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, whole soy consumption, which has a low content of phosphorus in compare with cow&#x02019;s milk, may be more effective in patients with DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Isoflavones in liquid kinds of soy foods may be absorbed faster than other soy foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Furthermore, dairy consumption should be limited in DN patients for reducing the phosphorus intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus, the low phosphorus content of soy milk compared with cow<sup>&#x02019;</sup>s milk make soy milk as a better choice for patients with DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>According to our knowledge, there are few studies regarding the effect of soy milk consumption on new cardiovascular risk factors among DN patients. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of soy milk consumption on inflammation, coagulation, and markers of oxidative stress among type 2 DN patients.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy were recruited from subjects attending to the clinic of Azzahra Hospital and the clinic of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. The inclusion criteria were stages 1 and 2 of DN, fasting blood glucose &#x0003e;126 mg/dL, hypoglycemic agents, or insulin intake, proteinuria &#x0003e;300 mg/day, and glomerular filtration rate &#x0003e;90 mL/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The diabetic nephropathy condition was confirmed by the specialist in the current study. Study procedure was explained for participants, and informed written consent was taken from all the patients. Exclusion criteria in this study were pregnancy or lactating in women, changing the dosage of medications, allergy or intolerance to soy milk or cow&#x02019;s milk, and avoidance of soy milk or cow&#x02019;s milk consumption. The sample size for this study was calculated based on this equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>): <italic>n</italic> = ([Z<sub>1&#x02212;&#x003b1;</sub>/2 + Z<sub>1&#x02212;&#x003b2;</sub>]<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; S<sup>2</sup>)/2&#x00394;<sup>2</sup>, where &#x003b1; (type 1 error) is 0.05, &#x003b2; (type 2 error) is 0.2, S is the variance of C-reactive protein (CRP; S = 3.3), and &#x00394; represents differences in the means of CRP (&#x00394; = 1.5). The rationale to use variance of CRP equal to 3.3 and differences in the means of CRP equal to 1.5 is based on the results of a previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Thus, the power for detecting differences between the treatment conditions for various outcomes in the current study was 80%. Therefore, according to this formula, we needed 19 patients to complete the trial. We recruited 32 diabetic patients to compensate for any possible exclusion. This study was approved by the research council and ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (research project number 185190). In addition, this study is registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (identification number IRCT201105282839N2) and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (registration number NCT01419912).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Study procedure</title><p>A randomized, crossover clinical trial with two interventional periods and one washout period was conducted to compare the effects of soy milk and cow&#x02019;s milk consumption among type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups, and they were asked to follow a diet containing cow&#x02019;s milk or soy milk for 4 weeks. After the interventional period, a washout period was conducted for 2 weeks. Then groups followed the alternate treatment for 4 weeks. All data were collected before and after each trial phase. They were requested not to change their diet and physical activity habits during the study and asked to record their physical activity and food intake for 1 day in each phase of the study. Their complications and medications were monitored carefully. During the current study, soy milk and cow&#x02019;s milk were provided for all patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Anthropometric assessments</title><p>All patients were assessed for anthropometric measurements including height and body weight at baseline and weeks 4, 6, and 10 of the study period. Heights in standing position and without shoes and body weight while participants were minimally clothed without shoes using digital scales were measured. BMI was calculated as body weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Diet</title><p>Each subject received a usual diet for patients with nephropathy containing 0.8 g/kg protein, 2,000 mg/day sodium, and 2,000 mg/day potassium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Calorie requirements of each patient were calculated individually based on the equation of Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Furthermore, in the soy milk and cow&#x02019;s milk intervention period, one glass (240 mL) of soy milk and cow&#x02019;s milk was provided for each patient. A 1-day dietary record was completed by all subjects in each phase of study to determine the adherence to the prescribed diet and soy milk or cow&#x02019;s milk intake. The soy milk and cow&#x02019;s milk were produced by Soya Sun Company and Mihan-Dairy Company in Iran, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Biochemical analysis</title><p>Blood samples were obtained and analyzed from fasting participants at the onset of the study and then after 4, 6, and 10 weeks. Interleukin<bold>-</bold>6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&#x003b1;), <sc>d</sc>-dimer, and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) were measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method and with commercial reagents (Boster Biological Technology for IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, Hyphen BioMed for <sc>d</sc>-dimer, and Pars Azmoon for hs-CRP). Fibrinogen concentrations were measured by using the Clauss method with commercial reagents (Mahsa-yaran, Tehran, Iran). Malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured by using the colorimetry method. We did not use any commercial reference in the MDA method. First, a standard curve was drawn from a material named malondialdehyde bis (diethyl acetal) for its different concentrations. We separated 0.5 mL serum and centrifuged with trichloroacetic acid. We then separated 0.5 mL from this supernatant and mixed it with 0.5 mL thiobarbituric acid. We put this mixture in a 100&#x000b0;C temperature for 10 min. Serum MDA would react with thiobarbituric acid and provide a pink material that was written by spectrophotometer. The detection limit of methods used to determine hs-CRP was 0.124 mg/L, for IL-6, it was 0.03 pg/mL, for TNF-&#x003b1;, 0.13 pg/mL, for MDA, 1.56 nmol/mL, and for <sc>d</sc>-dimer, 45 ng/mL.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Soy milk and cow&#x02019;s milk analysis</title><p>Ultra heat-treated soy milk was provided by Soy Max (Tehran, Iran), and ultra heat-treated low-fat milk was provided by Mihan (Tehran, Iran). Both of the products are registered with the health ministry of Iran. We used three random samples for analyzing the macronutrients. Milk fat was determined using Gerber&#x02019;s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), whereas the method of Folch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) was adopted for determination of soy milk fat. The micro-Kjeldal method was used to analyze the protein content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and carbohydrate was measured using Fehling&#x02019;s solution titration method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

Therefore, 14 and 15 subjects were randomly assigned to the soy milk and cow&#x02019;s milk groups, respectively. Two patients withdrew during the soy milk period due to the taste of soy milk and gastrointestinal problems following soy milk consumption. Problems in reporting dietary record caused the exclusion of two patients during the cow&#x02019;s milk period. Finally, 25 participants completed this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The mean &#x000b1; SD age and BMI of patients were 51 &#x000b1; 10 years and 28 &#x000b1; 4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. A total of 60% of the subjects were females. Only 24% of patients had an academic degree, 40% of the study population was in menopause, and 32% of participants used insulin. Dietary intake of subjects in different phases of trial was assessed.

Although most of the previous studies have shown the beneficial effects of soy products consumption on inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), there are few studies regarding the effects of soy milk on inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation.</p><p>Recently, findings suggested that imbalance between the coagulation pathways in DN might damage vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Also, <sc>d</sc>-dimer is correlated with renal dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In this study, we evaluated serum fibrinogen and <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels in DN patients, and a significant reduction was observed in the percent change of <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels in the soy milk group. The change of fibrinogen was not significantly different between the two groups. Previous studies showed conflicting results about the effect of soy interventions on serum fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). One study has demonstrated that genistein consumption could decrease fibrinogen concentrations among postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In another study, soy flour consumption did not affect fibrinogen level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Although participants were different in the mentioned studies, different types of products, sample size, and study durations might be responsible for these controversial results.</p><p>However, in the current study, no distinct difference on inflammatory factors was observed between the two groups. Contrary to our findings, one study reported the beneficial effect of soy containing isoflavones on IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels among postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The findings from a longitudinal study that was conducted in type 2 DN for 4 years have shown that soy protein intake significantly reduced CRP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Results of present study showed near-significant reduction in serum CRP level following soy milk consumption; however, it might be significant if the duration of our intervention was &#x0003e;4 weeks.</p><p>Oxidative stress has an important role in pathology of some diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). One study revealed that soy product consumption for 8 weeks could reduce MDA levels in patients with the metabolic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Our findings did not show a significant reduction on oxidative stress indices following soy milk consumption. This might be due to the types of soy products and study duration compared with others. The role of soy foods on health is controversial. Gut microflora, ethnic origin, and dietary context may affect absorption, metabolism, and bioavailability of isoflavones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Also, bioavailability of isoflavones is associated with gut transit time, fecal digestion rates, lactase, some dietary factors, and storage conditions of soy milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Lactase may be needed in hydrolyzation of isoflavone glucosides in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Therefore, these factors might have a role in not seeing any major changes in the current study.</p><p>We attempted to follow patients in each phase and used a dietary record to assess the food intake. However, dietary assessment might have some biases. We could not measure serum or urine isoflavones levels, which could be a limitation of this study. It is suggested that the relation between serum or urine isoflavones levels and inflammatory markers or coagulating factors will be assessed in future studies. We only measured MDA for evaluating the oxidative stress. This seems weak to present some conclusions. MDA is an end product of lipid peroxidation; however, the use of this assay to assess oxidative stress status is problematic because MDA is not a specific product of lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, because of financial limitations, we could not measure F2 isoprostane, protein carbonyls, total antioxidant capacity, or plasma antioxidant enzyme activities.</p><p>Strengths of the current study are the crossover design, high percentage of patients who completed this study, and detailed data collection through face-to-face meetings. Moreover, soy milk and cow&#x02019;s milk were provided for all patients.</p><p>As a summary, our findings showed that soy milk consumption for 4 weeks could decrease serum <sc>d</sc>-dimer level and had no significant effects on the inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with DN.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
