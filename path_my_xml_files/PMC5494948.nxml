Population aging is a result of development.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The number of the elderly aged 60 years and above has been estimated to be more than 605 million people worldwide, and by 2050, this number will reach 2 billion people.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Iran's elderly population will also increase in the same proportion. It is expected that the elderly population in Iran will increase to 25 million people by 2050.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] With increasing age, individuals will gradually lose some of their physiological, psychological, and social functioning.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>A serious and common problem of the elderly is falling. Each year, one-third of the population over 65 years of age experiences falling on the ground at least once, and in half of the cases, this occurs several times.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Falls are the leading cause of injury-related emergency visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in older adults.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Fear of falling potentially has serious health consequences among the elderly experiencing falling and among those with no experience of falling. In 30% of the elderly, restriction in performing activities has a direct relationship with their falling.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The results of the studies showed that factors such as aging, gender (fear of falling rate was higher in elderly women than in elderly men), problems with balance, movement disorders, walking problems, psychological issues, and low economic status had increased the risk of fear of falling in the elderly.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It was also observed that an increase in the fear of falling increased the rate of falling in the elderly.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Although many incidences of falling might not cause serious injuries, falling in the elderly, owing to multiple physiological (such as muscle weakness) and pathological changes (osteoporosis), is the leading cause of injury-related deaths as well as the sixth leading cause of death.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Fear of falling, loss of confidence, physical fitness, limited range of motion, muscle weakness, limitations in daily activities and mobility, gait imbalance, social isolation, and increased reliance and dependence on others are among the consequences of falling in the elderly.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Outcomes and complications of falling in the elderly not only influence their own lives but also have important effects on health, treatment, and economic systems.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In addition, studies have shown that care after falling has high costs, and the study of economic outcomes of fear of falling, as one of the most important risk factors in falling, is of significant importance[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] because participation in balance and strength training classes has been proven to reduce falls and related injuries.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] A method of reducing fear of falling is supposed to provide the elderly with training on correct behavior. Through education, training and improving the performance of students in the scientific community has been made possible.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Various methods of training, such as lectures, role-playing, performance, videos, face-to-face training, and group discussions, are available which can be used individually or in groups.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The training of different topics and skills require the use of different teaching methods and techniques, the selection of which depends on the learning objectives, abilities, talents, and the age of learners.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>A new method of teaching is the use of videos. Videos can be used to convey basic concepts of learning in a short time. Videos have made training easier and have increased the level of understanding and learning of the students. They are easy to watch and listen and are considered a cheap and affordable method of training.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, this method has limitations including its virtual nature and the trainee's lack of active participation in the education process. However, with the tremendous advancement in preparation of training videos, these defects are also being reduced.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Another training method is performance based on observation as the best method in learning skills. The advantage of this method is the presence of the trainer allowing direct questioning of the trainees and providing the possibility of training a large number of learners in a short time.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Like other methods, this method has limitations including damaged or lack of educational facilities. To resolve these problems, arrangements must be made before method implementation.</p><p>Numerous guidelines and trainings have been used to reduce the fear of falling in elderly and improve their physical balance. To mention some of these guidelines, we can refer to the necessity of age-appropriate exercises and daily mobility, the correct method of walking and compliance to safety precautions when walking, the appropriate way of going up and down stairs, safety guidelines for the bathroom and toilet, wearing suitable clothes and shoes, the correct way of sitting on and getting up from bed and chair, correct usage of mobility aids such as canes and walkers, keeping the living environment clean and tidy, and controlling the environmental risk factors for falling. Some of training exercises include Tai Chi and yoga as well as simple and effective exercises for the elderly in order to strengthen and maintain muscle strength, or a combination of these methods.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In the present study, a combination of these methods was used. Therefore, this study aimed at studying the impact of training programs on the fear of falling in elderly residents of nursing homes. In addition, the effectiveness of training through videos and demonstration on fear of falling in the elderly was compared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a quasi-experimental study comprising two groups. In the pre-test and post-test study, the demonstration and video groups were considered to be intervention and control groups, respectively.</p><p>This study was conducted in 2014 in 8 elderly nursing homes in Mashhad, Iran, which were selected using purposive sampling method. The study population comprised all the elderly residents of nursing homes in Mashhad.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for the elderly included willingness to participate in the study, lack of any mental and cognitive disorders, the ability to communicate with the researcher (no acute impairment in vision, speech, and hearing) so that they were able to answer questions, lack of any acute debilitating diseases, and a score of 50 and higher in the Fall Efficacy Scale. Exclusion criteria included the death of the elderly, refusing to participate in the study, physical abnormalities preventing participation in the study, and absence from training sessions 2 times. Because the main variables of the study were quantity variables, the formula of &#x0201c;mean comparison of the two communities&#x0201d; based on variables regarding fear of falling was used to determine the sample size. First, a pilot study was conducted among 20 elderly participants. Then, based on its results, the exact sample size was calculated. The sample size was estimated at 27 participants in each group with 95% confidence interval and 80% test power. Regarding the possibility of sample loss, a total of 66 elderly (33 participants in each group) were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Sampling was conducted in two stages. First, among all the nursing homes in Mashhad, 8 were selected via nonrandomized purposive sampling, based on having the highest number of elderly. In the next stage, the selected nursing homes were randomly assigned to two intervention groups. In the video intervention group, 2 participants were lost; 1 due to absence from more than 2 sessions and the other due to physical deterioration. Moreover, 1 participant was excluded from the performance intervention group due to lack of willingness to participate in the post-test. Finally, 31 elderly participants participated in the video group and 32 in the performance group.</p><p>The data collection tools consisted of the demographic questionnaire (consisting of 5 items on age, sex, history of falling, limb fracture history, and history of chronic disease) and the Fall Efficacy Scale. The Fall Efficacy Scale consists of 10 items; each of which is assigned a score between 1 and 10. Thus, the total score of fear of falling ranged from 10 to 100. A score of 50 to 70 indicated a moderate fear of falling in the elderly. The validity of the scale was approved by 10 professors of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran, via content validity. The reliability of the tool was measured in the past study. Permission and an introduction letter were obtained from the Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. After submitting the letter to the authorities of the elderly care center and obtaining their approval, sampling was performed. After the selection of participants and completion of their demographic form, details regarding the research objectives of the study were given to the elderly. Furthermore, their fear of falling was studied through the completion of the Fall Efficacy Scale and evaluation of the elderly by the researchers. The intervention in one group included training sessions with videos and the other group with performances. For the elderly in the performance group, 4 sessions of 30&#x02013;45 minutes were held (2 sessions per week). The first session included presentations on training related to appropriate shoes and clothing, reducing environmental risk factors, and the importance of activity and mobility. The second session included training related to the correct way of how to get out of bed, how to go up and down the stairs, how to walk, and how to use cane and walker. The third session included 6 easy training exercises aiming at increasing power and balance in the elderly. The fourth session included training of another 6 easy exercises related to strengthening the muscles of the lower and upper extremities performed by the elderly. These training sessions were recorded on video (in the group with performance training) and the video was displayed for the video group with a 1-session delay. The researchers referred to the nursing homes 3 months (29) after the end of the training sessions, and the fear of falling was evaluated again using the Fall Efficacy Scale. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (version 16.5, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To describe and summarize the background characteristics of the elderly, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and relative frequency) were used. In the analysis of the quantitative data, to evaluate the normal distribution of the data, Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk, and Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov tests were used. Then, independent <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square test were used to study the homogeneity of the variables and to obtain specific objectives. The significance level for all tests was 0.05.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study received ethics approval from the ethics committee at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (code 921534) according Helsinki Declaration. In all stages of the research, all ethical codes related to the participants were upheld, including both the written and verbal consent for participation in the research, participants' right to decline participation, and the right to withdraw from the study at any time. All competent participants provided written and verbal consent. Written informed consent for the older participants who were not competent was obtain from the next of kin or legal guardian.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The results showed that, from a total of 63 elderly participants, 65.1% were females. There were 21 (65.55%) elderly women in the performance group and 20 (64.5%) in the video group. Chi-square test results showed that the two groups were homogeneous in terms of gender (<italic>P</italic> = 0.93). The mean age of the elderly was 70.44 (0.54) years; the mean age of the elderly in the performance group was 70.18 (4.53) years and in the video group was 70.70 (4.11) years. Independent <italic>t</italic>-test indicated that the two groups were homogeneous regarding this variable (<italic>P</italic> = 0.63).

There was no statistically significant relationship between the other background and confounding variables and mean score of fear of falling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the present study showed the higher efficacy of the demonstration training method compared to the video method in reducing the fear of falling in the elderly. Furthermore, in both the study groups, there was a significant reduction in the mean score of fear of falling in the elderly after the intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Oslen <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study entitled The effect of exercise and education on fear of falling in elderly women with osteoporosis and a history of vertebral fracture &#x02013; results of a randomized controlled trial.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In this study, exercise was performed for 3 months (2 times a week, each 60 min), and 3 educational sessions were held. Exercise program comprised aerobic exercise with music and stretching muscles of the upper and lower extremities.</p><p>Educational programs (3 sessions, each 3 hours) were managed by a physiotherapist aiming at increasing the knowledge of elderly women regarding prevention techniques, awareness of the body, and ergonomic guidelines in specific situations of life. As indicated by the results of the study, the level of fear of falling significantly decreased in the intervention group after 3 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04) and 12 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07).</p><p>In this study, the decrease in fear of falling is due to the simultaneous effect of interventions on physical and mental factors. Fear of falling decreases in the elderly as their awareness increases and they get more domination on performing their daily tasks including walking up and down stairs and even standing up from the ground.</p><p>The study by Brenda <italic>et al</italic>. on 38 elderly residents of nursing homes in Canada showed that fear of falling in the elderly was at a moderate level before training.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In this study, after the training, the mean score of fear of falling was significantly reduced in the elderly. In a study by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., it was also indicated that Tai Chi reduced fear of falling in the elderly.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Dong Hyun <italic>et al</italic>. also showed the impact of an exercise program on reducing the fear of falling in the elderly.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Rucker <italic>et al</italic>. also examined the impact of education on reducing the fear of falling.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In this study, the fear of falling in the elderly before intervention was at a moderate level and was reduced after the intervention. The results of the abovementioned studies were consistent with those of the present study.</p><p>The results of this study opposed with those of the other studies. For example, Arlene <italic>et al</italic>., in a study entitled &#x0201c;Effect of a 12-Week Yoga Intervention on Fear of Falling and Balance in Older Adults,&#x0201d; found no significant difference in the elderly's fear of falling after performing yoga exercises compared with before the exercises.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] This finding was inconsistent with the results of the present study. The differences reported in the fear of falling can be due to many factors such as age, sex, education, depression, history of falling, stress, environmental differences, the time of the intervention (the season in which the intervention was performed), and cultural differences.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, the results of the Chi-square test showed that there was a significant relationship between fear of falling and history of falling. This can affect the level of fear of falling among the elderly.</p><p>Smulders <italic>et al</italic>. reported a study entitled Efficacy of a Short Multidisciplinary Falls Prevention Program for Elderly Persons with Osteoporosis and a Fall History: A Randomized Controlled Trial.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In this study, Nijmegen's Fall Prevention Program comprising 6 items including education, one course of obstacle, walking exercise, exercise of bearing weight, walking disorders correction, and falling techniques education was applied for 11 sessions during 5.5 weeks. As indicated by the results, in the intervention group, the level of fear of falling subtly decreased, and there was no significant relationship between two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.48). Some minor improvement was seen in the level of balance in two groups. However, no improvement was evident in the level of daily activities and life quality (0.81, 0.13). One reason behind the inefficacy of the intervention was the short time of the educational course and the lack of willingness to participate. The elderly should be encouraged to follow programs and perform exercises. Attending educational sessions and pursuing them are of high importance.</p><p>Lio <italic>et al</italic>. carried out a study entitled Balance Confidence Improves with Resistance or Agility training: Increase is not Correlated with Objective Changes in Fall Risk and Physical Abilities.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In this study, 89 elderly women participated in three randomly selected groups including resistance educational program, agility educational program, and stretching exercises for 13 weeks, two times a week, each for 50 minutes.</p><p>As indicated by the results of the study, both resistance and agility educational programs improved the level of balance confidence. However, these changes had no correlation with the level of fear of falling, speed of walking, and physical activities. Elderly interventional programs for reducing the level of fear of falling should cover educational programs including factors effective on fear of falling. For this, the intervention should not be too short.</p><p>The limitation of this study was the difficulty of explaining some of the questions to the elderly. Thus, the questions were clarified for the participants to the extent possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results showed that training can reduce the fear of falling. Applying suitable educational materials and equipment attract learners, facilitate education, and make learning more effective and stable. Through displaying animated images, movements are shown more realistically with the chance of displaying them more slowly or rapidly. This results in elderly playing an important role in learning through knowledge transfer using two domains of mental-movement and mental-emotion. Because learning occurs less through movie than display, the present study emphasizes on applying display in skill education.</p><p>Therefore, by informing the authorities of elderly nursing homes and using the results of this study, their fear of falling can be reduced, and consequently, their quality of life can be improved. It is recommended that further research be conducted to confirm or refute this topic. Moreover, further research on the effectiveness of different teaching methods on the fear of falling in the elderly should be considered.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This article was the result of a research project of a master's dissertation on nursing education coded 921534 and was approved by the Research Deputy of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.
