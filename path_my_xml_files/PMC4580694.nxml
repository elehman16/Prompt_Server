We enrolled patients who underwent coronary angiograms (CAG) at the department of cardiology of the Chungnam National University and had signed informed consent forms between January 2012 and May 2013. The patients were classified as controls, consisting of individuals with no significant coronary artery stenosis, or patients with coronary artery disease. The CAD group, with chest pain caused by significant coronary artery stenosis, included stable, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI; Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, NSTEMI and ST elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI). STEMI was diagnosed when patients came to the hospital with chest pain lasting for more than 30 minutes within the past 12 hours and showing an ST segment elevation of &#x02265;1 mm in more than two adjacent limb leads or &#x02265;2 mm in more than two contiguous precordial leads. NSTEMI was diagnosed in patients with an elevation of cardiac biomarkers and chest pain lasting more than 10 minutes and without evidence of ST segment elevation. CAG in NSTEMI was conducted within 72 hours of admission. Exclusion criteria included controls who had prior CAD or any infectious disorders that caused chest pain, such as pneumonia, cholecystitis, or gastrointestinal disorders. Also, patients with cancer or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease (known to be associated with an elevated APE1/Ref-1) were excluded from both the control and CAD groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox effector factor 1 measurement</title><p>All blood samples were taken into vacuum tubes before the CAG. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature and then re-centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes to obtain cell-free serum, which was stored in liquid nitrogen until use. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify serum APE1/Ref-1 levels. Briefly, 96-microwell plates (Nunc) were pre-coated overnight with 100 &#x000b5;L of a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit anti-APE1/Ref-1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in coating buffer (0.5 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) in each well. After blocking with a blocking buffer {5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, (PBS-T)} at room temperature for 60 minutes, 100 &#x000b5;L of sample was added to the wells and the plates were incubated at 4&#x02103; for 90 minutes, and then washed 5 times with PBS-T. This was followed by the addition of 100 &#x000b5;L of a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-APE1/Ref-1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and further incubation at room temperature for 2 hours. The plate was then washed 7 times with PBS-T, and 100 &#x000b5;L of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) was added, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes. After further washing, 100 &#x000b5;L of freshly prepared tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added to the wells. The color development reaction was stopped by adding 100 &#x000b5;L of 2.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an automatic microtiter plate reader (Sunrise Xfluor4; Tecan Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Each sample was assayed in duplicate, and mean values were determined. Purified recombinant human APE1/Ref-1 (1 mg/mL) was serially diluted (5-fold) and used in a concentration series from 0.16-20 ng/100 &#x000b5;L to establish a standard curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical data collection and clinical outcomes</title><p>Basic demographic data, past clinical history, and blood chemistry test results were collected from the patients' medical records. N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), creatinine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponin-I were analyzed together.</p><p>Patients were monitored for an additional 24.0&#x000b1;7.4 months to determine the occurrence of major adverse clinical events (MACEs). MACEs included death, recurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and revascularization including new vessel revascularization, target vessel revascularization, and target lesion revascularization. The revascularization that was planned at the time of enrollment was excluded, and it was only included when it was performed due to the progression of symptoms or stenosis. All events were determined by reviewing the patients' medical records with regular clinical follow-up. In patients without regular clinical follow-up, telephone interviews were conducted and deaths were checked from the nationwide database from the National Health Institute Service in Korea.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using standard software (SPSS version 20.0, IBM Co., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables are presented as frequency and percentage. Summary data were expressed as mean&#x000b1;standard error of the mean or percentage of patients. Categorical variables were compared with &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and continuous variables were compared with Student's t-test or analysis of variance. Bivariate correlation analysis was used to compare APE1/Ref-1 with other cardiovascular biomarkers. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to compute the impact of adverse clinical events at each time point. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>We enrolled 360 patients in total (237 men; mean age 64&#x000b1;12 years old).

There were no gender differences (0.59 &#x000b1;0.08 ng/100 &#x000b5;L for men vs. 0.47&#x000b1;0.10 ng/100 &#x000b5;L for women). The same results were observed in both groups (control vs. CAD; 0.19&#x000b1;0.13 ng/100 &#x000b5;L vs. 0.64&#x000b1;0.89 ng/100 &#x000b5;L for men, 0.07 &#x000b1;0.06 ng/100 &#x000b5;L vs. 0.60&#x000b1;0.13 ng/100 &#x000b5;L for women, p&#x0003c;0.02). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of APE1/Ref-1 in detecting CAD. The ROC curve from serum samples of 57 controls and 303 patients with CAD resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.592 to 0.729) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The sensitivity and specificity of APE1/Ref-1 were estimated at the optimal cut-off value in order to maximize sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio. On this basis, the optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 0.36 and 0.95, using a cut-off value of 0.16 ng/100 &#x000b5;L.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox effector factor 1 is higher in patients with myocardial infarction than angina</title><p>The levels of APE1/Ref-1 were higher in patients with MI than angina in the CAD group (0.81&#x000b1;0.101.30 for MI vs. 0.38&#x000b1;0.11 ng/100 &#x000b5;L for angina, p&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

There were significantly higher in STEMI than in the control group, but not in NSTEMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Also, we analyzed the levels of serum APE1/Ref-1 according to the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade flow in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. The lower TIMI flow was significantly correlated with higher APE1/Ref-1 (0.12&#x000b1;0.07 for control vs. 0.45&#x000b1;0.13 for TIMI flow 3 vs. 0.88&#x000b1;0.09 ng/100 &#x000b5;L for TIMI flow 0-2, p&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Four days after the CAG, serum APE1/Ref-1 was re-measured from 37 patients who were selected randomly among the STEMI patients.

Cox proportional hazard regression also showed that serum APE1/Ref-1 was not associated with MACE. Only hsCRP appeared to be associated with MACE (hazard ratio 1.029, p&#x0003c;0.01), but not NT-proBNP or ejection fraction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we demonstrate, for the first time, that serum APE1/Ref-1 is increased in patients with coronary artery disease, and that it is correlated with NT pro-BNP, troponin I and ejection fraction. The cut-off value of APE1/Ref1 to distinguish the CAD group from the control group is 0.16 ng/100 &#x000b5;L, providing the optimal combination of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio.</p><p>There are many conditions which reveal elevated levels of APE-1/Ref-1, such as cancer, inflammatory state, hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis, and other undescribed conditions.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref> In relation to cardiovascular disease, Jeon et al.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref> reported that the mean arterial blood pressure in APE1/Ref-1 heterozygotic mice is significantly higher than in wild type mice.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11)</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> Naganuma et al.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5)</xref> suggested that the APE1/Ref-1 gene appears to be a susceptibility gene for essential hypertension. Martinet et al.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref> reported that APE1/Ref-1 as a DNA repair enzyme is elevated in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. In other words, APE1/Ref-1 is increased and activated for radiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), ischemia/reperfusion (IR), hypoxia and other conditions. Although many reports have showed that APE1/Ref-1 is localized to the nucleus and the underlying mechanism for serum APE1/Ref-1 existence is completely elucidated, it was recently reported that APE1/Ref-1 was secreted into the bloodstream in response to lipopolysaccharides.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14)</xref> In lung and bladder cancer, elevation of serum APE1/Ref-1 has been identified.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15)</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref> Considering that CAD is associated with chronic inflammation, ROS, and IR injury, the elevation of APE1/Ref-1 in the sera of patients with CAD may be natural and expected. The increased inflammatory response from plaque rupture in acute coronary syndrome, especially in myocardial infarctions, may explain the higher levels of serum APE1/Ref-1 in MI than in angina, as shown in the present study. However, the results show that the AUC (0.66) is too low and the sensitivity (0.36) make the APE-1/Ref-1 level would not be a good candidate as a cardiac specific biomarker in the diagnosis of CAD. It might be related other possible conditions which affect the levels of APE1/Ref-1, such as inflammation, cancer, or other atherosclerosis or ischemic disease.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref> Also, there are overlapping groups between the APE1/Ref-1 levels in the control and CAD groups. The patients in the control group who had hypertension or diabetes showed relatively higher levels of APE1/Ref-1. The patients with NSTEMI show wide range of APE1/Ref-1 concentrations from 0 to 2.97 ng/100 &#x000b5;L. The wide range of APE1/Ref-1 might be related to the heterogeneity of patients with NSTEMI, such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and the various time between the disease onset and the blood collection (in this data, APE1/Ref-1 decreased after a few days). We did not analyze the relationship between APE1/Ref-1 and the NSTEMI risk score. We think the overlapping itself shows that APE1/Ref-1 would not be the best biomarker. The level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, a biomarker of atherosclerosis, shows significant overlap between the control and CAD groups. Though our data showed no significant differences between the control and NSTEMI groups, if the cuff-off value is increased, differences will be evident. Even though serum APE1/Ref-1 shows a limited diagnostic power, and ability differentiate acute coronary syndrome in those who present with chest pain in the emergency room, our data demonstrated that the serum levels of APE1/Ref-1 in patients with CAD were significantly elevated compared to those of the control group. A larger study is needed to verify the usefulness of serum APE1/Ref-1 as a diagnostic cardiac biomarker.</p><p>What is the role of elevated APE1/Ref-1 in CAD? Is it a just inflammation marker? Our data shows that APE1/Ref 1 has no correlation with hsCRP. This may mean that the elevation of serum APE1/Ref-1 in CAD is not a non-specific result solely due to inflammation. It is commonly accepted that APE1/Ref-1 activation is required for protecting cells from oxidative injuries.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17)</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18)</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref> Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the overexpression of APE1/Ref-1 is able to prevent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death in different cells systems.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21)</xref> Recombinant APE1/Ref-1 protein treatment inhibited tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule expression in cultured endothelial cells.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref> So, we suggest that the elevation of APE1/Ref-1 is related to oxidative injury of the myocardium and vessel wall, and the reason for the elevation is to prevent cell death. The serum levels of APE1/Ref-1 were not correlated with the severity of myocardial injury, such as peak troponin I or peak CK-MB. Even though serum APE1/Ref-1 positively correlated with NT-proBNP and troponin I, and was negatively correlated with ejection fraction, we suggest that serum APE1/Ref-1 elevation might be related to vessel well damage not myocardial damage. We were unable to identify the usefulness of APE1/Ref-1 as a prognostic biomarker because it was not correlated with clinical outcome. Although serum APE1/Ref-1 was more elevated in patients with MI, it did not show any association with adverse clinical events. These results might be related to the small sample size. In this study, there were only 35 MACEs in 354 cases during a follow-up period of 24.0&#x000b1;7.4 months. Any factors affecting adverse clinical outcomes, such as NT-proBNP, high troponin I, and ejection fraction, with the exception of hsCRP, were not associated with MACEs. That means the sample size of this study was too small to confirm these effects. Also, the fact that MI patients have a worse prognosis compared with angina was not seen in the present study. So, we think that a larger study is needed to evaluate the relationship between serum APE1/Ref-1 and clinical outcomes and to determine its usefulness for prognosis.</p><p>Our study has several limitations related to its small sample size. Although we included blood samples from all groups we examined, all measurements of serum APE1/Ref-1 were not taken at the same time and within six months after the initial collection. Even though we excluded diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, we could not completely eliminate other possible conditions that could cause changes in APE1/Ref-1. The possibility that medication could be responsible for alterations of APE1/Ref-1 should be considered, even though we followed the protocol for drug therapies.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that serum APE1/Ref-1 may be increased in patients with CAD. It is correlated with other cardiovascular biomarkers such as troponin I, N-terminal pro-B type and ejection fraction. However, we need larger studies to determine its usefulness as a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis and prognostic prediction in CAD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the Korean Society of Cardiology 2012, Chungnam National University Hospital Research Fund 2012, and Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), fund by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2014R1A6A1029617).
