We introduced the 3C3R-PBL method into a pediatric teaching plan, and evaluated its effectiveness and feasibility. The 3C3R model was applied in a pediatric problem design teaching plan &#x0201c;why the lips turn purple when a baby is crying&#x0201d;. All students were assigned either into a traditional PBL course or into a 9-step 3C3R model PBL course (3C3R-PBL). The performance outcomes of both groups were compared. For the PBL group, the proportion of students scoring &#x02265;4 for content, context, and problem design connection, was 90.8%, 80.3%, and 64.5% respectively, while for tutors, it was 71.4%, 71.4%, and 28.6%; for researching, reasoning, and reflecting, the proportion of students scoring &#x02265;4 was 81.6%, 55.3%, and 40.8%, while for tutors, it was 71.4%, 100%, and 57.1%. The learning difficulty was not considered high with only 31.6% of students and 42.9% of tutors rating the task as difficult. For the 3C3R-PBL group, the proportion of students scoring content, context, and connection, &#x02265;4 was 100%, 98.4%, and 90.5%, while for tutors it was 100%, 100%, 83.3%; for researching, reasoning, and reflecting, the proportion of students scoring &#x02265;4 was 95.2%, 88.9%, and 76.2%, while for tutors it was 100% for all 3 R components. Students and tutors were convinced by the content, case context, research process and reasoning process of both teaching plans, while scores for connection and reflecting were significantly improved when the PBL plan was amended by a 3C3R model (p&#x0003c;0.05) and the case learning difficulty was statistically increased (p&#x0003c;0.05). The 3C3R model, evaluated for the first time in China, was helpful for effective and reliable problem design in a pediatric PBL teaching plan for Chinese students.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Project of the 4th Undergraduate Education Highland.

With the deepening of the PBL teaching practice in basic and higher education, the validity of PBL became a widely concerned point of discussion for a large number of scholars and practitioners and has been a topic of public debate since the late 50&#x02032;s <xref rid="pone.0063412-Romero1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-Strohfeldt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-Benedict1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. PBL advocates insist that PBL is more effective than traditional methods in reducing inert knowledge and in improving students' problem solving and self-directed learning abilities <xref rid="pone.0063412-Okubo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Skeptics are adamant that PBL is expensive and inefficient, since it takes more time for students to achieve the desired learning outcomes compared to conventional teaching <xref rid="pone.0063412-Farnsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and it is less effective than traditional methods, because its minimum guidelines do not meet the requirements of the human cognitive system <xref rid="pone.0063412-Kirschner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In a PBL course, students work in groups and learning is achieved through solving a problem or series of problems rather than by passively learning from materials received from a tutor/instructor presented in a logical order and in accordance with a &#x0201c;textbook&#x0201d;. The content of a PBL course consists of addressing issues and information necessary to solve problems. The core of PBL therefore is a problem, making problem design the key to successful application of PBL <xref rid="pone.0063412-Barrows1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To address the challenging task of generating or selecting a problem, Hung developed a 3C3R model <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to guide the design of effective, precise and reliable problems. Hung noted that if PBL problems are invalid, or if ambiguous information outside of the plan is contained in the issues, then the problem itself may lead to inappropriate (that is, insufficient, excessive or out of topic) content coverage, and thus to inappropriate problem-solving skills (above or below the learner's ability). Due to these shortcomings, invalid PBL problems will affect the group's ability to build upon previous knowledge and problem-solving processes, cause difficulties for students in raising learning problems covered in the original designed problems, affect students' self-directed learning, which will in turn affect the students in gaining the contents as well as affect their overall learning experience. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063412-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the framework of a 3C3R model <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> applied in a PBL problem design, which is composed of two parts.</p><fig id="pone-0063412-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0063412.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Framework of a 3C3R-PBL problem design.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0063412.g001"/></fig><p>The core part of 3C3R contains 3Cs (<bold>Content, Context and Connection)</bold>, including the learning content and concept as a key point in a PBL problem design <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Three aspects for the students' knowledge, problem solving and self-directed learning capacity should be considered when designing the content and scope. In addition, the design should reflect the cognitive ability and PBL experiences of the students, so that suitable anticipated goals are developed. The 3R process (<bold>Researching, Reasoning and Reflecting</bold>), is closely related to and designed around the core of 3Cs. A 3R design focuses on mastering the necessary learning contents, developing the expected learning goals in appropriate depth, utilizing proper and effective research methods, using rational and efficient reasoning processes, while integrating conceptual knowledge processes and effective strategies to solve the problem <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the problem of neglecting the PBL learning outcome due to too much emphasis on the depth of the learning content in the problem design can be avoided. 3R design can enhance the students' ability to solve problems in cognitive processes and can cultivate self-directed learning and study habits. In 2009, the 3C3R problem design model was further improved and a 9-step design process was developed to guide the problem design of PBL teaching, thereby increasing PBL effectiveness by analyzing and optimizing PBL problems <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Since its first implementation, PBL has become a prominent instructional method in medical and health science education throughout the world <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung4" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; however, no uniform curricula and teaching material have been implemented for a pediatric PBL curriculum in China. Without uniform curricula, tutors must develop PBL curricula independently based on their different conditions <xref rid="pone.0063412-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-McGrath1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. By following the conceptual framework of a 3C3R problem design model, PBL curriculum designers will be able to systematically design more effective problems.</p><p>This study was designed to foster medical school students' abilities to master diagnosis, recognize clinical manifestations and complications, as well as determine the prognosis and learn the treatment principles of common congenital heart diseases (CHD) in children through discussions in a PBL teaching course based on their knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Diagnostics. Although pediatric PBL problem design is well explored and established in China, to our knowledge this is the first time that a 3C3R-PBL model has been applied in China. Here we report our findings from comparing a PBL and a 3C3R-PBL model in a pediatric teaching setting and we discuss how a 3C3R-PBL model might be approved as a comprehensive, effective and feasible pediatric PBL teaching mode and concept in China.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Study subjects comprised 139 eight-year course, fifth grade students of the School of Medicine in the Shanghai Jiaotong University. 36 male and 40 female students, aged 22.35&#x000b1;0.68 years, attended the traditional PBL course (PBL group) and were randomly assigned into one of 7 subgroups; 30 male and 33 female students, aged 22.50&#x000b1;0.75 years attended the 9 step 3C3R model (3C3R-PBL group) and were randomly assigned into one of 6 subgroups.

Groups began their course with reasonable problems that were raised by their tutors and the students were tasked with solving the chosen problem. Students formed their personal views through reading literatures in related books or Internet and from discussion with their group members. In the last 20 minutes of a lesson, the tutors' and students' questions were answered in a discussion summary. The lesson ended after the students' opinions about the teaching plan had been collected.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Application of a 3C3R model in modifying a pediatric PBL teaching plan (The 9-step problem design process)</title><p>Based on traditional PBL courses, the 3C3R model was applied in order to analyze and evaluate the PBL teaching plan, involving the content, context, and connection among several parts of researching, reasoning, reflecting processes, and learning difficulties.</p><p>Content: Well-designed PBL problems should consider several aspects of the content components. First, problems must be aligned with curricular standards so that students' problem-solving and self-directed learning skill training and their domain/content knowledge proficiency will meet the standards. Moreover, teachers should use these standards to identify the major concepts and areas of the topic or subject, and then design PBL problems accordingly. Second, scope must be considered to ensure that the problems have sufficient breadth and depth. Achieving the proper scope can be accomplished by conducting content/task analyses of the learning goal. In the limited time frame of our PBL course, we sought to balance factual knowledge acquisition with development of problem-solving skills, including the alignment with the university curricular standards and ensuring the students' domain/content knowledge proficiency. For example, we only provided information that would typically be available to a physician in a clinical situation such as medical history, laboratory examinations and image materials. The information may however overstrain some students, not familiar with this new method of teaching. As long as the information and materials provided are complete and intelligible, the potential problem of students being overstrained should be avoided. The question, &#x0201c;is the information provided by medical history, laboratory examinations, and image materials complete and intelligible&#x0201d; therefore addresses this problem (question 7 as well) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063412.s001">Table S1</xref>). To further develop our 3C3R-PBL teaching plan, we integrated our experiences and varied the problem design or the information provided based on our results as well as coordinated our teaching particularly regarding domain knowledge.</p><p>Context: According to Hung, the context should lead to a contextual knowledge. He further emphasized that it is the authentic context of a problem that should motivate students to learn and will determine how actively the learners participate in the problem solving process. Authenticity includes contextual validity (problems should be relevant for the students' later work), degree of contextualization (the problem should be tailored so it is not too specific or too broad), as well as context relevance and proximity, which influences the degree to which the learners take ownership of the problems (students' intrinsic motivation). If the contextual components are poorly designed then student motivation to develop a self-directed problem-solving concept might be lowered <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The answer to the question &#x0201c;is the case context attractive&#x0201d; reflects mainly the interest of the students, thereby covering the above-mentioned items in one simple question (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063412.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Connection: Students should be able to master the knowledge they learn in the lesson, which can be determined by their questions and the group discussion according to the connection of concept, principles and program of the medical knowledge. In our study connection included application of information about cyanosis, murmur, ischemia attack and others; the aims of the study included knowledge about cardiac embryonic developmental disorders, congenital cardiac malformations, fetal blood circulation characteristics, formation of post-natal hemodynamic changes, congenital heart disease classification and hemodynamic changes as well as congenital heart disease complications, prognosis and treatment principles, particularly the treatment of acute tet spells in children. The problem should be solved by using cyanosis differential diagnosis knowledge, and general differential diagnosis considerations of congenital heart diseases. Connection was evaluated with the question &#x0201c;can I discuss and connect disease related knowledge contents? (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063412.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Researching: Hung stated in his 3C3R model, that goal design and context specifications should lead to an effective researching component of a problem. Defining specific problem goals should direct the systemic research and data collection processes, while context specification determines the initial frame of reference and influences what the students' choose to research and how they process the information related to the problem-solving tasks. He also emphasized that the learning should follow the conventional researching processes practiced by the professionals in the particular field <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In our study design, research pertained mainly to clinical practice conditions and the research process was guided by tutor observations of the students. For example, tutors assessed whether students were clearly aware of the current state of the problem, their state of known information (such as cyanosis, heart murmur) and unknown information, but the students had to establish their own knowledge base. The act of researching encompasses a variety of channels to collect information and to determine the reliability of data, and includes self-directed learning skills and the ability to analyze and summarize data by processing this information. The research design component of the model thus evaluated whether the students have exploration desire and whether they clearly understood the focus of the domain knowledge, as well as identified what further exploration was needed.</p><p>Reasoning: This learning component was related to how students analyzed the information pertinent to the problem. Questions included for example, what kinds of information are important? How to differentiate between central and peripheral cyanosis? What kind of diseases may result in cyanosis of children? What additional kinds of information are necessary from the patient to make further judgments? What is the significance for the patients of further laboratory examinations and other checks? How to decide a treatment for children? Thus the aim of the reasoning design was to let students learn how to accurately reason, how to analyze reasons when the group disagreed and to study whether they participated in a positive manner until the dispute was settled.</p><p>Reflection: In the case-based reflection process, questions assessed the student level of domain knowledge about congenital heart disease. For example, was the depth of learning appropriate? During PBL learning, did they use effective, efficient research methods? Did Tetralogy of Fallot tet spell lead to reasonable, effective reasoning processes? Were the students able to integrate their conceptual knowledge of congenital heart diseases? Did they develop effective problem-solving strategies? Thus, reflection helped the students achieve the best learning effect and let them master the knowledge after reflection and learning strategy adjustments.</p><p>The teaching plan based on CHD case studies and problems were designed following the 9-step problem design process.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Set goals and objectives</p><p>Teaching goals: Students will master the clinical features of CHD.

The diagnosis should therefore be based on the symptom of cyanosis. Thus, the problems were: What mechanisms are causing cyanosis? How to differentially diagnose central cyanosis and peripheral cyanosis? What is the common etiology of cyanosis? What clinical features and medical history is special for cyanosis? Following a systemic medical examination of the baby a heart murmur was observed by cardiac auscultation and a preliminary diagnosis of CHD was made. According to the medical history combined with the medical examination and auxiliary examinations, the next problem is to specify which kind of CHD the baby is suffering. Considering the features of the patient's medical history (tachypnea, face becomes purple when he was crying in the morning after he woke up) and based on his physical signs, it should be explained why cyanosis occurs in the baby and the relationship between cyanosis and CHD should be studied. Subsequently what kind of CHD could cause the cyanosis should be answered. What are the emergency treatment plans for a baby with cyanosis and tachypnea in the emergency room?

Therefore, in the problem design, discussions about what other CHDs might cause cyanosis should be introduced. Hence, the ideas for CHD diagnosis, classification for common CHDs, their clinical features and hemodynamic changes could be put forward. This is necessary for the diagnosis, reasoning, and differential diagnosis of CHD. b) Some peripheral knowledge may be beyond the target range, for example, incidence of CHD, relationship between congenital heart malformation and genetic &#x00026; environmental factors.</p><p>Context information: the context is well established based on the context information of the problems.</p><p>Problem solving skills and self-directed learning abilities: 1) Research part: Students need to research and compare some information such as medical history (cyanosis, tachypnea) and physical examination (cardiac murmur).

Students' critical thinking abilities are improving, they become more effective readers and writers and are thus provided with enhanced skills to solve complex problems rather than merely memorizing facts or developing step-by-step processes for learning through restrictive tasks or the application of simple assessments <xref rid="pone.0063412-Bransford1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-Donovan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. PBL problems should therefore come from real-life pediatric science, making the contextualized learning of knowledge or skills achievable, rather than from book materials with high-level structured and contextualized knowledge over view. The core components of a 3C3R problem design model are content, context and connection. Content is the first core component of 3C3R problem design model. Previous works have indicated that students taking PBL courses generally perform a little worse in the test of contents than those taking traditional courses <xref rid="pone.0063412-Alghasham1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Researchers attributed this to the fact that PBL may miss the attention to learn content breadth and factual knowledge acquisition due to its emphasis in content depth and higher-order thinking <xref rid="pone.0063412-Gingerich1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. For example, in this study, during discussion of the condition of children with CHD, the professional knowledge needed to be learned and mastered prior to group discussion, otherwise PBL learning lacks the necessary content. Therefore, a 3C3R concept is a necessary complement of the PBL teaching mode. The second core component of a 3C3R problem design model is context. In order to become effective problem solvers in a particular area, students need to gain not only sufficient domain knowledge but also specific situational knowledge, which is implicit but essential to effectively solve problems <xref rid="pone.0063412-Torp1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-Onyon1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The third core component of a 3C3R problem design model is connection. In general, in a PBL course, students organize their knowledge structure based on problems. PBL courses often contain a series of questions, which cover all aspects of the course. By using a case study, the knowledge can be &#x0201c;packed&#x0201d; into a problem or issue collection, so that students can effectively obtain relevant knowledge, which they will then be able to effectively recall and add to related knowledge, should they encounter the same or similar questions in practice.</p><p>However, effective problems do not necessarily guarantee that the desired satisfactory learning outcome will be achieved. Studies have previously shown that learning outcomes may be restricted by the lack of guidance and promotion in the learning process <xref rid="pone.0063412-PriceKerfoot1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063412-Sockalingam1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In this study, we attempted to ensure that the desired learning outcomes of the PBL course were achieved by applying the process components of the 3C3R problem design model, whose aims promote and support students' thinking and participation. The process components include researching, reasoning and reflecting, which are dynamic elements related with the static core elements in the 3C3R model. The main functions of these dynamic elements are: 1) to guide the students' efforts toward the expected learning goals; 2) to adjust the required cognitive processing level according to the student's preparation level and cognitive state; and 3) to reduce students' discomfort when they join the PBL course for the first time <xref rid="pone.0063412-Hung3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the general objective of 3R is to promote meaningful participation in problem-solving processes, and to train the students to be effective and efficient learners and problem solvers.</p><p>The results of this study indicated that the content, case context, research process, and reasoning process of the PBL teaching plan, after revision using a 3C3R model, were convincing to the students and tutors; scores of connection, and reflecting were significantly improved, and case learning difficulty was increased. The process of researching the case provides for mutual support among content, context, connection and researching, taking into concern the context and inner connection of the plan, the coherent echo of contents, and the clear, specific and complete statement of a problem <xref rid="pone.0063412-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The designed problems should be hierarchical, systematic and integrated thereby allowing students to adopt a correct and effective research method, leading them to analyze and choose the right strategy for solving problems, supporting their abilities to gain knowledge in the content, guiding them during researching and in organically integrating the gained conceptual knowledge into previously obtained knowledge. Moreover, if the learning difficulty of the teaching plan can be increased, it will be more challenging and will therefore increase students' interests in the study.</p><p>The reasoning component of the teaching plan should be fully supported by the context design as well as by connections among problems within the case study to allow the knowledge gained to be integrated into previously obtained knowledge <xref rid="pone.0063412-Okubo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Diagnostic conclusions based solely on auxiliary examinations, such as chest images, ECG and cardiac color Doppler ultrasound; however, they do not lead to the development of a deeper knowledge because the reasoning process is lacking. In the 3C3R designed teaching plan, the conclusions in diagnosis based on auxiliary examinations, such as the chest images, ECG and cardiac color Doppler ultrasound, were omitted. Only picture information was available so students used their own logical reasoning processes to form their conclusions.</p><p>Our survey results indicated that some students thought the learning plan was moderately difficult, while a few students thought the teaching plan was too simple, and the tetralogy of Fallot diagnosis was too easy. The problem design failed to motivate these students to seek out addition information and therefore did not train them in active exploration of problems. Reflecting is not supported by acquiring content knowledge, it must instead be drawn from conclusions arrived through analysis. The traditional PBL teaching plan did not support reflection, which affected the systematic and conceptualization integration of the related CHD knowledge. In the 3C3R modified PBL course version, the information of conclusions in diagnosis based on auxiliary examinations was omitted, which increased the difficulty in correct diagnosis of the case, and as a result, the learning plan became more challenging. The feedback of students and tutors indicated that the reflecting process was improved.</p><p>Limitations of our study included its small sample size of only 139 fifth grade students of eight-year studying courses in the medical school of Shanghai Jiaotong University and only 13 tutors participating in the PBL lessons. Further, the teaching contents were focused only on pediatric congenital heart diseases. To gain more information on the general acceptance of 3C3R-PBL courses, a larger number of students should be evaluated and the teaching topics should be expanded to include a variety of diseases, such as general newborn diseases, pediatric respiratory diseases, pediatric neurological diseases as well pediatric digestion system diseases, with a more complex problem design.</p><p>We believe that this was an important study in that it was the first time that the 3C3R model was introduced in a pediatric PBL lesson &#x0201c;why the lips turn purple when a baby is crying&#x0201d; and therefore benefited the PBL lesson designer to systematically design an effective problem and course in a clinical teaching program, which is in contrast to other medical teaching in China highly related to the daily clinical practice, while designed by practicing physicians. Taken together a 3C3R model is helpful in PBL problem design of Pediatrics teaching and enhances problem-based learning, improves medical students' ability to analyze and solve problems, and trains them in their self-oriented learning ability. The significant positive improvement during exploring an establishment of the 3C3R model for a pediatric teaching PBL problem design might be a benefit for training pediatric medical personnel as well as for an effective promotion and development of a general PBL teaching concept in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0063412.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
