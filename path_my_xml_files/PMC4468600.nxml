It is important to focus on return to work (RTW) during treatment of sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Factors such as self-efficacy and the intention to resume work despite having symptoms are important in the RTW process. We developed &#x0201c;E-health module embedded in Collaborative Occupational health care&#x0201d; (ECO) as a blended Web-based intervention with 2 parts: an eHealth module (Return@Work) for the employee aimed at changing cognitions of the employee regarding RTW and a decision aid via email supporting the occupational physician with advice regarding treatment and referral options based on monitoring the employee&#x02019;s progress during treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>This study evaluated the effect of a blended eHealth intervention (ECO) versus care as usual on time to RTW of sick-listed employees with common mental disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a 2-armed cluster randomized controlled trial.

Prolonged sickness absence can lead to social isolation, income reduction, reduction of meaningful activity, and anxiety to return to work (RTW) [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The longer the duration of sickness absence, the more difficult RTW may become. In addition to the consequences of sickness absence for the individual employee, sickness absence also leads to substantial costs for society. Sickness absence due to common mental disorders leads to one-third of all disability benefits in The Netherlands [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Estimated annual costs of sickness absence in The Netherlands due to mental disorders are &#x020ac;2.7 billion [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Return to Work</title><p>Several studies have shown that a reduction of common mental disorder symptoms was not enough to reduce sickness absence [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, interventions focusing on symptoms alone did not have an effect on sickness absence [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to also focus on RTW during treatment of sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. However, in Dutch social security legislation, treatment sickness certification is separated with occupational physicians playing an important role in the guidance of sickness absence while the curative sector provides treatment. Although this legislation was introduced to protect the employee, RTW is hampered as a result due to a lack of collaboration and communication between occupational physicians and the curative sector. Also, RTW is often not addressed in the treatment of sick-listed employees [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Another study showed that the occupational physicians often neither monitor symptoms nor evaluate the initiated treatment [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To overcome these barriers, Van der Feltz et al [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] studied a form of collaboration in which occupational physicians worked together with consultant psychiatrists in the guidance of employees with common mental disorders. Although this form of collaboration did not reveal a statistically significant reduction in the duration of sickness absence until RTW, the results were promising [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Vlasveld et al [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studied the effectiveness of an even more elaborated form of collaboration, namely a collaborative care model. In this model, an occupational physician trained in this model provided the treatment for major depressive disorder and the regular occupational physician provided the guidance in sickness absence. Despite the dual focus on RTW and symptoms, the results of this study showed an improvement of depressive symptoms but not of RTW [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These results may reflect implementation problems, which in turn could be explained by the fact that the employees and the occupational physicians felt uncomfortable with the occupational physician in the role of treatment provider, although the occupational physicians had received specialized training [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the dual focus on RTW and the recovery of symptoms remains important and efforts need to be made to improve that dual focus [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A better model could be one in which the occupational physician is supported in the referral of the employee to adequate treatment in the curative sector by decision support based on monitoring of common mental disorder symptoms of the employee. This calls for a low-access intervention, such as eHealth, including a decision aid for the occupational physician.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-Efficacy</title><p>Recent studies have shown the importance of factors such as self-efficacy and the intention to resume work despite having symptoms [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Return-to-work self-efficacy (RTW-SE) is the belief that employees have in their own ability to meet the demands required to RTW [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several studies have shown that RTW-SE is a predictor of actual RTW [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Van Oostrom et al [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that a workplace intervention was effective on lasting RTW only for employees who at baseline intended to RTW while still having symptoms. The results of this study suggest that a negative intention regarding RTW while having symptoms will probably hinder the RTW process and a lack of focus on factors such as RTW-SE in treatment may lead to unnecessary sickness absence. This would have important policy implications if factors such as RTW-SE could be influenced by interventions working on these cognitions.</p></sec><sec><title>Web-Based Intervention</title><p>To our knowledge, no intervention exists that specifically focuses on advancing RTW and cognitions regarding RTW for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders combined with monitoring of progress in their mental health and a decision aid for the occupational physician [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Because there is a need for highly available, low-threshold, low-cost interventions and more than 90% of Dutch households have Internet access, a Web-based intervention was developed [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The intervention was named &#x0201c;E-health module embedded in Collaborative Occupational health care&#x0201d; (ECO). The aim of ECO was to guide sick-listed employees with common mental disorders to RTW. The employee follows an eHealth module, known as Return@Work, which focuses on the employees&#x02019; cognitions regarding RTW with physical or psychological symptoms and options to resume work at least on a partial basis while symptoms are still present. Also, the recovery process of the employee is monitored in the eHealth module. An integral part of the intervention is that the occupational physician of the sick-listed employee with a common mental disorder receives automated suggestions by email for referral to adequate treatment in the curative sector from a decision aid when the monitoring of symptoms indicates a lack of progress. Progress is monitored in terms of physical and mental well-being and functioning [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of the ECO intervention on time to RTW and mental health outcomes. It was hypothesized that the ECO intervention would lead to a faster RTW and less common mental disorder symptoms than usual care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>The study was a 2-armed cluster randomized controlled trial. Randomization took place at the level of occupational physician. Employees in both conditions received sickness absence guidance as usual. Employees in the intervention condition received the ECO intervention in addition. The design of this study has been extensively described in Volker et al [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands, in February 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization of Clusters</title><p>The participants were sick-listed employees in small- to medium-sized companies visiting their occupational physician at Arbo Vitale (a large occupational health service) and sick-listed employees of GGz Breburg (a large mental health service employer) visiting their occupational physician, both in The Netherlands. Cluster randomization took place at the level of the occupational physicians to prevent contamination and thus to prevent dilution of the effect. At Arbo Vitale, occupational physicians working in the same region were clustered to reduce contamination due to occupational physicians who take over each other&#x02019;s caseloads when necessary. The clusters of occupational physicians were randomized by an independent statistician using a computer algorithm for randomization. Six regions (31 occupational physicians) were allocated to the ECO group and 6 regions (29 occupational physicians) were allocated to the control group.</p><p>At GGz Breburg, only 1 occupational physician was available. For this reason, a cluster crossover design was used at first with the first 100 employees approached as the control condition and subsequently the second 100 employees approached as the intervention condition. However, at the end of the planned control condition, the occupational physician was replaced with another occupational physician, with whom the intervention condition was conducted. Therefore, this can be considered as a pseudo-randomization design in GGz Breburg.</p><p>Because the occupational physicians had to guide the intervention, they could not be blinded to the group assignment after randomization. However, they participated in only 1 experimental condition: either ECO or care as usual (CAU). The research assistants and the participants were blind to the allocation when assessing the eligibility of sick-listed employees for participating in this study. If the participant met the inclusion criteria for this study and agreed to participate, the baseline questionnaire was sent by email. After the questionnaire was filled out and informed consent was given, the participant was informed by the researchers via telephone about the allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>A power calculation prior to the study indicated that a sample size of 200 participants was needed to have at least .80 power to detect differences in time to RTW given a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.6 [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><sec><title>Recruitment Procedure</title><p>All employees on sickness absence for any cause between 4 and 26 weeks who gave informed consent were screened for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item; PHQ-9), somatization (PHQ-15), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item; GAD-7). Employees who were considered as screen-positive on any of the 3 screening instruments were contacted by a research assistant, who was blinded to group assignment, by telephone. The research assistants checked for inclusion and exclusion criteria and provided information about the study.</p><p>Sick-listed employees who did not meet any of the exclusion criteria received the baseline questionnaire and a second informed consent form. Employees who completed the baseline questionnaire and gave their informed consent were included in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>Employees (aged &#x02265;18 years) who were on sickness absence between 4 and 26 weeks and screened positive (score &#x02265;10) on either the depression scale of the PHQ-9 and/or the somatization scale of the PHQ-15 and/or the GAD-7 were included. These instruments have shown good psychometric properties for the screening of depression, somatization, and anxiety [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Employees were excluded for participating in this study if they had insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language, were pregnant, or were involved in legal action against their employer. Furthermore, employees without access to the Internet were excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>ECO</title><p>The ECO intervention included 2 elements (an illustration of the ECO intervention can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>): (1) the Return@Work eHealth module and (2) an email decision aid for the occupation physician. Both are described subsequently.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the ECO intervention.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v17i5e116_fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Return@Work eHealth Module</title><p>The employee received an individual log-in code for the eHealth RTW module Return@Work. Return@Work included the following 5 modules: (1) psychoeducation, (2) a module aimed at cognitions with regard to RTW while having symptoms (based on cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] principles), (3) a module aimed at increasing problem-solving skills with problem-solving treatment (PST) exercises, (4) a module for pain and fatigue management and for reactivation, and (5) a module for relapse prevention. In total, the modules included 16 sessions. The content of Return@Work was tailor-made to the individual employee, depending on the symptoms and cognitions about RTW of the employee. As a consequence, not every employee received all modules; therefore, the total number of sessions ranged from 6 to 17. Furthermore, functioning and symptoms were monitored on a regular basis in Return@Work. A screenshot of Return@Work can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>The employees worked through Return@Work individually, but were free to discuss topics or assignments with the occupational physician. The occupational physicians were asked to follow the guidelines of the Dutch Board for Occupational Medicine (NVAB); thus, as in usual sickness guidance, the occupational physician and employee met each other face-to-face on a regular basis [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The occupational physicians were instructed to inquire about the employee&#x02019;s progress in Return@Work during those meetings and to support the employee if necessary [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><fig id="figure2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Screenshot of Return@Work.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v17i5e116_fig2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Email Decision Aid for the Occupational Physician</title><p>Furthermore, the occupational physicians received automated email messages that were based on a decision aid with principles of stepped collaborative care. The decision aid supported the occupational physicians in the sickness guidance of the employees, in the monitoring of symptoms, functioning, and RTW. The outcomes of the monitor in Return@Work were used in the fully automated email messages for the occupational physician to give advice for stepped care treatment. Furthermore, the decision aid gave the occupational physician access to a consultant psychiatrist who, when needed, gave advice in case of stagnation [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Training</title><p>The occupational physicians in the intervention group were trained by the researchers and a consultant psychiatrist before recruitment of participants began. The training lasted half a day. In the training, occupational physicians were taught about the background and content of Return@Work and were instructed on how to guide employees through Return@Work and how to work with the decision aid. They were taught the basic principles of PST and CBT and how to apply these principles in the guidance of the employee.</p></sec><sec><title>Care as Usual</title><p>The occupational physicians in the control group provided usual sickness guidance to their employees. CAU was protocoled according to the guidelines of the NVAB [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, several studies showed that adherence to this guideline was minimal [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For the process evaluation, actual provided care was assessed with a questionnaire by the participants in both groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Data were collected by the research staff of The Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction. Participants completed online self-report questionnaires at baseline (T0) and at 3 (T1), 6 (T2), 9 (T3), and 12 months (T4) after inclusion. Data about RTW were derived from the registers of the occupational health service (Arbo Vitale) or employer (GGzBreburg).</p></sec><sec><title>Primary Outcome Measure</title><p>The primary outcome measure was duration until first RTW defined as the duration of sickness absence in calendar days from the day of randomization until the moment of first partial or full RTW. Subsequently, full RTW was analyzed. In accordance with the Dutch Sickness Benefits legislation, sickness absence within 4 weeks of full RTW was considered as belonging to the initial period of sickness absence. Furthermore, the total number of days of sickness absence in the first year follow-up period was tracked.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Outcome Measures</title><p>Secondary outcome measures were the severity of depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms as measured with the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PHQ-15 in terms of response and remission. Response was defined as a 50% reduction in symptoms on the PHQ-9, GAD-7, or PHQ-15, with the restriction that the baseline score on the questionnaire on which response was evaluated was above the cut-off point of 10 (otherwise it was defined as no response). Remission was defined as a score lower than 5 on the PHQ-9, GAD-7, or PHQ-15, with the restriction that the baseline score on the questionnaire on which remission was evaluated was above the cut-off point of 10 [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Covariates</title><p>All relevant covariates were measured at baseline. Demographic data such as age, gender, marital status, education level, and nationality were collected. Comorbid chronic medical illness was measured using a 28-item questionnaire developed by Statistics Netherlands. Job characteristics were measured by the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Of the 100 participants who did log in at Return@Work, 10.0% (10/100) did not finish the introduction (which included information about Return@Work and a questionnaire). The mean number of total log-ins of the 90 participants who finished the introduction and actually started Return@Work was 7.8 (SD 6.1). Furthermore, 40% (36/90) of the participants minimally completed half of the modules of Return@Work.</p><p>For the 3-month questionnaire, 69 participants in the ECO condition answered additional questions about their experiences with Return@Work. Of these, 29% (20/69) reported that they discussed Return@Work with their occupational physician, initiated by themselves or their occupational physician. Furthermore, 15% (10/69) of the participants stated that Return@Work did not fit with their situation/problems, 61% (42/69) stated that Return@Work somewhat fit, and 24% (17/69) stated that Return@Work fit (quite) well. The psychiatrist was consulted only once by the occupational physicians.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Per-Protocol Analyses</title><p>In the per-protocol analyses, the analyses on the primary outcomes were repeated, comparing the participants in the ECO condition who finished the introduction of Return@Work (n=90) with the CAU participants (n=89). The results of the per-protocol analyses did not differ from the results of the intention-to-treat analyses. The ECO participants who finished the introduction of Return@Work differed significantly from the CAU participants in duration until first RTW (HR 1.447, 95% CI 1.051-1.991; B=.369, SE=0.163; <italic>P</italic>=.02); however, they did not differ significantly from the CAU participants in duration until full RTW (HR 1.370, 95% CI 0.951-1.974; B=.315, SE=0.186; <italic>P</italic>=.09).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Interpretation and Comparison With Other Studies</title><p>This study showed a positive effect of the ECO intervention on the duration until first RTW. On average, the participants in the ECO group returned to work (either partial or full) 27 days earlier than the participants in the control group receiving CAU did. Because eHealth focuses on the importance of RTW and on the employees&#x02019; perceptions regarding RTW with symptoms, we expected that the intervention would lead to a faster first RTW than CAU. However, we also expected that the partial RTW would lead to full RTW. On average, the participants in the ECO condition achieved full RTW 47 days earlier than the participants in the control condition, but this difference was not significant at the 5% level (2-tailed test). It may be that to reliably assess the effect on full RTW, larger comparison groups or a longer follow-up would be needed. However, another explanation may be that full RTW did not differ significantly between the 2 groups because the intervention primarily focused on enhancing partial RTW in a patient group that is known from the literature to have long-term full sickness absence and low full RTW. Time lag for RTW in patients with depression in remission has been found to be at least a year in general [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Maybe, in order to attain faster full RTW, the intervention should be longer and more explicitly focus on full RTW.</p><p>Additionally, Hees et al [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] examined the perspectives of some key stakeholders regarding the definition of successful RTW outcome after sickness absence due to common mental disorders. One of the results of this study was that the stakeholders did not necessarily consider full RTW as a prerequisite for successful RTW, but instead regarded a subjective criterion (ie, consensus between supervisor and employee) as more important for successful RTW [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Partial RTW could even be a long-term solution of employees with reduced work ability [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Because of the relatively long sickness duration of the participants at the start of our study, this could be the case in this study. Unfortunately, it is unknown whether partial RTW was a satisfactory outcome for all parties concerned.</p><p>The intervention was not intended to be a treatment for common mental disorders, but we expected that the feedback and support that the occupational physicians received from the decision aid would lead to a reduction of common mental disorder symptoms for the sick-listed employees. Also, a faster RTW might have a positive effect on the recovery from symptoms. For remission, at 9 months after baseline a significant difference was found between the 2 groups in favor of the ECO intervention. However, no effect was found on treatment response and the effect on remission did not persist through 12 months after baseline. This might be explained by the low adherence of the occupational physicians to the intervention. The eHealth module for the employee, Return@Work, was meant to be blended. The occupational physicians were instructed to inquire about the employee&#x02019;s progress in Return@Work at the regular consults. However, the process outcomes showed that only 29% of the employees reported that they discussed the intervention with the occupational physician. Another signal of low adherence by the occupational physicians was the fact that only 1 occupational physician contacted the consultant psychiatrist during this study. It is unknown why the occupational physicians did not consult the psychiatrist more often. Another component of the ECO intervention was the decision aid. The decision aid supported the occupational physicians in the monitoring of symptoms, functioning, and RTW, and gave advice for stepped care treatment and referral to the curative sector. Unfortunately, it is unknown if the occupational physicians did adhere to the email messages from the decision aid. But the fact that the process outcomes showed that there were no differences in health care use between the ECO and CAU groups is an indication that the intervention did not lead to more referrals.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>This study discussed an innovative approach to reduce sickness absence because of its combination of an eHealth intervention aimed at RTW for sick-listed employees with a decision aid via email and the possibility of consulting a psychiatrist for the occupational physicians. However, the study design made it difficult to make inferences about the effectiveness of the different components of the intervention. However, there were several (mentioned previously) signals that the occupational physicians did not adhere to the intervention very well; therefore, it could be expected that the significant differences were mostly due to the Return@Work eHealth module.</p><p>The possible limited adherence of the occupational physician to the intervention could be caused by the design of this study. The participants were recruited by the researchers and the occupational physician was not informed (because of ethical reasons) about the participation of the employee until the employee started the eHealth module. The occupational physicians were informed by email and it is possible that they sometimes missed this notification. Furthermore, due to a reorganization by Arbo Vitale during this study, some of the sick-listed employees were not guided by 1 occupational physician, but by several occupational physicians. This was not helpful for the adherence of the occupational physicians to the ECO intervention.</p><p>Another limitation was that a relatively high proportion of the participants did not return 1 or more of the follow-up questionnaires. At 9 months, the loss to follow-up rate was significantly higher in the ECO condition than the CAU condition. Also at 9 months, significantly more participants in the ECO condition achieved remission than in the control condition. It might be the case that many participants who did not fill out the questionnaire at 9 months were not recovered, but it was also possible that the recovered participants did not feel the urge to fill out the questionnaires anymore. However, at baseline there were no differences between the participants who did or did not fill out the questionnaire at 9 months. Thus, no indications for selective dropout could be found in this study.</p><p>Furthermore, to achieve a successful RTW, it is important that all relevant stakeholders facilitate RTW [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A limitation of the ECO intervention was that the employers have no active role in the intervention. The cognitions that employees have about not being able to resume work while having symptoms is a cognition that employers/managers could also have. This could be one of the reasons why there was no effect of the ECO intervention on full RTW.</p></sec><sec><title>Generalizability</title><p>A rather large population was screened for eligibility for participation in this study (N=14,615). From this population, 10,269 employees did not respond to screening, which might limit the generalizability of the findings of this study. It is unknown for what reasons employees did not respond. However, the employees who received a screener were on sickness absence for any cause and the focus of the study was explained as being on psychiatric symptoms, so it is possible that a large proportion of the nonresponders did not respond because they did not fit the description of the study. Also, it is possible that they may not have been on sickness absence anymore.</p><p>The participants in this study were mainly sick-listed employees of Dutch nationality, working in small- to medium-sized companies whose employer had insurance for the costs of sickness absence and sickness guidance. There is no indication that these employees would react differently to the intervention than employees from, for example, large companies. However, the organization of the sickness guidance in the company might have an effect on the ECO intervention. In this study, the sick-listed employees were not always guided by the same occupational physician. It might be the case that in larger companies where 1 occupational physician gives guidance to all sick-listed employees, the ECO intervention would be better guided by the sole occupational physician than the multiple occupational physicians did in this study. Continuity and accessibility of the occupational physician are important aspects for successful implementation of the ECO intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine an (eHealth) intervention specifically focused on RTW and cognitions regarding RTW while still having symptoms for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders with a decision aid for the occupational physician. It is promising that even though the adherence of the occupational physician to the ECO intervention was not optimal, ECO led to a faster first RTW and more remission of common mental disorder symptoms. This suggests that the potential of the ECO intervention might be better exploited with better continuity in and adherence of occupational physicians. Future research on optimizing the benefits of the ECO intervention should focus on improving the involvement of the occupational physician throughout the intervention, involving the employer/manager of the sick-listed employee, and monitoring the adherence of the occupational physicians to the decision aid.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all participating occupational physicians, employers, and employees for participating in the study.
