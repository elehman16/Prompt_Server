function in patients with stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Fourteen patients with stroke
were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The
experimental group underwent eye movement training while the control group underwent
general gait training five times per week for six weeks. [Results] Patient walking speed,
cadence, and step length were measured by ink-footprint. The experimental group exhibited
significant changes in walking speed, cadence, and step length following training, while
the control group exhibited no differences. [Conclusion] Findings indicate that eye
movement training should be considered as part of a functional gait training program for
patients with stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Eye movement</kwd><kwd>Gait function</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Following a stroke, many patients have problems with asymmetric posture and abnormal
balance, which can lead to difficulty with standing and gait<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Diverse brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and
brain stem are involved in gait. For nerve cells in individual brain regions to be
rhythmically activated in order to achieve balance during normal gait, three functional
factors are necessary: the supporting action of the musculoskeletal system, the coordination
of functional eye movement, and the integration of sensory function with action<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. As such, eye movement training, in which
movement patterns are adjusted through visual feedback, has been studied recently. Visual
field and visual accuracy affect balance and movement ability, and in particular, patients
with problems in the visual system often develop problems with balance ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Eye movement training, intended to improve
balance and visual ability, is based on neuroplasticity, which is the foundation of the
rehabilitation of patients with central nervous system diseases. The neurologic basis for
eye movement training can be found in the role of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The VOR
is one of the reflexes induced by the vestibular system. The VOR is involved in the
maintenance of balance and plays an important role in sensing body position in space as well
as equilibrium<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In one study, when used
as part of a fall prevention program, eye movement training improved agility and dynamic
balance control in older people by impacting vision and proprioceptive sensory information
that affects balance control<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
most eye movement studies have been focused on balance, and studies relating eye movement
training to gait have been insufficient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Fourteen stroke patients in OO Hospital, located in Yong-in City, were divided into an
experimental group of seven patients and a control group of seven patients. These patients
were selected from among those who understood the purpose of the present study and signed a
written agreement to participate in the study in accordance with the ethical principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The selection criteria were as follows: patients who had a stroke at least six months
prior, patients who had no visual field defects or vestibular system abnormality, patients
who had no orthopedic problems, patients who could walk without caretaker assistance, and
patients who had no problem with their state of consciousness. Both the experimental group
and the control group consisted of three males and four females. The mean ages, heights, and
weights of the experimental group and the control group were 63.37 &#x000b1; 3.78&#x02005;years and 62.25 &#x000b1;
5.67&#x02005;years, 163.87 &#x000b1; 5.27&#x02005;cm and 164.0 &#x000b1; 7.23&#x02005;cm, and 67.5 &#x000b1; 2.92 kg and 66.75 &#x000b1; 2.85 kg,
respectively.</p><p>Ink foot prints were used to assess gait parameters. Patients were instructed to step on an
inkpad and were asked to walk on the paper roll. A paper of 8&#x02005;m length was divided into a
5&#x02005;m walkway, with 1.5&#x02005;m area left at each end to start and finish lines. The footprints from
the sole of the feet were produced on the paper as the patients walked from one end of the
walkway to the other.</p><p>The content of the eye movement program was as follows: First, a picture card was shown to
the patient, and then mixed with 20 other cards and spread face up on the desk. The patient
was instructed to find that one card. This task was repeated approximately 20 times. Second,
the therapist moved a baton slowly while drawing curves and the patient was instructed to
keep his or her gaze fixed on the tip of the baton. In this task, the distance between the
baton and the patient was maintained at approximately 1&#x02005;m and the task was performed for
approximately five minutes. Third, the patient was instructed to shake his or her head
laterally as quickly as possible and a letter card with letters written upside down was
presented to the patient to read. This task was repeated approximately 10 times. Fourth, the
therapist moved a baton slowly from a point approximately 5&#x02005;cm away from the patient to a
point approximately 50&#x02005;cm away and the patient was instructed to keep his or her eyes on the
baton. This task was performed for approximately five minutes. The experimental group
underwent eye movement training while the control group underwent gait training for 20
minutes per session, five times per week for six months in total.</p><p>The data were statistically processed using SPSS software (Ver. 12.0) and t-tests were
conducted to examine the degree of improvement in gait function for the experimental group
and the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the intervention, the experimental group showed a statistically significant increase
in Walking speed (m/s) from 0.39 &#x000b1; 1.52 to 0.87 &#x000b1; 1.08 (p&#x0003c;0.05), but the control group
showed no significant difference, 0.47 &#x000b1; 1.10 and 0.66 &#x000b1; 2.01 (p&#x0003e;0.05). The experimental
group showed a statistically significant improvement in the Cadence (steps/min) from 75.58 &#x000b1;
0.90 to 81.65 &#x000b1; 5.95 (p&#x0003c;0.05), but the control group showed no significant improvement,
78.36 &#x000b1; 2.04 and 81.06 &#x000b1; 2.10 (p&#x0003e;0.05). The experimental group showed a statistically
significant increase in step length (m) from 0.53 &#x000b1; 0.01 to 0.56 &#x000b1; 0.11 (p&#x0003c;0.05), but the
control group showed no significant improvement, 0.52 &#x000b1; 0.04 and 0.53 &#x000b1; 0.10
(p&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A prior study on weight distribution and gait in patients with stroke reported on the
effects of visual feedback<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Likewise, a
study that added action observation training for patients with stroke using visual
information reported that the training brought about improvements in weight bearing,
stability, and gait function<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
present study, eye movement training brought about changes in walking speed over time,
resulting in significant differences following training. Another study reported that after
visual feedback training in patients with stroke, step length increased, along with walking
speed and step length<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study as well, eye movement training brought about significant increases in walking speed,
cadence, and step length. One study aimed at determining factors that affect gait in
community-based patients with stroke investigated balance, deterioration of cardiopulmonary
function, and walking speed, and reported that a diminished sense of balance led to
deterioration of gait function<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, exercise programs using visual feedback in patients with stroke have reported
improvements in walking speed, muscle strength, and balance ability, supporting the
importance of visual training<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The application of eye movement training
in patients with stroke who have difficulty with gait and balance is thought to induce
positive changes in gait function because the direct stimulation of the visual and
vestibular systems improves balance ability. The study subjects were greatly interested in
the therapy program and participated at a high level, which seemed to improve their balance
ability<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Eye movement training is
considered to be easy to complete for most patients, even at home. If further studies on eye
movement focused on increasing the length of the intervention period, various spatiotemporal
variables (stride, step, stride length and step width), kinetic parameters(joint moment and
power) and the larger numbers of subjects, eye movement training could be generalized into a
new exercise program for patients with stroke and additional effects could be examined.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Carr</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Nordholm</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Investigation of a new motor assessment scale for stroke
