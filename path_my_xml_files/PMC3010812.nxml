One hundred and two patients of opium addition admitted in Psychiatry Center Jodhpur were subjects for present study. The patients were divided into group A, B and C having thirty four in each group. These groups were identical with regards to sociodemographic variables, mean dose of opium and duration of intake. Group A was given clonidine in small doses, Group B symptomatic therapy and group C was given clonidine in high doses. Study was double blind. Record of blood pressure, pulse rate, other vital sign and withdrawal symptom (on Physician's Rating Scale) was kept twice daily, Treatment was continued for two weeks. Clonidine in high doses proved to be more effective than other therapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
