The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome in primary care when provided as an adjunct to usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Design: A two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial.</p><p>Setting: Primary care in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Patients: 233 patients had irritable bowel syndrome with average duration of 13 years and score of at least 100 on the IBS Symptom Severity Score (SSS).</p><p>Interventions: 116 patients were offered 10 weekly individualised acupuncture sessions plus usual care, 117 patients continued with usual care alone.</p><p>Measurements: Primary outcome was the IBS SSS at three months, with outcome data collected every three months to 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a statistically significant difference between groups at three months favouring acupuncture with a reduction in IBS Symptom Severity Score of &#x02212;27.43 (95% CI: &#x02013;48.66 to &#x02212;6.21, p = 0.012). The number needed to treat for successful treatment (&#x02265;50 point reduction in the IBS SSS) was six (95% CI: 3 to 17), based on 49% success in the acupuncture group vs. 31% in the control group, a difference between groups of 18% (95% CI: 6% to 31%). This benefit largely persisted at 6, 9 and 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome provided an additional benefit over usual care alone. The magnitude of the effect was sustained over the longer term. Acupuncture should be considered as a treatment option to be offered in primary care alongside other evidenced based treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN08827905</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Irritable bowel syndrome</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>General practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] have expressed their concerns regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of current treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In a UK survey, 5% of patients receiving acupuncture reported having consulted primarily for gastrointestinal complaints, the most common being IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the evidence on acupuncture for IBS is weak. A Cochrane review of six trials, with a median sample size of 54, found insufficient evidence to determine if acupuncture is an effective treatment for IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. No evidence of an acupuncture effect beyond placebo was found in two subsequent trials which controlled for non-specific effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Apart from three Chinese-based trials in the Cochrane review, none of the above trials were designed to evaluate the overall effect of acupuncture, <italic>i.e.</italic> an evaluation of the combined specific effect of acupuncture and non-specific effects associated with placebo. Moreover all of the trials delivered acupuncture in a way that the intervention was constrained, such that acupuncturists were not delivering acupuncture in a similar way to how they would do so normally in routine care. None of the trials were reported as based in primary care, instead they were reported as based in hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or settings were not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Given this evidence gap, and the uncertainty outlined in the Cochrane review, further investigation of acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome is merited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In this study we designed an open pragmatic randomised controlled trial, in which we account for both the temporal effects associated with any spontaneous recovery and the effects of regression-to-the-mean, with the aim of capturing the overall impact of acupuncture when provided as a referral option in primary care. Our focus on a primary care setting complements previous studies conducted in secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We aimed to provide acupuncture as close as possible to how it would normally be provided in routine care, with the incorporation of explanations and lifestyle advice based on acupuncture theory in a way that is integral to practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This focus on acupuncture as a complex intervention precludes the possibility of a feasible and valid sham to control for all interacting components in a two-arm trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our design mirrors that used in a trial of acupuncture for chronic low back pain which influenced policy in the UK; the study was central to the decision by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to recommend 10 sessions of acupuncture for persistent low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Based on this rationale, our research therefore aims to provide practical comparative data on acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome that is relevant to primary care and will be immediately applicable to patients and providers. This design provides the evidence needed to assist policy and decision-makers when considering acupuncture as a referral option for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design overview</title><p>Building on our pilot study (ISRCTN32823720) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we conducted a parallel-arm randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture plus usual care compared to usual care alone for the treatment of IBS based on a published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We received ethics approval from the York NHS Research Ethics Committee (08/H1311/66) in 2008. A cost-effectiveness analysis is reported separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Settings and participants</title><p>We recruited patients from the databases of five general practices. The GP practices identified potential participants aged 18 or older who had consulted their GP and been diagnosed with IBS, and coded accordingly on the practice database. A letter was sent to all potentially eligible participants, inviting them to complete a baseline questionnaire and consent form and return these to the York Trials Unit. We excluded patients who did not speak English, who had a current diagnosis of haemophilia, hepatitis, HIV, or were receiving cancer care, had had major gastrointestinal surgery in the previous six months, were pregnant, had a history of psychosis or substance abuse, or were receiving acupuncture at the time. Patients were recruited if they provided informed consent and scored 100 or more on the IBS Symptom Severity Score (SSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>We randomised participants equally to receive either a short course of traditional acupuncture plus usual care or usual care alone. The randomisation sequence was computer generated at the University of York by an independent data manager at the York Trials Unit, and fully concealed from the research and administrative staff who then informed participants of their allocation by telephone and subsequently by letter.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Nine professional acupuncturists provided the acupuncture, and all were registered with the British Acupuncture Council with at least three years&#x02019; post qualification experience, and were working at independent clinics. Their practice style was based on principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine or &#x0201c;TCM&#x0201d;. Acupuncturists provided up to 10 sessions of acupuncture, adapted from a previously tested protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which allowed explanations and life-style advice based on acupuncture theory and clinical judgement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. While actual selection of points was individualised for patients and allowed to change over time, there was standardisation of the function of the acupuncture based on the theoretical frameworks used, an approach proposed for maintaining interventional integrity when delivering complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>All patients remained under the care of their general practitioner, and received usual care according to need. We documented usual care, for both NHS and non-NHS treatments, in both groups at three, six, nine and 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes and follow-up</title><p>Our primary outcome measure was the IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS SSS). This is scored from 0 to 500 (&#x0003c;75 = no IBS, 75&#x02013;175 = &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; case, 175&#x02013;300 = &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; and 300+ = &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d;), and it has been validated for use in IBS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our primary end-point was at three months, with further follow-ups at six, nine and 12 months. We recorded participants&#x02019; baseline belief in acupuncture, expectations that acupuncture might help their IBS and treatment preferences.</p><p>Our secondary outcome measures were the IBS Non-Colonic Symptom Score (which includes lethargy &#x00026; tiredness, &#x0201c;wind&#x0201d;, backache, and other symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and SF-12 to evaluate patients&#x02019; health related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. EQ-5D was the primary outcome for the economic study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Outcomes at follow-up points were sought by postal questionnaire, and where that failed to elicit a response, the main outcome measure was sought by telephone.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In our pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we calculated that for a 50 point difference on the IBS SSS, and an adjusted standard deviation to be 105 points, we needed to recruit a sample size of 94 patients per arm to have 90% power and a significance level of 0.05. To allow for loss to follow up of a similar proportion as observed in the pilot at three months (13%), our trial required at least 220 patients. In the full-scale trial we used analysis of covariance on an intention-to-treat basis to evaluate changes between groups for the primary outcome of the IBS SSS at three months, while adjusting for baseline scores and general practice. The statistical analysis was conducted using SAS version 9.2 and STATA version 10 using a 2-sided 5% significance level. We took a 50 point improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or more on the IBS SSS between baseline and three months as a &#x0201c;success&#x0201d; for our number-needed-to-treat analysis. We used similar analyses to explore between-group differences on the IBS SSS at other time points, and on secondary outcome measures. We used linear regression to explore whether expectation, belief and preference were treatment effect modifiers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Recruitment and follow-up of participants</title><p>The trial recruited patients from five general practices (total list size of 53,666) between November 2008 and June 2009.

This was reflected in 49% of patients in the acupuncture group and 31% in the usual care group improving by more than 50 points in their IBS SSS score, with six being the number-needed-to-treat. This effect was largely sustained through to 12 months. We also found acupuncture for this group of patients had a high level of acceptability, as shown by the willingness by patients to attend for acupuncture once they had commenced treatment, completing on average 9 out of the 10 weekly acupuncture sessions that were available.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study is the first pragmatic randomised controlled trial of acupuncture for IBS in primary care. The design ensured that we controlled for temporal effects associated with spontaneous recovery and regression-to-mean effects associated with having a minimum cut-off on our IBS SSS scale. The trial had an adequate sample size, and was conducted rigorously at all stages, with unambiguously concealed allocation to prevent subversion of the randomisation. Of the 1,651 potentially eligible patients identified by GP practices that were invited to participate, 243 patients responded, a rate that is typical of trials in primary care that use a database method for recruitment. We used validated outcomes measures, with response rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months that were reasonably high, at over 80 per cent in the control group and over 90 per cent in the intervention group. We have documented that there was reasonable equivalence in usual care received in both groups at three months, which leads us to cautiously ascribe any differences between groups to the treatment provided by acupuncturists. We explored the impact of variables that are potentially associated with placebo effects, namely patients&#x02019; beliefs, expectations and treatment preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], but they were not found to be treatment effect modifiers.</p><p>There is likely to be a contribution to the overall benefit we observed due to the additional attention received in the acupuncture group resulting from the contact time with practitioners in the acupuncture arm. We did not control for this bias, which would have required a trial arm with a practitioner-led intervention in order to control for time and attention. The patients in our study were not blind to their group allocation, as would have been the case in a sham-controlled trial. A comparator trial arm with a sham control would have had the limitation that the verum acupuncture would need to be constrained to minimise variability in patient experience between the verum and sham acupuncture arms. There is a trade-off between seeking to know more about the contribution each of the components might (or might not) contribute to any putative benefit and seeking to know more about the impact of acupuncture as a package of care that more closely reflects routine practice. A third trial arm was outside of the scope of our funding support.</p><p>The study population was made up of those who have consulted with predominantly &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; IBS symptoms in primary care (average IBS SSS score of 279), have experienced these symptoms for an average of 13 years and have not experienced sufficient symptom reduction from their usual care so that they are continuing to seek care. Therefore generalising the results to patients who are consulting their GP for the first time, and who therefore have not experienced usual GP care and its impact on symptoms, must be done with caution. The trial was not powered to determine whether any of the sub-groupings of patients with IBS symptoms (for example based on severity) would have fared better or worse.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing studies</title><p>Our study had the longest duration in terms of collecting outcome data through to 12 months after randomisation. By contrast, most other studies have been conducted within hospital based settings, with more narrowly defined populations, smaller sample sizes and shorter term follow-ups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The level of acceptability of acupuncture treatments among patients was high (only three patients out of 116 did not start treatment and 88 (76%) completed their full course of treatment, with an overall average of nine sessions attended out of 10) compared to a trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for IBS in which fewer than half of patients were considered by the therapist to have completed therapy, with 41% either declining therapy or dropping out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Components of acupuncture are drawn from three categories: needling related components; non-needling components that are acupuncture-specific, such as explanations and lifestyle advice; and non-specific components that are generic to the therapeutic encounter, such as the patient-practitioner relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our trial is unique in that it was designed to include the second of these components, as well as the other two. However it was not designed to determine the extent to which each of these components of acupuncture contributed to the overall outcome. To establish a proportional contribution of a component of treatment would require a trial arm with a sham control, for example as has been done recently to explore the impact of the patient-practitioner relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In their trial, sham acupuncture needling was used to control for the needling in verum acupuncture arm, which then allowed the impact of a variation in the intensity of patient-practitioner relationship to be measured. By contrast, our focus on acupuncture as a complex intervention with many interacting components meant that a feasible and valid sham control was problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>With regard to placebo effects among patients with IBS, there is some limited evidence from other studies that these effects appear to tail off after three months, according to a study that reviewed 27 randomised controlled trials of treatments for IBS, with individual trials showing no placebo response at 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The results from our trial, in contrast, provide some evidence of a sustained effect at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for future research and clinical practice</title><p>Our trial focussed on those patients with long term symptoms at recruitment (average 13 years duration) for whom usual GP care was of limited benefit; however, exploring the potential impact of referral to acupuncture soon after an initial diagnosis of IBS would be useful. An appropriately powered study could determine whether any of the sub-groupings of patients with IBS symptoms (for example based on mild, moderate or severe categories) fared better or worse, and also characterize responders and non-responders to acupuncture. A clearer specification of optimal acupuncture treatment for this group of patients would be helpful. In particular it would be useful to determine if more than 10 acupuncture sessions would improve outcomes, as from the graph in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> the steep improvement of the acupuncture group appears to level off quite abruptly when treatment ceases. To separate out the impact of different components of treatment, a sham controlled trial design similar to that used by Kaptchuk and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] could be used to determine whether or not the provision of explanations and life-style advice might (or might not) add to any overall effect, assuming that effects of different treatment components are additive rather than synergistic.</p><p>There is a need for a number of effective options for treatment in primary care, given the frustration experienced by some patients with existing treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Our results showed that, on average, acupuncture is associated with a small to moderate reduction in symptoms in a population that has had IBS symptoms for many years. If a patient responds at three months, then this benefit is likely on average to be sustained at 12 months. The IBS Symptom Severity Score is now widely used in IBS research and has been translated into many languages. When used in assessing response to treatment, a reduction of 50 points is regarded as clinically significant and, therefore, a reduction of 70 points after 12 months in a group of primary care patients in whom symptoms have been refractory, suggests that this is a treatment option worth considering in such individuals, especially as the beneficial effects seem to be sustained. These data on acupuncture are highly relevant to the primary care context in the UK and have policy implications.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a rigorously conducted pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we have evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome when offered as an adjunct to usual treatment in primary care.
