Treatment costs up to &#x000a3;120,000 per patient per year, and the psychological burden of PAH is substantial. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an intervention with the potential to reduce this burden, but to date, it has not been applied to people with pulmonary hypertension. We wished to determine whether a trial of MBSR for people with PAH would be feasible.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A customised gentle MBSR programme of eight sessions was developed for people with physical disability due to PAH, and they were randomised to group-based MBSR or treatment as usual. The completeness of outcome measures including Beck Anxiety Index, Beck Depression Inventory and standard physical assessment at 3&#x000a0;months after randomisation were recorded. Health care utilisation was measured. Attendance at the sessions and the costs involved in delivering the intervention were assessed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the acceptability of the MBSR intervention and when appropriate the reasons for trial non-participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Fifty-two patients were recruited, but only 34 were randomised due to patients finding it difficult to travel to sessions. Twenty-two completed all questionnaires and attended all clinics, both routine and additional in order to collect outcomes measures. The MSBR sessions were delivered in Bristol, Cardiff and London, costing, on average, between &#x000a3;2234 (Cardiff) and &#x000a3;4128 (London) per patient to deliver. Attendance at each session averaged between two patients in Bristol and Cardiff and three in London. For those receiving treatment as usual, clinician blinding was achievable.

It results in progressive increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately leading to right ventricle failure and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is characterised by debilitating progressive symptoms of severe breathlessness, fatigue, cyanosis and haemoptysis and declining functional ability. Precise national prevalence data are unconfirmed, but 5538 patients are monitored in the UK (Dr. L Howard personal communication from National Audit of PAH, 2010), and the number is rising with increasing awareness.</p><p id="Par15">The causes of PAH range from those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH), with a short life expectancy of 2.8&#x000a0;years without treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], to those associated with congenital heart disease (APAH), who commonly live into their fourth decade for whom treatment remains palliative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Treatment can be invasive, painful and upsetting, and it is not clear whether new methods of treatment have increased life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Most patients are seen in clinic at least twice a year and may require hospital admission to initiate treatment. Care costs are up to &#x000a3;120,000 per person per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Supporting patients as they cope with the psychological distress associated with PAH is an important adjunct of care. Living with an unpredictable future, complex treatments and lifestyle changes means that the emotional burden of PAH is substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Pulmonary hypertension and psychological health</title><p id="Par16">The symptoms of PAH can have a devastating impact on daily life. Many people cannot work and have limited mobility and independence, and women are advised to avoid pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They may have consistently high levels of anxiety (20%), depression (26%) and panic (25%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], associated with decreased quality of life and physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], as well as an increase in concern about symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Worryingly, only 24.1% of patients reported seeking professional help for psychological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Anxiety both exacerbates and mimics symptoms of PAH making it difficult for patients to interpret their symptoms and increasing their need for support. For example, breathlessness and chest pain are features of anxiety but also of PAH. Qualitative analysis from research with PAH patients revealed that they consciously &#x02018;hold back&#x02019; in order to avoid provoking symptoms and increased anxiety due to a heightened sense of awareness as they approached each activity, for fear of not being able to catch their breath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Anxiety may also stem from the uncertainties associated with prognosis, treatment and course of the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention</title><p id="Par17">Mindfulness is defined as &#x02018;the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment.&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a group-based course that runs for a recommended eight weekly sessions and includes education about stress and its effects on the body, becoming aware of unhelpful attitudes and thinking patterns, defining mindfulness and using it in everyday life, formal meditation techniques and gentle stretching. Participants are given a resource booklet to accompany the course and asked to continue practising what they have learnt at home. Benefits include increased ability to cope, improvements in mental health, physical functioning, well-being, quality of life, decreased psychological distress, enhanced functional status and reduced physical symptoms for people with chronic pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes and chronic fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Positive results have been demonstrated for continued practice and maintained effect after 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Significant effects have been observed with eight (2.5-h) weekly sessions of MBSR on blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], vascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], lifestyle stress, blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and general cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To date, there has been no intervention for people with pulmonary hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par18">The overall aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and pilot the methods of a randomised controlled trial comparing MBSR with treatment as usual. This would examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an MBSR intervention for people with PAH aged over 16. The pilot study reported here mirrored as closely as possible the intended design and conduct of a larger trial, so that the information it provided could be used to inform the design of that trial.</p><p id="Par19">The specific objectives of the pilot study were to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par20">Assess the processes of participant identification, recruitment, randomisation and collection of outcome data, including rates of recruitment, attrition, questionnaire completion and overall follow-up.

We excluded those with significant learning disabilities and who lacked capacity to consent or who were not fluent in English. In addition, we excluded those who were unable to take part (e.g. prior commitments, excess travel) or who were involved in simultaneous research projects.</p><p id="Par26">We planned to randomise 42 participants into the pilot study in a 1:1 ratio. The group size was intended to be seven participants. We wished to have three groups in each of the randomised intervention or treatment as usual cohorts. This suggested a total of 42 participants and would allow for some dropout during the study. The research assistant approached potentially eligible participants with information about the trial following a routine clinic visit. Initial recruitment was at a single site, Bristol, which included patients from a wide catchment area, including South Wales and South West England. If they were interested in participating, full information about the trial was provided, and participants were given the opportunity to ask questions. If the participant wished to proceed, written informed consent was sought along with the completion of baseline questionnaires. To avoid lengthy travel times, intervention groups were arranged in various outlying locations. We aimed for a minimum of seven participants per intervention group, necessitating recruitment of at least 14 participants within a geographical area from which participants were happy to attend a central site to receive the intervention (if so randomised). MBSR sessions were offered in the early afternoon from 12 to 2&#x000a0;pm, throughout the year. Baseline measures were collected, and once there were sufficient patients, the intention was to randomise on a 1:1 basis to intervention or control.</p><p id="Par27">It took 18&#x000a0;months to recruit 18 participants in the Bristol centre. It became apparent that it would not be possible to undertake randomisation as intended, due to potential participants living in widely dispersed areas making attendance at weekly group sessions difficult. We then over recruited (with ethics committee approval) patients to a waiting list of potential participants living near two geographic locations (Bristol and Cardiff) who were not randomised until the group size at that site became large enough. We also expanded the recruitment to an additional site. This additional site, Hammersmith Hospital, is a National Specialist Pulmonary Hypertension Centre that manages 1200 people with pulmonary hypertension. The majority of the patients lived within a 2-hour radius, but some travelled to the centre from across the UK. Only those close to London were included from this site for ease of travelling to the MBSR sessions. Due to low numbers, the randomisation ratio was also increased to ensure a viable number of patients could be recruited to form MBSR groups of sufficient size (up to a maximum of 3:1). Additionally, we randomised (with ethics committee approval) a smaller group of seven participants with the additional members of the MBSR group made up from patients from the same clinic but with different diagnoses.</p><p id="Par28">Participants were informed of their allocation by letter along with details of venue and timings for the MBSR group sessions. After baseline (T1), follow-up was planned for 10&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks (T2), 6&#x000a0;months (T3) and 15&#x000a0;months (T4) after randomisation. All patients were followed up to 6&#x000a0;months. However, as recruitment took much longer than originally planned, only patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) from the Bristol centre were followed for the additional time point of 15&#x000a0;months post-randomisation. For this reason, in our analysis, we focussed on 6-month outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Acceptability of the intervention</title><p id="Par29">Adaptations to the MBSR programme were based on advice and material given by Michael Speca (personal communications 20 October 2010 to 22 February 2011) and the experiences of patients. Prior to the pilot study, we invited four patients to undergo baseline assessment, attend the 8-week intervention and have an assessment at follow-up. Based on this, we further tailored the MBSR programme to patients with PAH.</p><p id="Par30">An experienced clinical psychologist and assistant psychologist delivered the course in a group setting in eight 2-hour weekly sessions. The intended group size was seven participants. The first session explained about MBSR and its role in promoting health. The other sessions were learning and practising stretching exercises and breathing exercises designed to reduce stress. Each group received their intervention at a location near to their home. Treatment as usual consisted of attendance at clinics and telephone support by the pulmonary hypertension nurses or doctors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Test data collection and patient-centred outcomes</title><p id="Par31">Outcomes included physiological measures and self-report questionnaire assessment at baseline, 10&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks and 6- and 15-month post-randomisation. These timings were chosen to provide long-term outcome data but also to coincide with usual outpatient clinics to avoid additional burden for participants. We conducted semi-structured interviews after the 15-month time-point with participants from both arms of the trial to determine the acceptability of participation and elicit perceptions of the MBSR the intervention from participants in this group.</p><p id="Par32">We did not specify a primary outcome for the pilot trial; outcomes measured included the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par33">Symptoms of anxiety and depression&#x02014;measured respectively by the Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) and Beck Depression Index (BDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Measures of physical functioning&#x02014;as assessed by echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and 6-min walk test</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Measure of health and social care resource use.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">Health-related quality of life&#x02014;measured by the components of the SF36 questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par37">The study was not powered to identify clinically important differences between MBSR and treatment as usual but aimed to determine response rates and whether a future trial would be possible.</p><p id="Par38">Self-report questionnaires included a demographic sheet recording patients&#x02019; age, gender, ethnic origin and work status; BAI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; BDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; SF-36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and a patient-completed resource use questionnaire (RUQ): asking patients about their use of secondary, primary and community health care. The SF36 measures health-related quality of life on eight dimensions and two summary scores: physical and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. All SF36 measures used norm-based scoring with population means of 50. A subset of SF-36 questions can also be used to estimate a single preference-based utility score anchored at 1 (best health) and 0 (health state as bad as death) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is appreciated that the PCS and MCS components are validated against an American population and would need to be validated for this sick population before being suitable for interpretation if a full trial was to follow.</p><p id="Par39">Physiological measures were collected as part of the routine clinical appointment by nursing and medical and technical staff as usual. Such physiological outcomes (e.g. echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, functional class, 6-min walk test) were collected but are not reported in this paper, which discusses the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Session record forms</title><p id="Par40">Therapists delivering MBSR completed session record forms that included staff grade and time to prepare, travel to and deliver the sessions, assistant&#x02019;s time if required, equipment and materials used during the session, duration of the session, number of patients expected to attend and actually attending the session and room hire costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blinding and measures taken to avoid bias</title><p id="Par41">The PAH specialist clinical team was blinded to the treatment arm, and the statistical analysis was intended to be conducted without knowledge of patient allocation (except for health resource utilisation).

Many of the patients found the therapy helpful, but it is not yet possible to determine its benefit. There are significant barriers to implementing face-to-face group therapies in rare diseases with geographically dispersed patients. Research on these interventions is difficult as numbers are constrained. For those who were clinically stable and had little limitation, demands of professional employment often prevented travel to intervention during working hours. For those who were unwell, it was too much of an imposition to travel to the sessions, especially in the winter months.</p><p id="Par79">The work of Bauer-Wu has attempted to address this concern that sick patients may be too unwell to travel to group mindfulness sessions. Bauer-Wu undertook one-on-one sessions for 17&#x000a0;min on a daily basis with those undergoing stem cell transplantation. 78.9% completed the interventions, considerably more than in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Others have tried undertaking the MBSR programmes over six telephone conversations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or even undertaking the whole programme in a single session, based on the acceptance and commitment model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These models show that there may be other methods of delivering mindfulness, although the validation of their effectiveness is still rather lacking in the longer term, perhaps requiring increased re-enforcement. In light of the chronic ill health of our patients with PAH and the fact that it is a relatively rare disease, such alternatives might offer better means of delivering the intervention.</p><p id="Par80">Due to the wish to recruit sufficient people for the expected size of intervention groups, we tested out the approach of topping up the group numbers with patients with similar clinical diagnoses. This was found to be a useful and feasible way of randomising at a site with low patient numbers. We would recommend this method to others attempting recruitment to group interventions. It is not clear whether the MBSR programme which is tailored for people with PAH would be less appropriate for those with similar diagnoses or whether the inclusion of people without PAH might reduce the efficacy of the tailored intervention for those with the disease.</p><p id="Par81">MBSR however does appeal to a significant proportion of this patient population. The semi-structured interviews revealed that those who attended were pleasantly surprised by the effect of MBSR and continued to practise many months later. It is possible that a more successful intervention would use the same techniques remotely, via e-health devices such as a smartphone app or a web or video-based programme or combination of these. Some studies using Internet-based MBSR programmes have already been introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This would allow the benefit for the patients without the need for travel to group meetings. Those who found the timing of the meetings restrictive due to work or other commitments would be able to take part when suitable. Achieving better MBSR attendance is very important in order to maximise the potential benefit of MBSR and make it more likely to be cost-effective for the NHS. Larger groups (e.g up to 12 patients) might be preferable but will be difficult to achieve for a rare disease like PAH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par82">It is clear that the methodology of this pilot trial will not translate more generally to other rare diseases in its current form. However, we have devised a suitable MBSR programme, which may be of benefit in PAH, a debilitating and uncommon disease. This study highlights the potential benefits of MBSR for patients with rare diseases whilst drawing attention to the significant challenges posed in delivering robust evaluations of group-based MBSR in these populations. It is possible that future research could use the same methodology but would need to be delivered in a way to accommodate at home use as travel was the main factor which prevented participation. This might be by an &#x0201c;e&#x0201d; programme delivered online or by some other telephone or single visit method&#x02014;as others have tried.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>APAH</term><def><p id="Par5">Associated pulmonary arterial hypertension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BAI</term><def><p id="Par6">Beck Anxiety Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDI</term><def><p id="Par7">Beck Depression Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBSR</term><def><p id="Par8">Mindfulness-based stress reduction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NYHA</term><def><p id="Par9">New York Heart Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAH</term><def><p id="Par10">Pulmonary arterial hypertension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par11">Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RUQ</term><def><p id="Par12">Resource use questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF36</term><def><p id="Par13">Health-related quality of life index</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par83">This report is independent research commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research Research for Patient Benefit (Grant PB-PG-0711-25145 &#x000a3;243,000) and the David Telling Charitable Trust (&#x000a3;10,000).
