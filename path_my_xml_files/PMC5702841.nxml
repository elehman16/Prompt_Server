proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation in stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty patients who were diagnosed with hemiparalysis due to stroke were selected as
subjects of study. Experiment group 1 patients had Kinesio taping applied before applying
the PNF, while experiment group 2 patients had McConell taping applied before applying the
PNF. The control group had only the PNF applied. The dartfish program was used to evaluate
the stance phase of stroke patients. [Results] Experiment group 1 and experiment group 2
showed a significantly longer stance phase duration of the affected side than the control
group in week 6. [Conclusion] Application of Kinesio taping has a more positive effect on
the stance phase duration than McConell taping in the patients with stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Stance phase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Due to the recent increase in average age and decline in birth rate, an aged society is
becoming acceleratedly realized. This worldwide increase in the proportion of elderly people
coincides with the development of modern medicine and improvements in the standard of
living<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke, the most common
cerebrovascular disease, is a type of acute cerebrovascular disease that causes circulatory
disturbance in the cerebral vessels, inducing sudden consciousness disorder and body
paralysis. About 75% of stroke patients develop chronic disorders, such as motor impairment,
reduced sensory function, cognitive dysfunction, and speech defects, and often show
emotional disturbance, including depression or anger<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscular weakness, a factor limiting the functional rehabilitation of stroke patients,
results in a reduction in walking speed and endurance, requires assistance with walking, and
impedes independent postural changes<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recovering muscular strength to perform functional movements is a goal of therapy. Muscular
weakness after a stroke usually has two causes: (1) a decrease in the number of motor units
that can be mobilized because of a reduction in descending information and (2) an absence of
muscular activity and exercise due to a lack of, or reduction in, descending motor commands
and adaptive changes in muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Damage
to the nerves that send motor commands to the muscles induces a reduction in muscular
strength and even paralysis; damage to descending neurotabes by stroke decreases the number
and the firing rate of activated motor units and injures the coordination of the units<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscular weakness, abnormal muscle tone, abnormal movement patterns, abnormal body balance,
defects in weight movement, and loss of motor factors specialized in performing delicate
functions&#x02014;these symptoms induce various problems in the motor control of stroke patients,
including disturbance in standing balance and walking. These disturbances explain why stroke
patients show slowed cycle and speed in walking<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The walking of stroke patients is usually slow, requires excessive
effort, and is urgently performed with poor coordination. Moreover, their movements show
synergy of mass flexion and extension in which the trunk and the limbs are not selectively
controlled<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When compared to healthy people, stroke patients display changes in temporal and spatial
characteristics of walking; previous study reported that stroke patients showed a reduction
in step length, walking speed, and the number of strides in the paralyzed and non-paralyzed
limbs. Such reduction is caused by difficulty in normal walking due to loss of leg muscular
strength, disequilibrium, rigidity, and stiffness induced by neurological damage after a
stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, for the functional
recovery of stroke patients, training is necessary to enhance muscular strength and
coordination in the lower limbs and to improve weakened postures, balancing, and
walking.</p><p>Most stroke patients show an increase of body sway because of an accompanying decrease in
the proprioceptive senses in the affected lower limbs and a reduction in efficiency of
movements since location information pertaining to the body in space is not provided<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients experience basic
difficulties in using their limbs due to loss of the proprioceptive senses with paralysis,
resulting in severe restrictions in daily life activities. Among the several treatment
methods provided to patients with these problems, taping therapy has recently been popular.
Recovery of the proprioceptive senses is important in the treatment of stroke patients; the
ability to change muscle contraction induced by immediate responses to external force is
known to be important in reducing functional instability and re-injury of the damaged
joints<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As part of the physiotherapy for these patients, exercise therapy, based on retraining the
nerve root, is usually provided to hemiparalysis patients for several weeks after stroke.
Additionally, functional task performance before movement activity such as walking, weight
shift in a sitting or a standing position, standing without aid, etc., are also
implemented<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Non-elastic taping is mainly used as a means of enhancing dynamic stability by supporting
and protecting the subject so they can regain proper use of their bodies. Kinesio taping is
used to reduce the pressure on the joint that is created during the walking and
muscle-strength reinforcing exercises, and to stimulate muscle activity and sense<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study not only examines the overlap effect of the PNF following the non-elastic taping
and the elastic taping, but also examines the impact of the taping application method on the
stance phase duration of the patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Among the patients that 30 patients who were diagnosed with hemiparalysis were selected as
subjects of this study and they were divided into three groups. The subjects were randomly
and divided into experiment group 1 (n=10), experiment group 2 (n=10), and the control group
(n=10). After sufficient explanation of the purpose and procedures of the study the
participants were provided a written informed consent form in accordance with the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by Daegu University Ethics
Committee (1040621-201611-HR-017-02).</p><p>Experiment group 1 (n=10) patients had Kinesio taping applied before applying the
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique, while experiment group 2 (n=10)
patients had McConell taping applied before applying the proprioceptive neuromuscular
facilitation technique. The control group (n=10) had only the proprioceptive neuromuscular
facilitation technique applied.</p><p>In experiment group 1, Kinesio taping was applied on the rectus femoris muscle and the
tensor fasciae latae of the hemiparalysis patients&#x02019; affected side<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In experiment group 2, taping was applied while the
subjects slightly bent the knee joint. A 3.8&#x02005;cm McConell taping was used. The taping
application followed the method where the transverse tape of the upper part was applied from
the lateral kneecap and was pulled from the outside to the inside to cover the rear medial
semitendinous muscle. Each pattern of the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation
technique was applied for 5 minutes and a 3 minute resting time was provided between the
different patterns. In this study, gait assessment was evaluated before the intervention, 3
weeks after, and 6 weeks after. The therapy was performed for 30 minutes, three times a
week, for a total of 6 weeks.</p><p>Stance phase during walking were measured using Dartfish program (Pro Suite, Dfkorea,
Korea). Video recordings of affected limb locomotion were collected in the sagittal plane
using a video camera at the rate of 60&#x02005;Hz at 1&#x02005;m distance. Only data from complete walks
were included, and the average values of five sets of measurements were used.</p><p>One-way ANOVA was conducted for comparison analysis between the groups in each period
regarding the normality, the balance, and the walking ability. LSD was used for the post-hoc
test. For the statistical process, the PASW Win. 20 package was used, with a significance
level at &#x003b1;&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The stance phase showed significant between-group differences in week 6 (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the

the prevention and rehabilitation of sports injuries and the improvement of exercise
ability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This therapy has recently
become popular in people&#x02019;s daily lives as not only therapists, but also the public can
purchase and use various therapeutic tapes, and many related books have been published.
Various studies have identified that taping therapy is effective in providing structural
support to attached sites, improving skin receptors and proprioceptors, increasing blood and
lymphatic circulation, supporting chronically weakened muscles, and enhancing motor
ability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Tapes for taping therapy can be roughly divided into two types: elastic and non-elastic.
Elastic tapes, called Kinesio Tapes, are attached to the target muscles to normalize actions
of the agonistic muscles of the joints. Therapies using these tapes are known to be helpful
in treating various diseases including stroke and relieving pain by maintaining postural
stability, improving the proprioceptive senses, and promoting circulation of blood, lymph,
and tissue fluid<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The cutaneous fusimotor reflex is used as a mechanism of the Kinesio Tapes: this reflex
refers to contraction of the muscles under the skin by the gamma motor neurons when
stimulation, such as skin contact, vibration, or temperature difference, is applied.
Reflex-induced muscle contraction is smooth and continuous; voluntary contraction contracts
the muscles through the alpha motor reflex, producing stronger power; however, after a
period of time, the muscles relax as excitability of the motor nerves in the spinal cord is
reduced. Gamma motor neurons control the muscle spindles, which have two types of sensory
nerve endplates. One type, located in the middle of the muscle spindles, senses and responds
to dynamic changes in muscular length, while the other type, located at the end of the
muscle spindles, continuously transmits information of static muscular length to the central
nervous system<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Non-elastic tapes are used to compress the body parts, fix the joints, and restrict movable
range. For instance, these tapes can be used directly to prevent excessive inversion of the
ankle. While non-elastic tapes can offer sufficient assistance and support, they are not
convenient for use in several respects. For example, when applied, these tapes easily
acquire wrinkles due to unevenness of body contour. Effective application of non-elastic
tapes requires considerable practice. According to existing studies related to non-elastic
tapes, these types of tapes can enhance mechanical stability by assisting and supporting
functional movements of the body, which is effective in the rehabilitation and prevention of
injuries for athletes. It has been reported that non-elastic taping reduces ankle movements,
resulting in a decrease in the incidence of ankle sprain and the prevention of injuries<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, significant between-group differences in the stance phase duration of the
affected side according to the treatment method was observed after 6 weeks. A significant
difference was observed between experiment group 1 and the control group and between
experiment group 2 and the control group after 6 weeks from the initial treatment. A
significant increase of stance phase duration of the affected side was observed in
experiment group 1 and experiment group 2, compared to the control group. These results can
be attributed to the fact that the taping application contributed to the optimal joint
alignment of the affected side during weight bearing and the controlling of the muscle
strength and the action of the muscular system, which decreased joint instability and
corrected musculoskeletal asymmetry through mutual deterrence.</p><p>There are a few limitations of this study. There was a problem of allergy when applying
taping to the patients with hemiparalysis after stroke who had sensitive skin. Also, during
the research period, patients often complained about fatigue, and the placebo effects of the
patients were not considered in this study. We believe that more diverse research will be
required in the future, by correcting and supplementing the limitations of this study, to
evaluate the effects of applying the taping method to patients with stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Daegu University Research Grant in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ostermann</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Lauche</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Comparative cost analysis of inpatient integrative
