It provided optimal analgesia, less rescue analgesia, less intra- and post-procedural sedation, early ambulation, and early discharge from postanesthesia care unit (PACU) without significant side effects.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided unilateral TAP block compared to bilateral TAP blocks as an analgesic technique during ureteric SWL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval of the Medical Ethics Committee, sixty patients American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status Class I, II, and III were enrolled in this prospective randomized, single-blinded clinical trial. Patients were between 18 and 60 years of age, of both genders, with single radio-opaque unilateral ureteric stone scheduled for elective unilateral ureteric SWL.</p><p>This study was conducted at the Department of Urology, Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital, Jeddah, KSA. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before participating in the study. Exclusion criteria were: Patient's refusal, coagulopathy, psychological abnormalities, severe cardio-respiratory, renal or liver diseases, chronic alcohol/drug abusers and those allergic to any of the medications to be used in the study.</p><p>On patient's arrival at the SWL unit, preoperative check-up was done, and the procedure was explained. Each patient was instructed on the use of a standard 100 mm linear visual analog scale (VAS) with &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; as no pain and &#x0201c;100&#x0201d; as the worst imaginable pain. Patients were advised not to move during the procedure and to ask for analgesia for discomfort or intolerable pain.</p><p>Baseline measurements of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR) and room air oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were obtained using an electrocardiogram, a &#x0201c;Dinamap&#x0201d; automated blood pressure monitor and a pulse oximeter, respectively. Those parameters were recorded for all patients after performing the TAP block and then every 10 min during the procedure and at the PACU time.</p><p>Venous access was secured by 20G intravenous (IV) cannula. Paracetamol 1 g (Perfalgan&#x02122;, Bristol-Myer's-Squibb) was infused to alleviate visceral pain. Ringer's lactate drip (10 ml/kg/h) was started, oxygen face mask (6 L/min) was applied, and IV midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) was given as a premedication.</p><p>Patients were randomized, following a sealed envelope method, to receive either ultrasound-guided unilateral TAP block (Group U; <italic>n</italic> = 30) or ultrasound-guided bilateral TAP blocks (Group B; <italic>n</italic> = 30). Intra- and post-operative data were recorded by a physician blinded to the study groups.</p><p>In Group (U), the unilateral TAP block was performed in a supine position, at the same side of the stone, 10 min before the procedure. Using a portable ultrasound device (SonoSite&#x02122;, Bothell, WA, USA), a linear 6&#x02013;13 MHz ultrasound transducer, covered with a sterile plastic sheath, was placed midway between the 12<sup>th</sup> rib and the iliac crest at the level of the anterior axillary line, after skin preparation with an antiseptic solution. The initial image was optimized by sliding the probe antero-posteriorly, and/or tilting in a cephalad &#x02013; caudad direction until the plane between the IO and TA muscles was clearly distinguished on screen. Using an in-plane approach, skin entry was 1&#x02013;2 cm away from the transducer. After local infiltration of the skin with 1 ml lidocaine 2%, an 80 mm 20G needle (B-Braun Stimuplex, Melsungen, Germany) was advanced into the TAP. Once the needle tip was visualized to be in the plane between the IO and TA muscles, and after negative pressure aspiration, 25 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% (62.5 mg) was injected in 5 ml increments. In Group (B), the same approach was done bilaterally, injecting 25 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% (62.5 mg) on each side.</p><p>Before starting with SWL, decreased sensation in the appropriate dermatomal levels was confirmed by pinprick. SWL was performed by SWL machine (Lithoskop&#x02122;; combined X-ray/shock wave C-arm system, Siemens, Germany). The shock wave emitter was applied on the patient's anterior abdominal wall at the same side of the stone. Hemodynamic (HR and MAP) and respiratory (RR and SpO<sub>2</sub>) variables and VASs were recorded at 10 min-intervals, both intra-operatively as well as in the PACU. Patients who developed intra- or post-operative pain (VAS &#x0003e;30) received fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg IV, which was repeated on demand. The total amount of rescue fentanyl was noted.</p><p>At the end of the procedure, patients were transferred to the PACU for observation until fulfilling our local discharge criteria (i.e., fully conscious, hemodynamically stable, having no nausea or vomiting, and pain-free). Variables related to the urologic procedure (e.g., side, site, and size of the stone, its fragmentation degree, the total number of shockwaves, their maximum power, and the total duration of the procedure) as well as the length of PACU stay were all recorded and considered for statistical analysis. All patients were closely observed for nausea and/or vomiting, signs and symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity and side effects of fentanyl, for example, bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;50 beats/min), hypotension (MAP &#x0003c;20% of baseline), bradypnea (RR &#x0003c;10 breaths/min), hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;93%), and pruritus.</p><p>Before discharge to the ward, patient's satisfaction was assessed using the 7-point Likert scale[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] as follows: 1 = extremely dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = somewhat dissatisfied, 4 = undecided, 5 = somewhat satisfied, 6 = satisfied, 7 = extremely satisfied.</p><p>Sample size was calculated according to a confidence interval of 95% and power of the test of 80%; considering the primary outcome of this study as the VAS for pain evaluation. Based on a previous investigation, 25 patients per group was the minimum sample size required to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the VASs. In our study, we included sixty patients, thirty in each group.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS program version 19 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and EP16 program. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square test, Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test, and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis as appropriate. Data are presented as a mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, median, numbers, and frequencies as appropriate.

We found that both techniques offered a very good analgesia during and after the procedure, cardiopulmonary stability, no significant side effects, and high patient satisfaction.</p><p>TAP blocks have been used as a part of multimodal analgesia in many clinical trials for patients undergoing abdominal operations,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] radical prostatectomy,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] inguinal herniorrhaphy, and laparoscopic surgeries.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided TAP block results from blockage of the nerve supply to the anterior abdominal wall which arises from the lower six thoracic, first lumber, iliohypogastric, and ilioinguinal nerves. These nerves pass in the fascial plane between the IO and TA muscles where they are blocked.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Using computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to study the spread of &#x0201c;iopamidol&#x0201d; contrast (injected within the TAP into three volunteers), the contrast spread from the superior margin of the iliac crest up to the costal margin and extended posteriorly until the quadratus lumborum muscle.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In a cadaveric study, 20 ml of aniline blue dye was injected into the TAP at the mid-axillary line; the dye spread between the iliac crest, the costal margin and the lateral border of the rectus abdominis sheath.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In a previous study, we proved that ultrasound-guided unilateral TAP block using 25 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% (62.5 mg) was an effective analgesic alternative to IV fentanyl (1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) during ureteric SWL, as it offered a satisfying analgesia during and after the procedure, significantly less requirements for rescue pethidine, lower sedation scores, and shorter PACU stay without significant side effects.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In our previous study, we noticed that although part of the shockwave emitter crossed the midline of the abdominal wall in some cases, the quality of analgesia was not affected.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This can be explained by the fact that shockwaves emerging from the center of the emitter would still be on the same side of the stone, even if the emitter partly crossed the midline. This explanation, indeed, supports the results obtained in this study: No significant differences between unilateral versus bilateral TAP blocks during ureteric SWL regarding intra- and post-procedural pain scores, total doses of rescue fentanyl during and after the procedure, duration of PACU stay and overall patient satisfaction scores.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that it was extended only till the end of PACU time. In addition, there was no control group for proper comparison. However, I considered the unilateral TAP block group to be the control since it was proven in a previous study that it is a safe and effective analgesic technique during ureteric SWL.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ultrasound-guided unilateral TAP block is as safe and effective analgesic technique as bilateral blocks during unilateral ureteric SWL. It can be used as the sole analgesic technique during ureteric SWL, for its beneficial analgesia during and after the procedure, cardiopulmonary stability, insignificant side effects and high patient satisfaction scores.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of
