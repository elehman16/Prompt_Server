It has also shown promising results in periodontal and implant surgeries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The employment of PRP positively modified the bone formation around dental implants.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The use of PRP in combination with bone grafts yielded positive results in terms of improving the handling properties of the grafts and enhancing the quantity and quality of the newly formed bone.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In patients with an alveolar cleft, repairing the cleft with autologous bone graft in combination with the use of PRP enhanced the bone healing and led to earlier resuming of orthodontic treatment.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In cases of complete cleft palate repair, the use of PRP significantly improved the velopharyngeal closure and nasality.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The injection of PRP after a mandibular odontogenic cystectomy has led to faster healing and yielded promising results as a minimally invasive method to support the wound healing process in oral soft tissue defects.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It has been found that the periodontal health distal to the second molar following third molar removal could be enhanced using platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), which was significantly better compared to PRP in this regard.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Free gingival graft (FGG) is one of the most common periodontal plastic surgeries to increase or establish the attached gingiva around teeth and implants. Inadequate keratinized gingiva (&#x02264;2 mm) around implants can compromise the treatment outcomes in the long-term.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The grafts harvested from palatal tissue are preferred to synthetic or allogenic grafts due to their adequate thickness and autologous nature.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Despite its safety and efficacy, FGG from palatal tissue leaves an open wound in the donor site and causes a postoperative pain and morbidity. A case series study has shown that PRF was an effective wound dressing which enhanced the healing of the palatal donor site and reduced the postoperative morbidity.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Despite the excellent observations in the mentioned study, the authors suggested conducting well-designed and controlled studies to further support the findings. They had evaluated the results in terms of wound healing and postoperative morbidity. The evaluation of tissue thickness was suggested for future studies to assess if the blood concentrates provide additional bulk to the donor site.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Regarding the limitations of the previous investigations, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect PRP has on the extent of wound closure, color, contour, and distortion of the wound, soft tissue healing, tissue thickness at the donor site, and the perceived pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The sample for this clinical trial comprised of 10 subjects (20 surgical sites) who were selected from the patients in the Department of Periodontology at Babol University of Medical Sciences. Patients who were in the age range of 20&#x02013;45 years and were candidates for a bilateral FGG to manage their gingival recession were included in the study. The subjects with compromised systemic health condition and those suffering from diseases or lifestyle factors influencing the healing process such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, immune system disorders, positive history of alcoholism, addiction, current smoking as well as the uncooperative patients and the subjects with abnormal bleeding time or abnormal findings in the complete blood count were excluded from the clinical trial. Similar oral hygiene instructions were delivered to all subjects. They were asked to brush twice daily, clean between the teeth with floss once a day, and to refrain from any other oral hygiene adjunct. The patients were adequately informed about the study design and represented their willingness to participate in the research by signing the informed consent form.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized split-mouth controlled design was used in this study. With this study design, each of the two treatments&#x02014;natural healing at one donor site (control group) and healing enhanced with PRP at the other donor site (experimental group)&#x02014;was randomly assigned either to the right or left sides of the mouth of each subject.

The FGG was dissected using a mucotome (A. DOPPLER made in SWISS) to have the same size grafts (thickness 1.5 mm, width 9 mm, length 15 mm) in all subjects [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Periodontal mucotome to harvest the graft from the palate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-11-447-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Graft harvesting using mucotome</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-11-447-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Free gingival graft harvested from the palate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-11-447-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Platelet-rich plasma preparation</title><p>A few minutes before the surgery, 10 ml of blood was drawn from each subject and was then transferred to sterile test tubes containing 3.8% anticoagulant sodium citrate. Centrifugation, using a digital machine (PRGF bti system IV, Spain) at 4000 rpm for 8 min, was done to separate and concentrate the platelets. Following the centrifugation, the plasma was divided into distinct fragments including PRP, platelet average plasma, and platelet poor plasma. To prepare PRP for use in the procedure, it was carefully pipetted out in a test tube (500 &#x003bc;l per each tube) and subsequently, injected to the submucosa of donor site and also, placed over the defect with a collagen sponge at the experimental side (which was randomly assigned) in each subject.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Postoperative care</title><p>Analgesics (Acetaminophen 325 mg four times daily for 5 days) and antibiotics (Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for a week) were prescribed.

The stitches were removed after 10 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Data collection</title><p>The patients were examined on days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 after surgery and photographs were uniformly taken from the wounds in all subjects using a Canon EOS 450D digital camera held at a 30-cm-distance from the surgical sites while the subjects were seated in the dental chair. The tissue thickness at the donor site was recorded before and 2 months after the surgery. Certain parameters were blindly recorded by three observers who were unaware of the study protocol.

The wound distortion was considered to be no distortion (score 0), slight distortion (score 1), and obvious distortion (score 2).

One of the major problems of the FGG procedure is that it causes a large defect in the donor site, which needs excessive time for healing. Recently, attempts have been made to enhance the healing process in the grafts' donor sites, and the growth factors have been the focus of many debates in this regard. PRP is a blood product which contains an enormous amount of growth factors. It can positively affect cell proliferation, chemotaxis, differentiation, and the matrix synthesis and plays a role in the initial events of healing and tissue regeneration.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Regarding the aforementioned facts about PRP, so far, however, there have been few papers on the topic of the effect of PRP effect on periodontal wound healing. Based on the findings of this study, PRP significantly reduces the time needed for wound closure and accelerates the healing process. On an average, more than 90% of wound closure in the experimental group was achieved in 1 week compared to the 2-week period needed for the same amount of wound closure in the control group. Kulkarni <italic>et al</italic>. had also reported that on the 7<sup>th</sup> day after the surgery, the donor site in the PRF group showed normal appearance and no sign of inflammation, whereas in the non-PRF group, the wound had a raw appearance and a layer of slough could be seen on the surface. On day 14 following the surgery, complete wound closure in the PRF group was observed, whereas the non-PRF group showed and some inflammation and incomplete closure.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This finding is also in line with the observation by Rozman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] who pointed out that PRP caused more rapid healing and lesser complications.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The positive effect of PRP on the healing process, especially in the 1<sup>st</sup> week, is further supported by the research done by Hung-Wen Lee, who also showed that epithelialization, wound closure, and the fibroblastic count were higher in the PRP group.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, the findings by Keceli, who used a combination of PRP and connective tissue graft for root coverage, revealed no significant difference between the experimental and control groups, which can be attributed to the different incisions used in their study groups (using full thickness flaps in the PRP group and partial thickness flaps in the control group).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In contrast to the first two papers cited above (Rozman's study and Keceli's), there are studies which do not support the positive effect that PRP has on wound healing. In the study done by Lawlor <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to evaluate the effect of PRP on inguinal wound healing in vascular surgery patients, it was shown that the incidence of groin wound complications was not decreased. The explanation for this difference from our findings can be attributed to the differences in methodological aspects or the various indices used to evaluate the healing rate.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Powell <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who assessed periodontal wound healing with and without PRP, found no significant contribution of PRP to greater flap strength at any postsurgical time point or any histologic differences in wound healing in the Yucatan minipig model. This contradictory result was attributed to the time points chosen for evaluation as well as the inappropriate environment for healing in that animal model.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Camargo <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of incorporating PRP into a bovine porous bone mineral and guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in the treatment of intrabony defects. They found that PRP was not a significantly effective adjunct in the healing of intrabony defects. This observation can be explained on the basis of the small sample size used in that study and the interference of PRP incorporation into the GTR protocol.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the healing process was assessed according to the Modified Manchester Scar Pro forma scale and the Landry index. Based on the scores rated with regard to the Manchester scale, it can be seen that the healing score was significantly better in the PRP groups at all-time points, especially in the 1<sup>st</sup> week. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> week (day 14), both groups showed a good healing score, and the difference between the two groups was more obvious on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> week.</p><p>According to Landry index, better healing score was seen for the PRP groups at days 2, 4, and 7. This observation is corroborated by a previous study which used the same index for evaluating the rate of healing.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>There are several reports which support the positive role of PRP in the healing of the extraction socket.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] For example, Alissa <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of PRP on the healing of extraction socket in terms of pain level, analgesic consumption, oral function (such as the ability to eat food, and swallowing), patient satisfaction, soft and hard tissue healing, and other factors. They used the Landry scale for the assessment of the healing rate and demonstrated that PRP caused an improved healing of the soft tissue of the extraction sockets.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Lindeboom <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] have shown that PRP has a strong stimulatory effect on wound healing and capillary regeneration, especially during the first 7 days after the surgery.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] These findings are proved by the investigations of Pierce [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Pierce and Mustoe.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Monica Caceres also reported that PRP causes several cell responses that have a potential role in wound healing. This article shows that PRP accelerates the healing.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] It is enriched with growth factors such as PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and the epidermal growth factor, and it has been claimed that healing time is twice or thrice as fast using this method.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Furthermore, it has been shown that PRP contains hepatocyte growth factor which has a strong anti-fibrinolytic effect, prevents the scar formation, and accelerates the epidermal regeneration.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The results of the present study show similar findings along the line of these investigations.</p><p>One of the side effects of the conventional FGGs is the large wound in the donor site which needs a long time to heal and causes a long-lasting pain and discomfort. The patients' satisfaction and convenience are important issues which are influenced by several things including personal and social factors. To assess the effect of PRP on reducing pain and discomfort, we evaluated the perceived pain in this study. Using the VAS which was recorded from the 1<sup>st</sup> day after surgery, it was found that the patients expressed less pain in the PRP-treated sites and it was significantly lower compared to the control sites. After 7 days, the patients felt no pain in the PRP-treated sites while this took 14 days to occur in the control sites. Alissa <italic>et al</italic>. assessed the effect of PRP on the extraction socket in terms of healing time and perceived pain. Their findings too showed more pain in the control sites during the first few days following the surgery.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This is also in accordance with the observations by Kulkarni <italic>et al</italic>. who found relative comfort reported by the subjects in the PRF group during the 1<sup>st</sup> week after surgery.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Regarding the definition of healing, it can be claimed that the more a wound heals, the less pain is expected.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In this study, the result of stimulated pain on days 10 and 14 showed significantly less stimulated pain in the experimental sites. Hence, it can be argued that PRP improves the patient's convenience and comfort and reduces the side effects. Monteleone <italic>et al</italic>. assessed the potential of PRP to accelerate soft tissue wound healing and epithelialization of a split-thickness graft donor site of skin. They concluded that PRP accelerated the wound healing in the early stages, which led to earlier epithelialization [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and less pain perception in the donor site. These findings are also in accordance with our observations. It seems that the healing process in skin and oral mucosa have many aspects in common.</p><p>Several studies claimed that PRP could increase the thickness of the repaired tissue.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The results of the current study revealed an insignificant difference between the study groups in this regard. Huang <italic>et al</italic>. surveyed the effect of PRP on the coronally advanced flap root coverage procedure. They observed that PRP provided no clinically measurable effect on the gingival thickness, which correlated to the small sample size used in their pilot study.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>The anesthetizing injection have some influence on the actual tissue thickness and this limited us in assessing the tissue thickness in the present study. Although attempts were made to inject at a site as far as possible from the site of graft harvesting, it is possible that the limited access to harvested tissue led to insignificant differences between the two study groups regarding the changes in tissue thickness.</p><p>Taken together, the results of this study suggest that PRP accelerates the healing process in the surgical site and causes patients to be more satisfied. In general, it can be claimed that the earlier researches on the topic unanimously have concluded that PRP plays a positive role in the various stages of treatment. However, with passing time and more studies in this field, literature has emerged that offers contradictory findings about the role of PRP as an adjunct in the healing process.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] A possible explanation for the disappointing function of PRP when used in addition to the synthetic bone materials can be traced to the acceleration of remodeling and consequently, the resorption of synthetic bone materials which should remain longer to serve as a scaffold containing osteoconductive agents to induce bone formation. However, this explanation needs further research to become scientifically accepted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The evidence from this study suggests that PRP is capable of accelerating the healing process of gingival tissue wounds and it can be extrapolated to the soft tissue defects in the whole body. However, further research is needed to settle the issue conclusively.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"
