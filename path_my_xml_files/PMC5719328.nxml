Children who do not develop the necessary language and literacy skills in the early years of school then go on to face long-term difficulties. Improving teacher effectiveness may be a critical step in lifting oral language and literacy outcomes. The Classroom Promotion of Oral Language trial aims to determine whether a specifically designed teacher professional learning programme focusing on promoting oral language can lead to improved teacher knowledge and practice, and advance outcomes in oral language and literacy for early years school children, compared with usual practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a two-arm cluster multisite randomised controlled trial conducted within Catholic and Government primary schools across Victoria, Australia. The intervention comprises 4&#x02009;days of face-to-face professional learning for teachers and ongoing implementation support via a specific worker. The primary outcome is reading ability of the students at grade 3, and the secondary outcomes are teacher knowledge and practice, student mental health, reading comprehension and language ability at grade 1; and literacy, writing and numeracy at grade 3. Economic evaluation will compare the incremental costs of the intervention to the measured primary and secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee #CF13/2634-2013001403 and later transferred to the University of Melbourne #1545540. The investigators (including Government and Catholic partners) will communicate trial results to stakeholders, collaborators and participating schools and teachers via appropriate presentations and publications.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

While learning to <italic>speak</italic> is a task for which humans are generally considered to be biologically well-prepared,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> reading and writing skills are not, requiring prolonged and specific instruction in order for proficiency to be achieved.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Children who do not master the basics of literacy in the early years of school face long-term academic struggles, are often ambivalent towards school and may face a range of behavioural, social, vocational and social-emotional difficulties into adolescence and adulthood.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 7</xref>
</p><p>There is a clear interdependence between the transition to literacy in the early school years and oral language competence. Snowling and Hulme<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> observed that &#x02018;literacy is parasitic on language&#x02019; (p. 597), meaning that children&#x02019;s ability to learn in the classroom and develop literacy skills is reliant on their ability to understand and use oral language effectively. Conversely, the literature examining causes of reading difficulties emphasises the influence of difficulties with oral language on literacy attainment.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Given the central role that oral language competence plays in academic success, it follows that strategic efforts to improve oral language skills in the early years of school should confer gains in literacy skills, social and emotional well-being and academic trajectories taking into account the considerable impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on language.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref>
</p><p>The Australian Early Development Census (AEDC)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> (a population measure of early childhood development completed by teachers on all children at school entry) shows that at the start of primary school, around the age of 5 years, significant SES-based disparities in language functioning are already evident. The 2015 AEDC results show that children who live in areas characterised by the greatest socioeconomic disadvantage have the highest rates of developmental vulnerability on the language and cognitive skills (school-based) domain (12.4%), which encompasses literacy and numeracy skills such as letter and sound awareness, rhyming, ability to write own name and simple words and sentences, ability to count to 20, recognise shapes and numbers and compare and sort numbers. This level of developmental vulnerability is more than four times the 3% of children living in the most advantaged areas whose language and cognitive skills are vulnerable<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and is consistent with the increasing evidence of relatively poorer language performance in young children from low SES backgrounds, inequities that are also reflected in later schooling.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12 15</xref> The Industry Skills Council of Australia<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> has identified that &#x02018;literally millions of Australians have insufficient language, literacy and numeracy skills to benefit fully from training or to participate effectively at work&#x02019; (p. 1), indicating that such difficulties do not spontaneously resolve over time.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>The early years of schooling represent an opportunity to make a substantive difference to educational and life outcomes by addressing the language abilities of whole populations of children.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> The reported high rates of developmental vulnerability with respect to language skills at school entry would suggest that this is both an area in need of pressing attention, and an immediate opportunity for improvement.</p><p>Evidence arising from a number of recent Australian and international studies suggests that efforts to impact student outcomes and address SES-based disparities must be centred on teaching quality.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> The emphasis on improving teaching aligns with international research highlighting the need to invest in teaching.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Improving language and literacy outcomes for school-aged children must therefore explicitly address teaching quality with respect to teacher knowledge and skills, effective formative assessment and instructional decisions. However, the systematic inclusion of language (eg, grammar) together with specific, phonics-based instruction has been limited in schools for decades.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 25&#x02013;30</xref> This presents an implementation challenge, as current teachers are often never taught these skills, either during their own schooling or in their pre-service teacher education. Teachers&#x02019; foundational knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding language and literacy are critical in any effort to target classroom-based approaches to improve student outcomes.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</p><p>Despite the clear importance of oral language for academic achievement, there seems to be no published, rigorous trials of oral language teacher professional learning intervention that have demonstrated a sustained change in student outcomes and/or teacher knowledge and practice. Large-scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in schools to test education interventions are uncommon but gaining momentum in Australia and internationally, including low-income and middle-income countries. For example, organisations such as the UK-based Education Endowment Fund and Social Ventures Australia have stimulated interest in trials by funding RCTs to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of teaching and learning interventions.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> In Australia, the Oral Language Supporting Early Literacy (OLSEL) pilot RCT demonstrated early gains in reading and oral language outcomes in students whose teachers had been exposed to a targeted intervention designed by educators and speech-language pathologists.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 34</xref> OLSEL draws on the theoretical framework developed by Munro,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> with content broadly consistent with the so-called &#x02018;five big ideas&#x02019; of early literacy instruction: phonics-based instruction, phonemic awareness, vocabulary development, comprehension at the sentence, paragraph and topic level and fluency<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> also including narrative skills and syntactic complexity.</p><p>This paper reports the research protocol for the Classroom Promotion of Oral Language (CPOL) trial. Based on OLSEL,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> it aims to advance the early oral language and literacy skills of students considered to be at-risk for low educational attainment, by improving teacher oral language knowledge and practice in their work with students in the first 2&#x02009;years of school. The primary hypothesis is that by grade 3, students in the intervention group will have significantly improved reading achievement, when compared with students who experienced usual teaching practice. Secondary hypotheses are that by grade 1<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">

</xref> students in the intervention group (compared with usual practice) will have improved outcomes in (1) oral language, (2) early literacy and (3) mental health, by grade 3 they will have improved (4) numeracy, (5) literacy and (6) writing skills, and that intervention teachers will have improved knowledge and practice in classroom-based oral language teaching strategies.</p><p>This large-scale cluster RCT will help to generate an evidence-base that can inform high-quality early years teaching and learning in schools, addressing early learning inequalities that can persist across the life span.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>CPOL is a cluster RCT of a teacher-led whole of classroom oral language promotion intervention, compared with usual teaching practice.

Teachers are then able to explore specific classroom teaching strategies to scaffold students&#x02019; acquisition of more sophisticated skills. Four language domains from ICPALER are especially targeted in the teacher professional development: phonemic and phonological awareness, vocabulary knowledge, knowledge and application of narrative structure and comprehension of longer and more syntactically complex sentences.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Overview of the four face-to-face professional learning sessions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content summary</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Format</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 1</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Introduction to the need for oral language promotion in the early years&#x02019; classroom. <break/>Detailed overview of the ICPALER framework for describing and teaching language <break/>Discussion of the material provided <break/>Instructions for between-unit activities (tasks to be completed in schools before next session)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Facilitated discussion <break/>Video footage including teaching examples <break/>Table and whole group discussion</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 2</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 1 refresher and between-unit activity feedback <break/>Assessing and profiling for oral language <break/>Using ICPALER to plan and implement classroom-based speaking and listening teaching <break/>School planning for implementation <break/>Instructions for between-unit activities</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Facilitated discussion/activities <break/>Modelled use of two assessment tools <break/>Practice use of a screening tool <break/>Facilitated activities <break/>Small group planning</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 3</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 2 refresher and between-unit activity feedback <break/>Assessing and teaching the &#x02018;four language elements&#x02019;: phonological and phonemic awareness, vocabulary development, developing and using complex sentences and story grammar. <break/>School planning for implementation <break/>Instructions for day 4 school presentation</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Facilitated discussion and activities <break/>Small group planning</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 4</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">School presentations of implementation <break/>School planning for sustained implementation</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peer-to-peer learning <break/>Small group planning</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn2"><p>*Online professional learning.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn3"><p>ICPALER, Ideas, Conventions, Purposes, Ability to Learn, Expressive and Receptive Language.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Supplementing the formal days of professional learning, teachers will have the opportunity to participate in a self-directed online learning network of teachers from like-schools, and they will liaise with CPOL support workers via intermittent face-to-face, telephone and online contact, in order that questions are addressed and programme fidelity is enhanced.</p><p>1.

These data will be collected by teams of three to five CPOL research assistants blinded to the schools&#x02019; randomisation allocation from October to December 2015.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>At the conclusion of the intervention phase of the trial, a process evaluation will be conducted to evaluate the extent to which the CPOL intervention was implemented as intended. The objectives of the process evaluation will be:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>to evaluate the degree to which teachers and school leaders engaged and complied with the CPOL professional learning intervention;</p></list-item><list-item><p>to identify the facilitators and barriers teachers and/or schools faced in implementation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>to assess the extent to which CPOL strategies are judged to have been maintained in classrooms and built into the school curriculum and wider school environment.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The fidelity of the CPOL intervention will be investigated via a mixed-methods approach, using data collected throughout the RCT pertaining to attendance, support worker notes and observations, as well as in-depth interviews and focus groups with teachers and members of school leadership teams from the intervention arm of the study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">table 3</xref> for details of data collection).</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>A cost-consequences analysis of the intervention compared with the control arm will be conducted from the government perspective, that is, it will include costs and outcomes relevant to government (but not those relevant only to individuals, such as additional out-of-pocket expenses). The economic evaluation will compare the incremental costs of the intervention (costs accrued in the intervention compared with costs accrued in the control group) to the measured primary and secondary outcomes, which are expressed in their natural units, such as point change in NAPLAN score. Costs will include the physical resources and staff time (of training staff and participating teachers) invested in providing all aspects of the intervention, recorded prospectively by the research team. Teacher report of all professional development activities over the 2-year intervention period will be used to assess whether CPOL is associated with a reduction (cost-saving) in other professional development activities. The uncertainty of cost and outcome data will be tested in a sensitivity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Data management and storage</title><p>All schools, teachers and students will be assigned unique numerical identifiers (an ID code) for use throughout the study. A single electronic, password protected, database in REDCap<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> will record all participant details. This will be hosted on the Murdoch Children&#x02019;s Research Institute server, which meets security and ethical confidentiality requirements. Members of the study team will have different levels of access depending on their role. Researchers will be able to access the details of participants where necessary but not their randomisation status unless necessary to that investigator. Participant questionnaire data will be identified by ID code only.</p><p>Written materials will be immediately scanned and saved within the study database. Paper versions of assessments or forms will be stored in a locked filing cabinet at the Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital and will be available only to the relevant research assistant.

Translation of study results will be facilitated by having CECV and DET, who are responsible for the regulation and funding of Victorian schools, as partners in this trial. Findings from this trial will be of national and international significance in health and education sectors. All investigators have extensive national and international research and policymaker networks. This will ensure academic and policy impact via national and international health, education and early childhood development conferences, academic journals, publications targeting practising teachers, targeted use of social and electronic news media and inclusion in strategic policy forums such as national ministerial and senior officer councils (eg, Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood).

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The CPOL trial is an education-based, rigorous evaluation of an oral language teacher professional learning intervention, an area of research in which there are relatively few gold standard trials. It addresses the crucial need to enhance literacy achievements in the early years of schooling by ensuring a rich oral language classroom environment. As a classroom-level, teacher-led intervention, CPOL takes a population approach to improve oral language competencies for all students. However, it targets schools where student&#x02019;s oral language skills may be impoverished relative to the demands of the early years classroom. The trial&#x02019;s efficiencies lie in its data collection design, capitalising on existing data sets routinely collected by schools for submission to their education departments. Partnering with CECV and DET will facilitate leveraging of these data for this intervention and tests a potentially replicable approach for future RCTs in schools.</p><p>The CPOL trial responds to identified evidence gaps in classroom-level oral language interventions, and in RCTs testing the effectiveness of teacher professional learning on student outcomes over the short to medium term. This trial will therefore be proof of concept and further confirmation that large-scale RCTs evaluating pedagogy can be efficient and robust in education. If effective, the following outcomes are expected:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The best available evidence that improving teacher knowledge and changing teacher practice regarding language and literacy can lead to student oral language development and sustained literacy improvement in the first 3 years of formal schooling.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A cost-efficient and well-tested intervention that could be (a) delivered to students as routine high-quality teaching practice and (b) included in teacher preservice education, going some way to addressing the question of &#x02018;what works?&#x02019; in early years language and literacy education.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Schools are highly susceptible to the adoption of poorly evidenced programme.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> While a number of studies have reported the impact of teacher professional development and learning as a before and after design,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59&#x02013;62</xref> this is an undeveloped field of research.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> We will extend this research by potentially demonstrating immediate and medium-term retention of knowledge and change of practice, and by testing this impact compared with control teachers who are being exposed to regular professional development and to ad hoc access to web-based and other sources of information. Support workers who reinforce the professional learning are included as an adjunct intervention accelerator based on feedback from the OLSEL implementation and on work which suggests that schools and teachers benefit from additional &#x02018;hands on&#x02019; support to reinforce and adapt learnings to their actual context.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59 64</xref>
</p><p>It is commonly acknowledged that a nexus should exist between teacher knowledge and practice and student outcomes, potentially mediated through teacher attitudes.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Given the lack of evidence in this area to date, this study will make an important contribution to the education and health literature. Indeed, there is increasing interest in rigorous testing of professional learning interventions in Australia and internationally.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63 66</xref> Education remains one of the most powerful predictors and social determinants of adult health outcomes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In Australia, the converging health and education policy interests in state and federal governments<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67&#x02013;69</xref> would suggest it is timely to rigorously evaluate how schools as education platforms can effectively and equitably address important child development outcomes.
