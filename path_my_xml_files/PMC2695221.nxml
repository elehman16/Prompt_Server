We compared the efficacy and safety of risperidone monotherapy versus combination therapy of haloperidol with sertaline for the acute treatment of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type. This is an open label study of 52 female inpatients randomly assigned to risperidone alone (N = 26) or haloperidol in combination with sertraline (N = 26) for 12 weeks. The mean daily doses of medications were: risperidone: 3.75&#x02013;3.29 mg/day, haloperidol: 5.35&#x02013;4.15 mg/day, sertraline: 65.39&#x02013;133.82 mg/day. Efficacy was measured using clinical rating scales of treatment, safety, and tolerability. Risperidone patients showed statistically significant greater improvement than haloperidol-sertraline patients on efficacy measures including Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impressions rating. A higher number of risperidone patients dropped out of the study early. Fewer adverse events and lesser need for concomitant medications occurred in patients on risperidone. The risperidone group showed better psychological, social and occupational functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning) and higher quality of life (Heinrich&#x02019;s Quality of Life Scale). Risperidone has higher antipsychotic efficacy and tolerability compared with haloperidol-sertraline combination for the acute treatment of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type. Both treatments were comparable in terms of antidepressant efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>schizoaffective disorder</kwd><kwd>depressed type</kwd><kwd>risperidone</kwd><kwd>haloperidol</kwd><kwd>sertraline</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The existence of schizoaffective disorder as a separate diagnostic entity has been the subject of debate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-5-091">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ndt-5-091">3</xref> It has often been considered to be the &#x0201c;waste&#x0201d; basket of a diagnosis by exclusion. Nevertheless, the combination of schizophrenic and depressive symptoms represents a clinical reality requiring accurate diagnosis and effective management. The prognosis of schizoaffective disorder is usually more favorable than for schizophrenia, but less positive in comparison to affective disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ndt-5-091">4</xref> The depressed type of schizoaffective disorder represents a challenge due to the chronic and frequently deteriorating course of the illness with negative effects on all spheres of social functioning. The net result is higher utilization of health care resources.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-5-091">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-5-091">6</xref> A factor that can significantly influence the prognosis for this disorder is the choice of suitable therapeutic strategy, in the acute, as well as the continuation and maintenance phases of treatment.</p><p>The pharmacotherapy of the acute phase of schizoaffective disorder involves primarily antipsychotic and secondarily antidepressant drugs. However, to achieve an optimal effect, patients with schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, require targeted pharmacologic therapy aimed at improving the schizophrenic as well as the affective components of the illness. Studies focusing on the pharmacotherapy of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, are limited. Most studies have focused on the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic monotherapy while opinions regarding the appropriateness of combined anti-psychotic&#x02013;antidepressant therapy vary. Antidepressants are especially useful when antipsychotic treatment improves the psychotic symptoms only.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ndt-5-091">7</xref></p><p>Due to their efficacy and safety profile atypical antipsychotics should result in improved long-term efficacy, quality of life, and patient compliance. Karow and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ndt-5-091">8</xref> found a subjective preference for atypical antipsychotics by patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, who had received long-term antipsychotic medication. As has been documented by Clark and colleagues,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ndt-5-091">9</xref> the use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder increased from 43% to 70% between 1995 and 1999. However, a surprising finding of this study was that, in the era of new-generation antipsychotics with broad-spectrum efficacy, combination antipsychotic therapy increased from 5.7% to 24.3%. In their meta-analysis of trials aimed at comparing long-term treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder published between 1994 and 2005, Turner and Stewart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ndt-5-091">10</xref> observed a lower number of relapses, fewer adverse events (AEs) and higher efficacy of atypical antipsychotics. Flynn and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ndt-5-091">11</xref> retrospectively studied therapy in 70 hospitalized patients with schizoaffective disorder (depressive symptoms present in 53% patients): 90% of patients received antipsychotics while the proportion of atypical antipsychotics increased year-to-year; 87% patients received an antipsychotic drug in combination with an anti-depressant or mood stabilizer; only 6% of patients received monotherapy with a typical or atypical antipsychotic drug. There was a tendency to continue the antidepressant if the patient was receiving such treatment before hospitalization despite not currently experiencing depressive symptoms. The presence of depressive symptoms at the time of hospitalization rarely leads to the administration of an antidepressant. Flynn and colleagues did not confirm that monotherapy with atypical antipsychotics is a widespread method in clinical practice.</p><p>We had earlier conducted a retrospective pilot study to obtain an overview of current treatment strategies in the acute phase of treatment of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ndt-5-091">12</xref> We determined that the most prevalent pharmaco-therapeutic strategy was the combination of antipsychotics with antidepressants. The reasons for preferring such combined treatment over monotherapy were: (a) low incidence of AEs with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), (b) statistically significant effect on reduction of depressed symptoms, (c) decreased risk of relapse when changing the antipsychotic medication. The treatment of schizoaffective disorder in Slovakia was also studied by D&#x000f3;ci and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ndt-5-091">13</xref> In this study, the combination of antipsychotics with antidepressants also prevailed over monotherapy with an antipsychotic drug, while atypical antipsychotics were preferred.</p><p>The present 12-week study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of monotherapy with risperidone versus combination therapy with haloperidol and sertraline in the acute phase of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>Open label, randomized, prospective, clinical study.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The study was meant to include men and women, aged 18&#x02013;65, hospitalized for schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, diagnosed by ICD-10 criteria (The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) and DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition). The nature of the episode was documented as first or recurring episode, relapse or gradual decompensation. The negative symptoms subscore had to be higher than the positive symptoms subscore (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]) at the initial assessment. The total score on the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) had to be &#x02265;5 at the initial assessment. Patients previously receiving a depot antipsychotic were included in the study only after a minimum of one therapeutic interval had lapsed. Women of reproductive age had to be practicing reliable contraception. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and all patients had to give written informed consent before enrolling in the study. Exclusion criteria included the presence of a mental disorder other than that specified in the inclusion criteria, the need for electroconvulsive therapy, and a history of insufficient efficacy of the study medication. Patients with a serious or unstable medical condition were excluded; however, patients with a chronic illness who were stable on medication were allowed into the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><sec><title>Risperidone monotherapy (Group R)</title><p>Risperidone was begun at 1 mg/day and subsequently titrated according to the condition of the patient.

The mean daily dose of haloperidol at week 1 was 5.35 mg/day (SD = 3.97) and that of sertraline was 65.39 mg/day (SD = 23.53). At week 12 the mean daily dose of haloperidol was 4.15 mg/day (SD = 3.38) and the dose of sertraline was 133.82 mg/day (SD = 38.47).

The collected data represent quantifiable differences of grouped median scores of the assessment scales in respective assessed time points, which were analyzed using the method of &#x0201c;Observed Cases.&#x0201d; As the sets of patients are number-restricted, the statistical assessment applied nonparametric tests. For assessing statistical significance, we applied the significance level of at least 5% (p = 0.05). We placed emphasis on effect size, calculated as the correlation rate of effect size of difference between grouped medians (correlation rate r<sub>m</sub>). The correlation rate (effect size) is standardized, and reaches values from 0 to 1.

The statistical evaluation of differences between individual groups and statistical evaluation of score variances in individual weeks used the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test and correlation rate of effect size between grouped medians (r<sub>m</sub>). The two-way significance level (p) was evaluated. The interscale correlations within both groups and between the groups were assessed using correlation analysis. The primary indicator for evaluating the tightness of relation of two quantitative variables was determining the Spearman rank correlation coefficient rho. The statistical software SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and Excel 2000 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) were used for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro|subjects"><title>Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients</title><p>Two thousand four hundred sixty-six patients were screened for the study. At the time of discharge from the hospital 207 patients (32.9% male, 67.1% female) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Of these, 130 patients (62.8%) were treated for schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, and 77 patients (37.2%) for manic type. None of the cases had the mixed type of schizoaffective disorder. The sex distribution of patients with schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, was almost 4:1 in favour of females (78.5% female vs 21.5% male) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-5-091">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>When patient enrolment into the study was completed, 54 patients (52 female) had met inclusion criteria. The only two male patients who met inclusion criteria dropped out at week 4, due to noncompliance with the study protocol. They were not included in the statistical analysis. The subject population included in the statistical analysis consisted of 52 female patients, representing 2.1% of the initial group. The study patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, either to the risperidone monotherapy (Group R) or to the haloperidol&#x02013;sertraline combination therapy (Group HS). The randomization codes were assigned using the method of random number selection. The total duration of the study was 12 weeks. All patients were hospitalized at the beginning of the study, and all were followed as outpatients after discharge from the inpatient service. Two patients were enrolled in the study at two different hospitalizations, after suffering a relapse three years later. A solid remission in both of these patients was obtained between hospitalizations. Since both patients were randomized at their second hospitalization and turned out to have been assigned to the other treatment group, they were kept in the data analysis.</p><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of Groups R and HS at baseline are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ndt-5-091">Table 2</xref>.

However, we observed a comparable effect of both therapeutic regimens on negative schizophrenic and depressive symptoms and on their rate of global clinical improvement. Comparisons of the efficacy of haloperidol and risperidone in improving negative symptoms have appeared in several publications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ndt-5-091">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ndt-5-091">26</xref> Judging from those reports, the efficacy of risperidone versus haloperidol in patients with schizophrenic disorders with depressive symptoms is an unresolved question. In our study, the comparison included another factor, sertraline, an antidepressant extending the effect of haloperidol on affective symptoms, but concurrently represented a certain risk for potential drug interactions and possible worsening of schizophrenic symptoms. M&#x000fc;ller-Siecheneder and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ndt-5-091">27</xref> compared the efficacy of haloperidol and amitriptyline therapy to the efficacy of risperidone in 123 patients with combination of psychotic and depressive symptoms in a six-week study. They observed a higher efficacy of combined therapy, although it was more frequently accompanied by AEs. The limitation of their study was the inclusion of patients with a combination of psychotic and depressive symptoms, and inclusion of psychotic depression.</p><p>With respect to quality of life and overall psychosocial functioning, our groups did not differ significantly at week 0. Quality of life and overall functioning improved in both groups, however, more significantly in Group R. Despite this finding, we would have expected more robust differences between the groups. Tempier and Pawliuk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ndt-5-091">28</xref> in their retrospective cross-study analysis did not observe better quality of life in patients taking atypical antipsychotics than in patients treated with typical antipsychotics. These authors interpreted their results by assuming that higher demands are placed on the life of patients taking atypical antipsychotics than in those receiving typical antipsychotics.</p><p>In both groups we observed a comparable effect size and a positive change of patient attitude toward study medication (DAI scale). They not only had a better attitude toward study medication, as compared to their previous medication, but their attitude improved during the course of the trial. The positive change of attitude was particularly evident during the first six weeks but levelled off between week 6 and 12 in both groups. A likely explanation for this observation is that patients in an acute condition require relief during the first few weeks of treatment, and efficacious medication provides this relief. However, once the acute phase is over, the patient begins to consider the likely need for long-term therapy and becomes more concerned about the presence of adverse events. A more favorable assessment of the study medication in both groups, compared to the previous medication, was obtained with the PPS scale. In comparing the PPS scores at week 12, Group R patients (n = 12) evaluated the study medication more favorably than patients in Group HS (n = 17). This is in accord with our hypothesis and the results of published studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ndt-5-091">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ndt-5-091">29</xref></p><p>We did not validate our hypothesis that the mean duration of hospitalization would be shorter with risperidone therapy. Our results agree with the retrospective study of Flynn and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ndt-5-091">11</xref> who failed to observe a relationship between duration of hospitalization and type of treatment for schizoaffective disorder, but who did establish a correlation between duration of illness and rate of improvement. With a longer history of schizoaffective disorder, the patient&#x02019;s condition stabilized faster and required a shorter hospitalization. We did not examine this relationship in the present study.</p><p>We assessed the safety of therapy by the incidence of AEs and the need for concomitant medication. Generally, the incidence of AEs was low with both treatment strategies. The AEs, which we observed using the SAS scale, and those spontaneously reported, belong primarily to the EPS spectrum. A decrease in the intensity of AEs was observed during the study, especially in Group R. Reduction of antipsychotic dose and administration of concomitant medication had a positive effect on AEs. The need for concomitant psychotropic medication was high in both Groups. The administration of concomitant medication at the beginning of study was justified by the need for symptom relief, such as insomnia, inner tension and anxiety. Generally higher doses of drugs are used at the beginning of antipsychotic therapy with treatment emergent AEs and the associated need for concomitant medication. Overall Group R showed lower need for concomitant medication than Group HS. No AEs were noted in vital signs, weight or laboratory measures in conjunction with either drug regimen.</p><p>The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, has been the subject of many scientific discussions. The literature has been addressing it since its initial description and to the present day, as it is considered to be an ambiguous diagnostic entity. Many authors consider it to be a waste basket of diagnoses. In attempting to diagnose the disorder accurately, we applied ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria. The diagnostic process comprised three independent phases. Firstly, the admitting psychiatrist made the diagnosis at the time of hospitalization. Secondly, the diagnosis had to be confirmed by the inpatient psychiatrist in charge of the patient while in the hospital. Thirdly, the psychiatric investigator confirmed the diagnosis and determined eligibility of the patient to be enrolled in the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thus, we are satisfied that the patient cohort was diagnostically homogeneous.</p><p>The present study has a number of limitations. One of them is the somewhat low number of patients in the two groups. Due to our rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, the target population was relatively small. At the time the study was conducted, a total of 130 patients diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, depressed type, were hospitalized. Of these, 41.5% met study criteria and signed informed consent. Schizoaffective disorder afflicts both sexes, however, it occurs far more frequently in women. The uneven sex distribution was supported by our study with predominant representation of female (n = 102) versus male (n = 28) patients. Ultimately, the entire study cohort analyzed consisted of female patients. Another limitation was the open design of the study reflecting a possible subjective bias. This weakness, however, was partially offset by the advantage of enabling the patient to work psychoeducationally with the treatment team and thereby improving the therapeutic relationship. In spite of these limitations, however, the data clearly established a significant therapeutic advantage of monotherapy with the atypical antipsychotic, risperidone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study demonstrated higher efficacy of risperidone monotherapy compared to combination therapy with haloperidol and sertraline, in regards to schizophrenic symptomatology, but suggested comparable efficacy in regards to depressive symptomatology for the acute treatment of schizoaffective disorder, depressed type. Risperidone monotherapy was more efficacious in improving quality of life and psychosocial functioning along with a more positive patient attitude toward therapy. Fewer adverse events and a lower need for concomitant medication in the risperidone group enhanced the patient&#x02019;s quality of life and decreased the pharmacoeconomic impact of therapy overall. For these reasons risperidone monotherapy may be advantageous for long-term administration. On the other hand, combination of haloperidol and sertraline represents a highly effective therapeutic alternative, especially suitable for patients who may not tolerate risperidone. A distinct advantage of the combination is the beneficial effect on depressive symptoms, which may represent an indication for such a regimen, if the affective component of this disorder predominates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Alojz Ritomsk&#x000fd;, PhD, Institute of Applied Psychology, Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This manuscript was previously presented at the 20th ECNP Congress, October 13&#x02013;17th, 2007, Vienna, Austria: Iz&#x000e1;kov&#x000e1; L&#x02019;.
