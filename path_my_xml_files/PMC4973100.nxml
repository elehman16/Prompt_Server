We report a process evaluation exploring the implementation of the intervention, the experiences of those participating in the study and lessons for future implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The OPTI-SCRIPT trial included 21 GP practices and 196 patients. The process evaluation used mixed methods. Quantitative data were collected from all GP practices and semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs from intervention and control groups, and a purposive sample of patients from the intervention group. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Despite receiving a standardised academic detailing session, intervention delivery varied among GP practices. Just over 70&#x000a0;% of practices completed medicines review as recommended with the patient present. Only single-handed practices conducted reviews without patients present, highlighting the influence of practice characteristics and resources on variation. Medications were more likely to be completely stopped or switched to another more appropriate medication when reviews were conducted with patients present. The patient information leaflets were not used by any of the intervention practices. Both GP (32&#x000a0;%) and patient (40&#x000a0;%) recruitment rates were modest. For those who did participate, overall, the experience was positively viewed, with GPs and patients referring to the value of medication reviews to improve prescribing and reduce unnecessary medications. Lack of time in busy GP practices and remuneration were identified as organisational barriers to future implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The OPTI-SCRIPT intervention was positively viewed by both GPs and patients, both of whom valued the study&#x02019;s objectives. Patient information leaflets were not a successful component of the intervention. Academic detailing and medication reviews are important components in changing PIP, and having patients present during the review process seems to be a more effective approach for decreasing PIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN41694007">ISRCTN41694007</ext-link>.

Recent systematic reviews report an estimated PIP prevalence of 20&#x000a0;% in community-dwelling patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. PIP has become an important public health concern as patients with PIP have been found to have a more than twofold increased odds of experiencing adverse drug reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and a nearly a twofold increased risk in the expected rate of emergency room visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PIP is also associated with increased health expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Decreasing the prevalence of PIP may have important public health and financial benefits, particularly in primary care, where the majority of prescribing occurs. However, to date, no single interventional strategy has proven to be most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The OPTImizing PreSCRIbing for Older People in Primary Care, a clusTer randomised controlled trial (OPTI-SCRIPT) cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that a multifaceted intervention was effective in reducing PIP in primary care. The intervention worked principally on reducing proton pump inhibitor prescribing and appeared less effective on other classes of PIP drugs such as long-term benzodiazepine prescribing and therapeutic duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The detailed methods and results have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In brief, the intervention involved academic detailing with a pharmacist on conducting General Practitioner (GP)-led medicines review with participating patients; medicines reviews were supported by web-based pharmaceutical treatment algorithms for GPs, providing evidence-based alternative treatment options to PIP drugs, and tailored patient information leaflets (PILs). A summary of the study is presented in Appendix <xref rid="Sec26" ref-type="sec">1</xref>.</p><p>Process evaluations are recommended to contextualise RCT results, answering key questions about why an intervention has failed or succeeded and how it was implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Process evaluations are particularly relevant to complex, multifaceted interventions such as OPTI-SCRIPT. Such interventions involve multiple targets (for example, patients and clinicians) and various active components and are often criticised as their complexity makes it difficult to measure their effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To date, systematic guidance on what data a process evaluation should collect and report has been lacking and process evaluations have been planned and conducted in an ad hoc fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Grant et al., recently developed a framework to guide the design and conduct of process evaluations specifically for cluster RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The framework presents a range of approaches to understanding trial delivery, intervention implementation, and the responses of targeted participants, taking into consideration evaluation at both the cluster and the individual participant level.</p><p>This paper presents the process evaluation conducted as part of the OPTI-SCRIPT trial and aims to explore how the intervention was implemented, the experiences of those participating in the study and lessons for future implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The process evaluation undertaken used a mixed methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. The process evaluation framework outlined by Grant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] was used to report the overall findings.</p><p>This study was approved by the research ethics committee of the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) and informed consent was given by all GP practices and patients.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>The OPTI-SCRIPT study was conducted in the Irish primary care setting (see Appendix <xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">2</xref>) among patients aged 70&#x000a0;years and over as the prevalence of PIP is high in this age group (36&#x000a0;% in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). Out of 21 GP practices, 11 practices (99 patients) were allocated to the intervention group and 10 practices (97 patients) were allocated to the control group using minimisation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of practices and patients through the study. *Eligibility fraction: Proportion of potential participants who undergo screening and are eligible to enrol. &#x02018;Recruitment fraction: Proportion of potential participants who actually enrol in the RCT. ^Enrolment fraction: Proportion of people who are eligible for participation and who actually enrol in the RCT. ~Number of patients needed to be screened: Number of patients screened in order to randomise one participant (1/recruitment fraction).

For patient interviews, only those who experienced the intervention were invited to participate (as questions mainly related to the experience of intervention). Purposive sampling was used to ensure coverage across GP practices and heterogeneity in terms of patient gender, type of PIP drugs, outcome of medication review. Out of 14 patients approached in the intervention group, 11 patients agreed to participate in an interview. Fifty-four percent of patient interviewees were male compared to 53.5&#x000a0;% of non-interviewees. The average age of interviewees was 78&#x000a0;years compared to 77 for non-interviewees.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Quantitative data were compiled from a number of sources. First, all GP practices completed a practice characteristics form upon recruitment, providing details on numbers of staff, location and numbers of patients. Second, all participating patients completed a questionnaire providing basic demographic details, health service utilisation and patient-reported outcome measures. Third, the OPTI-SCRIPT study team maintained researcher logs of the recruitment process and all contacts with participants. Finally, in the intervention group, process measure data were collected by evaluation forms, which were integrated into the web-based pharmaceutical treatment algorithms. These forms were completed by GPs upon completion of each OPTI-SCRIPT medication review.</p><p>Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews. Intervention group patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) were interviewed within 1&#x000a0;month of undertaking the OPTI-SCRIPT medicines review and intervention group GPs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) were interviewed within 1&#x000a0;month of completion of the final OPTI-SCRIPT medicines review for that practice. Control group GPs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) were interviewed upon final data collection conducted at intervention completion. Interviews were conducted by a single interviewer (BC) either in person or via telephone. Telephone interviewing is generally used where time or costs are issues, and evidence suggests there is little difference in the answers obtained this way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All interviews were audio recorded (on loud speaker for telephone interviews). The semi-structured GP interview topic guide was used to facilitate discussion of common prescribing-related issues in older patients and experiences of trial participation such as problems with the study processes or intervention and improvements which could be made. The patient topic guide focused on patients&#x02019; perceptions of their medications and their experiences of the medication review process (Appendix <xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">3</xref>). Patient interviews lasted an average of 11.6&#x000a0;minutes (min 6.2&#x02013;max 20.3), while GP interviews lasted an average of 14.5&#x000a0;minutes (min 8.56&#x02013;max 26.31).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Quantitative data were inputted into STATA Version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and summarised using descriptive statistics.</p><p>All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim.

Familiarisation with data was achieved through reading and re-reading transcripts one by one in detail. Field notes and observations were not used in the analysis. Initial codes were generated from commonly occurring patterns and were grouped into potential sub-themes and related directly to the pre-determined framework. Quotations were used as exemplars of key themes.</p><p>NVivo 10 was used to assist with organising the data for analysis. All transcripts were reviewed independently by two researchers (BC, JAC) and the findings discussed to confirm the validity of the emerging results.

Ok, you know, it&#x02019;s not like I&#x02019;m changing something that one of my colleagues put them on and said to them, you must stay on this or whatever, they all deal with me, for better or worse &#x02013; I don&#x02019;t know!&#x0201d;</italic> (GP21, intervention practice).</p></disp-quote></p><p>While practices differed in terms of conducting reviews with and without patients present, all practices (10/10) were consistent in terms of a second adaptation and the use of the PILs. The PILs were not used as part of the review process in the intervention group. In the main, GPs forgot to provide patients with the PILs and indicated that in this patient group, such extra material was not necessary:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;I didn&#x02019;t have to, you know, the whole process is that our patients, if they trust us, and we explain everything to them, what we are doing, em, you don&#x02019;t need to, we don&#x02019;t need to do that</italic> [give PILs]<italic>.&#x0201d;</italic> (GP16, intervention practice).</p></disp-quote></p><p>When asked if they would have liked to receive the PILs, generally this patient group reported not having much use for such materials:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Oh no, no, I don&#x02019;t welcome those sorts of things; they just pile up here in the house.&#x0201d;</italic> (P13.47, intervention patient).</p></disp-quote></p><p>The majority (9/10) of practices conducted reviews as patients presented for their repeat prescription, as recommended in the study protocol. However, one practice contacted the patients to attend a specific consultation outside of the repeat prescription timeline. Conducting the reviews with the patients was described positively by all GPs:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Oh yeah, it was very good, yeah, because actually, because they were coming in you were able to look at everything properly and they were coming in a structured review &#x02026; just to give you a time to review the whole situation you know, in regards to all of their prescribing. It was very useful, yeah.&#x0201d;</italic> (GP18, intervention practice).</p></disp-quote></p><p>The reviews were a positive experience for two main reasons. First, the intervention website and treatment algorithms were considered simple and easy to engage with by all GPs:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;It was very straightforward, it worked well I thought, em it was clear and you know, from our point of view, actually when you actually got down to it, the patient, the actual process of going through the patient was quite quick.&#x0201d;</italic> (GP24, intervention practice).</p></disp-quote></p><p>Second, the majority of GPs (8/10) reported that patients were overall <italic>&#x0201c;very receptive&#x0201d;</italic> (GP16, intervention practice) to the review process, making the consultation a positive and rewarding encounter from the GP perspective:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;I actually think that this study has made me review my patients more closely, so I think it&#x02019;s good for me personally, which means it&#x02019;s good for my patients in the end.&#x0201d;</italic> (GP23, intervention practice).</p></disp-quote></p><p>Despite being asked to conduct all reviews within 6&#x02013;8 weeks and receiving weekly reminder emails and calls, there were significant differences in the time between academic detailing and completion of all reviews by intervention practices (minimum 3&#x000a0;weeks, maximum 28&#x000a0;weeks) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Longer completion times generally reflected a lack of resources to dedicate to the study within the practice:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;That was difficult, because, the person who manages such things is</italic> [practice nurse], <italic>who was on sick leave for most of the study.

During the 86 medication reviews, 114 potentially inappropriate prescriptions were assessed. Of these, 44 (39&#x000a0;%) prescriptions were not altered, for reasons including the prescription being initiated in hospital (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), patient preference (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) and lack of available alternatives. The 62 remaining inappropriate prescriptions were altered, with the majority of changes (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30, 48&#x000a0;%) made in the form of a dose reduction, reflecting the fact that the majority of these changes were reductions in the use of proton pump inhibitors at maximum therapeutic dose.</p><p>Analysis of the OPTI-SCRIPT RCT data highlighted that the effectiveness of the intervention overall was largely mediated through a reduction in the prescribing of proton pump inhibitors with no statistically significant effect on other types of potentially inappropriate medicines such as long-term use of benzodiazepines. Some GPs were sceptical about the benefits of discontinuation of such medications in older patients:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Sometimes, for example, in relation to benzodiazepine, em, you know, somebody might be on benzodiazepines and has been for 40&#x000a0;years, which one of the patients actually was, I don&#x02019;t think it&#x02019;s appropriate to stop that.

A total of 89 potentially inappropriate prescriptions were assessed during reviews with patients present compared to 25 potentially inappropriate prescriptions in reviews conducted without patients present. Although the numbers are small, differences in the changes made to PIP drugs during reviews conducted with and without patients present were observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) with a higher proportion of reviews conducted with patients present resulting in a complete removal of the medication (22&#x000a0;%) compared to reviews without the patients (4&#x000a0;%).

The review provided an opportunity for patients to examine their medications as many (6/11) recognised the potential to be taking medications that may no longer be necessary. Two patients reflected on the wider societal implications of taking medications that may no longer be clinically necessary as wasteful. Both highlighted that by reducing waste in this area, there may be the potential to save money that could be redistributed in other areas.

GPs from both intervention and control groups expressed a desire to learn and a willingness to change their prescribing practices:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;When you are a GP you get practices and you get bad habits, and you get good habits, and sometimes you are too busy to change your habits until it is pointed out so, anything like this is a good thing.&#x0201d;</italic> (GP19, control practice).</p></disp-quote></p><p>Patients also perceived the value of the objectives of the medication review process and expressed support for the opportunity to stop unnecessary medications. Despite this enthusiasm, GPs did not seem to consider this as part of their current core work, and a number of organisational barriers to the provision of medicines reviews as standard in Irish primary care in the future were identified, particularly in relation to workload and reimbursement.</p><p>GPs highlighted that current workloads made dedicated reviews for all older patients unfeasible due to time constraints:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;General practice at the moment now, as far as I can see, is getting hit by about 30&#x000a0;% more extra work, due to the economic downturn, so most medical card list have gone up by about 30&#x000a0;%, and that is increasing a huge volume of work, because those patients before, happened to be in the non-medical card area and they weren&#x02019;t consulting as much.

First, just over 70&#x000a0;% of practices completed medicines review as recommended with the patient present. Medications were more likely to be completely stopped or switched to another more appropriate medication when reviews were conducted with patients present. Organisational factors such as resources and workload are often reasons for variation in intervention delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this case, practice characteristics may have been influential as both practices who conducted reviews without patients present were single-handed practices. Strong evidence supports the active involvement of older people in their primary care episodes to improve health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. While the effects of patient participation in medication reviews are understudied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], recent evidence from the EMPOWER study highlights that increasing older people&#x02019;s participation in prescribing decisions can result in the discontinuation of inappropriate benzodiazepines (risk difference 23&#x000a0;%, 95&#x000a0;% CI 14&#x02013;32&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although based on small numbers, our findings, and those of the EMPOWER study, provide support for actively encouraging shared decision-making between older patients and primary care prescribers, even for medications typically considered difficult to change such as benzodiazepines. It could be argued that medications such as proton pump inhibitors are easier to alter where time and resources are limited but the fact that 36&#x000a0;% of benzodiazepines were altered in the OPTI-SCRIPT study would suggest otherwise. Second, the PILs were not utilised by participating GPs. Evidence indicates that PILs are promising tools in reducing antibiotic prescribing in primary care and that older patients appreciate being provided with brief, clearly written information leaflets in addition to information from their doctor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Both GP and patient participants in this study felt that PILs were unnecessary, however, as the GPs reported forgetting this element of the intervention, it could be argued that its importance was not fully conveyed during the academic detailing process.</p><p>The control group also varied in its behaviour, with two practices implementing changes based on the feedback letter they received &#x02013; a common finding in prescribing-based RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This activity was the driving force for the changes noted in the control group in the RCT analysis. The fact that only a small proportion of the control group implemented changes reinforces the evidence that less intensive feedback on prescribing behaviour is generally not sufficient to impact on prescribing practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Overall, these findings are consistent with previous studies that have highlighted that complex interventions in primary care are often not implemented and utilised as intended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Participant experience</title><p>Both GP (32&#x000a0;%) and patient (40&#x000a0;%) recruitment rates were modest. The rates compare favourably to similar PIP related RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], but smaller than reported in other primary care studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For those GPs and patients who did take part, participation in the OPTI-SCRIPT study was positively viewed. The intervention was considered simple to engage with and the participants reported to agree in principle with the overall study objectives (i.e. stopping or reducing unnecessary medications in older patients). The OPTI-SCRIPT study also provided the opportunity for altruism, and perceived greater quality of care, important factors influencing the participation of older people in RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. For GPs, the study provided the opportunity to improve care for current patients, and update their knowledge and clinical skills, commonly reported benefits of participation in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Volunteer bias may also provide an explanation for the overall positive experiences reported. Those who volunteer for research studies may be motivated by a particular interest in the study objective. Comparison with a national sample of GPs highlighted that OPTI-SCRIPT GPs may have been more research-orientated but OPTI-SCRIPT patients&#x02019; demographics reflected those of the general population.</p><p>GPs&#x02019; main critique of study participation related to patient recruitment, which is consistently one of the most challenging aspects of research studies. The process of identification and recruitment required more time than expected, consistent with previous trials recruiting older patients in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The numbers needed to screen was six, meaning six people needed to be screened in order to randomise one, larger than has been reported in other primary care based studies (median 2.43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). Workload and time remain significant barriers to participation in such research by GPs. It is important to minimise the efforts required by practice staff to recruit patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the UK, research networks such as The Clinical Research Network offer services to assist with timely recruitment, however, in this case, no such services operate and ethical committee requirements were such that the burden of recruitment fell heavily on the practices involved. Excessive delays, variability in process and outcome, and imposed requirements that can have negative consequences for study conduct are common challenges reported during the research ethics review process for cluster RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the absence of support services, electronic identification of potential participants could potentially expedite the recruitment process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Future implementation</title><p>The main RCT demonstrated that the OPTI-SCRIPT intervention was effective in reducing PIP in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The challenge remains how to embed this type of intervention within the current structures of health care services. Rogers (2003) identified the key attributes (as perceived by prospective adopters), that influence the adoption of an intervention into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Innovations that are perceived as having greater relative advantage (innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes), compatibility (agreement between the innovation and organizational values and beliefs), simplicity (degree of difficult to use), trialability (how much innovation can be experimented with), and observability (ease with which results can be seen) will be adopted more rapidly than others. The process evaluation identified OPTI-SCRIPT as having relative advantage, compatibility, observability and was low in complexity. Coupled with the predominantly positive experiences reported during the process evaluation, this would suggest that the implementation of such an intervention would be acceptable to both GP and patient participants alike. However, medicines reviews did not seem to be considered core work. Despite the enthusiasm expressed, there was considerable variation in the time taken to complete the reviews (3&#x02013;28 weeks) and reminders from the study team were required. In order to implement medicines reviews as standard practice outside of the study setting, the organisational barriers of GP workloads, time to conduct the reviews, and reimbursement mechanisms need to be considered. Focusing on a select number of specific medications or &#x0201c;cardinal PIPs&#x0201d; offers a means to decrease workload barriers.</p><p>Just under 40&#x000a0;% of potentially inappropriate prescriptions were unaltered due to factors such as hospital initiation, patient preference and lack of alternatives, serving as a reminder that although a medication may be considered inappropriate for older people, it may still be prescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>This study is one of a growing number of process evaluations published independently of the main RCT findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and is one of first to adopt a process evaluation framework explicitly intended for use in cluster RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

However, the limitations of this study lie primarily with the collection of qualitative data as some participants were not available for interview. In particular, the GP who did not conduct any of the medication reviews was not interviewed. The practice provided the OPTI-SCRIPT team access to patient data, but attempts to schedule an interview with the GP were unsuccessful. As the only GP not to complete the reviews, this interview would have provided some valuable insights. The GP indicated that although the practice intended to conduct the reviews, they had no time to complete the study. A further limitation to the qualitative data may be the length of the interviews which were an average of 15&#x000a0;minutes with GPs and 12&#x000a0;minutes with patients which may have affected the richness of the data collected; however, all items on the topic guide were addressed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Lessons learnt and future research</title><p>The valuable insights gained during this process evaluation are summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.

The OPTI-SCRIPT RCT and process evaluation found that the intervention was effective, feasible and was acceptable to GPs and older patients. However, PILs were not a successful component of the intervention. Plans for wider implementation of the intervention in primary care would need to increase support for patient recruitment and address organisational barriers to implementation such as lack of time in busy GP practices and remuneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CME, continuing medical education; GMS, General Medical Services; GP, General Practitioner; HRB, Health Research Board; ICGP, Irish College of General Practitioners; OPTI-SCRIPT, OPTImizing PreSCRIbing for Older People in Primary Care, a clusTer randomised controlled trial; PILs, patient information leaflets; PIP, potentially inappropriate prescribing; RCT, randomised controlled trial</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Appendix 1</title><p><table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Overview of the OPTI-SCRIPT cluster RCT methods and findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Aim</td><td>To test the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention in reducing the level of PIP in primary care.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants</td><td>Twenty-one general practices (intervention n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11, control n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10).<break/>A total of 196 patients &#x02265;70&#x000a0;years (intervention n&#x02009;=&#x02009;99, control group n&#x02009;=&#x02009;97) with &#x02265;1 PIP drugs.</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome measure</td><td>Proportion of participant patients with PIP and the mean number of potentially inappropriate prescriptions per group.</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention group</td><td>The intervention consisted of:<break/>&#x02003;(1) Academic detailing with a pharmacist<break/>&#x02003;&#x02003;One session (lasting 30&#x000a0;minutes) where a pharmacist visited the practice to discuss PIP, medicines review and the web-based pharmaceutical treatment algorithms<break/>&#x02003;(2) Medicines review with web-based pharmaceutical treatment algorithms.
