alignment, pressure pain threshold and pain in subjects with scapular downward rotation
after 4 weeks of wall slide exercise or sling slide exercise. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty-two subjects with scapular downward rotation participated in this study. The
alignment of the scapula was measured using radiographic analysis (X-ray). Pain and
pressure pain threshold were assessed using visual analogue scale and digital algometer.
Patients were assessed before and after a 4 weeks of exercise. [Results] In the
within-group comparison, the wall slide exercise group showed significant differences in
the resting scapular alignment, pressure pain threshold, and pain after four weeks. The
between-group comparison showed that there were significant differences between the wall
slide group and the sling slide group after four weeks. [Conclusion] The results of this
study found that the wall slide exercise may be effective at reducing pain and improving
scapular alignment in subjects with scapular downward rotation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Scapular downward rotation</kwd><kwd>Wall slide</kwd><kwd>Sling slide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shoulder pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints in clinical practice. In
particular, abnormal alignment of the scapula is a common clinical problem<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Abnormal alignment provides clues about the resting length of muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. An imbalance in scapular upward rotator muscles, such as
the upper trapezius (UT), lower trapezius (LT), and serratus anterior (SA), is caused by
scapular downward rotation (SDR). SDR is one of the most common scapular alignment
impairments in individuals with shoulder pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in scapular alignment can potentially influence the
biomechanics of the glenohumeral joint by altering tension at the cervicoscapular muscle,
which may lead to shoulder impingement<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patients with SDR experience restriction of upward rotation at 60&#x000b0; of the scapula during
shoulder abduction, and compensatory scapular elevation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Excessive UT muscle activation resulting from scapular elevation in
the UT region generates myofascial trigger points that cause pressure pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, in order to treat the imbalance of
scapular muscles in patients with SDR, it is necessary to use exercises which recover the
normal alignment of the scapula by strengthening the scapular upward rotators and extending
the scapular downward rotators<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A sling is a tool that is used to provide an unstable base of support, and it widely used
in clinical practice in order to increase the activity of scapular stabilizer muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Jeong et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> measured UT, SA, and deltoid
activity while healthy adults conducted push-up plus exercises on a stable base of support
and an unstable base of support, such as a sling. They found that the SA and UT had higher
muscle activities in a push-up plus exercise conducted on a sling<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the wall slide exercise, the lower arms slip upward against the wall with the elbow
joints flexed at 90&#x000b0;, the shoulder joints at 90&#x000b0;, and the trunk fixed in a standing
position, in order to strengthen the SA<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It was reported that muscle activity increased with the arms lifted by more than 90&#x000b0; during
wall slide exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonetheless, no
previous research studies have investigated the effects of a wall slide exercise performed
by patients with SDR.</p><p>Therefore, the present study conducted the wall slide exercise and the sling slide exercise
using an unstable base of support, with subjects with SDR, for four weeks, and examined how
these exercises affected the resting scapular alignment, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and
pain of the UT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects whose downward rotation angle (DRA) was less than 0&#x000b0; in alignment during scapular
rest, as determined through radiological analysis, and who had UT pain during rest for at
least four weeks, were selected to participate in this study. Subjects who had experienced
neurological disorders or severe musculoskeletal disease were excluded. The study subjects
were 22 male university students attending Daegu University in Daegu Metropolitan City,
South Korea. The subjects were fully informed of all the experimental procedures before the
experiment, and they gave their voluntary informed consent before they participated in the
experiment. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Daegu University,

radiographer conducted the radiography with postero-anterior projection (diagnostic X-ray,
LISTEM Co., Ltd., Japan). SDR was measured from radiological images of the chest using a
picture archiving and communication system (PacsPlus). The scapular DRA was calculated as
follows: DRA=angle between the vertical axis from the scapular superior angle and the medial
border<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity
pre- and post-intervention. A digital algometer was used to measure PPT pre- and
post-intervention. PPT was measured by placing the measurement catheter vertically on the
skin of the UT muscle belly area between the acromion and the 7th cervical vertebrae, and
then gradually increasing the pressure. The intra-rater reliability for the digital
algometer measurements using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was reported as
0.90<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were randomly
assigned to one of two groups. For random assignment, cards numbered from one to 22 were
placed in a sealed box and each of the subjects selected one card. When the card number was
odd, the subject was placed in the wall slide exercise group (N=11) and when the card number
was even, the subject was placed in the sling slide exercise group (N=11).</p><p>The subjects performed the specified exercise three times each week, for a total of four
weeks. The subjects performed three sets of exercises with 10 repetitions per set during the
first week of the program. During the second week, the subjects performed three sets of
exercises with 15 repetitions per set. During the third week, the subject performed three
sets of exercises with 20 repetitions per set. During the fourth week, they performed three
sets of exercises with 25 repetitions per set. The resting time between each set was two
minutes. Before performing each exercise, the subjects in both groups engaged in stretching
of the shortened downward rotators. In order to stretch the downward rotators, the subjects
assumed a quadruped position as a starting position, with the hip joints and knee joints at
90&#x000b0; of flexion, the shoulder joints at 90&#x000b0; of flexion, the elbow joints fully extended, and
the head in a neutral position. Then, the subjects further flexed the hip joints and the
shoulder joints conducting backward rocking, applying downward rotator stretching. During
stretching, the subjects maintained the last position of the backward rocking for 10
seconds, and then slowly returned to the original position. Stretching was performed for a
total of three sets, with 10 repetitions per set. The resting time between each set was two
minutes.</p><p>For the wall slide exercise, the subjects stood in front of the wall, spread both feet
shoulder width apart, flexed their shoulder and elbow joints at 90&#x000b0;, and placed the ulnar
border in contact with the wall. The subjects were instructed to slide upward while pushing
their forearms against the wall. In addition, the exercise was conducted until the shoulder
joints were maximally flexed and the trunk was maintained in a straight line without
compensatory action. At the point of maximal shoulder flexion, the subjects maintained the
position for 10 seconds, and then slowly returned to the original position.</p><p>For the sling slide exercise, the subjects stood straight with both feet spread at shoulder
width. The sling suspension point was located vertically above the shoulder joint, and the
sling height was adjusted to the height of the elbow joints. Then, with the elbow joints
flexed at 90&#x000b0;, the sling was slipped over the ulnar border and the weight was supported by
the forearms in the starting position. From the starting position, the body was brought
forward, and the exercise was conducted until the subjects&#x02019; shoulder joints reached maximal
flexion. The trunk was maintained in a straight line without compensatory action. At the
point of maximal shoulder flexion, the subjects maintained the position for 10 seconds, and
then slowly returned to the original position. In each exercise group, the scapular
alignment and PPT and pain were measured in the same way after four weeks.</p><p>SPSS version 18.0 was used for all statistical analyses. Prior to analysis, the data
normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The paired t-test was used to compare pre-
and post-intervention data within each group, and the independent t-test was used to compare
the wall slide and sling slide exercise groups. The significance level was chosen 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the within-group comparison, the wall slide exercise group showed significant

upward and downward scapular rotators<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Cools et al. reported that exercises helped strengthen weakened muscles, and stretching was
conducive to shortened muscles<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
present study, resting alignment of the scapula was measured using X-ray images. A
significant decrease in the scapular DRA at rest was found only in the group that conducted
the wall slide exercise for four weeks, and, in the between-group comparison, the wall slide
exercise group&#x02019;s DRA was significantly decreased compared to the sling slide exercise group.
This indicates that the SA muscle was strengthened through the wall slide exercise, and
stretching of the downward rotators through the quadruped position also had an effect.
Therefore, the wall slide exercise accompanied by downward rotator stretching for four weeks
recovered muscular imbalance, and is conducive to recovery of normal alignment of the
scapula. In contrast, the sling slide exercise group showed no significant difference in
alignment of the scapula after four weeks. This strongly suggests that the sling slide
exercise does not greatly contribute to SA muscle activity.</p><p>Patients with SDR complain of UT pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Andrade et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the UT
tenderness threshold of subjects with downward scapular alignment was lower than that of
those with normal scapular alignment. They demonstrated that this was because UT is in
continuous passive tension when the muscles are lengthened due to a depressed or downward
rotated scapula. In the present study, two separate groups respectively performed the wall
slide exercise and the sling slide exercise for four weeks. The PPT of UT significantly
increased in the wall slide exercise group, and in the between-group comparison, the PPT of
UT was significantly higher in the wall slide exercise group than in the sling slide
exercise group. This finding was consistent with decreased SDR, and because of stretching of
the downward rotators and strengthening of the upward rotators, downward rotation of the
scapula decreased, reducing passive tension of the UT and increasing the tenderness
threshold.</p><p>Changes in the tension of the neck and shoulder muscles resulting from SDR greatly
contribute to decreases in shoulder pain and functional disability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain in the UT area triggers continuous eccentric
contraction of the UT resulting from muscle weakening of SA, thereby contributing to
scapular upward rotation and traction of the muscles, contributing to SDR; consequently,
muscular strain may be suspected<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, the shortening of the levator scapulae muscle in subjects with SDR may trigger
severe pressure on the disc and facet joints through the cervical vertebra<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, only the wall slide
exercise group reported a significant decrease in pain after four weeks, and the wall slide
exercise group&#x02019;s pain was significantly less than that of the sling slide exercise group. It
is assumed that the pain decreased because a reduction in SDR decreased the load on the UT,
thereby decreasing muscular strain of the UT, and, as the levator scapulae muscle was
stretched, the pressure force of the disc and the spur joint decreased. Ha et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the UT pain of subjects with
SDR syndrome was decreased by passive scapular elevation performed by a therapist, which
supports the result of the present study.</p><p>The present study had a few limitations. First, the subjects with SDR were young males and
the study only included 22 participants, thus it is difficult to generalize its results.
Second, this study failed to collect and quantify kinematic data of the scapula. Third, a
4-week exercise program was conducted to evaluate the exercise treatment effects, but
long-term and periodic follow-up evaluations after the training were not taken into account.
Future research needs to study the long-term effects of the exercise treatment on subjects
with SDR, with differing age groups, taking the above limitations into consideration by
conducting follows-up on a long-term basis.</p><p>The results of this study may provide a foundation for understanding the effects of the
wall slide exercise in SDR patients. In conclusion, the wall slide exercise can be used
effectively for symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with SDR in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Reliability of measuring the passive range of shoulder
