The stress response to surgery is characterized by increased secretion of pituitary hormones and activation of the sympathetic nervous system.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The ultimate effect of these various endocrine changes is increased catabolic activity by increased secretion of catabolic hormones like cortisol and glucagon. The effect of these endocrine and metabolic changes ultimately leads to increased neoglucogenesis and hyperglycemia. So this stress response may be quantified by the incidence of hyperglycemia. The metabolic changes appear to be proportional to the severity of the surgical trauma with plasma cortisol and blood glucose concentration rising slightly during minor surgical procedures but significantly during major intraabdominal operations.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Conventionally any balanced salt solution containing sodium chloride and potassium is equally effective as maintenance fluid. But the obligatory glucose requirement of brain and red blood cells can only be met by dextrose containing solutions. In a fasting patient, if carbohydrate is not provided from extraneous source, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from amino acid pools provide the necessary glucose, but accelerate protein catabolism. Dextrose prevents protein catabolism.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In 1993 Obata <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] conducted a study to assess the potential benefits of perioperative glucose administration. They measured the plasma concentrations of insulin, free fatty acids, ketone bodies, amino acids, lactate, and pyruvate in patients undergoing partial gastrectomy. The results suggested that administration of glucose stimulated insulin secretion and resulted in accumulation of the substrates such as pyruvate and alanine which were utilized readily in the body. Glucose administration is useful in suppressing catabolism during upper abdominal surgery.</p><p>Different crystalloid fluids may also alter the blood glucose levels in intraoperative period.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Persistent hyperglycemia in the perioperative period has been consistently shown to be associated with increased postoperative complications particularly after cardiac and vascular surgery in diabetic patients. The effect of different fluid regimen has been studied in neonates and pediatric populations.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Though the prevalence of perioperative hyperglycemia in non-diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery is very high[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but its incidence in non-diabetic patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery is not yet known. The present study was undertaken to observe the effect of different maintenance fluid regimen on intraoperative blood glucose levels in non-diabetic patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY</title><p>The metabolic changes during surgery appear to be proportional to the severity of the surgical trauma. During surgery there is insulin resistance due to rise of levels of counter regulatory hormones like glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol and catecholamines which can be indirectly observed by the incidence of hyperglycemia. Different crystalloid fluids may also alter the blood glucose levels in intraoperative period.</p><p>Previous studies concluded that plasma insulin concentrations increased significantly in the group receiving 5% dextrose showing that the usual suppression of insulin during abdominal surgery can be overcome by a strong glycemic stimulus.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to observe the effect of different maintenance fluid regimen on intraoperative blood glucose levels of non-diabetic patients undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia.

The patients were temporally randomized into the two study groups. Randomization list was generated by a random number function using Microsoft Excel 2003 spreadsheet resulting in a list of 200. Group A patients received Ringer's lactate (RL) solution as maintenance fluid and Group B patients received 0.45% sodium chloride with 5% dextrose and 20 mmol/L potassium chloride, as per calculated hourly infusion rate according to their body weight. Fluid deficit arising from overnight fasting was corrected by the maintenance fluid.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Fifty percent of total deficit was corrected in the first hour and the remaining 50% was corrected in next 2 h. Blood loss and other plasma losses were approximately calculated from mops and suction drain bottle. These losses up to the transfusion threshold (blood loss up to 15% of body weight) were replaced volume per volume with Gelofusine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (succinylated polygelatin). We targeted a urine output of at least 1 ml/kg/h intraoperatively and urine output measured every 30 min. If urine output was found to be below desired target, 200 mL bolus of Gelofusine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was given over 10 min. We also maintained systolic blood pressure between 100 and 130 mm Hg. If at any point during surgery patients became hypotensive (SBP systolic blood pressure &#x0003c; 100 mm Hg), additional bolus of 200 ml Gelofusine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was administered. When the hypotension was not corrected by fluid bolus alone, 3 mg mephentermine injection was administered intravenously.</p><p>All patients were pre-medicated with 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate IV, 1 mg midazolam IV, ranitidine 50 mg IV, fentanyl 2 mcg/kg IV and ondansetron 4 mg IV 5 min prior to induction of anesthesia. Following pre-oxygenation, induction of anesthesia was done with 2 mg/kg propofol intravenously and tracheal intubation facilitated by 1 mg/kg intravenous succinylcholine. Anesthesia was maintained with 66% nitrous oxide and 1% isoflurane in 33% oxygen, on controlled ventilation. Intravenous fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg at hourly intervals was administered for intraoperative analgesia. Muscle relaxation was maintained with initial dose intravenous atracurium 0.3 mg/kg followed by 0.1 mg/kg at 30 min intervals or as clinically judged.</p><p>All patients had baseline capillary blood glucose (CBG) measured immediately prior to the start of intravenous infusion of any fluid. Thereafter, CBG levels were measured hourly till the end of surgery. Glucose concentration was determined in fresh capillary blood by reflectance photometry using an Accu-Check<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> active blood glucose monitor (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany; Unit of measure: Mg/dL, measuring range: 10-600 mg/dL or 0.56-33.6 mmol/L). If at any time during the study, CBG was found to be more than or equal to 150 mg/dL, calculated dose of human soluble insulin (=CBG/100 units) was given as IV bolus.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>We considered CBG value of 150 mg/dL as treatment initiating point because a recent analysis of the cohort found a positive correlation between the average postoperative glucose level and mortality, with the lowest mortality in patients with average postoperative blood glucose of 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>We tested all data set of this study for normality using Shapiro-Wilk Tests of Normality. Age, weight, height, (FBS) fasting blood sugar, (PPBS) post prandial blood sugar, CBG_1, CBG_2, CBG_3, CBG_5 and duration of surgery are normally distributed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

Exogenous insulin requirement to maintain normoglycemia is significantly higher in patients receiving dextrose containing solution is also significantly higher than those receiving RL solution. Percentage of hyperglycemic episodes in group B patients is also significantly higher than group A patients.</p><p>In 1983 Walsh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] studied effects of infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, Hartmann's and 5% dextrose solution on the concentrations of circulating metabolites and insulin in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. They concluded that Hartmann's solution had a similar effect on the metabolic response to 0.9% sodium chloride solution, but the use of 5% dextrose at the rate of 5 mg/kg/min was associated with an exacerbation of the hyperglycemic response to surgery. Plasma insulin concentrations increased significantly in the group receiving 5% dextrose showing that the usual suppression of insulin during abdominal surgery can be overcome by a strong glycemic stimulus.</p><p>Chin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] concluded that initiation of intravenous fluid replacement with dextrose containing solutions is not required to prevent hypoglycemia in elective surgery; however glucose administration is useful in suppressing catabolism during upper abdominal surgery.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Coupled with the metabolic response to surgical stress, intravenous dextrose infusion may in fact cause significant hyperglycemia. In 2008 Rasoul Azarfarin and Azin Alizahed Asl[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] concluded that the prevalence of severe hyperglycemia was high during (CABG) coronary artery bypass graft operation. In that study, prevalence of at least one episode of hyperglycemia (blood glucose &#x0003e; 126 mg/dL) was 95% and prevalence of severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose &#x0003e; 180 mg/dL) was 54.6%. However, they did not mention their intraoperative fluid protocol. Saringcarinkul and Kotrawera[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found a progressive increase in the blood glucose values in patients receiving 5% dextrose during surgery. They defined hyperglycemia as blood glucose greater 180 mg/dL and they excluded major surgical cases. But no patient had blood glucose values more than 180 mg/dL at any point of time. On the contrary, we have included only major surgical cases in our study. Smith <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that hyperglycemia (blood glucose &#x0003e; 144 mg/dL) occurs in 73% nondiabetic patients following renal transplant. Prasad <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that blood glucose &#x02265; 200 mg/dL was observed at least once in the perioperative period in 70% non-diabetic patients undergoing CABG surgery. The findings from the previous studies has been summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. Our observations are also corroborative with these studies.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of various studies on intraoperative hyperglycemia in nondiabetic population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-7-183-g007"/></table-wrap><p>In our study at least one episode of hyperglycemia (CBG &#x02265; 150 mg/dl) was observed in 29% patients receiving RL as maintenance fluid as opposed to 63% patients receiving 0.45% sodium chloride with 5% dextrose and 20 mmol/L potassium chloride as maintenance fluid. We also found that requirement of rescue insulin to maintain glycemic homeostasis in patients receiving dextrose as maintenance fluid during surgery was significantly higher than those who received
