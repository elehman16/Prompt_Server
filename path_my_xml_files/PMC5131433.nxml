Thus, controlling dental plaque is crucial for oral health. Mechanical plaque control by using toothbrush and dental floss is the most adopted method of supragingival plaque control. Previous studies have reported low plaque removal performance using toothbrush, failure to use interproximal cleaning aids on a daily basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and high prevalence of gingivitis among toothbrush users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. On the other hand, mechanical plaque control procedures merely focus on teeth, while gingivitis and periodontitis can develop from microbial plaque accumulated on oral soft tissue that serves as a source of bacteria to colonize tooth surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These findings suggest the need for using chemical plaque control to help in controlling dental plaque.</p><p>Chlorhexidine (CHX) is the gold standard mouthwash used for chemical plaque control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, CHX has some undesirable effects such as extrinsic staining on teeth and restorations, interfering with taste function, bitter taste, enhancing calculus formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. CHX mouthwashes containing anti-discolouration agents were reported to have no consistent beneficial effects on plaque and gingivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This encourages many researchers to find alternatives for CHX.</p><p>Traditional medicinal plants may exhibit biological activities that enhance oral health. For example, <italic>Salvadora persica L.,</italic> family<italic>: Salvadoraceae,</italic> (Sp) root extracts is well documented for its anti-bacterial effect properties against dental plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It was reported that those using chewing sticks have saliva with significant lower level of primary plaque colonizers (including <italic>Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus salivarius)</italic> as compared with those using conventional toothbrushes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to Sp, green tea (Gt), leafs of <italic>Camellia sinensis var. assamica</italic> (family<italic>: Theaceae</italic>), extracts have been reported to exhibit anti-bacterial effect against bacterial species of dental plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In an epidemiological study, Kushiyama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] concluded a modest inverse relationship between drinking one green tea cup/day and periodontal disease. Recently, brushing with dentifrice containing Gt was reported to enhance periodontal therapy outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Primary plaque colonizers play an important initial role in the development of dental plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the author&#x02019;s earlier in vitro investigation, a combination of 0.25&#x000a0;mg/ml Gt and 7.82&#x000a0;mg/ml Sp aqueous extracts was found to exhibit significant synergistic anti-bacterial and anti-adherence effects against primary plaque colonizers biofilm (<italic>S. mitis</italic>, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, and <italic>Actinomyces viscosus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, a 24&#x000a0;h plaque re-growth protocol has been used successfully in earlier clinical studies to evaluate the anti-plaque efficacy of various oral formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, a 24&#x000a0;h plaque re-growth clinical trial was conducted to confirm these preliminary in vitro results and to evaluate its impact on plaque formation. Hence, this study hypothesized that the use of 0.25&#x000a0;mg/ml Gt and 7.82&#x000a0;mg/ml Sp aqueous extracts combination mouthwash would reduce plaque levels, when compared with a placebo, over a 24&#x000a0;h period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population</title><p>This study was a 24&#x000a0;h plaque re-growth, double-blinded, randomized crossover clinical trial conducted at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya between February and June 2015.

The inclusion criteria included participants (1) aged 25&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years old; (2) in good general health and (3) with more than 20 teeth.

Interestingly, this formulated mouthwash was also able to significantly reduce plaque quantity compared to the CHX mouthwash. In the authors&#x02019; earlier in vitro study, this same combination exhibited anti-bacterial activity comparable to 12% CHX against primary plaque colonizers, i.e. <italic>S. mitis</italic>, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, and <italic>A. viscosus</italic>. It also significantly reduced the adherence of those bacteria to saliva covered glass beads which acted as tooth surfaces. When compared the anti-adherence effect of the combination with CHX, fewer primary colonizers adhered but it was statistically non-significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The initial adherence of primary colonizers to oral surfaces is important as they provide new receptors for subsequent adhesion of secondary bacterial colonizers, thus promoting plaque development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The finding suggested that the significant anti-plaque effect of the test combination was attributed, in addition to its anti-bacterial efficacy, to fewer primary colonizers&#x02019; receptors available on tooth surfaces for subsequent secondary colonizers adhesion, therefore resulting in retarded plaque development. This proposed explanation is further supported by earlier reported finding of lower salivary levels of primary colonizers among Sp chewing sticks users than toothbrush users; an effect attributed to chemical constituents of Sp such as thiocynate, sulfate, chloride, and nitrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, polyphenolic tannins were reported to inhibit salivary &#x003b1;-amylase and bind both salivary histatin and proline-rich protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recently, it was reported that rinsing with a fluoride-based mouth rinse results in a slight fluoride accumulation at the surface of the pellicle-coated enamel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Both tannins and fluoride were identified in Sp aqueous extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and they may bind salivary proteins of the pellicle covering tooth surfaces, modify the pellicle surface and therefore interfere with the adherence of primary plaque colonizers. On the other hand, gargling with Gt polyphenols, catechins, was reported to reduce intra-oral load of primary colonizers including <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, <italic>S. salivarius</italic>, <italic>S. mitis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Also, Gt was found to have an anti-adherence efficacy against oral streptococci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These findings might be due to the capability of tea polyphenols to adsorb onto acquired pellicle, subsequently modify its structure, and thus interfere with the bacterial adherence to tooth surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the authors considered variations in participants such as gender, thus opted for a crossover design in which each participant would serve as his/her own control to improve the sensitivity for detection of relative changes in plaque accumulation. No mechanical hygiene measures for 24&#x000a0;h protocol was used because the deposition of dental plaque at the gingival margin occurs on all teeth surfaces which can be clinically recognized with or without disclosing agents in less than 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Also, 24&#x000a0;h plaque reformation can be safely measured as previously done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, in an earlier in vitro study the test mouthwash was found to exhibit significant anti-bacterial and anti-adherence activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, the authors used the 24&#x000a0;h plaque re-growth protocol to confirm this in vitro result and to evaluate its impact on plaque formation using only the plaque index. Longer-term protocols, such as 4&#x000a0;days plaque re-growth design, were not been used in this study. This decision was made to avoid inappropriate evaluation of the anti-adherence effect of the test mouthwash, which is believed to be responsible for its anti-plaque effect. This is due to the fact that undisturbed plaque matures after 3&#x000a0;days of no oral hygiene measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the evaluation of the long-term effect of the test mouthwash on gingival tissue is highly recommended using a longer-term protocol and to include the gingival and bleeding indices. Absolute intra-examiner agreement, kappa value of 0.827, was achieved. This enhanced the reliability of the study in which the data was able to be measured in a reproducible manner which in turn improved the discriminative power of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Earlier relevant clinical studies have investigated the anti-plaque efficacy of Gt and Sp extracts independently. It was reported that neither commercial Sp mouthwash (Persica<sup>TM</sup>) nor its comparator placebo reduced plaque accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In contrast, Al-Bayaty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] found that rinsing with 10&#x000a0;ml of Sp extract at 100&#x000a0;mg/ml thrice a day significantly reduced plaque scores but did not reach the better effect of CHX. Recent clinical trials reported that rinsing with Gt extracts at 50 and 250&#x000a0;mg/ml significantly reduced plaque accumulation and the anti-plaque effect of both concentrations was comparable to CHX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In conclusion, both Sp and Gt extracts have anti-plaque effect which is in accordance to the current results but at much higher concentrations. The novelty of this study relies on investigating the anti-plaque effect of the combination between Gt and Sp aqueous extracts at lower concentrations than previously studied. Thus, this has the advantage of both cost effect and safety.</p><p>In this study, rinsing with the test formulated mouthwash has significantly reduced plaque scores when compared to CHX with an effect size of 1.077. The comparison was powerful (achieved power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.856). This result was not surprising as the authors&#x02019; in vitro results had revealed better synergistic anti-adherence effect of the Gt and Sp extracts combination against primary colonizers than CHX, Gt extract and Sp extract alone. Less primary colonizers biofilm adhered to glass beads treated with the combination when compared to CHX after 2&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although the difference was not significant, but this might have an effect on the plaque quantity formed after 24&#x000a0;h by providing less binding sites for the secondary plaque colonizers in vivo. On the other hand, less plaque scores were recorded after rinsing with CHX mouthwash compared to placebo with no significance difference. This may be due to small effect size of CHX achieved in this study as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. However, it may need higher sample size of participants to uncover statistical significant difference between CHX and placebo.</p><p>In this study, the test formulated mouthwash has significantly reduced supragingival plaque in healthy gingiva participants with no adverse effect detected. The succession of supragingival plaque reformation is similar for both healthy and periodontitis subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This clinical finding suggests that the anti-plaque effect could also be seen in periodontitis subjects. Therefore, the test mouthwash can be used by healthy or periodontitis subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that rinsing with 15&#x000a0;ml of 0.25&#x000a0;mg/ml Gt and 7.82&#x000a0;mg/ml Sp aqueous extracts combination twice daily can significantly reduce plaque accumulation after 24&#x000a0;h re-growth. This result supports the earlier reported anti-bacterial and anti-adherence effects of this combination which may explain its significant anti-plaque effect. The anti-plaque effect of this combination was significantly better than 0.12% CHX. So, this combination provides a natural alternative mouthwash to CHX for controlling plaque up to 24&#x000a0;h period. However, longer-term clinical studies are highly encouraged to confirm these results for longer-term, and to evaluate the effect of this combination on gingival tissue.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional files</title><p>
