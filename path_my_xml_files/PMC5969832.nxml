on the experiences and outcomes of the clinical evolution of patients. In this
sense, the number of studies in the nursing area associated with the actions of
nurses and their impact on clinical outcomes<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> has significantly increased in recent years.</p><p>However, this number of clinical trials in nursing is still incipient, mainly due to
the recent area of activity of the profession and high cost for development<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. However, it is known that it is an area with important development
potential, capable of expanding the professional clinical practice to contribute to
the improvement of health care for the population. Authors point to a predominance
of this method of study in the area of adult and female health, and a smaller number
in the health of the child, elderly, worker, and neonatology<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Regarding methods of analysis of results, there has been an investment in methods and
criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical practices in the last
decades<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> to identify the really effective procedures, with questions related to the
variability of results among participants of the same intervention and the clinical
effect of it. Besides identifying the statistically significant differences between
individuals, there is a concern to verify the significance and adaptive
functionality of the changes brought about by the intervention, which is not
necessarily guaranteed by the statistical significance<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The effectiveness of an intervention, whether educational or clinical, implies
gathering evidence on the internal validity of the interventions (degree that the
results can be attributed to the procedures used) and on social or external validity
(impact on the daily functioning of the individual, generalization for other
environments or population, cost-benefit ratio)<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In this perspective, several proposals for the analysis of the effectiveness of the
interventions, mainly directed to the investigation of the clinical significance of
the results obtained<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> appeared. Among them, there are Jacobson and Truax (JT) highlighted<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>, known as the JT Method. This method articulates the analysis of clinical
significance with the verification of the reliability of the changes obtained<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. It can be used as a complement to the analysis of statistical significance
when working exclusively with numerical scales. Also, it is considered an
alternative method when the number of subjects makes inferential statistical
analysis impossible<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Practically, the JT method proposes a comparative analysis of pre and post
intervention scores to decide if the differences between the participants represent
reliable changes and if they are clinically relevant<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, this method tries to answer two questions: did the gains of the
individual go beyond a mere oscillation (positive or negative) due to the
measurement error? What is the final condition of the individual in relation to the
scores of non-clinical reference groups? Thus, data analysis using the JT Method
implies two complementary procedures: the calculation of the reliability of the
changes that occurred between the pre-assessment and the post-intervention
evaluation, described in terms of a Reliable Change Index (RCI), and the analysis of
the clinical significance of these changes<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>

<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>This study shows the application of this method in a clinical study that evaluated
the effectiveness of a teaching program for the home care of patients submitted to
radical prostatectomy, to evaluate the operationalization and applicability of the
JT Method in nursing intervention research, from the dimensions of self-efficacy,
anxiety, psychological morbidity (anxiety plus depression), satisfaction and
knowledge.</p><p>After radical prostatectomy, patients may have different symptoms, such as fatigue,
decreased physical capacity, urinary tract infection and surgical incision, sexual
dysfunction and urinary incontinence<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. Considering these possible changes after prostatectomy, it was proposed the
elaboration of a teaching program based on nursing orientations that improve the
knowledge of these individuals about home care, for a greater capacity for
self-care, increased satisfaction with care postoperative period and decreased
psychological morbidity.</p><p>Thus, the objective of this study was to exemplify the applicability of the JT Method
in a nursing intervention study that analyzes the effectiveness of the teaching
program for home care after radical prostatectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This is a descriptive study regarding the applicability of the JT method in the data
analysis of a clinical trial.</p><p>The study was carried out in three hospitals in the interior of Minas Gerais from
January 2012 to February 2013, with patients undergoing radical prostatectomy who
had the following eligibility criteria: age above 18 years old, cognitive ability
for participation assessed at application of the mini-mental state examination<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>, locomotor, visual, auditory and self-care skills, and telephone to follow
up on the teaching program. Participants were randomly divided into two groups:
Control Group (CG) and Intervention Group (IG).</p><p>The sample size was estimated considering the expected difference between CG and IG
for self-efficacy, after treatment<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>, at a significance level of 5%, and power of 80%, resulting in 33
individuals in each group.</p><p>It was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) under protocol number 42/2011.
The clinical trial was enrolled in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials under
the number: RBR-5n95rm. All the patients who accepted to participate in the study
signed a free and informed consent term, in compliance with the legislation in force
in the country.</p><p>The intervention consisted of a teaching program for hospital discharge, elaborated
from the combination of oral orientation, writing, and telephonic reinforcement. A
booklet called &#x0201c;Guidelines for home care: Prostate Radical Surgery&#x0201d; was developed,
and a script based on the Theory of Self-efficacy<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> was developed to guide the telephone calls in clarifying doubts and
reinforcing the guidelines contained in the booklet, stimulating self-care.</p><p>The study was developed in four steps in a two-month follow-up. In T0,
sociodemographic and clinical variables, self-efficacy, anxiety, psychological
morbidity, satisfaction with post-operative care and knowledge were collected;
randomization of participants in two IG (n=34) and CG (n=34) groups; and the
beginning of the intervention with booklet delivery and oral guidance. In T1, the
first telephone call was made between the third and fifth postoperative day; and in
T2, the second telephone call was 30 days after discharge. Two months after T0, in
the second medical return, the variables self-efficacy, anxiety, psychological
morbidity, knowledge, and satisfaction in both groups were measured (T3). It should
be emphasized that the CG continued in usual hospital discharge from the health
service, without any intervention of the research.</p><p>When comparing the variables in the IG with the CG in the post-test, significant
differences between the groups for satisfaction (p &#x02264; 0.001) and knowledge (p &#x02264; 0.001
) were identified from inferential tests (parametric and non-parametric).</p><p>Thus, to verify if the dependent variables that presented statistical significance by
the inferential tests also presented clinical significance, the JT Method was used.
Based on the assumption that the JT Method is applicable for numerical scales, the
RCI and clinical significance proposed by Jacobson and Truax<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> were calculated for the knowledge variable in both IG and CG. The JT Method
was not applied to the satisfaction variable since it was only an evaluation item
with Likert type measurement.</p><p>The instrument for assessing knowledge about home care after radical prostatectomy
consisted of a questionnaire elaborated by the authors, with 23 questions with
&#x0201c;right&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;wrong&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;do not know&#x0201d; answers. The phrases correspond to the guidelines
contained in the booklet &#x0201c;Guidelines for home care: Radical Prostate Surgery&#x0201d; and
allow evaluating the knowledge that patients have about the care in the
postoperative period of radical prostatectomy. For each correct answer, a point was
assigned, totaling a maximum of 23 points. For wrong answers or do not know, there
was no punctuation. The reliability of this instrument in the studied sample
evaluated by Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was 0.71, considered as acceptable<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In order, the pre and post-test scores of each individual are required and the value
of the standard error of the difference to calculate RCI, according to the
formula<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

measuring instrument (usually Conbrach&#x02019;s alpha)</p><p>From the calculation of RCI, the following parameters are considered<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>: RCI greater than 1.96 is defined as Positive Reliable Change; RCI less than
-1.96 is Reliable Negative Change; and RCI values between -1.96 and 1.96 are defined
as Absence of Change.</p><p>Thus, any positive or negative oscillation between pre and post-test scores is
classified as a reliable change if it is sufficiently robust to overcome the
uncertainty associated with measurement errors or variability of the evaluated
object, placing it within the confidence interval for the results obtained<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>For the calculation of the cut-off point of clinical significance, the method
considers three criteria (A, B and C)<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>:</p><p>Criterion A: used when normative data are not available, being able to estimate mean
and standard deviation based on the pre-test data of the clinical sample (or
dysfunctional population) under treatment. In this case, a change is considered
clinically relevant if the difference between pre and post-test is at least two
standard deviations above the pre-test mean in the indicators of the skill being
trained.</p><p>Criterion B: used when normative data are available on the distribution of functional
population scores, a clinically relevant change is considered when the
post-intervention score shifts the individual into the functional population
distribution. That is, their post-test scores should be within the range starting at
the cut-off point represented by the mean minus two standard deviations of that
population.</p><p>Criterion C: used when normative data are available on the distribution of functional
and dysfunctional population scores; a clinically relevant change should lead the
individual, after the intervention, simultaneously out of the dysfunctional
distribution and into the functional distribution. That is, the final score of the
individual should place it above the point defined by the mean plus two standard
deviations of the dysfunctional population and above also the average minus two
standard deviations of the functional population.</p><p>For the delimitation of the confidence interval of clinical significance, the formula
for the calculation of the standard error of measurement is used:</p><p>
<disp-formula><mml:math id="e2"><mml:mtext>PC</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x000b1;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>1</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>,96</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>(DP</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x000f7;</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x0221a;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>n)</mml:mtext></mml:math></disp-formula>
</p><p>where: PC = Cut-off point calculated based on one of the criteria (A, B or C); SD =
pre-test standard deviation of the clinical population; n = Number of
participants.</p><p>The authors of the JT method<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> use a classification, based on RCI verification and clinical significance:
recovered - when met both criteria; improved - when passed RCI but not for clinical
significance; unchanged - when did not meet any of the criteria; deteriorated - when
went through the RCI in the sense of worsening.</p><p>The results of the study used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the JT method in
the analysis of an educational intervention were organized and presented from
scatterplots in which pre-test scores were plotted on the x-axis and post-test
scores on the y-axis. Also, for the interpretation of the graphs, it is necessary to
understand that the diagonal tracing called the bisector indicates that individuals
located above it had improved due to the intervention and individuals below had
worsened due to the intervention. However, for individuals located above the line or
within the confidence interval (traced below and above the bisector), no statements
of improvement or worsening can be made regarding the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From the use of the JT method in a clinical intervention study, consisting of a
teaching program in the home care of patients submitted to radical prostatectomy,
the effectiveness of its use was verified. In this study, considering the
statistical significance found in the pre-test for the post-test in the CG at the
level of the knowledge variable, the RCI and clinical significance were calculated
for this variable in both OG and CG. The pre-test standard deviation of the GI equal
to 3.5 and the GC equal to 3.2 was considered to calculate the standard error of the
difference, and the reliability of the measurement instrument (Alfa de Cronbach)
equal to 0.71, obtaining for the IG and CG the values of 2.524 and 2.322,
respectively.</p><p>Thus, when calculating the difference between pre-test and post-test divided by the
standard error of difference (2.524) for each individual, it was identified that
only two of the 34 participants (S1 and S2) did not present a reliable change for
the knowledge variable, since, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>, they were located between the above and below the bisectors, that is,
they did not improve or worsen the knowledge due to the intervention.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Reliable change index of the variable pre and post-test knowledge:

</p><p>Regarding the CG, when calculating the difference between pre-test and post-test
divided by the standard error of difference (2.322) for each individual, it was
identified that one of the 34 participants (S23) presented a reliable negative
change, most of them (n=28) were located between the traces above and below the
bisector, that is, they did not improve or worsen the knowledge, and six of the
participants (S1, S14, S26, S28, S30, S34) showed a positive change in knowledge
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Reliable change index of the variable pre-test and post-test
knowledge: control group</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="0104-1169-rlae-26-e3003-gf2"/></fig>
</p><p>Also, the mean (M=11.47) and the standard deviation (SD=3.5) of the IG in the
pre-test were considered for the calculation of the clinical significance of the
knowledge variable in the IG. From this criterion, it was considered a clinically
relevant change if the difference between the pre-assessment and the post-test
evaluation was at least two standard deviations above the pre-test mean. The cut-off
point found for clinical significance was 18.470 and the confidence interval was
1.093. Thus, in four of the 34 individuals (S1, S2, S19, S33) it was not possible to
infer that the intervention presented a clinically relevant change to the knowledge
variable, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>
<fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Clinical significance of the pre-test and post-test knowledge

</p><p>Regarding the clinical significance of the knowledge variable in the CG, the mean
(M=11.56) and the standard deviation (SD=3.2) of the CG in the pre-test were
considered, and the cut-off point was found for significance clinic of 18.000 and
the confidence interval of 1.067. Thus, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, none of the 34 CG individuals presented clinical significance
of the results related to knowledge, that is, the statistical significance
identified by the inferential tests and the positive RCI presented by six CG
individuals did not represent clinical changes knowledge level in this group.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most researchers concentrate on the result being statistically significant, that is,
it may not be the result of chance. However, just because the test shows that the
effect of treatment is statistically significant, it does not mean that the outcome
is clinically important<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. For example, if a large sample size study has a small standard error, it is
easier to find small and unimportant effects for treatment that is statistically
significant<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, when a clinical trial presents a statistically significant difference in
its variables, one should also consider whether it is clinically important and large
enough to merit a change in practice<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Thus, it was possible to answer the two questions in this study based on RCI analyzes
and clinical significance<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. In IG, only two of the 34 individuals did not have a reliable change
regarding the knowledge variable, and for only four men, it was not possible to
infer that the intervention presented clinical significance for the knowledge
variable. In CG, an individual presented a reliable negative change and most of them
did not present a reliable change. In the CG, no clinical significance was
identified for the knowledge variable in any of the individuals, that is, the
statistical significance indicated by the inferential tests did not represent a
clinically relevant change in the knowledge variable in the CG.</p><p>Therefore, it is suggested that patients with poor knowledge regarding the necessary
care at home after surgery are subject to a negative impact on their clinical
evolution, since the education of the patient has a satisfactory relation with the
reduction of the occurrence of complications, satisfaction improvement, and
increased capacity for care and quality of life<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. In the context of the patient with prostatectomy, adequate knowledge allows
the patient to be able to perform surgical wound care and the handling of the late
bladder catheter (LBC) at home, as well as to cope with physical side effects such
as urinary incontinence and the erectile dysfunction, and the consequent
psychological suffering that these effects bring to men and their caregivers<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The JT Method articulates the analysis of clinical significance (more focused on
external validity) with verification of the reliability of the changes obtained
(more related to internal validity)<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. In this study, it was very important to use it as a complement to the
analysis of statistical significance. From its application, it was possible to
reaffirm the importance of the teaching program and its clinical significance in
improving the knowledge of the 34 men who participated in the intervention, as well
as the non-clinical representativeness of this variable among the CG
participants.</p><p>In clinical trials, the internal validity is usually verified by inferential
statistical techniques based on central (mean, median) and dispersion (standard
deviation, standard error) measures of the group results. These analyses evaluate
the probability of occurrence of the pre and post-test differences if they are
sufficiently robust to discard the hypothesis of representing mere oscillations
attributable to an error of measure and to accept that there are changes,
attributable to the intervention conditions. In these designs, the external
validity, mainly in terms of generalization, depends on the sampling characteristics
of the IG or CG (how representative the sample is of the larger population).
Therefore, such tests have little information about the clinical significance of
these differences<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the literature, some clinical research that used the JT Method for the treatment
of the data in recent years were identified. There is a study highlighted that
compared the performance of the JT Method with three other alternative methods to
determine which one best measured the changes in treatment ratings for substance use
disorders<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. Another study evaluated an intervention program for hypertensive patients,
according to the variables knowledge, skills for self-care, therapeutic adherence,
coping strategies and stress management<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>, and other researchers discussed possible statistical analyses based on the
relationship between RCI and clinical significance in the context of intervention
for the improvement of speech and language disorders<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Finally, a study that verified the use of methods to quantify the clinical
significance of the change during participation in an intervention program for
alcohol and drug prevention was identified<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In education, the JT Method has also been applied. Researchers used it to assess the
progress of medical undergraduates in learning best practices and identified the
major errors made by students<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. More specifically in special education, scholars evaluated RCI and clinical
significance for the results of a group of mentally retarded adults who participated
in a program to promote social and communicative skills<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. Also in special education, the effects of a phonological remediation
program with eight regular students diagnosed with Down Syndrome<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref> were verified using the JT method.</p><p>Regarding the use of clinical significance in primary nursing studies, a review of
the literature with the objective of analyzing the advances of the topic in the
area<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> identified that in a sample of 261 quantitative studies published in 2016,
only 33 (12.6%) reported results regarding clinical significance. In some of these
33 studies, the citation of the term clinical significance was performed without
analysis basis and definition of evaluation strategy. This finding refers to the
need to prioritize investigations that discuss this type of analysis in the context
of nursing practices since statistical significance does not guarantee that the
results are clinically meaningful, that is, they may have genuine and applicable
effects on patients&#x02019; health or health care decisions<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, it is expected that the JT Method will offer sufficient advantages for its
use in clinical change assessment research, and that may eventually be used by other
Brazilian researchers, who wish to have an objective and reliable form of evaluation
of change, without disregarding the clinical relevance of the procedure.</p><p>A limitation of the study used to exemplify the JT method is the lack of validity of
the questionnaire &#x0201c;Knowledge about home care after radical prostatectomy&#x0201d; by the
factorial analysis, due to the small number of individuals that composed the sample,
being possible only the reliability analysis of the instrument by Cronbach&#x02019;s
Alpha.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>With the use of the JT method in the analysis of the data of the exemplified clinical
study and from the results found, the educational intervention carried out through
the combination of oral orientation, writing and telephone follow-up was clinically
effective in the scope of improvement knowledge about home care.</p><p>It is considered that this study contributes to the nursing science by proving the
clinical effectiveness of the proposed intervention. It is clear the relevance of
the preparation of patients for hospital discharge, mainly based on the knowledge
needs about post-surgical care involving the treatment of individuals with a
pathology such as cancer. It is imperative that the nurse carry out the planning and
implementation of educational strategies capable of strengthening the knowledge to
generate clinical impact in the reestablishment of the patient.</p><p>In the context of methodological advances, it is believed that this study also has a
contribution to future clinical trials in nursing, from the presentation and
application of the JT Method, still little known and disclosed in nursing.</p><p>It can be argued that the main differential of the JT Method is the possibility of
analyzing individual results. That is, comparing the results of each person before
and after a given intervention, even when group parameters are used for the
reliability question. Thus, it is expected that this work will contribute to
disseminate the potential of this method and stimulate researchers and professionals
for its use in clinical nursing research.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Financial sponsorship: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e
