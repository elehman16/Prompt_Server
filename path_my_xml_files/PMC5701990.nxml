Current treatment strategies struggle to curb the burden of this injury on health systems and society due to lengthy rehabilitation, work absence and reinjury risk. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous preparation that has been shown to improve the mechanobiological properties of tendons in laboratory and animal studies. The use of PRP in musculoskeletal injuries is on the increase despite the lack of adequately powered clinical studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>This is a multicentre randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of PRP in patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR). All adults with acute ATR presenting within 12 days of the injury who are to be treated non-operatively are eligible. A total of 230 consenting patients will be randomly allocated via a remote web-based service to receive PRP injection or placebo injection to the site of the injury. All participants will be blinded to the intervention and will receive standardised rehabilitation to reduce efficacy interference.</p><p>Participants will be followed up with blinded assessments of muscle&#x02013;tendon function, quality of life, pain and overall patient&#x02019;s functional goals at 4, 7, 13, 24 weeks and 24 months post-treatment. The primary outcome is the heel-rise endurance test (HRET), which will be supervised by a blinded assessor at 24 weeks. A subgroup of 16 participants in one centre will have needle biopsy under ultrasound guidance at 6 weeks. Blood and PRP will be analysed for cell count, platelet activation and growth factor concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol has been approved by the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee (Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee A, reference no 14/SC/1333). The trial will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN: 54992179, assigned 12 January 2015.

The current treatment strategies are either augmentation with surgical suture or immobilisation in a cast or boot. The mechanical and biological properties of healed tendons appear never to match those of the original intact tendons, leading to high risk of further injury (5%&#x02013;15%) or reduced function.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> Moreover, a Cochrane review reported mean ATR rehabilitation and work absence of 63&#x02013;108 days.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a derivative of the patient&#x02019;s own blood (autologous blood) that contains a supraphysiological concentration of platelets. Platelets contribute to injury healing by releasing an ordered sequence of growth factors, cytokines and an array of bioactive proteins in soluble and membrane-bound forms over the lifespan of the platelets.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> These include transforming growth factor (TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A and VEGF-C), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> These factors recruit a range of cell types, including the injured tendon&#x02019;s tenocytes, leucocytes and local stem cells, and promote the healing pathway. PRP enhances angiogenesis, stem cell homing, local cell migration, proliferation and differentiation coupled with the deposition of proteins such as collagen which plays a key role in enabling the restoration of normal tissue structure and functional proliferation of human tenocytes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p><p>PRP is prepared from autologous blood using gravitational platelet sequestration centrifugation, cell separators or selective filtration technology (plateletpheresis). Each preparation technique has been evidenced to result in significant differences in yields, concentration, purity, viability and activation status of the platelets.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Each of these variables will not only influence the eventual concentrations of the bioactive proteins but may also affect the clinical efficacy of each PRP preparation.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We selected a centrifugation technique with highly standardised preparation protocol that offers consistently viable and active PRP with a high concentration of platelets and leucocytes (leucocyte-rich PRP (L-PRP)).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>To date, there is only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that has assessed PRP in ATR, and in this study of 30 participants treated surgically, no effect of platelets on radioisometrical tendon contraction was seen<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>; the use of PRP as an adjunct to open surgical repair may have obscured any effect of PRP on healing. In a case&#x02013;control study of 12 athletes treated with PRP, positive effects at 32 months after treatment were demonstrated.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Less tendon thickening and higher concentrations of TGF-&#x003b2; and other growth factors were seen in the intervention patients, who also regained range of motion faster and returned to gentle running earlier.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Systematic reviews<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> concluded that there are encouraging signs that PRP could be developed as an effective tendon therapy, with potentially faster recovery and, possibly, a reduction in injury, with no adverse reactions described.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Both reviews emphasised the need for an adequately powered RCT to establish PRP efficacy with disease-specific outcome measures.</p><p>We describe the first multicentre RCT to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of PRP in patients with acute ATR, where adequate power and robust, validated, objective and participant-reported outcome measures will ensure successful efficacy evaluation. Our aim is to investigate if the efficacy signal for PRP identified in basic science translates to improved mechanical muscle&#x02013;tendon unit recovery in patients with acute ATR. The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRP in acute ATR in terms of mechanical muscle&#x02013;tendon function. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the clinical efficacy in terms of participant reported functional recovery, pain and quality of life; determine the key components of PRP that contribute to its mechanism of action; further understand in an immunohistochemical substudy the mechanisms of PRP which may account for its clinical efficacy and identify the histological pathways that PRP may alter to exert its effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective multicentre, participant and outcome assessor blinded randomised placebo-controlled superiority trial, which aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRP in acute ATR in terms of recovery of the tendon function. Two hundred and thirty participants will be randomised to receive a PRP or placebo injection after attending the orthopaedic or trauma outpatient clinics within 12 days of the injury in at least 18 National Health Service&#x000a0;(NHS) hospitals. Two substudies are embedded in the main study to evaluate the mechanism of action and PRP components. The substudies are: (1)&#x000a0;immunohistochemistry analysis of ultrasound-guided needle biopsies from 16 participants at one centre (Oxford) and (2)&#x000a0;whole blood and PRP component analysis in all participants. A whole blood sample will be obtained from each participant prior to intervention. In the PRP group, a small volume of PRP will be used to analyse the biological components. Blood and PRP analysis will be carried out at a central specialised laboratory (Institute of Inflammation and Ageing Laboratory at the University of Birmingham).</p><p>Through immunohistochemical, PRP and blood analysis, the potential mechanism of action will be studied to determine the key components of PRP that contribute to its effect. Linking the outcomes and the embedded laboratory analysis will allow us to evaluate the effect of variability of this biological product on the clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study participants</title><p>All patients with acute ATR attending outpatient trauma or orthopaedic clinic within 12 days of sustaining the injury are eligible for the trial if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).

Both interventions are delivered by the same technique. The patient is positioned lying face down on a treatment bed with the tendon exposed. The tendon gap is palpated clinically to identify the injection site. The area is cleaned, and 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;mL local anaesthetic is used to anaesthetise the skin only. In PRP injection group, half of the PRP is injected in the tendon gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1D</xref>), and the remaining PRP is kept for analysis. In the imitation group, the same size needle is inserted into the tendon gap, held briefly and withdrawn without injecting anything.</p><p>As this study requires a single treatment, adherence to the protocol consists of the participant receiving the allocated treatment. This will be monitored, and every instance of the participant not receiving the allocated treatment will be investigated. Unless they request to withdraw, these participants will be retained in the trial, to avoid missing data and for follow-up. However, if a participant is unable to receive a PRP injection for any technical reasons, they will receive an imitation injection, and this will be recorded.</p><p>Training in delivery of the PRP injection and the imitation injection will be provided by the trial team, and a step-by-step manual is provided to each site. Video training materials are available to site staff via an access-controlled website<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> but not supplied here because of the potential for non-blinding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Blinding procedure</title><p>It will not be possible to blind the research nurse, surgeon or extended scope physiotherapist involved in treatment preparation or delivery due to the nature of the intervention. However, the participant and the assessor for the primary outcome are blinded. The participant will be shielded from the injection preparation as this is done in another room or while the participant is waiting outside the clinic. To reduce the risk of non-blinding, participants in both intervention groups will wait for approximately 17&#x02009;min, the duration of a cycle for the PRP preparation, and not be in direct sight of the machine. If the machine is not out of earshot, a dummy cycle will be run on the machine. The participant will receive the injection while lying face down and visually obscured from the procedure. The primary outcome assessor will not be aware of allocation when they perform the HRET at 24 weeks after treatment.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Standardisation of other treatments</title><p>All participants receive standard care at the participating site. Standard treatment for the non-surgical population is usually immobilisation of the ankle in a cast, splint or boot during the initial clinic visit. Immediately after the intervention (PRP or imitation), the ankle will be immobilised in a cast, splint or boot. Standardisation of key elements of rehabilitation is required for this trial to reduce the risk of efficacy interference from substantial variation in rehabilitation. The following milestones are standardised:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>duration of initial ankle immobilisation postintervention is at least 3 weeks,</p></list-item><list-item><p>position of the foot and ankle in equinus during the initial immobilisation,</p></list-item><list-item><p>referral to physiotherapy for rehabilitation,</p></list-item><list-item><p>avoidance of rigid full-time immobilisation or non-weight-bearing for more than 6 weeks.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Standardisation will not be required for the ankle splinting method or device, when weight-bearing is commenced or the specific exercise prescription. We will standardise rehabilitation by providing guidance to surgeons and physiotherapists in written form. Monitoring adherence with these guidelines will be assessed by asking participants questions relating to progress with rehabilitation during follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Objectives and outcome measures</title><p>The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRP in acute ATR in terms of muscle&#x02013;tendon function. The primary outcome measure is work in Joules derived from the HRET, which is a validated objective measure of Achilles tendon&#x02013;muscle unit function at 24 weeks to evaluate efficacy.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Preceded with a warm-up activity of walking for 5&#x02009;min, the test is first performed on the uninjured limb and then on the injured side. The HRET involves the participant standing on one leg on a 10&#x000b0; incline box, raising the heel for maximum height and lowering the heel repeatedly at a rate of 30 raises per minute guided by a digital metronome until task failure. Vertical displacement data from the movements are obtained using a computer-controlled linear encoder (Encoder, MUSCLELAB; Ergotest Innovation AS, Porsgrunn, Norway) that measures the height of each heel-rise repetition and integrates the data into custom-made software (PATH-2, MUSCLELAB; Ergotest Innovation AS, Porsgrunn, Norway). Work (Joule) is calculated as the product of body mass (kilogram, measured on class III scales), total vertical displacement (metre) and the constant 9.807 converting kilopond-metres to Joules. We will also report the number of repetitions and maximum heel-rise height (centimetre). The performance of the injured limb for each of the three variables will be expressed relative to the uninjured limb by computing a Limb Symmetry Index (LSI)=(/)&#x000d7;100. Participants are asked to stop by the assessor if any of the following is observed: volitional stopping due to fatigue, inability to keep pace with the metronome or maintain full knee extension of the standing leg or using more than fingertip support against the wall. The assessor uses verbal prompts if the above are observed and stops the test if the participant does not respond to two consecutive prompts. The test will be standardised through providing study-specific encoder and software, HRET training manual and one-to-one training to the blinded assessor in each centre. Since the encoder is a very sensitive device, it records even minimal movements that might not correspond to actual heel rises. To dismiss potential measurement errors, two researchers (at least one being a physiotherapist) blinded to treatment allocation will independently review the videos of all assessments and discount any invalid repetition included in the HRET data. The primary and secondary outcome measures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2 T3">tables 2 and 3</xref>.</p><p>In the two substudies, the outcome measures are defined according to the substudy analysis. The whole blood and PRP component substudy includes analysing full blood cell count (red cells, platelets and white cells) in all participants in both groups and analysing PRP components in the PRP group. PRP analysis includes: cell count, platelet activation status (basal resting status and after ex vivo activation) as a measure of quality and relevant growth factor concentrations (PDGF, IGF-1, VEGF, fibroblast growth factor&#x000a0;and TGF-&#x003b2;). All blood and PRP samples will be anonymised, placed in secure biological sample transport packaging and sent via tracked courier to a central laboratory (Institute of Inflammation and Ageing Laboratory at the University of Birmingham) for analysis.</p><p>In the immunohistochemistry substudy: 16 participants in one centre (Oxford) who have given informed consent to undergo the sample collection procedure will have tendon needle biopsy under ultrasound guidance at week 6 postintervention. The patients for this substudy will be the first eight consented in each arm at the Oxford site only, and the procedure is carried out by an experienced radiologist. Analysis includes tissue morphology, proliferation, apoptosis, vascularity, metabolic indicators and stem cell marker. The tissues will be stored for future analysis of relevant markers.</p><p>Data will be collected for all participants including those who do not receive the allocated intervention, unless they have withdrawn consent for follow-up. In order to obtain as complete set of outcome data as possible, several attempts will be made to contact participants by phone for follow-up at each time point, and if they are not available, the questionnaire will be sent by post.</p><table-wrap id="T3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Secondary outcome measures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time point</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome measures</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATRS, PSFS, SF-12 (preinjury and postinjury), VAS (pretreatment) <break/>Substudy 1: blood sample (both groups), PRP analysis (PRP group)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x000a0;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Daily record of post-treatment pain using daily pain diary (VAS)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substudy 2: tendon needle biopsy under ultrasound guidance analysis <break/>(16 participants, 8 in each arm, central site)&#x000a0;Immunohistochemistry analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4, 7 and 13&#x000a0;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATRS, PSFS and SF-12 <break/>Recorded by telephone call or during outpatient visit</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24&#x000a0;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATRS, PSFS, SF-12, HRET <break/>Conducted via assessment at outpatient visit</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24&#x000a0;months</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATRS, PSFS and SF-12 <break/>recorded by telephone call</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn3"><p>ATRS,&#x000a0;Achilles Tendon Rupture Score; HRET, heel-rise endurance test; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; PSFS, Patient-Specific Functional Scale; SF-12, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey; VAS, Visual Analogue Scale.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Study flow&#x000a0;chart</title><p>The patient pathway and main study activities are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The patient pathway for the main study.

If data on the primary outcome are not normally distributed, the first approach will be data transformation, but if normality cannot be achieved, a non-parametric statistical test without adjustment will be used.</p><p>The PROMs (secondary outcomes) will be analysed in a linear mixed-effects model with longitudinal framework to allow data collected at all time&#x000a0;points to be taken into account. This is a robust procedure that deals with some missing values; however, missing data imputation will be carried out if necessary. Similarly to the primary outcome, unadjusted analysis and data transformation (if necessary) will also be performed for all continuous secondary outcomes.
