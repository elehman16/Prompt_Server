They produce a significant deterioration in patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with a considerable physical, social, psychological and economic impact and deterioration in overall health, with the consequent reduction in life expectancy. Moreover, informal caregivers of these patients are stressed by a challenging workload, which in turn provokes numerous pathologies [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PU represent the alteration of a basic need, that of maintaining the integrity of the skin. They can appear anywhere on the body, but are most common on bony prominences (the sacrum, hips and heels), and are suffered particularly by elderly patients who are immobilised with severe acute disease and a neurological deficit. A PU is a skin lesion produced secondarily to a process of ischemia. It can lead to necrosis in areas of the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous tissue and muscle where it is present, and may even affect the joints and bones. It tends to occur when the soft tissue is compressed between two planes, one of which is the bony prominence of the patient and the other, an external surface [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].The development of PU is often accompanied by vascular occlusion, due to the external pressure and by endothelial damage affecting microcirculation and the arterioles, primarily due to the effect of tangential forces, shear and friction.</p><p>The incidence and prevalence of PU are among the most representative indicators of the quality of nursing care. The prevalence data for hospitals in Spain (8.24%) [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are very similar to those for neighbouring countries such as Italy (8.3%), France (8.9%), Germany (10.2%) and Portugal (12.5%) [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and also to those of more distant countries, such as Jordan (12%) [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].The highest prevalence values reported correspond to Ireland (18.5%), Wales (26.7%) [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Belgium (21.1%), United Kingdom (21.9%), Denmark (22.7%) and Sweden (23.0%) [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With respect to the occurrence of PU in homes for the elderly, perhaps the most important study carried out is that by Park-Lee [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], who analysed the situation of nursing homes in the USA and recorded a prevalence of 11%, similar to that found in Spain. In primary healthcare, in patients receiving home care, there are no data to compare the prevalence in Spain with that in other countries because the characteristics of health care systems vary greatly from country to country. However, we do have data from the second National Survey of Prevalence of Pressure Ulcers in Spain in 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], in which the crude prevalence of PU was 3.73% and the average prevalence recorded was 9.11% &#x000b1; 10.9% for patients aged over 14 years and included in the Home Care programme; in the third such National Study, in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the crude prevalence was 5.89%. This increase reflects the aging of the population in Spain during this period.</p><p>PU currently represents a major health problem. They produce a severe economic impact and significantly increase pharmaceutical expenditure. The cost of treating PU amounts to 5% of total annual health expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and they impose a heavy burden on healthcare personnel.</p><p>The major risk factors involved in the occurrence of PU are the mechanical forces&#x02014;pressure, friction and shear&#x02014;and the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that tend to decrease tissue tolerance to these forces&#x02014;immobility, incontinence, malnutrition and reduced level of consciousness. Coleman [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] recently developed a new conceptual framework for studying PU, incorporating physiological and biomechanical components and their impact on internal tensions, together with individual susceptibility and tolerance to these changes.</p><p>PU are an indirect indicator of the quality of care. Thus, a low rate of appearance of PU is synonymous with high-quality nursing care with effective preventive measures. The assessment of risk factors, the use of support surfaces, repositioning the patient, maintaining optimal nutritional status, hydration and skin care are all valuable strategies to prevent PU [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>For skin care, the pharmaceutical industry has launched products such as oils derived from hyperoxygenated fatty acids (HOFA). Various studies [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have confirmed the effectiveness of HOFA in maintaining skin integrity and preventing the formation of PU or delaying their onset. Gallart [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported an incidence rate of 19% in the target group (preventive measures + HOFA) compared to 35% in the placebo group (preventive measures alone) (p&#x0003c;0.007), RAR = 16 (95%CI: 3.9 to 28.1), RRR = 45.7 (95%CI: 11.8 to 66.6) and NNT = 7 (95%CI: 4&#x02013;26). In another study, TorraiBou[<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]reported an incidence of PU of 7.32% in the target group (Mepentol HOFA) versus 17.37% in the placebo group (oily placebo) (p&#x0003c;0.001), with RAR = 10 (95%CI: 3.1 to 17.0), RRR = 57.9 (95%CI: 20.3 to 77.7) and NNT = 10 (95%CI: 6&#x02013;33).</p><p>One disadvantage of this treatment is its high cost, especially when prolonged treatment is needed to prevent PU. Most studies of effectiveness in the prevention of PU are performed in hospitals or closed institutions and primarily consider the use of compounds based on HOFA.</p><p>An alternative could be olive oil. This product is rich in oleic acid, has an important concentration of natural antioxidants (such as hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol), and a high resistance to oxidative processes. Olive oil has between 330 to 500 mg of polyphenolsperkilogram of fat, and under 20mEq of peroxide perkilogram of fat. It is compatible with human tissues what converts it in an ideal product for topic use[<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Consequently, we hypothesised that this alternative treatment could achieve a similar effect, with respect to preventing PU, to products based on HOFA, but at a much lower cost. To resolve this question, a non-inferiority study design is considered the most appropriate. Furthermore, there is no history of experimentation with this product for the prevention of PU in home care patients.</p><p>In summary, the aim of this study is to determine whether the use of olive oil achieves results that are not inferior to those obtained by HOFA in preventing PU in immobilised home care patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as <xref rid="pone.0122238.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122238.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Trial Design</title><p>The study design adopted was that of a non-inferiority, triple-blind, parallel, multicentre, randomised clinical trial.

The main outcome was the appearance of Stage 2 or higher PU. The accuracy of the trial with regard to the control product (HOFA) is widely supported by historical favourable results of HOVA vs a placebo [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as it is recommended by the International Conference on Harmonisation. The HOFA efficacy conditions remained intact during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Recruitment and selection</title><p>The target population were patients included in the immobilised patients programme receiving the home nursing service provided by health centres in Andalusia (Spain).The characteristics of the patients included in the study population were similar to those of the subjects examined in HOFA efficacy trials [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122238.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The following inclusion criteria were applied: patients aged over 18 years, aided by a family member or paid caregiver for treatment application; risk of impaired skin integrity according to the Braden Scale &#x02264;16, identified by a nurse, and nutritional status of &#x02264;10 according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA).</p><p>Patients were excluded if they refused to take part in the trial, if their permanent address was outside the catchment area of the corresponding health centre, or if they planned to be elsewhere during the follow-up period, if they required hospitalisation during the sampling period, if they were terminally ill or if they already had PU.</p><p>All the patients included in the trial received written and verbal information about the aims and characteristics of the study, before they gave written informed consent.

The presence/absence of PU was confirmed by inspection of the areas where the product had been applied (sacrum, hips and heels).</p><p>Variables to reflect the characteristics of patients and caregivers were included to assess socio-demographic data, such as the time registered in the care service for immobilised patients, information about previous cases of PU, comorbidities, nutritional and cognitive status, incontinence, ulcer location and availability of technical support devices (mattress or cushions to avoid bedsores, articulated beds, etc.). With respect to the caregivers, age, gender and whether he/she was a family member or paid assistant were determined.</p><p>A baseline assessment was performed on all patients at the beginning of the trial, and repeated each week, up to the conclusion of the follow-up period, or until the incidence of any PU.</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Procedure</title><p>All patients, both in the control group and in the target group, were given preventive instructions in accordance with the guidelines to clinical practice on the deterioration of skin integrity, published by the District of Primary Health Care of Malaga. The caregivers in both groups were fully trained to apply the procedure. Together with these preventive measures, the patients in the control group received two applications per day of the HOFA-based product, in the sacral area and on the hips and heels. The HOFA product used presented the CE mark, Class IIb, a higher classification than that of competing products. It was applied topically and included Equisetum Arvense, Hypericum Perforatum and perfume. The olive oil procedure consisted in applying a magistral formula, in liquid spray form, containing 97% extra-virgin olive oil and 3% Hypericum Perforatum and Peppermint. The olives used for this product is the &#x0201c;Picual&#x0201d;. This product had the same appearance as the HOFA. The target group received, as well as the preventive measures mentioned above, two applications daily of the olive-oil-based formula, to the skin areas of the sacrum, hips and heels. This applications contained 0.33 ml in each spraying (one spraying for sacrum, one for hips and one for both heels).Any appearance of PU was recorded in the weekly follow-up report, stating also whether skin integrity was maintained or not. Any adverse effects occurring during the follow-up period were reported using a purpose-designed document.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>In order to achieve a power rate of 80%, to reject the null hypothesis (H&#x02080;: that a difference between the proportions of PU in both groups was below a non-inferiority limit of 10%), by means of ordinary asymptotic analysis, taking a level of statistical significance of 5%, and assuming that the proportion of PU in both groups was 45% [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it was estimated that 612 patients would need to be recruited. Initially, we estimated a 15% withdrawal rate, but this was later raised to 25%, in view of the losses to follow up being experienced. Thus, a final sample size of 765 patients was required for a non-inferiority design where we stated a 10% absolute risk difference (from 0.1 to 10%) as the non inferiority margin (delta), to determine if the confidence interval of this absolute risk reduction included or not this delta value.</p><p>Continuous variables were summarised by mean values and the standard deviation, and the categorical variables were expressed in terms of absolute and relative frequencies. All variables were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In order to evaluate the non-inferiority or otherwise of the olive oil treatment for the prevention of PU, absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk (RR) values were estimated, and the chi square test applied, with confidence intervals of 95% in every case. In all cases, we examined whether the estimated delta value was within the confidence interval. Additionally, the T Student and the Mann-Whitney U tests were applied to determine differences in continuous variables by groups, and ANOVA was performed, with robust measures of central tendency in cases of heteroscedasticity (which was tested by the Levene test), by means of the Welch and Brown-Forsythe test. Kaplan-Meier curves were obtained and log-rank tests performed to determine the progress of the appearance of PU in both groups.</p><p>The non-inferiority analyses were carried out on both the per protocol and the intention to treat populations. The per protocol population included the subjects who completed the complete follow-up period and received the allocated target treatment, in order to force to the limit the conditions of difference between the treatments and to increase the null hypothesis rejection criteria. For the intention to treat analyses, multiple imputation was used to estimate missing data. This imputation process included five imputations for each variable estimated (incidence of any PU in the sacrum, hips or heels). SSPS 20 statistical software was used for all analyses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec015"><title>Results</title><p>The recruitment period lasted 17 months, from July 2012 to November 2013, and a total of 915 patients were recruited.

The data are also similar to those for the subjects included in studies performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of HOFA, although these took place in different environments, such as hospitals or nursing homes [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122238.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122238.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].<italic><xref rid="pone.0122238.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> Patients&#x02019; basal characteristics</italic>.</p><p>Among the caregivers, the data are comparable with those published following the study conducted in Spain by Imserso in 2004, according to which 83.6% of caregivers were women. They are also similar to the results obtained in neighbouring countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom), according to the EUROFAMCARE study, in which the proportion of female caregivers ranged from 60% to 85% [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The mean age of the caregivers in our study was 55.7 years (SD 14.40). It is noteworthy that they are not young, but 83.4% are informal caregivers and 64.4% are sons or daughters of the patients, which accounts for their age. <italic><xref rid="pone.0122238.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> Patients&#x02019; basal characteristics</italic>.</p><p>Among the patients included in the study, the mean age and sex are similar to those in a study comparing the effectiveness of two HOFA in the treatment of Stage I PU in hospitalised geriatric patients [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Most of the patients, in both groups, were at high risk of developing PU. For the present study, the subjects with this risk profile were selected in order to test whether the intervention was effective in clinical practice in the home environment. This hypothesis was confirmed, even in the relatively adverse context established. Home care patients are very fragile and dependent; they present many risk factors and require increasingly complex treatment. The goal of the primary care team is to respond to the patient&#x02019;s wish to remain at home for as long as possible, under the best possible conditions. If the development of PU can be prevented, this will increase these patients&#x02019; quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality, as well as the consumption of materials and human resources. A noteworthy outcome of this study is that it obtained equivalent results in a complex population, ensured by the inclusion criteria applied and the resulting homogeneity of the groups. <italic><xref rid="pone.0122238.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> Basal skin integrity.</italic>
</p><p>Many of the patients included were at risk of malnutrition, as reflected by the mean MNA value of less than 7. Our literature search did not reveal any study of HOFA that specifically included this parameter, despite evidence of the influence of nutrition on the development of PU reported in various studies and clinical practice guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122238.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122238.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We decided to include MNA scale because Braden scale measured is general and subjective. Malnutrition is a major risk factor and to ensure the inclusion criteria, needed to be comprehensive in measuring the nutritional status with a specific and validated scale, in this case MNA scale.</p><p>Regarding physical activity, almost half of the patients in both groups spent most of their time in bed or seated, and were thus subject to forces of pressure, friction and shear, placing them at high risk of developing PU. A study comparing the effectiveness of two different HOFA in preventing Stage 1 PU reported similar results in this respect, with 69.4% and 75% of patients restricted to a prone and/or seated posture [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Over half of the patients, in both groups, suffered cognitive impairment, and made high use of absorbent products for incontinence; both are risk factors, which in addition to the others mentioned above, predispose these subjects to the development of ulcers [<xref rid="pone.0122238.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Only one adverse effect (and this was slight) was recorded among the olive oil treatment group, and so the product is considered safe for topical application to intact skin. It was only possible to compare these results with HOFA studies conducted in hospitals or nursing homes, because our literature search did not obtain any randomised clinical equivalence trials studying the use of olive oil to prevent PU in the home care environment.</p><p>With respect to external validity and applicability in clinical practice, the results of this study support the widespread use of the olive oil formula (non-oxygenated fatty acids) in the prevention of PU in primary care, and by extension in hospitals, as the patients studied are very similar to those treated in hospitals and nursing homes. It should be stressed that the cost of treating PU represents a major outlay for the health system and for society in general and also increases the burden of care on caregivers, requiring considerable time, materials and resources. The lower cost of the product makes it more accessible to the population in general and to the healthcare system, and offers a viable alternative to standard HOFA treatment, promising a significant reduction in pharmaceutical expenditure and alleviating the burdens placed on health care personnel and caregivers, by reducing the incidence of PU. <italic><xref rid="pone.0122238.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> Incidence of PU at the end of the follow-up and results of the per protocol and intention to treat analyses.</italic>
</p><p>Further studies should be conducted to investigate the action mechanism by which olive oil contributes to preventing PU and to determine the pathogenesis of PU, with respect to factors such as friction and shear forces, capillary circulation and microvascular, histological and molecular changes.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Limitations</title><p>Analysis of the study sample losses to follow up showed there were no significant differences in this respect between the groups, and so they are unlikely to be caused by the characteristics of the intervention. The mode of application of the product is very simple, but to avoid variability in the application (and thus potential bias)&#x02014;a possibility under real conditions due to the high number of participants, with no specific instruction in the use of the product&#x02014;the nurses collaborating with the study gave the caregivers training in this respect. Moreover, all were given an instruction sheet and an explanatory video, thus ensuring consistent use of the product by all participants. Conditions were also controlled by masking the product and randomising its use among the technical personnel involved.</p><p>To avoid the heterogeneity within the groups and the risk of obtaining a very low or zero incidence of PU, patients at low risk of developing this condition were excluded. In our opinion, the effect of the new product on this population would improve their skin quality, but we would be unable to determine whether the low incidence of PU was the result of application of the product, or of the absence of risk. This control of the internal validity of the study is a limitation as regards applicability of the product among low-risk patients, as none were included in the study.</p><p>Patients who were admitted to hospital during the follow-up period were excluded from the study. This was done in order to avoid contamination regarding application of the product, because when such a situation occurs, physicians could apply the products available in the hospital, which would probably be different from those assigned according to the study protocol. Further studies are needed to consider the effectiveness of this product in acutely hospitalised patients, because although such patients are similar to those included in the HOFA studies, it is necessary to clarify whether the caregiving environment and the specific care provided influences the outcome.</p><p>We used the Braden Scale for assessment of the risk for skin break down and the Mini Nutritional Assessment for assessment of nutritional status. But we only measure these ones at the beginning of our study, because we believe that patients studied did not change significantly the results of these scales in only 16 weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122238.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol Translate.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0122238.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122238.s002"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0122238.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122238.s003"><label>S1 Informed Consent</label><caption><title>Informed Consent.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0122238.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This trial was made possible through the cooperation and support of the nurses who voluntarily participated in the trial and that of the nursing managers of the Primary Healthcare Districts who assisted in coordinating this trial.</p><p>On behalf of the CAO-UPP study, we express special thanks to: Francisco Martin-Santos (Malaga&#x02014;Valle del Guadalhorce Healthcare District), Eugenio Contreras-Fernandez (Costa del Sol Healthcare District) Ana de Irigoyen-Diaz (Bah&#x000ed;a de Cadiz-La Janda Healthcare District, C&#x000e1;diz), Ceferino Prieto-Garcia (Campo de Gibraltar Healthcare Management Area) and Rosario Ort&#x000ed;z Castro (Sevilla Healthcare District), Francisco Manuel Peregrina-Palomares (Granada Metropolitano Healthcare District), Carmen Martinez-Pascual (Axarquia Healthcare Management Area) who facilitated the implementation of the study in their respective districts.
