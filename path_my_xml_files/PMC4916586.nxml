For child health, childcare services are required to provide foods to children consistent with nutrition guidelines. Research suggests that foods and beverages provided by services to children are often inconsistent with nutrition guidelines. The primary aim of this study is to assess, relative to a usual care control group, the effectiveness of a multistrategy childcare-based intervention in improving compliance with nutrition guidelines in long day care services.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study will employ a parallel group randomised controlled trial design. A sample of 58 long day care services that provide all meals (typically includes 1 main and 2 mid-meals) to children while they are in care, in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia, will be randomly allocated to a 6-month intervention to support implementation of nutrition guidelines or a usual care control group in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention was designed to overcome barriers to the implementation of nutrition guidelines assessed using the theoretical domains framework. Intervention strategies will include the provision of staff training and resources, audit and feedback, ongoing support and securing executive support. The primary outcome of the trial will be the change in the proportion of long day care services that have a 2-week menu compliant with childcare nutrition guidelines, measured by comprehensive menu assessments. As a secondary outcome, child dietary intake while in care will also be assessed. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, the measures will be undertaken at baseline and &#x0223c;6&#x02005;months postbaseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee.

In 2010, the Global Burden of Disease study reported that over 11 million deaths worldwide were due to dietary risk factors alone.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Of these deaths, 4.9 million were linked to low fruit intake, 1.7 million to low vegetable intake and 3.1 million to a high sodium intake.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Australia, &#x0223c;23% of total mortality and 11% of disability-adjusted life years during 2010 were attributable to dietary risk factors.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Dietary patterns and food preferences developed in childhood track into adulthood and influence the risk of future chronic disease.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Developing healthy eating patterns in childhood is therefore recommended by the WHO and governments internationally as a key chronic disease prevention strategy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Childcare services represent an opportune setting to improve the dietary intake of children as they provide access to a large number of children for prolonged periods of time at a critical stage of development.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Further, systematic review evidence suggests that improving the childcare nutrition environment can improve dietary and health outcomes for children.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>It is recommended that childcare services provide foods to children consistent with dietary guidelines.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> International research, however, suggests that foods and beverages provided by services to children are often inconsistent with guideline recommendations. A study conducted in the UK audited 118 nursery menus and found that none adhered to nutrition guidelines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Similarly in Australia, 46 long day care service menus were reviewed and none provided adequate serves of vegetables consistent with the guidelines.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Childcare services report a number of barriers to complying with nutrition guidelines, including limited professional development opportunities, lack of practical resources, lack of time and inadequate support from management and colleagues.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Childcare services in Australia do not receive a subsidy from the government for the provision of meals that comply with the nutrition guidelines. For childcare services in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the current nutrition recommendations are outlined in the Caring for Children resource which has been publicly available online since October 2014.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The resource was developed by the NSW Ministry of Health to assist childcare services to provide food that is consistent with the sector-specific nutrition guidelines. The content is based on experience in the field and consultation with childcare service representatives and outlines best practice guidelines on healthy eating and nutrition for the childcare setting. The resource provides guidance on menu planning and the number of serves of foods that need to be provided on a service menu to be compliant with guidelines. In NSW assessment and compliance officers, who regulate service accreditation, use the Caring for Children resource as a benchmark for determining if services meet accreditation standards in relation to the provision of healthy food and drinks to children while in care.</p><p>If the health benefits of nutrition guidelines for the childcare sector are to be realised, interventions to support services to overcome barriers to routine implementation are required. The few trials that have been conducted to assess how to best support the implementation of nutrition guidelines in childcare services report mixed results on implementation outcomes, providing a limited evidence base for efforts to improve implementation of nutrition guidelines and practices in this setting.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;20</xref> In addition, the majority of these trials do not explicitly report applying an implementation framework to guide intervention development and strategy selection.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Nonetheless, existing findings from these trials suggest that strategies such as resource provision, performance monitoring and feedback, ongoing support and professional development opportunities for service cooks and service managers may be effective in changing food provision in line with nutrition guidelines.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;21</xref> Furthermore, it is suggested that strategies to increase childcare staff awareness of the nutrition guidelines may also be effective in improving compliance with nutrition guidelines in the setting.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>While a number of non-randomised trials have assessed the impact of changing food provision in line with nutrition guidelines on child dietary intake, to the best of our knowledge no randomised trials of such interventions have been undertaken.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> Such trials are required to better assess the health impact of such implementation strategies on child health.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study aim</title><p>Given the limitations of the existing evidence base, the primary aim of the study is to assess, relative to usual care, the effectiveness of a multistrategy childcare-based intervention in improving the compliance with nutrition guidelines in long day care services. As a secondary aim, the impact on child dietary intake during the hours attending care will also be assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>The study will employ a randomised controlled trial design. Fifty-eight long day care services will be allocated to receive either the multicomponent intervention to support nutrition guideline implementation or a usual care control group. Service compliance with nutrition guidelines regarding food provision will be assessed by menu assessments undertaken by a dietitian blind to group allocation at baseline and at &#x0223c;6&#x02005;months following baseline data collection. Child dietary intake will be assessed by aggregate plate waste measures and educator-completed child food intake questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Setting</title><p>The study will take place across one local health district of NSW, Australia (Hunter New England). The Australian Statistical Geography Standard describes the region as encompassing non-metropolitan &#x02018;major cities&#x02019; and &#x02018;inner regional&#x02019; areas.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Over 840&#x02005;000 people reside in the area, of which &#x0223c;33&#x02005;300 are aged 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> There are currently 368 childcare services in the study region, of which 107 are long day care services which prepare and provide food onsite to children while in care. A subsample of 58 services will be invited to participate in this trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample</title><p>To be eligible to participate in the trial, long day care services must prepare and provide one main meal and two mid-meals to children while they are in care, and be open for at least 8&#x02005;hours per day. Services that do not prepare and provide meals to children onsite or do not have a cook with some responsibility for menu planning will be excluded from the study. Further, services catering exclusively for children requiring specialist care will be excluded, as will mobile preschools and family day care centres given the different operational characteristics, and therefore intervention requirements of these services relative to permanent centre-based care services.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p>A list of all long day care services in the study region will be supplied by the NSW Ministry of Health and serve as the sampling frame. Service managers will be mailed recruitment letters &#x0223c;1&#x02005;week prior to recruitment, informing them of the study and inviting participation. A research assistant will contact services to confirm eligibility and invite participation. The order at which services will be approached to participate in the study will be randomised using a random number function in Microsoft Excel. Consent will be obtained through the service manager via the return of the service's current 2-week menu. Study recruitment will continue until the required sample is achieved. To assess secondary outcome measures, a nested evaluation will be undertaken in a randomly selected subsample of 34 participating services located in the Hunter region. For such services, managers will also be asked if they consent to participate in a site visit to assess child dietary intake via plate waste. Services will be asked to return consent forms if they choose to participate in the site visits. To maximise study participation, a dedicated recruitment coordinator will make multiple attempts to contact services at times convenient to the centre.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The theoretical domains framework is an integrative theoretical framework developed for behavioural research and incorporates 33 theories of behaviour change. The framework includes the following health behaviour change domains: knowledge; skills; social/professional role and identity; beliefs about capabilities; optimism; beliefs about consequences; reinforcement; intentions; goals; memory, attention and decision processes; environmental context and resources; social influences; behavioural regulation.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The framework has previously been used to design effective interventions to improve guideline implementation in clinical settings.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Further information about the domain definitions and constructs is reported by Cane <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The theoretical domains framework was chosen by the research team as it has been empirically validated, successfully applied in numerous healthcare settings and covers &#x0223c;95% of constructs targeting behaviour change.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;38</xref></p><p>The theoretical domains framework was used to assess the potential behavioural determinants of the implementation of nutrition guidelines in childcare services, and inform selection of intervention strategies to influence these.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Specifically, literature reviews of previous implementation interventions targeting food provision in childcare and semistructured interviews with service cooks (n=7) using a modified theoretical domains framework questionnaire were undertaken, to identify the relevant domains in the framework that may influence (enable or impede) guideline implementation.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The findings of the interviews were supplemented with on-site observations of food service practices and menu planning processes. On the basis of findings of the literature review, the interviews and the observations, a matrix developed by Michie <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> was applied to map potential behaviour change techniques (implementation strategies) to the relevant theoretical domains (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010786TB1">table 1</xref> for more detail). The implementation strategies to include in the intervention were selected on the basis of the mapping process and evidence of effect in changing behaviours; with consideration of contextual factors, programme resources and following further consultation with health promotion practitioners, childcare service managers and service cooks.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015010786TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Identified domains from quantitative and qualitative interviews, intervention content and delivery of intervention strategies</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Identified domain</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention content</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strategy</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Knowledge</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The menu planning workshop will attempt to address the service managers and cooks awareness of the sector specific nutrition guidelines, the AGHE food groups and the daily recommended serves per child to be provided while in care.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The menu planning workshop</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The menu planning workshop will introduce the Caring for Children resource, which outlines the sector-specific nutrition guidelines.

Leftover food items (including any food items found on the floor) will be similarly separated into food groups, placed in labelled waste tubs and weighed to determine the leftover mass. Mixed meals will again be weighed as a total mass. The research assistants will be responsible for grouping the leftover food items.

The strengths of this trial include its randomised design, the use of the theoretical domains framework to guide intervention strategy selection to target barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the childcare nutrition guidelines and rigorous assessment of primary and secondary outcome measures. This trial will provide strong evidence to advance implementation research in this setting and allow assessment of the impact on child diet. This randomised controlled trial is the first in the childcare setting to assess the impact of improving guideline implementation on child dietary intake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper describes the design; delivery and evaluation of a randomised trial to support childcare services&#x02019; implementation of nutrition guidelines. The proposed trial addresses a gap in the literature by applying implementation theory to inform the design and development of an intervention to improve childcare centres&#x02019; implementation of nutrition guidelines. The trial will be the first national randomised trial of its type and is likely to represent a substantial contribution to the literature in this field.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank members of the Good for Kids, Good for Life Early Childhood Education and Care advisory group.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KS led the development of this manuscript.
