The parents of children with ADHD report higher levels of stress and show more negative parenting behavior. Medication and behavior training are evidence-based treatments, but both show significant limitations. In short, medical treatment is not suitable for preschool children and would suppress growth, whereas parents under stress may not be capable of consistently applying behavior management skills. Mindfulness training can improve attention and facilitate cognitive development and overall functioning. It has been widely adopted as a treatment option in health care, but its application in a family context is limited. In this context, a family-based mindfulness intervention (FBMI) has been developed to promote the attention and mental health of children with attention symptoms and to reduce the stress experienced by their parents. This article describes the design and conduct of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A multicenter, 8-week, waitlist, randomized controlled trial of FBMI is currently being conducted in Hong Kong (from mid-2015 to mid-2016). Its effectiveness will be examined by comparing the participants who receive treatment to those in a waitlist control group. The study population consists of one hundred twenty children with ADHD, or with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, between 5 and 7&#x000a0;years of age and their parents. To be included in the study, the children are required to meet or exceed the borderline cutoff score of the Chinese version of the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behaviors Rating Scale (SWAN-C). The primary outcome measures are the children&#x02019;s ADHD symptoms and behavior and the parents&#x02019; stress. The secondary outcome measures include the children&#x02019;s overall behavioral problems and performance on the Attention Network Test, the parents&#x02019; ADHD symptoms, the parents&#x02019; mindful parenting scores, and heart rate variability of parents.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is probably the first randomized controlled trial of FBMI for young children and their caregivers. A rigorous design and multiple outcome measures are used to examine the effectiveness of FBMI. If the hypotheses are confirmed, FBMI may serve as an additional treatment option for children with ADHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (reference number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=12290">ChiCTR-IOR-15007292</ext-link>).

The prevalence of ADHD is between 1.5&#x000a0;% and 8&#x000a0;%, depending on the diagnostic criteria used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A study in Hong Kong estimated that 3.9&#x000a0;% of adolescents had received a diagnosis of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More children in the community have reported problems of inattention, and studies have found an association between children with subclinical attention problems and problems with peer relationships and negative parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Most children with ADHD have significant impairment of their executive functions (EFs). They show consistently worse performance on EF tasks than their typically developing counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. EFs are a set of fundamental mental processes associated with the use of higher cognitive abilities that contribute to overall neuropsychological functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The core EFs are cognitive flexibility, inhibition (self-control, self-regulation), working memory, problem-solving, reasoning, and planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. When children exhibit EF deficits, they have greater difficulty moderating their behavior and show problems in working memory recall; self-regulation of mood, motivation, and arousal; internalization of verbal communication; and reconstitution of language and motor behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, EFs are more important than intelligence quotient for school readiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Children with less self-control (less persistence, more impulsivity, and poorer attention regulation) between 3 and 11&#x000a0;years of age tend to have worse health, earn less, and commit more crimes 30&#x000a0;years later than those with better self-control as children, after controlling for intelligence quotient, gender, social class, and other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>ADHD is also associated with disturbances in the family and poorer parenting practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The parents of children with ADHD report less marital satisfaction and more conflict than those of children without ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Challenging child behavior evokes harsh parenting, which is defined by intense hostility and negative emotionality and is hypothesized to influence the development of oppositional and conduct problems via a process of mutual reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The parents of children with ADHD report higher levels of stress, lower levels of social support and quality of life, and less parenting satisfaction than parents of children without ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In view of the reciprocal and dynamic interactions between children with ADHD and their parents, the treatment of ADHD should consider the promotion of calm and consistent discipline and emotional responsiveness in parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Currently, evidence-based treatment for ADHD focuses predominately on the use of medication and behavior therapy, but both options have limitations. Although the use of stimulant medications is generally considered to be evidence-based practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the sustained use of stimulants over time is associated with growth suppression and may induce deleterious side effects that are untenable for many individuals, and thus it should not be preferable for young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The parents of children with ADHD may learn parenting skills from behavior therapy; however, when they are under stress or have their own psychopathology, they may not be able to properly carry out parenting skills, and may feel frustrated and negatively reinforce parent&#x02013;child conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A family-based intervention would be advantageous because both children and their parents could benefit from improvement of attention and emotional management.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mindfulness and its potential application in children and in a familial context</title><p>Mindfulness training has been shown to be an effective tool with which to enhance the self-regulation of attention in individuals with ADHD, in conjunction with other evidence-based treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Mindfulness training is expected to improve attention in three aspects: orienting attention, alerting attention, and executive attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Orienting attention concerns the use of all available sensory inputs in the perceptual field to direct and select situation-appropriate information. Alerting attention refers to sustaining attention by achieving and maintaining a vigilant state. Executive attention involves examining, monitoring, and resolving conflicts among one&#x02019;s ongoing behavioral reactions to the immediate environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Mindfulness training may improve the ability to strengthen attentional processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; it not only promotes the EFs of children with ADHD, but also improves parents&#x02019; self-regulation in response to their child&#x02019;s challenging behavior and alters the dysfunctional patterns in their parenting behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Evidence of mindfulness-based intervention is emerging, specifically for families with children with ADHD. A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was conducted in 25 children between 9 and 13&#x000a0;years of age who had a mixture of attention problems and ADHD diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The children showed significantly fewer attention-related problems after the intervention. A mindfulness-based curriculum developed for 409 children from kindergarten to sixth grade from low-income families and ethnic minorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] resulted in improvements in classroom behavior, including attention, self-control, and caring for others. However, no control group was used, and the effects on the children&#x02019;s other developmental aspects remain unclear. The results of an 8-week mindfulness training course conducted in 22 children between 8 and 12&#x000a0;years of age with ADHD and their parents indicated significant reductions in the children&#x02019;s ADHD symptoms and in their parents&#x02019; inattention and hyperactivity symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In a study of the same program in 10 adolescents aged 11 to 15 with ADHD and their parents, the adolescents, parents, and tutors all reported improvements in attention and behavioral problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Overall, the results are positive but three of four studies were based on small samples, and except the first study, only a simple pretest-posttest comparison design was adopted for outcome evaluation.</p><p>There is increasing evidence for the application of mindfulness-based interventions in Chinese populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, this project is one of the earliest attempts to apply mindfulness training in children and families, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies of mindfulness training in parents and young children have been published. With reference to the above overseas studies, mindfulness-based interventions for children with ADHD and their parents may be acceptable and feasible, but the published studies have numerous methodological limitations, including small or heterogeneous samples and uncontrolled or nonrandomized designs. Some studies did not involve parents, and most studies involved children above 8&#x000a0;years old, but not young children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The objectives of the project are (1) to reduce the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity of children with ADHD; (2) to reduce the stress of parents; and (3) to examine the effectiveness of family-based mindfulness intervention (FBMI) in Chinese families of children with ADHD or with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity.

HRV is interpreted with the frequency-domain method according to the guidelines for the standard measurement and interpretation of HRV developed by a task force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The indices of frequency-domain analysis include very-low-frequency (VLF), low-frequency (LF), and high-frequency (HF) in absolute values of power (ms2) and normalized units by using Kubios HRV (version 2.2) software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS)</title><p>The ASRS is used to assess parent inattention and hyperactivity symptoms.

The Chinese version of this scale has been validated in a sample from Taiwan which showed high intraclass correlations between 0.80 and 0.85, and internal consistency with Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.83 to 0.91 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Interpersonal mindfulness in parenting (IM-P)</title><p>The IM-P scale includes 31 items that assess the parent&#x02019;s quality of mindfulness specific to his or her family context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The original subscales include listening with full attention, emotional awareness of self and child, self-regulation in the parenting relationship, nonjudgmental acceptance of self and child, and compassion for self and child. The inter-item coefficient ranged from 0.45 to 0.72. The scale validation study in parents with preschool children in Hong Kong has been conducted by the first author (Lo HHM, Yeung JWK, Chan SKC, Ma Y, Siu AFY, Szeto MP, et al.

The baseline factors include the age of the children and the parents, the sex of the children and the parents, the children&#x02019;s medication status, and the SWAN scores. The effects of FBMI will be tested by analysis of covariance, comparing the FBMI group (arm 1) to the wait-list control group (arm 2). All analyses will be carried out according to the intention-to-treat approach. The participants&#x02019; missing values will be imputed using the last-observation-carried-forward method. A two-sided <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 or less will be considered be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Estimation of sample size</title><p>Because no studies of FBMI have been performed in the families of young children with ADHD, and because the effect sizes of studies of psychosocial treatments vary, the research team adopted an estimated effect size of 0.6 for changes in child attention and behavior. Based on a one-sided type I error of 5&#x000a0;% and 80&#x000a0;% power to detect statistically significant differences between the FBMI and wait-list control groups, the required sample size per arm is 45. Considering an attrition rate of 15&#x000a0;%, more than one hundred six families should be recruited for the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although ADHD is one of the most common mental disorders in early childhood, existing treatments have limitations, and the families of children with ADHD experience high levels of stress that create a great burden to school systems and the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

The search for effective treatments to improve the functioning and quality of life of families of children with ADHD should be a priority in the mental health care and education sectors.</p><p>We are conducting the first randomized controlled trial of FBMI in Chinese families that contains multiple outcome measures with biomarkers and child attention test. The study includes multiple sites and recruits one hundred twenty families, based on an estimation of the expected effect size. Successful completion of this study and confirmation of the hypotheses will contribute to the evidence base regarding FBMI and treatment options to ADHD. The application of FBMI may also be considered for children with other clinical problems, such as autism spectrum disorder, severe behavioral problems, conduct disorders, depression, and anxiety. Further studies should also consider a 6-month or 1-year follow-up period to verify the sustainability of the treatment effects. Treatment designs that can compare the effects and costs of medication, behavior training, and other methods will be the next step in investigating the efficacy of FBMI.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HHML is the principal investigator of this study.
