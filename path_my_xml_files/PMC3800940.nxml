Hair plays very vital role in our beauty. A human body without hair would be seen just as a tree without leaves. So everyone has an ambition that his/her hair should be long, black and thick. In Ayurveda there are many synonyms for Hair loss as Inderlupta, KhaIitya, rujya etc. Indralupta is a unique, idiopathic, non-cictricial, non-inflammatory alopecia, presents as discoid areas of hair loss.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>Therapeutic assessment of lepa of sodhita langalimoola was carried out on the patient of Indralupta. Lepa of the fine powder of langali moola was made with madhu. External application was done twice a day for a period of 60 days. Selection of Cases Source: For the present study, patients with Indralupta were screened out from OPD &#x00026; IPD of NIA, Jaipur. Number of cases: 30 Patients were registered from OPD &#x00026; IPD of NIA Jaipur. Grouping of Patients: Selected patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A: This group of 15 patients was treated with Gomutra sodhit Langali moola with honey for external application. Group B: This group of 15 patients was treated with Godugdha sodhit Langali moola with honey for external application.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result :</title><p>It was observed that after 60 days of treatment with Gomutrashodhit Langlimool in Group A there was reduction in Hair fall which is statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and highly significant improvement was observed in reducing dandruff.(<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).
