Subjects were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single treatment (0.1&#x02009;mL injected into each of 5 target sites in the glabellar region) of either DWP-450 (total of 20&#x02009;U, administered as 4&#x02009;U/0.1&#x02009;mL) or Placebo (0.9% saline). Subjects were then followed for 150 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects classified as responders on Day 30. This was a composite endpoint based on both the Investigator and subject&#x02019;s assessments of glabellar lines at maximum frown on the GLS; a subject was a responder only if both independently agreed that a &#x02265;2 point improvement had occurred from Day 0 to Day 30. Safety was evaluated throughout the study.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> 330 subjects participated in the EV-001 study; 324 participated in EV-002.</p><p>For the primary efficacy endpoint, in EV-001 and EV-002 the percentages of responders in each of the Placebo and DWP-450 groups were 1.2% and 67.5%, and 1.3% and 70.4% respectively; the absolute difference between groups was 66.3% (p&#x0003c;0.001) and 69.1%(p&#x0003c;0.001) respectively.</p><p>Also at Day 30, as assessed by the Investigator using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, in EV-001 and EV-002 the proportion of responders was 95.8% and 92.9% respectively.</p><p>In total, for each of EV-001 and EV-002: 38.2% of DWP-450 subjects and 32.1% of Placebo subjects, and 28.5% of DWP-450 subjects and 26.9% of Placebo subjects respectively, experienced one or more adverse events.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> The results of these two parallel US phase III studies successfully met the predefined primary endpoint.</p></body></article>
