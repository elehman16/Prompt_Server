Anti-TNF therapy, either alone or in combination with MTX (apart from infliximab, which should only be used in combination with MTX), is recommended in patients with active RA with inadequate response to MTX or another disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or combination of DMARDs or another anti-TNF agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These new methods of treatment are expected to yield not only the alleviation of disease activity, but also structural improvement of the affected joints and improvement in daily life for patients. The three most widely used anti-TNF agents in Japan are infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, and numerous reports have been published on these agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Golimumab (GLM), a new human anti-TNF antibody agent created using transgenic mice, has been shown to exert effectiveness comparable to that of existing anti-TNF antibody agents when injected subcutaneously at 4-week intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This drug was introduced in Japan in September 2011, thus providing a new treatment option for Japanese patients with RA. GLM can be administered either as monotherapy at a dosage of 100&#x000a0;mg or in combination with MTX at dosages of 50 or 100&#x000a0;mg every 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is indicated not only in patients who have not previously received treatment with biological agents but also in patients who have experienced difficulties with infliximab or adalimumab therapy; for example, problems with neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>In Japan, there have been no published reports on the use of GLM in clinical practice to date. When patients are enrolled into clinical studies, age and disease activity are often taken into account to ensure safety and continued use of the investigational agent, so the populations studied differ from the population managed in real life. Therefore, this analysis evaluates the use of GLM in patients with RA receiving real-life clinical care at our clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>This retrospective analysis included patients with baseline moderate-to-high disease activity according to a 28-joint disease activity score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) &#x0003e;3.2 despite treatment with MTX or another biological agent.

This is lower than the current recommended MTX dose in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and lower than the MTX dose used in combination with GLM in other published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite the low doses of MTX used, overall remission rates with GLM were high. Evidence suggests that, for patients receiving MTX who fail to achieve clinical remission based on SDAI or disease activity score scales, increasing the MTX dose needs to be considered at this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the GO-FORWARD study, GLM was shown to be effective in patients who showed lower responses or who were refractory to prior MTX therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the present retrospective analysis, manifestation of effectiveness appeared to be delayed in the bio-switching group compared with the bio-na&#x000ef;ve group, suggesting the necessity for longer follow-up when evaluating effectiveness in patients who switch between biological therapies.</p><p>In a post-hoc analysis of the effectiveness in relation to the reasons for switching, the effectiveness did not differ significantly according to the reason (data not shown). This suggests that patients undergoing switching will respond to this therapy, regardless of the reasons for switching. This supports findings by Smolen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] that switching from other anti-TNF agents to GLM was effective regardless of the reasons for switching, indicating that GLM can serve as the second anti-TNF agent when patients are switched from another TNF agent. Of the five anti-TNF agents available, including certolizumab pegol, all have different affinities to TNF-&#x003b1;; therefore, switching from one anti-TNF agent to another is likely to be effective.</p><p>Expression of antibodies to anti-TNF antibody agents such as infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol monotherapy is not uncommon; however, incidences of anti-GLM antibodies in the GO-FORWARD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and GO-FORTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] studies were remarkably low. Because GLM is prepared by the transgenic mouse technique, it is an antibody with high affinity for the antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which means that formation of unstable proteins or aggregations, which can serve as immunogens, is unlikely. Studies of GLM (100&#x000a0;mg) monotherapy were conducted in Caucasian and South American countries in GO-FORWARD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and in Japan in GO-FORTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and GO-MONO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and showed that GLM is an appropriate biological agent for preventing the loss of effectiveness in Caucasian, South American, and Japanese populations receiving long-term RA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As a result of findings from the GO-FORTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and GO-MONO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] studies, in addition to the 50-mg dose, GLM (100&#x000a0;mg) every 4&#x000a0;weeks&#x02014;as monotherapy and in combination with MTX&#x02014;has been approved in Japan. Further studies at this dose level in larger numbers of patients are necessary.</p><p>Apart from the usual limitations relating to observational data and retrospective analyses, particularly with regard to selection and enrolment bias, a major limitation of our analysis is the small patient numbers, especially for patients receiving GLM (100&#x000a0;mg) monotherapy. In addition, evaluation of levels of anti-GLM antibodies and the effects of GLM on structural joint damage in this real-life setting would have been useful; however, this was not evaluated in the original study.</p><p>Despite suppression of joint destruction being an important factor in improving the quality of life of patients with RA, the number of published reports evaluating this effect in patients treated with GLM is small, because of its relatively recent development. Emery et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported that treatment with GLM suppressed joint destruction significantly 52&#x000a0;weeks after the start of treatment, and further long-term observation is needed. However, due to the short follow-up period in our analysis, such observation was not possible.</p><p>In the present analysis, there were no serious adverse events arising from the use of GLM, although deterioration in renal function was reported in two patients. An association with the development of malignant tumors has been suggested with GLM, and further clinical confirmation is warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, long-term observation of the patients in our study is needed before any definite conclusions can be made.</p><p>It is important to select a type of biological agent taking into account the lifestyle of individual patients. Despite reported problems with pain and administration site reactions, subcutaneous injection of drugs offers greater convenience than intravenous infusion, which requires physical immobilization for many hours at a hospital, and a longer dosing interval is also advantageous. Because GLM contains only small amounts of stimulating acidic additives and requires only a small volume of dosing solution, reported incidences of pain and administration site reactions are low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present analysis, GLM plus MTX or GLM monotherapy used in clinical practice in Japanese patients with RA was confirmed to have high effectiveness and safety, comparable with existing biological agents. Thus, we conclude that GLM is a promising new alternative for the treatment of RA in Japanese patients showing poor response, those in whom the use of other biological agents is contraindicated, and cases where the use of MTX in combination with biological agents is difficult.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Technical editing and manuscript styling was provided by Andrea Bothwell and post-submission editorial assistance was provided by Mary Hines, <italic>in</italic>Science Communications, Springer Healthcare, with funding provided by Janssen, Japan.</p><sec id="d30e823"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Agarwal SK.
