However, the tendency to focus only on assessment of pre-specified structural aspects of fidelity has been criticised for paying insufficient attention to implementation processes and how intervention-context interactions influence programme delivery. This paper reports findings from a process evaluation nested within a randomised controlled trial of the Strengthening Families Programme 10&#x02013;14 (SFP 10&#x02013;14) in Wales, UK. It uses Extended Normalisation Process Theory to theorise how interaction between SFP 10&#x02013;14 and local delivery systems - particularly practitioner commitment/capability and organisational capacity - influenced delivery of intended programme activities: fidelity (adherence to SFP 10&#x02013;14 content and implementation requirements); dose delivered; dose received (participant engagement); participant recruitment and reach (intervention attendance).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A mixed methods design was utilised. Fidelity assessment sheets (completed by practitioners), structured observation by researchers, and routine data were used to assess: adherence to programme content; staffing numbers and consistency; recruitment/retention; and group size and composition. Interviews with practitioners explored implementation processes and context.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Adherence to programme content was high - with some variation, linked to practitioner commitment to, and understanding of, the intervention&#x02019;s content and mechanisms. Variation in adherence rates was associated with the extent to which multi-agency delivery team planning meetings were held. Recruitment challenges meant that targets for group size/composition were not always met, but did not affect adherence levels or family engagement. Targets for staffing numbers and consistency were achieved, though capacity within multi-agency networks reduced over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Extended Normalisation Process Theory provided a useful framework for assessing implementation and explaining variation by examining intervention-context interactions. Findings highlight the need for process evaluations to consider both the structural and process components of implementation to explain whether programme activities are delivered as intended and why.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Uses Extended Normalisation Process Theory to theorise intervention implementation.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">The Strengthening Families Programme was delivered with good overall fidelity.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Adherence to planned content and staffing guidelines was high, with some variation.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Recruitment of families was challenging and affected group size/composition</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Intervention-context interactions shaped variation in fidelity and implementation.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>United Kingdom</kwd><kwd>Strengthening Families Programme 10&#x02013;14</kwd><kwd>Family-based prevention</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd><kwd>Fidelity</kwd><kwd>Extended Normalisation Process Theory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Adolescent substance misuse is a significant problem in developed countries (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Currie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007</xref>) and early initiation of substance use is associated with higher levels of substance-related harm during adulthood (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dawson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Grant and Dawson, 1998</xref>). Because the consequences of early initiation are difficult to modify, an important response has been the development of family-based prevention interventions (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cuijpers, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kumpfer et al., 2003</xref>). One such intervention, the Strengthening Families Programme (SFP), aims to delay substance use initiation and prevent later misuse through strengthening family-based protective factors. In the United States of America trials of SFP 10-14 - a universal version of SFP for families with children aged 10&#x02013;14, have found evidence of long-term effectiveness (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Spoth, Redmond &#x00026; Shin, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Spoth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Spoth, Redmond, Trudeau &#x00026; Shin, 2002</xref>), though the methodological rigour of these studies has been criticised (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gorman, 2015</xref>). The evidence base for family-based prevention interventions such as SFP 10-14 is dominated by studies from the USA and there is a need for more research on whether effective interventions can be successfully &#x02018;transported&#x02019; to other national contexts (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Petrie, Bunn &#x00026; Byrne, 2007</xref>), where they are more likely to be implemented under &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; conditions, and without extensive input from programme developers (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Axford &#x00026; Morpeth, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Family-based programmes are complex interventions, with multiple components designed to work synergistically. Process evaluations, which analyse implementation, aid interpretation of complex outcome effects and understanding of intervention theory (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Durlak, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Durlak and DuPre, 2008</xref>). An important purpose of process evaluations is to assess the extent to which interventions are implemented with fidelity (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). This includes adherence (whether planned activities are delivered), dose (how much of an intervention is delivered/received), delivery quality, and reach and recruitment (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baranowski and Stables, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dusenbury et al., 2003</xref>). Alongside these quantitative measures, qualitative research can provide important data on the processes which influence implementation, and their variation across contexts (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">New interventions must operate within existing delivery systems and they depend upon cooperation from individuals and organisations, especially when delivered on a multi-agency basis (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">May, 2013</xref>) - a common social service delivery mechanism in the UK and elsewhere. Delivery settings are typically complex systems - characterised by the interaction of multiple individuals, social networks and organisations. Within these systems practitioners make meaning of interventions in ways which shape how they are delivered (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bisset et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">May, 2013</xref>) &#x02013; though the study of these phenomena is limited (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bisset et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2007</xref>). Practitioner engagement with an intervention may be emergent (and therefore hard to predict), and self-adaptive rather than centrally controlled (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sterman, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Tan, Wen &#x00026; Awad, 2005</xref>). Although studies in many countries have encountered variation in implementation across delivery contexts (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cantu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Durlak and DuPre, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lendrum and Humphrey, 2012</xref>), the role of intervention-context interaction in shaping this has often been overlooked (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bisset et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bonell, Fletcher, Morton, Lorenc &#x00026; Moore, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Glasgow, Lichtenstein &#x00026; Marcus, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hawe, Shiell, Riley &#x00026; Gold, 2004</xref>), and the narrow focus of process evaluations on quantitative assessment of pre-specified structural aspects of interventions (e.g. coverage of intervention activities) has been criticised for paying insufficient attention to the processes through which they occur (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bisset et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hawe et al., 2004</xref>). A previous trial of SFP 10-14 (conducted in the United States) &#x02013; in which the programme was delivered by community-university partnerships, found no significant association between implementation team functioning and levels of adherence, but suggested that potential relationships may have been masked by the consistently high rates of adherence across programmes (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Spoth, Guyll, Lillehoj &#x00026; Redmond, 2007</xref>). However, evaluation of the programme in the USA as part of &#x02018;real world&#x02019; dissemination found greater variation in adherence and other aspects of implementation (staffing levels, group size, children's age range), though no clear association between facilitator characteristics and fidelity (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cantu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2007</xref>). Questions therefore remain about the key influences on the quality of implementation of SFP 10-14, the role of individual facilitators and their teams, and the influence of wider contextual factors.</p><p id="p0045">Increasing attention is therefore being paid to intervention-context interactions, and their influence on implementation processes and hypothesized outcomes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). It is important to understand how practitioners engage with interventions because this can provide insights into why fidelity and intervention effectiveness vary over space and time, and the extent to which an intervention may be adopted. One important contribution to the study of these processes is Extended Normalisation Process Theory (ENPT) (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">May, 2013</xref>) which seeks &#x0201c;to provide a more comprehensive explanation of the constituents of implementation processes&#x0201d; by integrating existing theories that are more concerned with specific processes, such as intervention delivery, integration and normalisation. ENPT conceptualises implementation as comprising practitioners - who have agency that is manifested when they interact with each other and with intervention components; and implementation contexts comprising &#x0201c;the socio-structural and social-cognitive resources that people draw on to realise that agency&#x0201d;. It therefore offers a useful framework for explaining implementation processes and the role played by intervention-context interactions.</p><p id="p0050">ENPT has four main constructs. First, <italic>potential</italic> concerns practitioners&#x02019; commitment to deliver an intervention and behave in ways which are congruent with its aims, underpinning the action necessary to embed it within agents&#x02019; working practice (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">May, 2013</xref>). Whether practitioners value the changes an intervention brings about (change valence) and perceive that the changes are feasible within their local context (change efficacy), determine levels of commitment (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Weiner, 2009</xref>). Second, <italic>capability</italic> concerns the possibilities presented by the intervention. <italic>Capability</italic> comprises: workability - how practitioners adjust what they do when organising an intervention - for example, (re)allocation of roles and responsibilities; and integration - how practitioners perceive implementation of an intervention to be linked to the wider social system. Third, <italic>capacity</italic> is the structure into which an intervention is introduced. Implementation depends on agents&#x02019; co-operation to accommodate the intervention by modifying norms and roles in social systems and redistributing resources, e.g. providing funding (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">May, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0055"><italic>Potential</italic>, <italic>capability</italic> and <italic>capacity</italic> form the context for the fourth construct - <italic>contribution</italic>. This comprises the ways in which practitioners make sense of a complex intervention and their role in delivering it, the enactment of the intervention itself, and reflexive monitoring of its effects. The enactment of the intervention is expected to have specific qualities for each process evaluation component (e.g. adherence to programme manuals). Differences and similarities between expectations and practice can thus be explained in terms of <italic>potential</italic>, <italic>capability</italic> and <italic>capacity</italic>.</p><p id="p0060">A small number of empirical studies have employed ENPT as a theoretical framework to understand the implementation of interventions within healthcare systems (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">the REFReSH study group, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). Our paper &#x02013; which applies ENPT to a social intervention outside the healthcare system, reports findings from a process evaluation within a randomised controlled trial of the Strengthening Families Programme (SFP) 10-14UK. We build on previous studies which have employed ENPT mainly to analyse implementation processes, by extending its application to explain how such processes shape the extent to which programme inputs and activities occur as intended: fidelity (adherence to SFP 10&#x02013;14 content and implementation requirements); dose delivered (number of programmes organised); dose received (participant interest/engagement); reach (the proportion of families in the intervention group that participated in SFP 10&#x02013;14); and participant recruitment (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Linnan &#x00026; Steckler, 2002</xref>). In doing so, this paper aids interpretation of outcome effects within the trial, develops our understanding of how SFP 10&#x02013;14 could be implemented in a UK setting, and assesses the potential for ENPT to contribute to understanding of implementing social interventions within complex systems. The paper also extends previous process evaluations of SFP 10-14 which have focused mainly on the quantitative assessment of implementation (e.g. <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Byrne, Miller, Aalborg, Plasencia &#x00026; Keagy, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Spoth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Spoth, Guyll, Trudeau &#x00026; Goldberg-Lillehoj, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0065">The study was a process evaluation embedded within Project SFP Cymru &#x02013; a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial of SFP 10-14 UK (with families as the unit of randomisation), conducted in seven counties of Wales.

This process was designed to maximise the external validity of the trial by basing implementation on the systems and agencies which would be likely to deliver SFP 10-14 beyond the life of the RCT. Six county level partnerships were selected to implement the programme (one additional county later joined the study). Three counties were funded by Welsh Government, and three by the trial grant. Levels of funding provided (circa &#x000a3;75k per annum per county) were based on prior experience of running SFP 10-14 outside a research context. Funding covered the costs of employing coordinators and administrators, facilitator training, and programme delivery (e.g. room hire, participant transportation). Programme manuals and materials (e.g. activity sheets and DVDs) were provided to each team free of charge (and could continue to be used after the end of the trial). The local agency partnership in each county selected a lead organisation which appointed a co-ordinator who identified families eligible to participate in the trial, and organised and facilitated SFP 10&#x02013;14 programmes. Coordinators&#x02019; managers normally held senior leadership roles within their organisation, with responsibilities for securing ongoing funding for programmes, and managing the broader services within which SFP 10-14 sat.</p><p id="p0075">Practitioners from local agencies were trained free of charge as SFP 10&#x02013;14 facilitators in return for a commitment by their employer that the individuals concerned would be available to facilitate SFP 10&#x02013;14 during all seven weeks of at least one programme, with the intention that programmes would be delivered by multi-agency teams. Two trainers provided 3&#x000bd;-day training courses in all counties. A second round of courses was subsequently held which included training for two facilitators in each county to become trainers, so that delivery teams could maintain their staffing levels over time. Programmes were delivered in schools and community facilities between 2010 and 2012, with a target group size of 10&#x02013;12 families.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p id="p0080">Promotion of the trial in the community generated self-referrals from families, and practitioners working in local agencies could refer families. Access to SFP 10-14 was only available to families who agreed to participate in the trial and who were allocated to the intervention arm. Programme coordinators visited families who were referred or self-referred to the trial to provide information about the intervention and confirm eligibility. Based on this visit, and information contained in referral/self-referral forms, coordinators determined whether a family was likely to experience/present challenges within a group setting. Eligible families who agreed to be contacted by the research team were visited by a researcher who sought consent for participation in the trial, and collected baseline data from consenting parents/carers and children. Following baseline data collection families were randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive SFP 10-14 alongside existing services (intervention arm) or continue receiving existing services only (control arm). The study had a target sample size of 756 families.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>SFP 10-14 UK intervention</title><p id="p0085">The seven-week SFP 10-14 universal prevention intervention is delivered to groups of families (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Molgaard, Spoth &#x00026; Redmond, 2000</xref>). Participants divide into separate groups of parents/carers and children during the first hour of weekly sessions and meet for a refreshment break followed by the final hour when parents/carers and children come together in family groups. Facilitators use videos, interactive teaching and games specified in the programme manual to demonstrate and support the practice of parenting and other skills. The UK version of SFP 10&#x02013;14 uses videos featuring actors with UK accents and incorporates changes to makes activities more appropriate for a UK context (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allen, Coombes &#x00026; Foxcroft, 2007</xref>). Otherwise it closely follows the American version.</p><p id="p0090"><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the intervention logic model - developed by the paper authors, and reviewed by one of the programme developers. Project SFP Cymru implementation guidelines included provision of free transport, childcare and refreshments for families; and participant groups composed of approximately 30 percent of families who might present or experience challenges within a group setting (&#x0201c;families with challenges&#x0201d;) and 70 percent who would not (&#x0201c;families without challenges&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Segrott, 2013</xref>). This was a response to the difficulties of delivering the programme mainly to families with challenging behaviour, and had three aims. Firstly to assist implementation fidelity, by reducing disruptions to programme activities. Secondly to optimise hypothesized behaviour change processes, through creating pro-social group dynamics. Thirdly to maximise participant retention by achieving a participant-staff ratio that allowed support to be provided for families with higher needs/challenges, and create an enjoyable learning environment. This group composition strategy facilitated a proportionate universalism approach (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Marmot et al., 2010</xref>), whereby participation was invited on a universal basis while recognising that greater efforts were needed to involve certain groups.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>: Logic model for SFP 10&#x02013;14.

Disagreements in coding were resolved by the two researchers, with input from a third member of the team in a small number of cases. The completed analysis was then reviewed by the wider process evaluation team (by reading the original summaries of thematic codes and the subsequent coding of the data against ENPT constructs).

Some practitioners were strongly motivated to provide direct support (e.g. working as a facilitator) and indirect support (e.g. referring families to the programme) and four had done the training and/or programme sessions in their own time.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>3.3</label><title>Positive potential, high capability and decreasing capacity: Factors influencing implementation of planned programme activities</title><p id="p0155">Nineteen interviewees (12 facilitators, 2 managers, 5 coordinators) said they had enjoyed the facilitator training. Eight (6 facilitators, 1 manager, 1 coordinator) reported valuing the facilitator manual as a practical guide because it was detailed and easy to follow. According to one trainer, training tended to increase change efficacy related to programme content because it dealt with objections or misunderstandings about SFP 10&#x02013;14, so that trainees could gain an understanding of programme theory and design. Practitioners therefore understood how SFP 10&#x02013;14 worked as a whole. One facilitator commented that:<disp-quote><p><italic>[&#x02026;] you really saw how the activities were mirrored for the young people and the parents, there was a different approach with the DVD for the parents and the games for the young people, you could see how they were working towards a common aim and how that was embedded then in the family session.</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p id="p0160">Training guidance was that a meeting should be held the day after each SFP 10&#x02013;14 session to allow facilitators to debrief and prepare for the next session. These meetings included agreeing roles and responsibilities, and addressing issues relating to group dynamics and participants&#x02019; needs, to ensure that programme activities were covered as intended. However, three interviews with facilitators in County D indicated a link between coverage rates and staff preparation; they said they had needed to improvise during SFP 10&#x02013;14 sessions because there had been no preparation meetings and they did not know what to do:<disp-quote><p><italic>We didn&#x02019;t kind of decide until we got there on the session what - whether it would be parents or whether it would be this or that or the other. So it was - did feel a little kind of off the deep end cos the training had been probably a good six months before.</italic> (Facilitator)</p></disp-quote>.</p><p id="p0165">Lower coverage rates were found in counties where regular meetings were not held or did not fulfil intended functions. In County F, with the second-lowest observer-rated coverage and least observer-facilitator agreement, meetings lasted 30&#x000a0;minutes, with little time for discussion: <italic>&#x0201c;[&#x02026;] it was just purely a &#x02018;sit down, this is what you&#x02019;ll be doing&#x02019;</italic> (Facilitator). In County B, with the highest observer-rated coverage and agreement rates, interviewees consistently reported that meetings were held before each programme session. Meetings lasted two hours, which facilitators felt was the minimum required for them to debrief, plan, practise and get to know each other.</p><p id="p0170">Several practitioners (4 coordinators, 4 facilitators) described how meetings were difficult to arrange where facilitators were working for different organisations in separate locations and coping with work demands which were too urgent, heavy or inflexible to allow them to attend every week. When facilitators were unable to attend meetings, co-ordinators in Counties A, B, C, E and F contacted them individually. In County A, with the lowest observer-rated coverage, facilitators were frequently unavailable for meetings and the co-ordinator said that during one programme <italic>&#x0201c;four planning meetings instead of one&#x0201d;</italic> were held every week. However, one-to-one contact would not have been a complete substitute for staff meetings, which were described in eleven interviews (2 coordinators, one manager, and 8 facilitator interviews across 6 counties) as important to build relationships, discuss issues arising with participants, support team working, get other facilitators&#x02019; perspectives on what had happened during a session, and build inexperienced facilitators&#x02019; confidence.</p><p id="p0175">Difficulties in assembling facilitators for meetings were part of more general problems affecting facilitator recruitment. Co-ordinators in five counties said they struggled to recruit and retain facilitators from local agencies. <italic>Capacity</italic> to release staff decreased following cuts in public-sector jobs and funding: &#x0201c;<italic>It's impossible [to get facilitators]. Especially now [&#x02026;] where funding has been cut and people are tending to have to job share and won&#x02019;t be released from their role and things like that, so that's really difficult.</italic>&#x0201d; (Coordinator) Seven practitioners described how facilitators had been obliged to change, or had lost, their jobs. Three managers and a trainer explained how the resulting reduction in the pool of facilitators was aggravated in some counties by their small geographical size or competition from other programmes:<disp-quote><p><italic>[&#x02026;] SFP isn&#x02019;t the only programme in [name of area] that's using facilitators working within their core role. We have the [name] programme which also requires there to be facilitators and we have the [name] programme which is an emotional and mental health programme for children and young people and again that'</italic>s <italic>being run through volunteer facilitators, people that have been a volunteer from their service, and because there's a limited pool of workers that the facilitators can come from and with budget cuts people being - people's work load going up it actually makes it more difficult, the pool of potential facilitators gets saturated very quickly and I think we would struggle if we were to try and recruit many more to be honest. (Manager)</italic></p></disp-quote>.</p><p id="p0180">These difficulties suggested that fidelity to staffing standards would be low but quantitative findings indicated the opposite. Further analysis of interview and routine data revealed that co-ordinators in counties A, E and F had relied increasingly on colleagues in their own organisations to staff SFP 10&#x02013;14. This circumvented barriers to recruiting staff from multiple outside agencies and rendered achievement of staffing standards workable. The programme had become embedded within coordinators&#x02019; employing organisations, who had made a commitment to lead implementation and make organisational changes (e.g. staff recruitment, provision of accommodation) necessary to fulfil this role. This meant that they were more able and willing to sustain an increasing burden of staffing compared with partner agencies where the programme was less embedded, and who could stop releasing staff without impacting on the delivery of their core work. Achieving multi-agency staffing was challenging in three counties, but appeared to have been maintained in counties B and D. Co-ordinators in both counties were in post throughout the implementation period, which may have increased workability of multi-agency staffing and enabled them to sustain relationships with professionals in other agencies. All other co-ordinators were in post for shorter periods.</p><p id="p0185">High staff turnover did not appear to be a risk to other aspects of implementation, and evidence from county D suggested that co-ordinators&#x02019; time in post was less important than their individual <italic>potential</italic>. The County D co-ordinator lacked commitment to strict fidelity, did not think it was important to have the same facilitators at every SFP 10&#x02013;14 session and reported changing programme content to make it more interesting. This negative <italic>potential</italic> may explain why preparation meetings were rarely held, and why even with reduced <italic>capacity</italic>, multi-agency staffing would have been more easily achieved if managers were not being asked to release the same staff for seven consecutive SFP 10&#x02013;14 sessions and meetings. Some County D facilitators contacted each other independently to prepare for sessions (reported by four facilitators), which would have attenuated the co-ordinator's negative influence on coverage rates.</p><p id="p0190">Delivery of supporting inputs for the programme was generally good. Facilitators&#x02019; feedback and routine data from co-ordinators indicated that attendance at SFP 10&#x02013;14 sessions was facilitated in accordance with the SFP 10&#x02013;14 approach. Most comments on childcare, refreshments, travel arrangements, accommodation, materials and equipment were positive, ranging from 60% of comments on materials to 81% of comments on childcare.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><label>3.4</label><title>Decreasing potential, capability and capacity: Barriers to trial recruitment</title><p id="p0195">All co-ordinators reported difficulties in recruiting families. Two co-ordinators explained that they were seconded from organisations providing support services to vulnerable and needy groups and their professional contacts were with agencies primarily concerned with such families. Identifying families to take part in a universal programme presented a challenge because co-ordinators were recruiting from the general population rather than a clearly identified client group which was the norm. Three coordinators and two managers felt that agencies did not fully understand that SFP 10&#x02013;14 was universal, and continued their normal practice of referring only &#x0201c;needy&#x0201d; families. Co-ordinators&#x02019; and facilitators&#x02019; organisational affiliations also fed a more general perception that SFP 10&#x02013;14 was for families with expressed needs or problems.</p><p id="p0200">As recruitment proceeded, practitioners in some agencies perceived a divergence between their goals of supporting individual clients by offering them SFP 10-14 and provision of the programme in the context of an RCT which restricted access to families willing to participate in the trial, and who were randomised to the intervention arm. Managers (n=2), coordinators (n=3) and facilitators (one group interview) indicated that some professionals became reluctant to refer families for these reasons:<disp-quote><p><italic>[&#x02026;] when people were hearing that &#x02018;oh xyz they&#x02019;d all been referred, they&#x02019;re in the control group, next one's in the control group, next one'</italic>s <italic>in the control group&#x02019;, people were starting to [&#x02026;] say &#x02018;What's the point in me referring?&#x02019; (Manager)</italic></p></disp-quote>.</p><p id="p0205">Thus, positive change valence was affected by the research context which reduced integration of the intervention within local systems. The impact of recruitment difficulties was felt at trial, programme and session levels. Implementation was extended for 12 months so that enough families could be recruited to provide the required sample size for the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>3.5</label><title>Sustaining potential and capacity beyond the end of the trial</title><p id="p0210">Decisions on long term funding at national (and to some extent county) level were dependent on the findings from the RCT. This not withstanding, the value which staff placed on SFP 10&#x02013;14 drove high levels of <italic>potential</italic> among practitioners towards sustaining implementation of the intervention beyond the period funded by the randomised controlled trial. Staff in six counties described plans for implementing the programme beyond the trial funded period:<disp-quote><p><italic>We are going to try and find the money if we can. We wouldn&#x02019;t want it to go out of our portfolio of services. Strengthening Families is something that we feel we are getting good feedback from families [on]. Families want to engage with it, and it'</italic>s <italic>filling a gap for us in services that we have for teenagers and so definitely we would want to keep the project and take it forward further.</italic></p><p><italic>(Manager)</italic></p><p><italic>I&#x02019;m very glad we&#x02019;ve got the programme, I&#x02019;d like to keep it, I&#x02019;ve already been talking about how we might be able to sustain it beyond the life of the trial. It's very popular, parents who come on it love it, the facilitators are so enthusiastic about the programme, it just makes sense to everybody and they are very keen to continue delivering. So there's a lot of good will around the programme and beyond the life of the trial we will do everything we can to try and keep it going and not lose that expertise and that opportunity</italic>.</p><p><italic>(Manager)</italic></p></disp-quote>.</p><p id="p0215">One county had already received some follow-on funding. Securing dedicated funding from local commissioners was seen as important but was recognised to be challenging within a context of budget cuts. In some cases, staff described how they were thinking strategically about those potential funders whose aims or work SFP 10&#x02013;14 was aligned with or could help meet:<disp-quote><p><italic>[We are] looking at different initiatives that are coming out, like Team Around the Family which has just started with us, how you link into that? Because almost all of their desired outcomes are covered by Strengthening Families. I&#x02019;m sitting there ticking them off in my head.</italic></p><p><italic>(Coordinator)</italic></p></disp-quote>.</p><p id="p0220">County C aimed to secure dedicated funding for an SFP 10&#x02013;14 coordinator, either through a &#x02018;standalone&#x02019; grant, or by integrating the programme within their portfolio of services and allocating resources to its implementation. In Counties A and B the intention was to employ a coordinator who would be responsible for the delivery of multiple programmes, including SFP 10&#x02013;14, which would help sustainability but might reduce the number of programmes that could be delivered each year. Alongside financial resources (e.g. for employment of a coordinator) another challenge identified in most counties was the need to maintain and coordinate a network of facilitators from multi-agency partnerships who could staff programmes. There was uncertainty as to whether agencies would continue to provide time off in lieu to staff who worked as facilitators on the programme outside of normal working hours.</p><p id="p0225">Many interviewees believed that linking the programme more closely with schools could increase <italic>capacity</italic>, by creating semi-autonomous delivery teams, providing access to suitable accommodation free of charge, and facilitating recruitment of families from the general population. Other potential solutions to the challenge of coordinating delivery teams were put forward, including uni-agency delivery, and identifying a dedicated facilitator from each partner agency, so that coordinators were working mainly with individuals who had significant prior experience of delivering the programme, and thus required less support.</p><p id="p0230">In general participants indicated that the programme was likely to continue to be delivered in its intended form. However, in County A it was suggested that parts of the intervention (i.e. week sessions) could be delivered in standalone form, such as the work on making good choices, which might be offered to schools whose pupils were selecting subjects. Although many practitioners remained committed to the 70/30 model (as they recognised the difficulties of delivering the intervention to groups comprised solely of families with challenges), there was a recognition that partner agencies would be likely to focus referrals on families with challenges, and that once the programme was not part of an RCT, referral rates would increase as objections to randomisation were no longer an issue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0105"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0235">In this paper we have drawn on Extended Normalisation Process Theory to evaluate the delivery of a complex intervention &#x02013; the Strengthening Families Programme 10&#x02013;14. We have used the theory as a framework to understand how the interplay between the intervention and local delivery systems shaped implementation. This was achieved by considering how practitioner agency (<italic>capability</italic> and <italic>contribution</italic>) and delivery systems (<italic>capacity</italic> and <italic>potential</italic>) interacted with the intervention (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">May, 2013</xref>), the extent to which it was delivered as intended, and how this varied over space and time. The findings provide valuable contextual information for the RCT which is assessing the effectiveness of SFP 10&#x02013;14 on behavioural outcomes, and important insights into the extent to which the programme can be delivered as intended within a UK setting, following adaptation from the original US version.</p><p id="p0240">Overall SFP 10&#x02013;14 was delivered with good fidelity, and families received the intended intervention. Adherence to programme content by facilitators was high, but with some variation across delivery sites. These findings mirror those of previous evaluations of SFP 10&#x02013;14 in the USA (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cantu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Spoth, Guyll, Trudeau &#x00026; Goldberg-Lillehoj, 2002</xref>), and provide evidence that its implementation functions in broadly similar ways across contrasting national contexts, with key activities which are hypothesized to produce behaviour change being delivered in line with the programme's logic model.</p><p id="p0245">In our study, high <italic>potential</italic> among practitioners towards SFP 10&#x02013;14 appeared to have a positive influence on implementation. Practitioners valued the intervention (and were committed to delivering it) because they believed SFP 10&#x02013;14 could help families and fill gaps in existing services. Through facilitator training, delivery staff gained an understanding of what they were required to deliver and how programme components were intended to work and interact, thus enhancing their <italic>capability</italic> to deliver it. Variation in adherence to planned programme content appeared to be influenced by levels of <italic>capacity</italic> to achieve coordination across multi-agency networks, though coordinator <italic>potential</italic> was also important. In particular, the organisation and quality of facilitators&#x02019; preparatory meetings &#x02013; which were designed to optimise delivery processes and group dynamics - varied significantly. Programme adherence appeared to be higher in counties where the meetings were held regularly and fulfilled their intended purpose. Nonetheless, it is possible that the quality of meeting arrangements was associated with other aspects of implementation which also affected adherence. Targets for staffing numbers and consistency were met, but involvement of facilitators from multi-agency networks became increasingly difficult as levels of <italic>capacity</italic> reduced &#x02013; partly due to cuts in public-sector jobs and funding. However, coordinators were sometimes able to overcome these challenges, for example by drawing more on staff from the programme's host agency or organising multiple meetings.</p><p id="p0250">Family recruitment into the trial was challenging, and group size and composition targets were not always achieved. Practitioners&#x02019; concerns about random allocation of participants to intervention/control arms, and universal provision of the intervention (as opposed to focusing on families with support needs) impacted levels of <italic>potential</italic> and their willingness to refer families. However short-term funding, job losses in partner agencies, and competition from other programmes also played a part in reducing <italic>capacity</italic> to support recruitment &#x02013; a situation many interventions face.</p><p id="p0255">Despite practitioners&#x02019; concerns about the use of an RCT design, some aspects of the trial may have had a positive impact on implementation <italic>capacity</italic> and <italic>capability</italic>, particularly comprehensive funding for staffing, multi-agency practitioner training, and resources to enable family attendance &#x02013; levels of funding which were not always sustained after the end of the study. Good rates of fidelity could also have been shaped by the heightened levels of monitoring which the trial introduced, such as observation of programme sessions, reinforcing practitioner commitment and enhancing intervention <italic>contribution</italic>.</p><p id="p0260">Given the aim of forming groups to comprise a specific ratio of families with/without challenges to optimise group functioning and dynamics, the difficulties in consistently achieving the specified composition were theorised to be important for intervention <italic>contribution</italic> and implementation fidelity. However, although groups did not always achieve the target, most programmes comprised a mix of families with and without challenges in which the latter formed the majority. Only 5 groups comprised more than 60% families with challenges. The generally high levels of adherence and engagement achieved suggest that deviations in group size/composition from the intended formations may not have been significant enough to impact negatively on group dynamics or the delivery of intervention activities.</p><p id="p0265">Our study &#x02013; the first to our knowledge to use ENPT as the analytical framework for an empirical study of a social intervention, has several strengths. It builds on previous process evaluations of SFP 10&#x02013;14 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Byrne et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Spoth et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Spoth et al., 2002</xref>) &#x02013; and other trials of parenting/family interventions, which have focused primarily on assessment of pre-specified structural aspects of implementation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bisset et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hawe et al., 2004</xref>), by theorising implementation processes in order to provide greater understanding of how and why the programme was delivered as it was. This was done by integrating quantitative assessment of implementation (e.g. adherence, recruitment) and qualitative investigation of practitioners&#x02019; agency and the dynamics of local delivery systems, using ENPT as a theoretical framework. The qualitative dataset is important because it aids interpretation of implementation and programme behavioural outcomes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>), and offers insights into the kinds of conditions needed for the intervention to be delivered as intended when transferred to new settings. ENPT provided an effective framework to examine how intervention implementation and its variation may be shaped by interactions with local delivery systems and practitioner agency. Through using it we have addressed calls to pay greater attention to the theorisation of implementation processes and the role of intervention-context interactions in shaping their variation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bisset et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bonell et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Glasgow et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hawe et al., 2004</xref>), which can help optimise the explanatory value of process evaluations.</p><p id="p0270">Although other implementation frameworks assess moderators of fidelity (e.g. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2007</xref>) and examine intervention adoption and maintenance (e.g. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Glasgow et al., 1999</xref>), ENPT's distinctive contribution is that it offers a theory to help understand implementation processes, and how and why interventions are adopted and maintained (or not) over time. However, ENPT's focus is on how new forms of practice are embedded and integrated &#x02013; it is not primarily a framework for assessing and explaining implementation fidelity &#x02013; the main aim of process evaluations such as ours. We therefore used <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Linnan and Steckler's (2002)</xref> framework to identify those aspects of implementation that needed to be assessed, with ENPT employed to theorise implementation processes (identified in qualitative data) and the extent to which programme inputs and activities were delivered as intended (measured by quantitative data).</p><p id="p0275">ENPT places considerable emphasis on the notion of implementation as an expression of agency. However, the agents in question appear to be mainly conceptualised as professional practitioners (e.g. nurses), rather than the participants who receive interventions. There is scope to consider further how the key constructs of ENPT can be applied to understand how participant (and non-participant) agency may shape whether interventions become integrated and embedded within delivery systems. For example, participants&#x02019; <italic>potential</italic> towards an intervention may influence levels of recruitment and the feasibility of long-term implementation. To achieve their hypothesized mechanisms, interventions such as SFP 10&#x02013;14 require certain forms of <italic>contribution</italic> from participants, including participation in group activities, and the practising of skills within the home setting, which require cooperation and coordination between and across families (<italic>capacity</italic>).</p><p id="p0280">We originally planned to conduct focus groups with parents/carers and children/young people who participated in the trial to explore the factors affecting participation in the trial and intervention, and families&#x02019; experiences of receiving SFP 10&#x02013;14. However, despite significant efforts to recruit participants (including provision of free refreshments, organising transportation, and offering incentives), we were not able to recruit sufficient families to undertake the focus groups, and this is an important limitation of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0285">SFP 10&#x02013;14 was delivered with good overall fidelity. Levels of adherence to programme content were high, though with some variation. Delivery of the intervention within the context of an RCT reduced levels of <italic>potential</italic> among some referrers, affecting the feasibility of planned recruitment and group composition targets. However, provision of material resources by the trial may have helped generate the <italic>capacity</italic> needed to make SFP 10&#x02013;14 implementation workable, integrate the intervention within local delivery systems, and coordinate staff across multiple agencies. Trial-specific monitoring of implementation fidelity may have increased practitioner <italic>potential</italic> to deliver the intervention as intended, feeding through into intervention <italic>contribution</italic>.</p><p id="p0290">Our findings will aid interpretation of outcomes from the effectiveness trial of SFP 10&#x02013;14. Use of a pragmatic trial design (which aimed to assess delivery under &#x02018;real world&#x02019; conditions) and analysis of the factors influencing implementation fidelity, provide valuable evidence about the extent to which our findings would be replicated when the intervention is used outside of a trial context, and the conditions necessary for successful delivery. Collection of data on implementation outcomes (e.g. recruitment, adherence, staffing levels, and group characteristics) would be valuable if the programme is delivered outside of a trial context&#x02013; both to monitor what is delivered, and to develop understanding of how the programme operates in settings offering varying levels of <italic>potential</italic> and <italic>capacity</italic>.</p><p id="p0295">Extended Normalisation Process Theory provided a useful framework to explain implementation processes, and their variation across time and space by examining interactions between the intervention and local delivery contexts. Our findings lend further weight to calls (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bisset et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>) for process evaluations to examine both the structural and processual aspects of implementation - including interactions with local context, if they are to fully explain what is delivered and why.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
