Diffusion capacity progressively worsens as the severity of CAD increases due to reduction in lung tissue participating in gas exchange.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims and Objectives:</title><p>Pranayama breathing exercises and yogic postures may play an impressive role in improving cardio-respiratory efficiency and facilitating gas diffusion at the alveolo-capillary membrane. This study was done to see the effect of yoga regimen on lung functions particularly diffusion capacity in CAD patients.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 80 stable CAD patients below 65 years of age of both sexes were selected and randomized into two groups of 40 each. Group I CAD patients were given yoga regimen for 3 months which consisted of yogic postures, pranayama breathing exercises, dietary modification, and holistic teaching along with their conventional medicine while Group II CAD patients were put only on conventional medicine. Lung functions including diffusion capacity were recorded thrice in both the groups: 0 day as baseline, 22<sup>nd</sup> day and on 90<sup>th</sup> day by using computerized MS medisoft Cardio-respiratory Instrument, HYP&#x02019;AIR Compact model of cardio-respiratory testing machine was manufactured by <italic>P</italic> K Morgan, India.

Prevalence of CAD is greatly increasing in our country for the last several years and is expected to assume epidemic proportions soon. CAD causes more deaths and disabilities, and incurs greater economic costs than any other illness in the developed as well as developing countries. Projections based on the Global Burden of Disease Study estimate that by the year 2020, the burden of athero-thrombotic cardiovascular disease in India would surpass that in any other region in the world. [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Studies in India have documented a five-fold higher prevalence of coronary heart disease in the urban as compared to the rural population. [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Over the last three decades, progress in coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous interventions has improved the prognosis of CAD, but has not been able to address the basic etiopathology of CAD. [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] These are merely providing palliative relief at a high cost.</p><p>The lungs are linked in series with the cardiac pump, and they are not only influenced by mechanical alterations in pump function but also by neuro-humoral modulators and cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of various heart diseases. [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It has also been proposed that increased levels of circulating cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and interleukin-6 in CAD patients may induce changes in lung parenchyma. [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] High left atrial pressure may also induce chronic remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and its wall thickening. There may also be an enhanced degree of airway reactivity. [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Elevation of the capillary pressure causes alveolar-capillary membrane stress failure (i.e., increase in capillary permeability to water and ions, and disruption of local regulatory mechanisms for gas exchange), leading to a decrease in membrane conductance, an increase in capillary blood volume and subsequent impairment of diffusion capacity. [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Diffusion factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) may give an early indication of alveolar-capillary membrane dysfunction in CAD patients as data is lacking in stable patients of CAD.</p><p>There is a growing incidence of anxiety and stress related diseases like CAD for which conventional medicine offers only relief from symptom, not from the disease. The new millennium has heralded an unprecedented increase in such disorders and appropriate preventive and remedial measures are needed to be taken. Yogic exercises and pranayama may improve breathing patterns due to which respiratory bronchioles may be widened and perfusion of a large number of alveoli can be carried out efficiently. Yogic regimen may change the milieu at the bronchioles and the alveoli particularly at the alveolar-capillary membrane to facilitate diffusion and transport. Studies done by several researchers showed that yogic lifestyle intervention decreases the stenosis of coronary artery, decreases the anginal episodes, retards atherosclerosis, decreases sympathetic activity and improves exercise tolerance. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Adiponectin, interleukin-6, and various other cardiovascular disease risk makers are also found to be modified by a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention in obese people. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We have not come across any study showing the effect of a comprehensive yoga regimen on lung diffusion capacity in CAD patients to the best of our knowledge. Reports are available on improvement in lung functions and DLCO after yogic lifestyle intervention in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>As very few studies are available on the effect of yoga practices on lung functions and none on diffusion capacity in stable CAD patients, it is therefore, endeavored to study the effect of yogic regimen and lifestyle modification on lung diffusion capacity and other lung functions in patients with stable CAD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 80 patients with stable CAD of age group 45-65 years (55.78 &#x000b1; 8.95) were recruited from the Outpatient Department of Medicine, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi. All the patients were on regular conventional drug therapy. Most of them were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors of calcium channel blockers along with aspirin.

All the subjects underwent complete physical and clinical assessment as given in the performa. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP) were also recorded in both the groups. Informed and written consent from each subject was taken before recruiting him/her in the study.</p><p>Due to the nonavailability (to the best of our knowledge) of any clearcut article on the effect of yogic intervention on DLCO, sample size of 80 was arbitrarily decided on the basis of observations mentioned by other researchers on other parameters of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) such as FEV<sub>1</sub>, forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). After the initial screening for selection criteria, the selected 80 CAD patients were randomized into two groups of 40 each according to a computer generated randomization list (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</ext-link>). After this all the patients in both the groups underwent a baseline recording of PFTs and single breath DLCO in the cardio-pulmonary lab of Department of Physiology, UCMS. PFTs were recorded thrice in all the subjects and the best of the three was considered for analysis.

These sessions were aimed at understanding the need for lifestyle change, weight management and stress and anxiety management their diet was also modified and protein rich pulses, green vegetables, juicy fruits, and very less fat were included as per recommended by the dietician. After this they were asked to practice the whole yoga regimen at home for the next 10 weeks.

These improvements are statistically significant in CAD patients on yoga with conventional medicine as compared to patients on conventional medicine only.</p><p>This could be because of reduction of sympathetic reactivity attained with yogic training which may allow broncho-dilatation by correcting the abnormal breathing patterns and reducing the muscle tone of inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Due to improved breathing patterns, respiratory bronchioles may be widened and perfusion of a large number of alveoli can be carried out efficiently. [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Yogic practice covers the entire field of our existence from physical, sensory, emotional, mental and spiritual to the highest self-realization. One of the hallmarks of yoga is balance - which is of both body and mind. Yoga improves the circulation and there is better perfusion of tissues. It increases the strength of respiratory muscles and reduces sympathetic reactivity thereby helps to reduce stress and anxiety which aggravate the severity of CAD.</p><p>The further advantage of yogic breathing lies in the fact that it is more a vertical breathing. By this vertical breathing all the alveoli of both the lungs open out evenly. Due to the even expansions of all the alveoli, a vast expense of alveolar membrane is available for exchange of gases. The larger the surface available for the process of diffusion, the better is the process. [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Generally a small portion of lung capacity is been utilized. This inadequate supply of oxygen results in improper waste disposal from the body. The body functions are slowed down and the cells fail to regenerate themselves due to lack of sufficient energy. Pranayama, a well regulated breathing exercise increases the depth of breathing and expands lungs more than normal and recruits previously closed alveoli. Moreover, endurance power of the lung muscle also improves after adopting yoga. [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Ornish <italic>et al</italic>. showed short term and long term benefits of lifestyle changes (without using cholesterol lowering drugs) on coronary lesions and clinical manifestations of CAD. [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Manchanda <italic>et al</italic>. showed similar benefits in Indian patient population in both these studies, number of subjects were small. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Recent study done in Global Hospital and Research Centre at Mt. Abu on 123 CAD patients and 360 coronary lesions showed a significant improvement not only in hormonal profile (which showed increased levels of endorphins, serotonin and decreased level of catecholamine), lipid profile, quality of life, but also showed a significant regression of atherosclerotic lesions angiographically in the yoga group. [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] We have also seen significant improvement in cardiovascular parameters such as HR, SBP, and DBP after 90 days yoga regimen in CAD patients.</p><p>Very few reports are available which document an improvement in lung functions and prevention of complications after following yoga based lifestyle modification. Our previous pilot study on CAD patients reported an improvement in PEFR, ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub> :FVC (FEV<sub>1</sub> %), MVV, and forced mid-expiratory flow (25-75) after following 2 weeks of pranayama breathing exercises. [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The limitation of this study were that the sample size was small, patients performed only pranayama and DLCO could not be recorded. In the present study, the subject size was bigger and they followed a proper yoga based lifestyle which included yogic postures, pranayama, diet management along with holistic teaching for a longer duration, that is, 3 months. Yogic exercises and pranayama may improve lung functions and prevent serious cardio-respiratory complications by emphasizing optimal physical and mental conditioning. Yogic lifestyle modification therapy can be used as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment in CAD patients to achieve optimal results.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Strength of the study</title><p>Strength of our study is that it is first randomized control trial depicting the improvement in PFTs especially in diffusion capacity after following a longer duration of yoga regimen (3 months) under the guidance of a yoga instructor.
