difficulty is optimized, the amount of information required to complete the task matches
the learner's information processing abilities. The practice schedule is one of the
factors which changes the amount of task information. We investigated the influence of
changes in practice schedule on the amount of task information using the probe reaction
time technique. [Methods] Fourteen young male subjects were randomly assigned to a blocked
or random practice group. They were required to perform two tasks simultaneously. The
primary task consisted of treadmill walking with specific step lengths, and the secondary
task consisted of a probe reaction time task. [Results] The blocked practice group was
superior to the random practice group in performance during the acquisition phase. In
contrast, the random practice group was superior to the blocked practice group in
performance during the retention phase. Furthermore, the random practice group had a
longer reaction time than the blocked practice group. [Conclusion] From the standpoint of
the challenge point framework, motor learning may be accelerated by random practice
because random practice probably elicits greater attentional demand than blocked
practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Motor learning</kwd><kwd>Practice schedule</kwd><kwd>Probe reaction time</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Practice is considered the most important factor responsible for motor learning. The
generalizability of the relationship between practice and skill is so profound that it is
sometimes modeled mathematically and referred to as a law<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in the clinical practice of physical therapy, the practice
period is usually limited. Therefore, physical therapists must make the most efficient use
of limited opportunities for providing motor learning. Many previous researchers in the
motor learning domain have studied the effects of practice variables on motor learning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, especially practice schedule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and
the methods for providing feedback<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most common finding in the extensive literature comparing a blocked practice schedule
(e.g., A-A-A, B-B-B, C-C-C) to a random practice schedule (e.g., A-B-C, B-C-A, C-A-B), is
that blocked practice produces better performance than random practice during acquisition
trials, but that random practice results in better retention performance than blocked
practice. This phenomenon is known as the contextual interference effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the majority of previous studies
relevant to the contextual interference effect have used relatively simple tasks. Therefore,
it has been suggested that researchers need to study whether contextual interference causes
the same phenomenon to occur in complex tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hebert et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>
studied the relationship between a learner's skill level and contextual interference. In
their study, contextual interference was found only in the high-skill group. Albaret and
Thon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a contextual
interference x task complexity interaction for tests of transfer. The random practice group
was better than the blocked practice group in the transfer tests, but only at the simple
task. However, no differences in transfer were found between the random and blocked practice
groups at the complex task. Considering these findings, the optimal practice schedule for
motor learning is thought to depend, at least, on task difficulty and the learner's skill
level.</p><p>The <italic>challenge point framework</italic> has been proposed as explaining the optimal
practice conditions changing with the learner's skill level and task complexity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This framework has two characteristics.
First, it indicates that the optimal task difficulty for motor learning differs depending on
task complexity, the learner's skill level, and practice conditions. Second, this framework
classifies task difficulty into two categories, <italic>nominal</italic> and
<italic>functional task difficulties</italic>. The nominal difficulty of a task reflects
the constant amount of difficulty, regardless of who is performing the task and under what
conditions it is being performed. On the other hand, functional task difficulty refers to
how challenging the task is relative to the skill level of the individual performing the
task and to the conditions under which it is being performed. According to the challenge
point framework, motor learning will be delayed in the presence of a functional task
difficulty which is too high or low. When the amount of information available from
performance of the task and the learner's information processing capabilities match, motor
learning is most efficient.</p><p>However, the influence of the practice schedule on functional task difficulty is still
unclear. If the influence were clear, physical therapists would be able to adjust the
practice schedule, along with nominal task difficulty and the patients' skill level. In
consequence of the adjustment, functional task difficulty would approach the optimal
challenge point, and motor learning would become more efficient.</p><p>A dual task procedure has been used in many previous studies in order to examine the amount
of attention available for performance of a task across a range of perceptual motor
tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially, the probe
reaction time (PRT) is a method commonly used for attentional demand measurement during
execution of motor tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The attention
demand of the primary task is assumed to be inversely related to the PRT; i.e., an extended
reaction time is interpreted as indicating that the primary task requires considerable
attention.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of the practice schedule on functional
task difficulty by measuring functional task difficulty using the PRT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 14 male student volunteers (mean age 21.5&#x02005;years, SD =
1.1&#x02005;years) who had no prior experience of the experimental tasks and were unaware of the
specific purposes of this study. All subjects signed an informed consent before commencing
the experiment. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ibaraki Prefectural
University of Health Sciences Ethics Committee (Approval No. 398).</p><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Experimental procedure. Pretest reflects the skill level before the acquisition phase.
Posttest reflects the results of motor learning in the last acquisition phase (e.g.,
posttest of Day 2 reflects the results of motor learning in the acquisition phase of Day
1). The time interval between acquisition and the following posttest is 2&#x02013;3 days.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-25-827_g001"/></fig><p>Subjects were required to perform two tasks simultaneously. The primary task consisted of
walking on a treadmill with a specific length of step. This task required the subjects walk
at one of three different lengths of step, 60%, 80%, or 100% of the length of their lower
limbs. To calculate the target value of step length, each subject's right lower limb was
measured, by a single experimenter, from the anterior superior iliac spine to the apex of
the medial malleolus. The subjects were requested to make their steps correspond to the
prescribed lengths as much as possible. The treadmill was adjusted to the speed at which the
individual subjects felt comfortable. The subjects wore experimental footwear with a
pressure-sensitive sensor (PH-462, DKH Co., Ltd.) on the posterior of the heel. At the
beginning of a trial, an auditory tone, delivered from a sound simulator, was presented to
the subject for one second as the start signal. Then, the subject was told, orally, the
length of the target step by the experimenter. The end signal (the same as the start signal)
was presented to subject 25 seconds after the start signal. Subjects were instructed not to
look down at their feet, but to look straight ahead during execution of the task. A safety
bar was mounted on the treadmill to prevent subjects from shifting position on the belt and
to maintain their safety. The secondary task consisted of a PRT task, and prior to
commencing the experiment, the secondary task was practiced by the subjects sufficiently
enough to familiarize themselves with it. Subjects were instructed to respond by saying &#x0201c;pa&#x0201d;
as fast as possible upon hearing an auditory tone delivered from a sound simulator. The
auditory tones were 50&#x02005;msec in length and were presented randomly five times with different
timings for the acquisition trial. The auditory tones and the subjects' verbal responses
were recorded for later analysis.</p><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to either a blocked or random practice group; n = 7, each
group. The experiment was conducted individually in three experimental phases (pretest,
acquisition, and posttest) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). After
explaining the procedure and task of the experiment to each subject, all the subjects
underwent a pretest of 15 trials (5 trials for each step length), which were performed in a
quasi-random order and did not provide knowledge of results (KR) relative to the difference
between the desired value of step length and the obtained value. In this phase, the
secondary task was not included. Next, the acquisition phase of 30 trials was administered.
During this phase, all the subjects performed the primary and secondary tasks
simultaneously. Subjects assigned to the blocked practice condition completed 10 trials of
one step length before performing practice trials of a new step length. The practice order
of the three step lengths was counterbalanced across subjects. Those individuals assigned to
the random practice condition performed 10 trials of each of the three step lengths randomly
presented throughout the acquisition phase, with the restriction that one step length was
not repeated in consecutive trials. The secondary task stimuli were presented five times at
random during the trials. KR of the primary task was orally given to the subjects by the
experimenter after every trial. The next trial started after a 10-second delay. The posttest
occurred two to three days later, under the same conditions as the pretest. After the
completion of the 15 posttest trials, all groups rested for three minutes. Then the
acquisition phase was administered.</p><p>Step length (cm) was calculated by multiplying treadmill speed (cm/msec) by a step time
(msec). Step time was defined as the time lapse from one sensor detecting heel contact to
the other sensor detecting heel contact. These signals were sent to a dedicated amplifier
(PH-450A, DKH Co., Ltd.), and the amplified signals were converted to digital signals using
an A/D converter (Power Lab/16SP; AD Instruments) at a sampling rate of 100&#x02005;Hz and stored a
personal computer. The step length error was the absolute value of the difference between
the desired step length and the obtained step length divided by the length of the
individual's lower limb. PRT greater than two standard deviations above or below the mean
were removed as outliers. To obtain the rate of prolongation of PRT caused by performance of
the primary task, the PRT when performing the primary task was divided by the PRT when
walking on the treadmill at the usual step length of individual subjects.</p><p>SPSS ver. 20 software (SPSS Statistics, IBM Corp) was used to perform the statistical
analysis. The error of step length in the acquisition phase and PRT were analyzed in a 2
(practice schedule conditions) &#x000d7; 3 (Day) ANOVA, with repeated measures for the last factor.
The error of step length in all test phases were analyzed in a 2 (practice schedule
conditions) &#x000d7; 4 (Day) ANOVA, with repeated measures for the last factor. We chose an alpha
level of 0.05 to indicate significant effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The error of step length of each of the two groups during the acquisition

complexity, the learner's skill level, and practice condition. In this study, the influence
on the functional task difficulty of difference in skill level was excluded by setting a
novel task (one subjects had not yet learned), and by verifying that there was no difference
in the skill level of each group at the time of the pretest. In addition, because all
subjects executed the same tasks, the study protocol ensured that no difference existed in
the nominal task difficulty between the groups. Therefore, the difference of the functional
task difficulty for each group was attributable to the different practice schedules. This
study examined the influence on functional task difficulty of the practice schedule using
the PRT technique. The blocked practice group showed significantly superior performance to
the random practice group during the acquisition phase. In contrast, the random practice
group showed significantly superior performance to the blocked practice group during the
retention phase. This result is in agreement with those of many previous studies concerning
practice schedule and provides further evidence in support of the contextual interference
effect.</p><p>Several hypotheses have been proposed for the contextual interference effect. The two most
prominent hypotheses center on the benefits of encoding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the benefits
resulting from forgetting and subsequent reconstruction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Shea and Zimny<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, the difference in task requirements during random practice
facilitates better comparative and contrastive analyses of the features of different tasks,
resulting in the formation of a more elaborate and distinct memory representation. This
means that the random practice group would have developed a memory representation that
facilitates retrieval. The other hypothesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup> is based on ideas about the spacing effect originally presented in
verbal learning literature. According to this hypothesis, the action planning that occurs
just prior to a practice trial is influenced by what was done in the previous trial. In
blocked practice, a previously constructed action plan is available in working memory
because the same task has just been performed, and no forgetting occurs. In contrast, when
tasks are ordered intermittently during random practice, the previously constructed action
plan must be abandoned to execute other tasks and then reconstructed once again. This view
accounts for the learning/performance distinction of the contextual interference effect,
because remembering the action from a previous trial (as in blocked practice) facilitates
better performance in acquisition, but does not facilitate learning. However, random
practice creates short term retention loss, which is detrimental to acquisition performance,
but beneficial to learning.</p><p>The important thing to understand here is that increased cognitive efforts attributable to
random practice inhibit performance during acquisition, but facilitate learning in both
hypotheses. We consider that the increased cognitive efforts attributable to random practice
represent increased functional task difficulty. Our results revealed that the random
practice resulted in a longer PRT than the blocked practice, suggesting the functional task
difficulty of the random practice is higher than the functional task difficulty of the
blocked practice. This further suggests that the functional task difficulty of random
practice rises due to the contextual interference effect. As the functional task difficulty
was increased, performance during the acquisition period was inhibited, but motor learning
was facilitated because the increased functional task difficulty approached the optimal
challenge point. Our results indicate that practice schedule affects the functional task
difficulty, and increased functional task difficulty makes motor learning more efficient.
Extending these results to the clinical settings of physical therapy, motor learning would
be more efficient if random practice were adopted in cases where the learning task is too
easy. Similarly, motor learning would be more efficient if blocked practice were adopted in
cases where the learning task is too difficult.</p><p>We recognize several limitations of the study. First, it is important to point out that all
the subjects were young men, and the results may be affected by age and gender. Second, this
study used treadmill walking with specific step lengths as the learning task; therefore, the
generalization of results to other tasks may be limited. Third, we failed to confirm the
relationship between the functional task difficulty and the efficiency of motor learning
when the functional task difficulty exceeds the optimal challenge point. Therefore, in
future studies, we should consider the relationship between the functional task difficulty
and efficiency of motor learning when it exceeds the optimal challenge point.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Crossman</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>A theory of the acquisition of
