</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) presents clinically in children and adolescents, and it may persist in a sizeable portion of adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When pharmacotherapy for adults diagnosed with ADHD is pursued, the initial treatment choice is generally a psychostimulant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which is in accordance with US practice recommendations for children and adolescents with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although reviews suggest that currently available long-acting psychostimulants have estimated durations of effect ranging from 8 to 14&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], some physicians may augment their patients&#x02019; long-acting psychostimulant with another ADHD medication later in the day because the long-acting psychostimulant alone does not provide all-day coverage. In a clinical program practice survey of adults being treated for ADHD, approximately 40% of patients were receiving a combination of short- and long-acting psychostimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">SHP465 mixed amphetamine salts (SHP465 MAS) is a novel, once-daily, extended-release, single-entity MAS product for oral administration approved in USA for the treatment of ADHD in patients aged 13&#x000a0;years and older. SHP465 MAS was designed with the goal of providing a medication with the potential to reduce the ADHD symptoms throughout the day and into the evening in individuals who require such coverage. It contains equal amounts (by weight) of four salts: dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate and amphetamine aspartate monohydrate. This results in a 3:1 mixture of dextro- to levoamphetamine base equivalent. Each capsule contains three types of drug-releasing beads, an immediate-release bead and two different types of delayed-release beads. The first delayed-release bead releases amphetamine at pH 5.5 and the other delayed-release bead releases amphetamine at pH 7.0. In a phase I study, the pharmacokinetic profile of 37.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS was similar to that of 25&#x000a0;mg/day of extended-release MAS (MAS XR) in the morning supplemented 8&#x000a0;h later by 12.5&#x000a0;mg/day of immediate-release MAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], suggesting it may be a viable once-daily treatment for ADHD.</p><p id="Par9">The efficacy, tolerability, and safety of SHP465 MAS in adults with ADHD have been examined in several phase III studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In a forced-dose study, the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of 25, 50, and 75&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS were examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In that study, all SHP465 MAS doses produced significantly greater reductions in ADHD symptoms than did placebo, but a clear and clinically meaningful, dose-dependent response between low and high doses of SHP465 MAS was not established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In another study, the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of dose-optimized SHP465 MAS (12.5&#x02013;75&#x000a0;mg/day) were evaluated; however, owing to the use of dose optimization, relationships among the individual SHP465 MAS doses used in that study (12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and 75&#x000a0;mg/day) were not examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This forced-dose study specifically evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of 12.5 and 37.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS, with the 12.5-mg/day dose being evaluated to further elucidate the lower end of the dose response relationship of SHP465 MAS. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SHP465 MAS vs. placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par10">This phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, forced-dose study (ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT02604407) was conducted at 43 US sites [participants randomized/enrolled across sites (median 6; range 1&#x02013;19); no more than 7% of participants enrolled from each study site] in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol, final approved informed consent document, and all supporting information were submitted to and approved by a central institutional review board (Copernicus Group Independent Review Board, Durham, NC, USA) and by the US Food and Drug Administration as appropriate before study initiation. All participants provided written informed consent before taking part in study procedures.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par11">Men and non-pregnant women (aged 18&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years) meeting the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</italic> criteria for a primary ADHD diagnosis and having ADHD Rating Scale with Adult Prompts (ADHD-RS-AP) total scores &#x02265;28 at baseline were enrolled. Eligible participants had satisfactory medical assessments with no clinically significant abnormalities and they were either not currently on ADHD therapy or they reported that they were not completely satisfied with any aspect, including issues related to efficacy and tolerability, of their current ADHD therapy.</p><p id="Par12">Participants were excluded if they had a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis that was controlled with prohibited medications or uncontrolled and associated with significant symptoms that contraindicated SHP465 MAS treatment or could confound study assessments. Participants were also ineligible if they were considered a suicide risk, had previously made a suicide attempt, or were currently demonstrating active suicidal ideation (those with intermittent passive suicidal ideation could be included based on investigator judgment). Other exclusion criteria included a body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;18.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (underweight) or &#x02265;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (very severely obese) at screening; a history of moderate-to-severe hypertension, average sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x0003e;139&#x000a0;mmHg, or average sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#x0003e;89&#x000a0;mmHg; use of combination antihypertensive medications (participants with well-controlled mild hypertension on a single antihypertensive agent could participate); a known history of symptomatic cardiovascular issues or serious cardiac problems; a known family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia; a clinically significant electrocardiogram; a documented allergy, a hypersensitivity, or an intolerance to amphetamine or any excipient in SHP465 MAS; a failure to respond to an adequate course of amphetamine therapy (to ensure that response to treatment is not artificially reduced by the inclusion of non-responders); a history of suspected substance abuse or dependence disorder (excluding nicotine) based on the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</italic> criteria; a lifetime history of amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant abuse and/or dependence; and participation in a clinical study within 30&#x000a0;days before screening.</p><p id="Par13">Prohibited medications were psychostimulants and amphetamine-like agents, centrally or peripherally acting antihistamines (non-sedating antihistamines were permitted), investigational compounds, clonidine and guanfacine, and herbal preparations. Additional medications that were prohibited because they indicated the potential presence of an exclusionary diagnosis were combination anti-hypertensives (use of a single antihypertensive was permitted if the same dose had been used for at least 3&#x000a0;months before screening), sedatives, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antidepressants, selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Participants requiring or anticipating the need to take medications with central nervous system effects or who were taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors were excluded (stable bronchodilator inhaler use was not exclusionary).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment</title><p id="Par14">The study included four periods (screening and washout, forced-dose titration, dose maintenance, safety follow-up) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After the screening and washout period (7&#x02013;30&#x000a0;days depending on use of prohibited medications at screening), participants were randomized 1:1:1 to 1 of three treatment groups for 4&#x000a0;weeks: 12.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS, 37.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS, or matching placebo.

</p><p id="Par15">Treatment assignments were made by an interactive web response system. Within each study site, unique participant numbers were assigned according to the sequence of presentation for study participation after determination of study eligibility. The packaging of the study drug and the appearance of each treatment were identical across treatment arms. The investigators, the investigators&#x02019; staff, and the participants were blinded to the treatment assignment.</p><p id="Par16">During the forced-dose titration period (weeks 1 and 2), participants randomized to SHP465 MAS initiated treatment at 12.5&#x000a0;mg/day during week 1. Participants randomized to 12.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS maintained this dose during week 2. In participants randomized to 37.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS, the dose was titrated to 25&#x000a0;mg/day during week 2 and to 37.5&#x000a0;mg/day during week 3. Throughout the forced-dose titration period, dose escalation was dictated by treatment group, and dose changes were not allowed. Participants were discontinued if they experienced unacceptable tolerability. During dose maintenance (weeks 3 and 4), participants were maintained at their randomized dose. The follow-up period was 7 (+2) days from the last dose of the study drug. At the end of the follow-up period, information related to the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and concomitant treatments was requested via a telephone call.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Efficacy Endpoints</title><p id="Par17">The primary efficacy endpoint was ADHD-RS-AP total score change from baseline to week 4 in the full analysis set, which included all screened participants assigned a randomization number who took one or more study drug doses and who had one or more post-baseline on-treatment primary efficacy assessments. The ADHD-RS-IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was developed to measure behavior in children with ADHD. In this study, the ADHD-RS-AP, which consists of 18 items reflecting current ADHD symptoms based on the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</italic> criteria, was used. The adult prompts create a semi-structured measurement allowing clinicians to probe the extent, frequency, breadth, severity, and consequences of adult ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Items are scored on 4-point scales [0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms)]; total score ranges from 0 to 54. The scale is divided into two subscales, hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness, consisting of nine items each. The ADHD-RS-AP was completed at each visit by an experienced clinician who was certified on the scale.</p><p id="Par18">The key secondary efficacy endpoint was Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score at week 4. The CGI-I measures improvement in global symptom severity on a 7-point scale [1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], with improvement measured against baseline CGI-Severity (CGI-S) scores. The CGI-I and CGI-S were completed by clinicians experienced in evaluating adult ADHD.

All AEs were collected from the time of informed consent until the end of follow-up. Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as AEs occurring during double-blind treatment that (1) had start dates on or after the first study drug dose or (2) had start dates before the first study drug dose but that increased in severity on or after the date of the first study drug dose. Vital signs and weight were assessed at screening, baseline, and all visits through week 4/final on-treatment assessment, as were responses on the C-SSRS, which is a semi-structured interview that assesses suicidal ideation and behavior and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

To detect a treatment difference of 7.0 [assumed common standard deviation (SD), 11.6] for the ADHD-RS-AP total score change from baseline, 60 participants per group were needed to provide 90% power for a two-sided <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05). Therefore, a total of 180 participants (60 for each SHP465 MAS dose and 60 for placebo) needed to be randomized. With an expected post-randomization dropout rate of 30%, the randomization target was set at 258 participants. The estimated treatment difference and SD corresponded to an effect size (ES) of 0.6 and was based on a previously completed phase III study of SHP465 MAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">All statistical analyses of efficacy were conducted in the full analysis set. The primary efficacy endpoint (ADHD-RS-AP total score change from baseline at week 4) was analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures, with treatment group, visit, and the interaction of treatment group with the visit as factors; baseline ADHD-RS-AP total score as a covariate; and the interaction of baseline ADHD-RS-AP total score with the visit adjusted in the model. The null hypothesis was that there was no difference in the mean change from baseline at week 4 in the ADHD-RS-AP total score between each SHP465 MAS treatment group and the placebo group. The primary contrast was each dose of SHP465 MAS vs. placebo. To compare SHP465 MAS with placebo, the least-squares (LS) mean treatment difference for the change from baseline at week 4 and the corresponding 95% confidence interval and <italic>p</italic> value were calculated; ES (the LS mean difference divided by the square root of the variance estimate at week 4) was also calculated. Two sensitivity analysis models were used to examine the robustness of the primary analysis. These models assumed different missing not at random mechanisms and were within the pattern-mixture model framework.</p><p id="Par22">The key secondary efficacy endpoint, CGI-I score at week 4, was analyzed using the same analysis methods described for the primary efficacy endpoint. Other assessments of efficacy were changes from baseline at week 4 on the ADHD-RS-AP subscales and dichotomized improvement on the CGI-I. Changes in ADHD-RS-AP subscales from baseline to week 4 were analyzed using the same mixed-effects model for repeated measures described for the primary efficacy endpoint. The dichotomized CGI-I analysis examined the percentage of participants who improved on the CGI-I at the final on-treatment assessment, with &#x0201c;improved&#x0201d; categorized as scores of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) and &#x0201c;not improved&#x0201d; categorized as scores of 3 (minimally improved) through 7 (very much worse). The percentage of improved participants for each SHP465 MAS dose vs. placebo was analyzed with a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test stratified by baseline CGI-S.</p><p id="Par23">To preserve study-wide type I error at a two-sided <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 across the primary and key secondary efficacy assessments, a fixed-sequence test procedure was applied. In this procedure, each test was evaluated at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and a later test could only be reported as significant if all earlier tests were significant. The order of assessment was as follows: 37.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS vs. placebo for the ADHD-RS-AP total score change from baseline at week 4; 12.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS vs. placebo for the ADHD-RS-AP total score change from baseline at week 4; 37.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS vs. placebo for the CGI-I score at week 4; and 12.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS vs. placebo for the CGI-I score at week 4. The study was not powered for the assessment of change from baseline at week 4 in ADHD-RS-AP subscale scores or for dichotomized improvement on the CGI-I at the final on-treatment assessment, and these endpoints were not included in the testing strategy. Therefore, all reported <italic>p</italic> values for these endpoints are nominal (unadjusted) and reported for descriptive purposes only.

This difference could be clinically meaningful.</p><p id="Par37">Although direct comparisons cannot be made between agents across different studies, the magnitude of effect observed in the current study is within a range observed for other long-acting psychostimulants in adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A 4-week fixed-dose study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with ADHD reported an ES range of 0.73 for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate 30&#x000a0;mg/day to 0.99 for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate 70&#x000a0;mg/day. In a 4-week forced-dose study of MAS XR, the mean ES reported for MAS XR (20&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mg/day) was 0.80. In further support of the robust ES observed in this study, a meta-analysis of psychostimulant treatment effects on the ADHD-RS total score from nine studies in adults with ADHD reported a mean ES of 0.89 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">The short-term safety and tolerability of SHP465 MAS in this study are consistent with observations from short-term placebo-controlled studies of SHP465 MAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and other long-acting psychostimulants in adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The most frequently reported TEAEs with SHP465 MAS (those occurring at a frequency of &#x0003e;5% and at twice the rate of placebo) in this study&#x02014;decreased appetite, dry mouth, insomnia, headache, anxiety, initial insomnia, irritability, and bruxism&#x02014;were consistent with those reported in other phase III studies of SHP465 MAS in adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These TEAEs have also been reported with other long-acting psychostimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In previously published short-term phase III studies, SHP465 MAS also increased pulse (range: 0.9&#x02013;5.4&#x000a0;bpm), SBP (range &#x02212;0.3 to 1.5&#x000a0;mmHg), and DBP (range &#x02212;0.3 to 1.8&#x000a0;mmHg), and decreased weight (range &#x02212;2.1 to &#x02013;3.7&#x000a0;kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which is consistent with reports of other long-acting psychostimulants [extended-release dexmethylphenidate (3.1&#x02013;6.0&#x000a0;bpm; SBP &#x02212;0.5&#x000a0;mmHg; DBP 1.0&#x000a0;mmHg); lisdexamfetamine (pulse 2.8&#x02013;5.2&#x000a0;bpm; SBP 0.3&#x02013;1.3&#x000a0;mmHg; DBP 0.8&#x02013;1.6&#x000a0;mmHg); MAS XR (pulse 4.2&#x02013;6.2&#x000a0;bpm; SBP 0.3&#x02013;4.3&#x000a0;mmHg); osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system methylphenidate (pulse 3.6&#x000a0;bpm; SBP &#x02212;1.2&#x000a0;mmHg; DBP 1.1&#x000a0;mmHg)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The findings of this study should be considered in light of potential limitations. Although SHP465 MAS was titrated in the study, the forced-dose titration design used in this study is not consistent with the flexible-dose treatment strategies employed in clinical settings. As such, participants could have been maintained on doses that were suboptimal in terms of maximizing the balance between efficacy and safety/tolerability. Furthermore, a majority of study participants [67.5% (183/271)] had an ADHD medication treatment history, with the most frequently taken medications being stimulants. Because it is beyond the scope of this primary report to examine the role of treatment history on response to SHP465 MAS, it is not known how previous stimulant treatment would influence SHP465 MAS efficacy or tolerability.</p><p id="Par40">Additionally, because the study was not powered for the assessment of changes in ADHD-RS-AP subscale scores or of dichotomized CGI-I improvement, the nominal <italic>p-</italic>values reported for those endpoints should be considered descriptive. It should also be noted that the 4-week duration of treatment was relatively short and does not allow for assessment of the long-term safety and tolerability of SHP465 MAS or of long-term clinical outcomes regarding ADHD symptoms. In addition, the current population was predominantly white and excluded individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. As such, generalizing these findings to a more diverse population of adults with ADHD should be considered cautiously because comorbidities are common in ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and their effects on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of SHP465 MAS are not known. Last, the study also excluded individuals who met BMI criteria for being very severely obese (BMI&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Although the mean BMI at baseline in this study indicates that on average study participants met BMI criteria for being overweight (BMI between 25 and 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), the exclusion of a proportion of obese individuals could limit the generalizability of these data because of the increased proportion of adults diagnosed with ADHD who meet criteria for obesity compared with adults who have not been diagnosed with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">The burden of illness of adult ADHD warrants efficacious treatment options that address ADHD symptoms. In this study, SHP465 MAS at a low dose of 12.5&#x000a0;mg/day was effective compared with placebo in alleviating adult ADHD symptoms. A dose of 37.5&#x000a0;mg/day of SHP465 MAS also demonstrated clinical efficacy, with an ES of 1.11. The safety profile of SHP465 MAS was consistent with previous observations in studies of adult ADHD treated with SHP465 MAS and other psychostimulants.
