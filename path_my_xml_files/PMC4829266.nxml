However, for the group to be successful, individuals should be able to strike a balance between their level of competence and their influence on the collective decisions. The hormone oxytocin has been shown to promote trust, conformism and attention to social cues. We wondered if this hormone may increase participants&#x02019; (unwarranted) reliance on their partners&#x02019; opinion, resulting in a reduction in collective benefit by disturbing the balance between influence and competence. To test this hypothesis we employed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design in which male dyads self-administered intranasal oxytocin or placebo and then performed a visual search task together. Compared to placebo, collective benefit did not decrease under oxytocin. Using an exploratory time dependent analysis, we observed increase in collective benefit over time under oxytocin. Moreover, trial-by-trial analysis showed that under oxytocin the more competent member of each dyad was less likely to change his mind during disagreements, while the less competent member showed a greater willingness to change his mind and conform to the opinion of his more reliable partner. This role-dependent effect may be mediated by enhanced monitoring of own and other&#x02019;s performance level under oxytocin. Such enhanced social learning could improve the balance between influence and competence and lead to efficient and beneficial collaboration.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dolan</surname><given-names>Raymond J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winston</surname><given-names>Joel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>091593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutledge</surname><given-names>Robb B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>european research council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroCoDec 309865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4852-3516</contrib-id><name><surname>Hertz</surname><given-names>Uri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroCoDec 309865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bahrami</surname><given-names>Bahador</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The European Research Council supported BB and UH,[NeuroCoDec 309865].

Groups of cooperating individuals benefit when tackling social dilemmas [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and promote common interests [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Groups also achieve collective benefit in perceptual tasks, outperforming the best individual member. However, cooperation is not always the chosen (or indeed the rational) strategy for interacting with others. Self-interest often trumps common interest, as group members make decisions aimed at maximizing their personal gain regardless of, and sometimes against, the group&#x02019;s interests [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Collective decisions can also fail when participants fail to calibrate their contribution to the group with their own performance, with poor performers tending to be overconfident and competent performers tending to be underconfident [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The problem of calibrating one&#x02019;s contribution to group performance is demonstrated by the equality bias heuristic, i.e. assuming that every group member is as competent or as reliable as everyone else [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Dyads engaged in a joint oddball detection task showed such bias, with better performers overweighting the opinions of their less competent partners during disagreements about the oddball location. This resulted in suboptimal dyadic oddball detection accuracy. A study using a similar experimental design to Mahmoodi et al. (2015) showed that administering exogenous testosterone swayed participants&#x02019; bias, rendering them more egocentric and less likely to change their mind during disagreements [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].Because testosterone&#x02019;s egocentric discounting affected both better and worse dyad members, regardless of their performance level, it deteriorated group decisions and collective benefit. Can another intervention sway the weighting of other&#x02019;s opinions to the other side, making them more allocentric, and will it have the same suboptimal effect dyadic performance as egocentric bias?</p><p>A likely candidate for shifting participants&#x02019; to the more allocentric side is the hormone oxytocin. Recent studies indicate that oxytocin can promote effective collaboration [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Exogenous oxytocin increases trust in an economic game [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], causing, on average, participants to send more money to a trustee, reinforcing the optimistic assumption that the trustee will return more than they invested, thereby increasing the benefit from social interaction. This tendency for greater optimistic risk taking in social contexts is also seen in an increased altruism under oxytocin [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. De Dreu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that, under oxytocin, participants tend contribute more to the public good and were willing to risk personal loss to that end suggesting a promotion of collaboration by reducing self-interest in social contexts. Finally, oxytocin was shown to enhance conformity to other group members [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], making participants more likely to align their views to the group&#x02019;s. Social effects of oxytocin are not always positive, and under certain experimental designs oxytocin was shown to increase negative social feelings such as envy, gloating [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and outgroup hostility [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The current experimental design does not include competition between participants, and we expected that the positive social effects of oxytocin, namely increased trust, altruism and conformity, would make the interacting partners more likely to take each other&#x02019;s view into account, making them more allocentric.</p><p>Here we tested the hypothesis that oxytocin will make participants more allocentric, i.e. more likely to change their mind during disagreements. We further hypothesised that such allocentric bias will decrease dyadic performance, as the more competent member of a dyad will tend to follow the opinions of the inferior partner during disagreements. We employed a double-blind placebo-controlled design to examine a collective benefit accrued by pairs of participants engaged in a collective perceptual decision making task, similar to the one used to demonstrate equality bias [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and egocentric discounting effect of testosterone [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this task participants first searched for a visual oddball individually and then made a joint decision on trials on which they disagreed. It is then possible to examine individual and dyadic perceptual sensitivity, and extract additional measures of collaborative behaviour such as performance similarity [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and a tendency for making egocentric joint decisions [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Importantly, and diverging from previous oxytocin studies, these measures are extracted from real-life dyadic interactions and disagreement resolution between two participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>We tested 90 healthy adult male participants (age range: 18 to 35; mean &#x000b1; SD: 23.5&#x000b1;4.0), paired into 45 dyads.

The experiment started with intranasal self-administration of oxytocin or placebo (double blind). Participants waited quietly for 20 minutes and the performed a 5-minute practice block. The experiment proper started 25 minutes after administration. The experiment duration varied but lasted at least 35 minutes in all dyads, by which time the average of 224 were carried. (B) Pairs of male participants (dyads) performed together a 2-alternative forced choice oddball detection task. Visual stimuli consisted of six vertically oriented Gabor patches displayed equidistantly around an imaginary circle. One randomly selected interval contained the target of higher contrast. Participants indicated their individual decisions privately. If they disagreed, a joint decision was negotiated and announced. Feedback about accuracy was provided. (C) Participants sat in the same testing room, each viewing his own display. Display screens were placed on separate tables at a right angle to each other. (D) We measured the proportion of trials on which the observer reported that the target was presented in the second interval in different target contrast levels, and fitted a psychometric curve to these data. For each dyad three curves were fitted: two for the individual decisions made by each dyad member, and one for the dyadic decisions. Here we depict the psychometric curves fitted to one exemplar dyad. We present the better member data (dark square) and fitted curve (dark line), worse member data and fitted curve (light line and light circles), and dyadic data and fitted curve (dark dots and dashed line).

Appearance of the content of the bottles was identical for both group members. Participant spray instructions were as per those described by Guastella et al. 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Participants first &#x02018;primed&#x02019; (pumped) the spray bottle until a fine mist appeared (2&#x02013;3 pumps) then closed one nostril with one finger while administering spray to the other nostril. The nozzle was inserted approximately 1cm into the nostril (parallel to the nasal septum) at an angle of 45&#x000b0; (from tip of nozzle to horizontal plane). Upon delivery of one puff, participants inhaled and breathed in lightly. Delivery was then alternated between nostrils until 10 puffs had been administered. The spray was administered with head in the upright position, and at least 15 seconds were allowed between each re-administration to the same nostril.</p><p>Care was taken to make sure that the placebo spray matched the experimental oxytocin spray in all respects except the active ingredient. The placebo was prepared by the Royal Free Hospital Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit (Pond Street, London UK) to match the carrier of Syntocinon (the synthetic analogue of oxytocin). Both sprays were prepared according to the European Union guidelines on good manufacturing practice. The placebo and Syntocinon spray bottles were identical in appearance with the exception of a dyad number (the content associated with dyad number was unknown to the experimenter and participants). The correspondence between group number and chemical content of the bottles was recorded in look-up table prepared and maintained by a third party who was not involved in data collection.</p><p>After spray administration was complete, participants sat quietly for 20 minutes and spent the time reading a book or magazine. They had previously been advised about this waiting period. They were not allowed to interact with each other during the waiting time. 20 minutes waiting period was chosen in order to make sure that participants will have accomplished sufficient number of collective decisions (128) within 1 hour from oxytocin/placebo administration, when peak effect of oxytocin was expected (see below).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Task Procedure</title><p>After the 20 minutes waiting period, participants performed the practice task (duration &#x02248; 5 minutes) followed by the experimental task (duration &#x02248; 36 minutes or more). The experimental timeline is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153352.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. Both dyad members performed one practice block (16 trials) and twenty experimental blocks (320 trials, lasting at least 36 minutes) of a 2-alternative forced choice visual perceptual task [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We assumed that dyads will be able to finish at least 128 trials within 35 minutes (i.e. within 1 hour from oxytocin/placebo administration), sufficient number of trials for psychophysical function fit (see below). Each trial started with a black central fixation cross (0.75 degrees visual angle). Following a variable time period, drawn uniformly from the range 500&#x02013;1000 ms, two successive observation intervals were displayed. The stimulus duration in each interval was 85 ms, and the intervals were separated by a blank display lasting 1000 ms. An &#x02018;oddball&#x02019; target (Gabor patch with higher contrast grating) occurred either in the first or second interval.</p><p>After the second interval, the fixation cross turned into a question mark, prompting participants to decide (privately) in which of the two intervals the target had occurred. Dyad members did not consult over these initial decisions and the question mark remained on screen until both had responded. The participant using the keyboard responded by pressing &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; for the first interval and &#x0201c;M&#x0201d; for the second; the participant using the mouse used the left click for indicating the first and right click for the second interval. Individual decisions were then displayed, so that both dyad members were informed of their own and their partner&#x02019;s decision. The keyboard participant&#x02019;s decision was displayed in blue text, and the mouse participant&#x02019;s decision was displayed in yellow text. Vertical locations of the blue and yellow text were randomised to avoid spatial biasing.</p><p>If the individual decisions disagreed, a joint decision was requested and one dyad member was selected to enter the decision. The person declaring the joint decision was determined according to the trial number: one dyad member (keyboard user) declared joint decisions on odd trials and the other (mouse user) on the even trials. As a consequence, because disagreements happened randomly, we did not have full control over exactly how many trials each participant would arbitrate. However, the assignment of arbitration by the odd/even trials ensured that, overall, both participants declared the joint decision equally frequently. The colour of the request text indicated which dyad member was to enter the decision (blue: keyboard participant, yellow: mouse participant). Dyads were free (and encouraged in the instructions) to verbally discuss their joint decision with each other for as long as they wanted.</p><p>In agreement trials, feedback was provided immediately after the individual decisions had been entered. In disagreement trials feedback was provided immediately after the joint decision had been entered. The feedback words, &#x0201c;Correct&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Wrong&#x0201d;, were displayed in blue text for the keyboard participant, in yellow text for the mouse participant, and in white text for the joint decision. The feedback remained on screen until the next trial was initiated by the participant responding with the keyboard, after coordinating with their partner. The participants set the pace of the experiment&#x02019;s progress, dependent upon the length of their discussions. Time stamps for all decisions (individual and dyadic level) were recorded relative to the start of the trial as well the beginning of the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Psychometric functions were constructed for each observer [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and for each dyad, by plotting the proportion of trials in which the oddball was reported in the second interval against the contrast difference at the oddball location (the contrast in the second interval minus the contrast in the first) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153352.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

We used it to allow our dyads enough time (35 minutes) to perform at least 128 trials before the peak of oxytocin effect hour after administration. As it turned up, only one dyad completed only 128 trials within 35 minutes, while the rest of the dyads were quicker, finishing 224 trials on average.

Under testosterone better members overcome this bias to become more egocentric, but worse members also become more egocentric, resulting in further decrease of collective benefit [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We hypothesised that oxytocin will have the opposite influence, pushing both dyad members to be less egocentric and similarly resulting in reduced collective benefit. However, our analysis did not show such reduction, but hinted towards advantage in collective benefit under oxytocin. To further examine this result we used an exploratory time dependent analysis, inspired by the pharmacokinetic properties of intranasal oxytocin administration, suggesting peak activity 50 minutes after oxytocin administration. We found that advantage in collective benefit under oxytocin was delayed, and temporally localized to the 49&#x02013;60 minutes window after administration. This delayed effect was accompanied with release from equality bias under oxytocin, as better members were less likely to follow the worse member&#x02019;s view, and worse members more likely to follow the better member. This effect was not observed in the standard, time invariant analysis.</p><p>There are a number of important differences between our task and design and previous studies looking at social effects of oxytocin in decision-making. Rather than employing neuroeconomic paradigms that contrast competition and cooperation through monetary exchange [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we used a visual perception task free from any element of conflict of interest [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and focused on a reduction of decision uncertainty by social interaction. The task was optimised to detect individual and group performance level independently, and to infer collective benefit. In addition, measures such as the egocentric/allocentric bias can be calculated to investigate the processes underlying joint decision making.</p><p>Another important difference between our study and previous works is the fact that we examined pairs of face-to-face interacting participants making joint decisions, while previous studies examined one participant at a time interacting with virtual or computer-based partners [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our participants had access to social cues from the other dyad member to make inferences about the partner&#x02019;s reliability and performance level. Such cues are not available when playing against a virtual player. Based on our lab&#x02019;s previous experience and in order to be able to compare these results with previous works [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we allowed the dyad members to freely discuss their views before making joint decisions. Previous investigation of the content and style of discussions in similar experiment (but without pharmaceutical intervention) showed that more successful dyads were able to better align the terms and words they used to describe their confidence level regarding the target location [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Here we did not record the content of discussions, and we cannot evaluate the idea that oxytocin dyads may have had more efficient discussions and converged to more similar confidence expressions. We recorded the duration of the discussions and did not observe any difference (oxytocin: 7103 ms, placebo: 7422 ms, p = 0.71). No difference was observed in the time dependent analysis (oxytocin: 6389ms, placebo: 6886ms, p = 0.56), although both groups displayed reduction in length of discussion as the experiment proceeded.</p><p>Finally, our design demands considerably more trials than standard economic games do in order to fit psychometric curves. We overestimated the amount of time it would take participants to complete 128 trials, and used a shorter rest period (25 minutes) than usually used (50 minutes) before starting the experiment [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We ended up with more trials done within one hour from administration than expected, which allowed us to carry an exploratory time dependent analysis, revealing the dynamics of exogenous oxytocin&#x02019;s impact on collaboration over time. This time-dependent analysis was inspired by previous estimates of the pharmacokinetic properties of intranasal oxytocin administration [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and more recent findings of behavioural impacts of oxytocin that emerged around 50&#x02013;60 minutes after administration [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We acknowledge that the pharmacokinetics of intranasal oxytocin administration are still the topic of debate, while direct measures of oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are sparse and inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The behavioural effects we observed using the time window analysis indeed peaked during the expected peak of oxytocin effect, 49&#x02013;60 minutes after administration, in agreement with a need to delay the start of the experimental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with the pharmacokinetics of intranasal oxytocin administration [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and other reported behavioural effects [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, it remains possible that the timing of the effect observed here was determined by the social nature of our task, or by its interaction with the pharmacokinetics of oxytocin. It is possible that oxytocin facilitated the social learning process by which participants gradually learned who is better and who is worse. Under placebo participants may have failed to learn who the better member is even though feedback was provided. The results should therefore not be taken as a clear indication of the exact temporal effect of oxytocin on behaviour. One way in which these hypotheses could be separately tested would be to run the experiment with longer waiting period, starting the experiment proper 50 minutes after administration for shorter duration (one time window of 15 minutes). If oxytocin enhances a slow but stable social learning process it may have no effect on collective benefit when social interaction is short. If oxytocin effect is temporally locked and transient, then it may enhance collective benefit even with no previous history of interaction.</p><p>Our results highlight the role dependent effect for oxytocin such that its effects were contingent upon a subject&#x02019;s relative performance level. Under oxytocin dyad members settled disagreements according to performance level within the dyad, resulting in a disposition for the better dyad to adhere to their initial decisions and the less sensitive member to change their mind. We suggest that enhanced monitoring of own and other&#x02019;s performance may underlay the effect of oxytocin on collective decision making. When performing a shared or collaborative task one needs to monitor his own performance, his partner&#x02019;s performance and the task at hand. Here, in order to learn who is better and who is worse one has to monitor his and other&#x02019;s individual responses, feedback and stimuli. Oxytocin may enhance such monitoring processes and social learning, giving rise to the observed role dependent adjustment of behaviour. We speculate that this may be mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), area associated with monitoring of errors for oneself and others [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and an area greatly affected by oxytocin [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Enhanced monitoring of self and other&#x02019;s performance and errors may contribute to accurate estimation of one&#x02019;s relative performance level within the dyad. Dyad members adjusted the number of mind changes during disagreements according to their relative performance, and were less affected by equality bias [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This role dependent effect is in line with the more general notion of context dependent oxytocin effect [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Bartz et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] suggested that oxytocin may not exert a single stable effect, as implied for example by the term &#x0201c;love hormone&#x0201d;, which implies the same effect on behaviour regardless of task, person, and social context. Instead, our data suggest its effect is highly context and person dependant, and this might result in apparently contradictory behaviours under different circumstances. For example, while oxytocin has been shown to increase trusting behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], this effect disappears if the potential trustee is portrayed as untrustworthy [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] or is unknown [<xref rid="pone.0153352.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>To conclude, using an exploratory time dependent analysis we observed a delayed and role-dependent effect of oxytocin on collective decision making. Under oxytocin participants were released from equality bias and accrued higher collective benefit 50 minutes after administration. We suggest that this effect is mediated by enhanced monitoring of own and other&#x02019;s performance. Enhanced monitoring allowed participants to recognize their relative role in the dyad increasing the efficiency of collective decisions during disagreements. The role dependent effect of oxytocin observed here emphasises the importance of context in effects of exogenous oxytocin, as it may produce contradictory behaviour under different circumstances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153352.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Two CSV files contain the data from 43 dyads in our two analysis approaches: whole data and time analysis.</title><p>Whole date table columns are: dyadic treatment (Oxytocin = 1, Placebo = 0), dyad slope (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>), better member (Max) slope, worse member (Min) slope, total number of trials performed, number of disagreement trials, number of disagreement arbitrated by Max, number of mind changes during disagreements arbitrated by Max, number of disagreement arbitrated by Min, number of mind changes during disagreements arbitrated by Min, time from beginning of experiment in minutes (experiment starts 25 minutes after administration).
