Patients were assessed at different periods. Primary end point was relapse rate; secondary end points included response, remission rate and adverse effects. 52 patients were in Group I and 50 in Group II. At 1 month, both groups achieved obvious improvement. Accumulated relapse rate during 1 year was 38.5% in Group 1, including 12 cases with clinical relapse and 8 patients manifesting only serological relapse; whereas there was 12.0% of relapse in Group 2, only 1 with clinical relapse and other 5 patients got serological relapse. The mean flare time in Group II was significantly longer than that in Group I. All relapsing patients in Group I were sensitive to immunosuppressants. Most patients involving more than 6 organs in Group I relapsed during 1 year. IgG4 levels of relapse cases were significantly higher than non-relapsing patients at baseline. Bile duct, lacrimal glands and lymph nodes were commonly relapsed organs in Group I.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a newly recognized systemic disease characterized by multiple sites swelling, which are caused by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and sclerosis, combined with elevated serum IgG4 levels and infiltration of IgG4 positive plasma cells in the involved organs and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">Although glucocorticoids therapy has been shown effective for patients with IgG4-RD, few prospective studies have analyzed the effect of CYC or other immunosuppressant agents in this disease. In the first international consensus guidance statement on the management and treatment of IgG4-RD, the opinion among experts on the statement of using of steroid-sparing agents was split (46% agreement)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, because till now there has been no good evidence for immunosuppressant agents in treating IgG4-RD. This study was a prospective non-randomized controlled clinical trial, in which we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids and CYC versus glucocorticoids monotherapy.</p><p id="Par35">The major salivary glands, lymph nodes and pancreas were the most frequently affected anatomical sites in this study, similar to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Clinical manifestations were protean and varied according to the different organ involvement. There was no significant difference of clinical features at baseline between patients treated with glucocorticoids monotherapy and prednisone combined with CYC. Not only did disease flares occur in 39% of the patients over one year of treatment despite receiving ongoing prednisone of not less than 5&#x02009;mg/day, it also seems that only 25% (13 of 52 patients) achieved complete remission in Group I, which suggested the poor ability of glucocorticoids monotherapy to achieve sustained disease control of IgG4-RD. However, the patients treated with glucocorticoids and CYC had significantly higher incidence of CR rate, lower occurrence of relapse rate and longer relapse time than glucocorticoids monotherapy. Therefore, glucocorticoids combined CYC treatment were more efficacious and preventing from disease flare better than glucocorticoids monotherapy.</p><p id="Par36">Bile duct, lacrimal glands, lymph node and pancreas were frequently relapsed organs in Group 1, accounting for 13.33%, 12.50%, 11.76%, and 8.33% respectively, shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, while only 1 patient had pancreas recurrence in Group 2. No certain organ involved predicted disease relapse to treatment, but most of patients relapsed after 3 months when having more than 6 organs involved who were treated with prednisone alone, and relapsing patients had significantly higher IgG4 levels than non-relapsing patients at baseline. As a consequence, it was clear that combined treatment of CYC decreased organs recurrence greatly and maintained disease remission. The patients with more than 6 organs involved should accept treatment of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressant agents at the beginning to prevent relapse. Besides, serum IgG4 level should be considered as a useful tool for therapy purpose.</p><p id="Par37">All the relapsing IgG4-RD patients in Group 1 accepted immunosuppressant agents therapy after disease flare, achieving CR or PR for a long time; only 1 relapsing IgG4-RD&#x000a0;patient developed to diffuse large B cell lymphoma. No difference of the total response rate was found between 2 groups at 12 months. Hence, we concluded that immunosuppressant agents had a good effect on most of relapsing IgG4-RD patients accepting therapy of glucocorticoids alone at initial.</p><p id="Par38">Long term cyclophosphomide toxicity was observed in our patients. Patients were monitored for a median follow-up period of 24.45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.37 (15~36) months. After 1 year, CYC could be changed to other immunosuppressant agents, including methotrexate, leflunomide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil etc. No long term toxicity such as bladder cancer was reported.</p><p id="Par39">Our study also has some limitations, due to its non-randomized trait, leaving room for potential bias, but it worked almost as well as a matched study because the baseline characteristics showed no statistical differences between the 2 groups. The other concerning aspect is that the study is not blinded to doctors, which might affect disease activity and relapse assessment.</p><p id="Par40">In conclusion, glucocorticoids monotherapy is an efficient treatment for IgG4-RD patients, having almost the same effect as glucocorticoids and CYC at the initial stage, but glucocorticoids combined CYC treatment had better effect and lower relapse rate than glucocorticoids monotherapy overtime. The patients with more than 6 organs involved should receive glucocorticoids and immunosuppressant agents treatment at the onset. Immunosuppressant agents were efficacious for most relapsing patients treated with glucocorticoids alone.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
