Although numerous proof of principal studies have been reported, limited randomized controlled trials (RCT) data have been published to date comparing noninvasive metabolomic analysis versus morphology alone for embryo evaluation. In two studies, using a non-commercialized version of the NIR instrumentation, no additional benefit was found when using this technology to rank the metabolic profile of similar embryos of good morphology prior to single embryo transfer (SET) on Days 5[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] and 3.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] A slight advantage was, however, reported when performing Day 2 SET.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>The aim of the study was to compare the novel noninvasive metabolomic profiling and the traditional method of morphology assessment for embryo selection in terms of implantation and pregnancy rates in a clinical IVF program.

Frozen-thawed cycles and cycles with oocyte donation or testicular biopsy were excluded from the study. Patients were allocated to embryo selection using either metabolomic analysis combined with embryo morphology (metabolomics + morphology group) or embryo morphology only (morphology group). We used an unequal randomization (ratio metabolomics + morphology: Routine morphology = 1:2) in order to reduce trial costs,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] as the study was self-funded and part of the cost of the sample cells would have to be covered by the patients. Allocation to the metabolomics + morphology or morphology groups was performed on the day of fertilization assessment (Day 1 postoocyte retrieval) by a study nurse using sealed envelopes following a computer-generated random allocation sequence. Neither patients nor doctors were blinded to the treatment assigned. Patients underwent embryo transfer on either Days 2, 3, or 5 according to the clinical protocol and previous history.

Oocytes were fertilized by IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and fertilization was assessed 16-20 h postinsemination. Fertilized oocytes were individually cultured for 2, 3, or 5 days in 25 &#x003bc;l drops of sequential culture media (ISM1/BlastAssist; Origio, Denmark). Control culture media were incubated during this period under the same conditions. Embryo transfer using ultrasound guidance was performed 2, 3, or 5 days after oocyte retrieval, depending on patient history and embryo characteristics. Luteal phase support with 600 mg of micronized progesterone (Utrogestan Laboratoires Besins-International S.A., France) was initiated 2 days after oocyte retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Embryo selection based on noninvasive metabolomic profiling</title><p>In patients allocated to the metabolomics + morphology group, all embryos of similar good morphology from each patient's cohort were metabolically evaluated using Viametrics-E and ranked on the day of embryo transfer according to their Viability Score. Briefly, 10 &#x003bc;l of media samples of each embryo were loaded into specialized spectrometer-compatible sample cells and placed in a temperature equilibration chamber (21&#x000b0;C). After 4 minutes, sample cells were placed in an indium-gallium-arsenide array-based 512 element NIR spectrometer with a wavelength of 920-1675 nm (ViaMetrics-E, Molecular Biometrics, USA) for spectral analysis. Measurements of each sample and corresponding controls were repeated three times. Specific biomarkers, corresponding to unique functional groups of molecules had been previously identified from training samples[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] by Molecular Biometrics Inc. Therefore, spent medium of a particular embryo generates a spectrum due to vibrations of specific functional groups including N&#x02013;H, C&#x02013;H, O&#x02013;H, and S&#x02013;H. The intensity of the light absorbed can be determined by analysis of the resulting spectra and is directly proportional to the concentrations of molecules, such as albumin, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, and glucose, in the sample.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] The unique metabolomic profile of each embryo was then quantified into a Viability Score, using a wavelength selective algorithm specific for Days 2, 3, or 5 transfers. The algorithms were preprogrammed into the commercial version of the instrumentation. The resulting Viability Score is a quantitative measurement of an embryo's potential to establish a pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity (FCA). The acceptable range for the Viability score was from 0 (lowest score) to 1 (highest score). When the viability score fell outside this range (&#x0003e;0 or &#x0003c;1), the corresponding embryo was either cryopreserved or discarded depending on the morphology grade allocated. One to four embryos with the highest-ranking viability scores were selected for transfer either on Days 2, 3 or 5, taking into account national legislation, patient's age and previous and current cycle characteristics. In split IVF/ICSI cases, embryos with the best viability scores were selected for transfer, irrespective of fertilization method. All patients in the metabolomics + morphology group underwent embryo transfer (ET).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Embryo selection based on morphology assessment</title><p>In patients allocated to the morphology group, embryo selection was based solely on morphological characteristics. Cleavage-stage embryos were assessed based on morphological criteria (number, size and shape of blastomeres, degree of fragmentation, multinucleation, appearance of cytoplasm), and were categorized in four grades [grade 1 (highest) to grade 4 (lowest)]. Embryos with 2-4 cells on Day 2 and embryos with 6-8 cells on Day 3 and &#x0003e;20% fragmentation were regarded as good quality embryos (grades 1 and 2).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] In the case of blastocysts, degree of expansion, inner cell mass, and trophectoderm were graded according to a scoring system previously described.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] One to four embryos with the highest morphology grade were selected for transfer either on Days 2, 3, or 5, taking into account national legislation, patient's age and previous and current cycle characteristics.

This is one of the first randomized controlled studies comparing IVF outcomes after embryo selection based on noninvasive metabolomic profiling versus traditional morphology assessment, and the first to use a commercial version of the ViaMetrics-E instrumentation, as distinct from two other RCTs,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] which involved earlier noncommercial versions.</p><p>Our results indicate a significant increase in ongoing IRs with positive FCA following embryo selection based on noninvasive metabolomic analysis combined with morphology on Day 5, but not on Days 2 and 3. In two previous studies, using a noncommercialized NIR version and SET, no beneficial effect on implantation and pregnancy rates was found when using this technology to rank the metabolic profile of similar embryos of good morphology on Day 5[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] and Day 3,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] while a slight advantage was reported when performing Day 2 SET.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the increased IRs in the metabolomics + morphology group for Day 5 transfers suggest that the commercial NIR instrument may have enhanced the identification of blastocysts with the highest developmental competence. However, the fact that pregnancy and live birth rates were similar, despite the higher IRs in the metabolomics + morphology group on Day 5, may be explained by the higher, although nonsignificant increase in twin and triplet rates in the metabolomics + morphology group, combined with higher clinical miscarriage rates in the morphology group. Interestingly, the publication of Hardarson <italic>et al.</italic>, showed that the NIR instrument was least effective on Day 5 transfers.</p><p>Our initial experience with the commercial version of the NIR instrument showed that Viametrics-E was easily implemented in routine clinical practice and was not disruptive to everyday laboratory procedures. The method yielded the viability score for each assayed embryo in a rapid and straightforward manner, facilitating the real time clinical decision of embryo selection.</p><p>Our data show that the Viability Score was not correlated with embryo morphology grade on Days 2, 3, and 5, corroborating previous studies reporting that the viability score is independent of morphology grades for Days 2 and 3 embryos[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] and for Day 5 blastocysts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Moreover, it has been shown that 75.4% of embryos with the best morphology did not have the highest viability score.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Therefore, it is suggested that metabolomic profiling of embryos may indeed provide an objective secondary level of assessment as an adjunct to embryo morphology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>The present study was terminated prematurely in December 2010, before achieving statistical power, following the voluntary market withdrawal of ViaMetrics-E due to variability in scores and a susceptibility of the algorithms to noise. Briefly, it was reported by the manufacturer that some of the commercial instruments showed variation in repeatability within the instrument, but more concerning was a larger problem with reproducibility between instruments. This translated to individual algorithms created on master instruments being vulnerable to noise and other factors when loaded on other instruments. In effect, it may have been that although some benefits were seen in our clinic, they may not have been transferable to other clinics using different instruments. The present study set out to describe our Unit's experience using the commercial NIR instrument of ViaMetrics-E. It shows that despite the aforementioned drawbacks of the instrument, the philosophy and the principles behind the method are valid and interesting to investigate. This is the only report on the use of ViaMetrics-E, which shows that the use of Viametrics-E was not harmful, but also gave higher IRs for blastocyst transfers on Day 5. There is no question that a new version should be developed, which will require stringent validation before commercial launch.</p><p>Indeed, larger studies using SET have been conducted using prototype NIR instruments to assess the precision and reproducibility of the Viability Score, and to evaluate the efficacy of the method in identifying the single best embryo of a patient's cohort. Two of those SET studies have failed to show a difference in implantation, clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates using metabolomic profiling of spent embryo culture media.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] In light of our data, showing higher IRs on Day 5 with multiple embryo transfers, this could be an indication that score variability may increase the chance of failure to identify the most viable embryo in a SET scenario. The following possibilities exist: (i) That this particular instrument was less susceptible to noise and that the algorithm was more likely to examine the correct spectral profile and/or (ii) that when transferring multiple embryos the instrument had a greater chance to have measured the correct signal in one of those embryos when compared with the more stringent test of having to get the score correct every time with a SET.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that metabolomic analysis using the commercial Viametrics-E does not appear to have a significant beneficial effect on pregnancy and live birth rates, with a marginal improvement in IRs with FCA for Day 5 transfers. A limited number of patients were included in the study due to the early withdrawal of the current instrument, and therefore the data presented here should be viewed with caution. It is anticipated that reduction of score variability and improvement of the instrument platform may yet provide a feasible system for the rapid, noninvasive assessment of embryos prior to transfer.
