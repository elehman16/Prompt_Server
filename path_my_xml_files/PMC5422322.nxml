It should represent an important component of the medical syllabus. However, it is often overlooked by the formal courses at universities. The current study aimed at evaluating whether the interactive educational models, recently adopted by the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, at the University of Genoa, Italy, would favor the adoption of critical thinking, attitudes to changes, cultural diversity acceptance, and the adoption of relational soft skills versus traditional and frontal didactic teaching. Thirty students, who attended the last year of health care professional course at the Faculty of Medicine, volunteered to take part in the study and were randomly allocated to two groups: one group receiving an innovative, interactive excellence course and the other group receiving a more traditional approach. Ethnopsychiatry was chosen as the topic since it was hypothesized that it would have contributed to generation of a new approach toward diseases and patients. The first group of students, exposed to interactive lectures with the aim of promoting the adoption of critical thinking, were more satisfied than the second group. Participants who were involved in an active manner and had to work in small groups, actively finding their own solutions to solve the problems, perceived the utilized teaching method and experience more stimulating, involving, and effective. Implications for education policy makers are also envisaged.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>creative thinking</kwd><kwd>clinical case/example</kwd><kwd>medical education</kwd><kwd>medical syllabus</kwd><kwd>medical teaching</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Creativity is an ability that plays a major role in the modern economy and society.<xref rid="b1-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As stated by the European Parliament and Committee (2009), instruction and vocational training should foster creativity and propensity to innovation, as vital life skills.<xref rid="b4-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>It is particularly difficult and challenging to define creativity.

For Morin, creativity, meant as ability to ask new questions, to generate a high variety of ideas, and to reflect about the solving problems process, represents a strategic resource that needs to be cultivated, recognized, and developed.<xref rid="b18-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Thus, cognitive and meta-cognitive skills such as critical and reflexive thinking are also required,<xref rid="b20-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> as Piaget has also claimed.<xref rid="b23-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Critical thinking can be defined as the &#x0201c;ability/process of raising discriminating questions in an attempt to search for better ideas, a deeper understanding and better solutions.&#x0201d;<xref rid="b2-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b24-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>In particular, in the field of medical education, critical thinking should play a major role in the medical syllabus.<xref rid="b24-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The extant literature shows that long-term tutors, problem-based learning (PBL), workshops, web-based tutorials, role-playing games (RPGs), and clinically oriented courses seem to favor critical thinking and foster critical thinking and creativity.<xref rid="b24-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Therefore, universities should adopt innovative and interactive methodologies<xref rid="b26-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and integrate traditional and new ways of teaching different paradigms for learning.<xref rid="b30-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This is especially true for health care courses and degrees<xref rid="b31-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> in that health care workers often make use of these skills and abilities to make clinical decisions.<xref rid="b32-amep-8-321" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Aims of the current study</title><p>The current study aimed at evaluating whether
