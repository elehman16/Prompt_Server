basal brain-derived neurotrophic factor in athletic adolescents. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty-two male adolescents participated in this study. The subjects were divided into a
control group (n=9) and trained group (n=13). The trained group comprised table tennis
athletes with more than 3&#x02005;years of training who regularly exercised 18 hours per week.
[Results] The results of this study show the trained group had significantly lower basal
brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels than the control group. Further, platelet levels
were significantly higher in the trained group than in the control group. However, no
significant differences were observed between the groups in serum nerve growth factor
level or physical characteristics (body weight, body mass index, fasting blood glucose).
[Conclusion] This study showed that the basal brain-derived neurotrophic factor level of
well-trained athletic adolescents was lower than that of the control group. Further
research with a larger sample size is required to confirm the finding that lower basal
brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are associated with long-term habitual exercise
in athletic adolescents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BDNF</kwd><kwd>NGF</kwd><kwd>Adolescent</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Multiple studies investigating the effects of acute or regular exercise on changes in
neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF),
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), etc. have
been recently conducted. Central BDNF exerts a positive influence on neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, and hippocampal neural plasticity, all of which help promote memory and
learning<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, BDNF is the
primary neurotrophic factor in the brain, and is involved in the neural activities of the
central and peripheral nervous systems; therefore, the BDNF level can exert a significant
effect on human neural physiology. During learning and memory, higher-order thinking
requires hippocampal activation; the cortex, cerebellum, and basal forebrain are also
activated. These regions play an important role in long-term memory formation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lower resting levels of BDNF are observed
in patients with obesity, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, Huntington&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and depression<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a study of elderly women suggested that plasma BDNF is a
biological marker of general cognitive function and memory impairment<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition to the association of low resting BDNF levels with these diseases, some studies
have suggested that lower resting BDNF levels are found in well-trained athletes<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, or
in people who have habitually trained for a long time<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. These studies attracted our interest. Our research differs
considerably from previous research because our target group was adolescents, and
adolescence is an important period of growth and development. The subjects of previous
studies who showed lower BDNF levels were well-trained adults between 20 and 50&#x02005;years of
age, and our present findings appear to confirm these previous adult findings in an
adolescent population.</p><p>Although recent research has suggested there is an effect of exercise on neurotrophic
factors, the claim that regular training and long-term exercising alters the basal BDNF
level remains controversial. It is important to study basal BDNF levels during the critical
development period of adolescence. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the
impact of exercise training on basal BDNF in athletic adolescents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-two adolescents participated in this study. They were assigned to either the control
group (CG, n=9) or the trained group (TG, n=13). All the participants were male and between
the ages of 14 and 18&#x02005;years. The TG was comprised of elite table tennis athletes who had
participated in a regular exercise program for an average of 18 hours per week for more than
3&#x02005;years. Subjects in the CG had not participated in any regular exercise program for more
than 1&#x02005;year. The CG was age-matched to the TG.</p><p>All subjects underwent a medical examination performed by a medical specialist before
inclusion in the study. The study conformed to the principles of the latest revision of the
Declaration of Helsinki, and all subjects read and signed a written informed consent
statement consistent with the guidelines of the Department of Taekwondo at Youngsan
University. In addition, signed consent forms were obtained from the guardians of all the
participants before their participation in the study.</p><p>Physical characteristics [height, weight, and body mass index (BMI)] were measured using a
height/weight analyzer (Venus 5.5, Jawon Medical, Gyeongsan, Korea). Blood samples were
drawn from a forearm vein after a 12-hour fast. The samples were centrifuged at 3,000&#x02005;rpm
for 10 minutes and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02005;&#x000b0;C until analysis. To avoid changes in parameters induced
by continuous training, the TG did not train or compete for at least 24 hours before blood
sampling.</p><p>Serum NGF was measured biochemically with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the
quantitative detection of human NGF (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Serum NGF was quantified
using polyclonal antibodies recognizing native human NGF in wells coated with predetermined
amounts of recombinant human NGF.</p><p>Serum BDNF levels were analyzed with an R&#x00026;D system (Minneapolis, MN, USA) kit using a
Sino Biological kit (Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China). First, the antibody was
incubated overnight and washed 3 times. Next, the samples and standard were reacted with the
detection antibody. Then, substrate solution and streptavidin-HRP were added. The reaction
was terminated with a stop solution, and the results were obtained by measuring the optical
density at 450&#x02005;nm.</p><p>Fasting blood glucose (FBG), white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin
(Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelets, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG)
were determined using enzymatic methods.</p><p>For all data, means and standard deviations were calculated using SPSS for Windows version
14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Data are shown as means &#x000b1; standard deviations. Comparisons
between CG and TG were performed using the unpaired Student&#x02019;s t-test. Statistical
significance was accepted for values of &#x003b1;&#x02264;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Subject characteristics are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

adolescents. The basal BDNF level increases during acute exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, suggesting it would increase with long-term aerobic
training<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, basal BDNF in
athletes appears to be reduced by habitual exercising and training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Contrary to this finding, some trained subjects in
another study had particularly high basal levels of BDNF, but this was not discussed by the
researchers<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
the well-trained group was initially expected to have high levels of basal BDNF, but, in
contrast, the well-trained group had lower levels of basal BDNF. Nofuji et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested two potential explanations for
lower BDNF levels in well-trained athletes: that an increase in BDNF release from platelets
is responsible for the repair of damaged tissue; and that BDNF production is not necessary
in a well-trained group.</p><p>The first hypothesizes is based on the fact that more than 90% of blood BDNF proteins is
stored in platelets and then released through platelet activation or during the clotting
process<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise causes functional stress and muscle damage<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since most athletes do a lot of
high-intensity training, damaged tissue must be continuously repaired, and BDNF would play a
role in this process of recovery from injury and trauma<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our present results support this hypothesis as the TG had
significantly higher platelet levels than the CG. Referring to the literature, it was found
that previous general exercise research had sufficiently predictable results. Our research
was limited in that the level of BDNF in platelets was not measured, and future research
measuring platelet BDNF levels is required to support this hypothesis.</p><p>The second hypothesizes involves the role of BDNF in food intake, weight control, appetite
suppression<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, and increased glucose and lipid metabolism<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Well-trained groups require little BDNF for the
regulation of food intake and energy balance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reduction in serum BDNF may reflect an exercise training
adaptation of decreased BDNF synthesis and/or increased consumption by the central nervous
system, and this also requires further investigation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and should be a point of focus. According to Babadi et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, one bout of aerobic and anaerobic exercise
increased BDNF immediately after exercise in both control and well-trained groups. However,
in the well-trained group, the increase in BDNF was relatively small, because the generation
of BDNF would not be necessary in the well-trained group. It is our opinion that this second
hypothesis is also correct. Currie et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>
observed reduced basal BDNF levels in a physically active group along with greater BDNF
uptake and efficiency in the central nervous system. Altogether, the evidence from the
literature indicates lower levels of basal BDNF in well-trained groups<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and inverse correlations between BDNF and energy
consumption/VO<sub>2max</sub><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and between BDNF and better
intermediate-term memory<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is evident
that regular physical activity is associated with lower basal BDNF levels. Similar to
previous research<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, a difference was observed
in basal BDNF levels in the present study: TG had significantly reduced levels of BDNF
compared to CG. However, the present study provided limited evidence to clarify the
responsible mechanisms for lower BDNF in well-trained athletes. In order to study these
mechanisms, future studies involving measurement of BDNF in athletes and long-term
exercisers, as well as measurement of BDNF levels in platelets will be necessary. These
future studies should include larger numbers of participants to enhance their statistical
power.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a 2014 research grant from Youngsan University, Republic of
