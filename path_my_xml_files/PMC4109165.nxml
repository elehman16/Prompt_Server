that is characterized by narrowing of the spinal canal, lateral recesses, and/or
neuroforamina that causes encroachment of surrounding soft tissue on the thecal sac
and exiting nerve roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The natural history of LSS includes disease progression that may cause
symptomatic neurogenic claudication, including pain in the buttocks or legs that is
often exacerbated by standing, ambulating, and trunk extension. One of the classic
features of LSS is pain alleviation with sitting or by standing/walking in a
slightly flexed lumbar position.</p><p>The long-term effectiveness of nonsurgical LSS treatments such as activity
modification, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, and epidural steroid
injections is limited since these modalities have no impact on the rate of disease
progression nor do they directly modify the diameter of the spinal canal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In fact, 4 in 10 patients treated with conservative measures ultimately
require decompressive surgery within 10&#x000a0;years due to symptom recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the potential for relief of claudication symptoms must be
carefully balanced against the risks of treatment failure and surgical
complications, particularly in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There is a distinct treatment gap for patients with LSS who have
unsuccessfully exhausted conservative treatments but whose symptom severity does not
justify undergoing invasive decompression surgery.</p><p>Interspinous spacers are promising minimally invasive treatment alternatives for
patients with persistent symptoms of LSS. Interspinous spacers are delivered via
small, minimally traumatic incisions and implanted between contiguous spinous
processes of a stenotic lumbar segment, with the goal of limiting back extension at
the symptomatic level and alleviating neurogenic claudication symptoms. The purpose
of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was to compare 2-year
outcomes in patients treated with an investigational interspinous spacer or a Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved interspinous spacer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>This clinical trial was conducted in strict accordance with a predefined protocol

assessment for study eligibility based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Radiographic assessments included x-rays (standing A/P, lateral lumbar,
flexion/extension lateral lumbar) and magnetic resonance imaging or computed
tomography of the lumbar spine. Self-reported measures included the Zurich
Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], a 100&#x000a0;mm visual analogue scale for extremity and axial pain
severity, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (version 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Devices</title><p>Patients were randomized to treatment with the Superion Interspinous Spacer
(VertiFlex, Inc., San Clemente, CA, USA) or a Control spacer (X-Stop
Interspinous Process Decompression System; Medtronic, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
The Superion device (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) is an investigational device that is composed of titanium
6AI-4&#x000a0;V ELI alloy, a material that conforms to ASTM standards for surgical
implants and commonly used in a variety of orthopedic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Five device sizes are available, ranging from 8 to 16&#x000a0;mm, with
each size corresponding to the magnitude of desired distraction between the two
spinous processes. This single-piece, self-expanding implant is delivered via
minimally invasive access and deployed between the spinous processes of the
involved vertebral levels. The Control spacer was approved for use in the United
States by the FDA in November 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Procedural details have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interspinous spacers were implanted at 1 (51%) or 2 (49%) levels,
with a comparable distribution between groups.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(A) A/P and (B) lateral radiographic image showing a properly placed

A/P, lateral lumbar, and flexion/extension lateral lumbar x-rays. Postoperative
care was prescribed according to individual subject needs and typically included
medications, bracing, and/or physical therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Treatment groups were randomly assigned using computer-generated codes. Site

and effective treatment options. Interspinous spacers represent a viable treatment
alternative for these patients that bridge the gap between conservative care and
decompression surgery. The 2-year clinical outcomes of this trial demonstrate
clinically meaningful improvements in back function, back pain, and leg pain in
patients treated with the Experimental and Control interspinous spacers.</p><p>The mid-term effectiveness of the Experimental device is comparable to data reported
in two previous studies. Bini and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] reported 1-year outcomes of 52 patients treated with the Experimental
device for moderate LSS. In that study, axial pain severity improved 49%
(p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), extremity pain severity improved 53%
(p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and back function improved 64%
(p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Shabat and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] treated 53 patients with the Experimental device for moderate LSS and
reported clinical outcomes through 2&#x000a0;years. Similarly, axial pain severity
improved 54%, extremity pain severity improved 54%, back function improved 50%, ZCQ
symptom severity improved 43%, ZCQ physical function improved 44%, and mean ZCQ
patient satisfaction at 2&#x000a0;years was 1.9. Overall, the collective experience
with the Experimental device to date suggests durable neurogenic claudication
symptom amelioration. The effectiveness of the Experimental device in relieving
symptoms of neurogenic claudication, the hallmark symptom of LSS, was particularly
impressive with clinical success achieved in 8 in 10 patients in the current
trial.</p><p>Data from the current study as well as from previous studies suggest that mid-term
treatment effectiveness with interspinous spacers is comparable to that of open
decompression surgery for moderate LSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The primary advantage of interspinous spacers is the minimally invasive
approach, which is in stark contrast to the extensive resection of muscle, ligament,
and bone that is typically required for traditional open decompression surgery. The
specific procedural benefits of the Experimental procedure include a midline
incision of only 1&#x000a0;cm, minimal disruption of the supraspinous ligament with
preservation of the lamina and posterior ligamentous structures, short procedure
time, and minimal blood loss. The lack of iatrogenic insult and associated
complications combined with the postulated mechanism of action of immediate widening
the spinal canal leads to rapid symptom improvement as evidenced by clinically
meaningful neurogenic claudication symptom improvements at hospital discharge.</p><p>While the results of the present study are encouraging, the long-term durability of
interspinous spacers is currently unknown and requires further study. Subjects in
this trial will be followed through 5&#x000a0;years post-treatment. Although the
clinical outcomes found in this study following treatment with the Experimental and
Control spacers appear to be consistent with prior studies of open or minimally
invasive decompression surgery, these decompression techniques were not directly
compared with the Experimental device in this study, and thus comparisons of
outcomes should be made with caution. With regard to patients with preoperative
spondylolisthesis, long-term clinical outcomes with interspinous spacers were
similar to those in patients without pre-existing spondylolisthesis. However, this
study did not report the radiographic change in spondylolisthesis over time.
Finally, we partly attribute the favorable results and low complication rates with
both devices to the rigorous clinical and radiographic criteria employed in this
clinical study. However, the generalizability of these outcomes to a real-world
setting in patients with moderate LSS is unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both interspinous spacers effectively improved neurogenic claudication symptoms
