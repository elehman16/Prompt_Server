Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Patients with tricompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were allergy to TEA, rheumatoid arthritis, revision total knee arthroplasty, coagulopathy (preoperative platelet count &#x02264;1,50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, BT, PT, CT abnormality), previous history of thromboembolic disease (cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction), severe ischemic heart disease, NYHA class 3 and 4, serum creatinine &#x0003e;1.5 mg/dL, severe pulmonary disease, e.g. FEV1 &#x02264;50% normal, hepatic failure and preoperative anemia (Hb &#x0003c;10 g/dL). The patients were not controlled for intake of drugs that are known to prolong bleeding time.</p><p>Randomization was computerized and a total of 56 patients were part of the study. They were further divided into the control unilateral group (CU), control bilateral group (CB), TEA unilateral group (TU) and TEA bilateral group (TB). Thus, there were 14 patients in each group. A clinical orthopedic nurse who otherwise was not part of the study carried out the doses schedule. Preoperative data were entered on an excel sheet. There were no differences between the groups preoperatively and the patients were age and sex matched. Patients in the study group received three intravenous administrations of TEA at a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight. The first dose was prior to inflation of the tourniquet after induction, the second dose was 4 h after the first dose either in the recovery room or in the ward and the third dose was after 12 h of the first dose. Patients in the control group received normal saline (NS) at the same time intervals, i.e. 0, 4 and 12 h. This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study where the surgeon and the patient were both blinded. Using a computer, with the anesthetist being aware of the selection, the patients were randomized into groups. The surgeon and the patient were both unaware to which group of the four the patient being operated belonged to. A clinical orthopedic nurse carried out the doses schedule and administration of the drugs; she was not part of the study in data recording or interpretation.</p><p>Anesthesia was standardized and all the patients received general anesthesia with femoral nerve block. A bolus of 20 mL, 0.5% Bupivacaine was administered through the catheter at insertion followed by a continuous infusion started postoperatively. Femoral nerve block catheter was removed on the second postoperative day. A dose of 2 g Inj. Cefazolin was given intravenously shortly before the operation. A tourniquet was placed around the upper thigh and inflated to 300 mmHg after exsanguinating with an esmarch bandage. The tourniquet was released before skin closure. Coagulation was achieved with a cautery. An anterior midline skin incision was used followed by the subvastus approach in all the cases. All patients were operated by a single orthopedic surgeon using flexion &#x02014; balancing instrumentation (Zimmer FBI &#x02014; USA) and the same implants (Zimmer Nexgen &#x02014; USA). Antibiotic-impregnated Palacos cement was used in all the cases. The hole created for the intramedullary guide of the femur was occluded with bone before implantation of the femoral component. In each knee, one intraarticular drain (10-gauge) was used and connected to a vacuum drain bottle. For postoperative analgesia, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) was administered using Fentanyl citrate. Postoperative analgesic techniques were used so as to keep the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) less than or equal to 3 on a 10-point scale (0-no pain, 10-worst imaginable pain). All the knees were placed in compressive bandages. The patients were asked to perform a mechanical ankle pumping exercise regimen for DVT prophylaxis as soon as possible. Physiotherapy was started on the first day after surgery, and all drains were removed 48 h postoperatively.</p><p>Measuring the volume in the suction apparatus and estimating blood loss by weighing the sponges recorded the approximate blood loss at the end of surgery. Postoperative blood loss was recorded from the drain bottle at 24 h and on drain removal at 48 h. The blood Hb concentration was determined preoperatively on the morning of first, second, fourth and seventh postoperative days. For both lower limbs, Venous Color Doppler was performed in all the patients on the fifth postoperative day or earlier if the patient was symptomatic. All our patients received DVT prophylaxis in the form of inj. dalteparin sodium 5000 IU SC for 5 days or tablet rivaroxaban 10 mg for 10 days. Along with this, a mechanical DVT prophylaxis in the form of pump or DVT stockings was given.</p><p>The indication of blood transfusion in our department was not set at a specific value of Hb concentration or hematocrit levels. Each transfusion was prescribed with regard to patient's cardiovascular history, present status and fall in Hb level, rate of blood loss and age. As a rule of thumb, we considered that blood transfusion was indicated at an Hb concentration below 8 g/dL. Also, the physicians who ordered blood transfusion were blinded in the study; they were not aware as to which group the patient being treated belonged to as the clinical orthopedic nurse who otherwise was not part of the study carried out the doses schedule and drug administration. Blood transfusions were recorded as the number of units of packed erythrocytes. We determined differences in the mean age, preoperative hemoglobin, volume of drained blood, decrease in hemoglobin postoperatively and the mean number of transfused units between the TEA and the control groups.</p><p>All continuous data are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) and Chi square test was used for statistical analysis. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Mean age in the control unilateral group and the TEA unilateral group was 63.79 years and 66.79 years, respectively.

There are various methods of administering TEA to reduce blood loss in TKA: Intramuscular, oral, intravenous and intraarticular.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The time taken for maximum plasma levels of TEA to reach ranges from 30 min for intramuscular to 5-15 min for intravenous administration. An intravenous injection for patients undergoing TKA is the best method for rapidly increasing and maintaining the therapeutic concentration of TEA.</p><p>However, there is no consensus regarding the timing and dose of TEA. Also, few studies speak of its use in the Indian population.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Clinical studies report that TEA reduces blood loss or transfusion requirements when given on deflation of the tourniquet and with a repeat dose postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Some authors recommend two doses of TEA, one on induction and another dose shortly before release of the tourniquet.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Others recommend a dose of 15 mg/kg TEA at the time of cementing of the prosthesis,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and yet others recommend a 10 mg/kg bolus dose followed by a dose of 1 mg/kg/h.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic> described that TEA given preoperatively and on deflation of the tourniquet reduced blood loss compared with when given only preoperatively or only on deflation of the tourniquet without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] They also thought that hemostatic control was better when TEA was administered before surgery rather than on deflation of the tourniquet, and suggested that suppression of fibrinolysis from the beginning of the operation may be more effective than only later at the time of peak hyperfibrinolysis.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] indicate that a dose of 20 mg/kg TEA is suitable for TKA. A therapeutic level can be maintained for approximately 8 h after surgery, and this covers the period of hyperfibrinolysis in cases of increased blood loss. It has been reported that 65% of drainage volume occurs in the first 8 h postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Numerous studies have reported that TEA reduces blood loss by 30-50%. Our study confirms that administration of TEA reduces blood loss in TKA by 50%. These differences in the amount of reduction of blood loss may be difficult to compare owing to differences in surgical techniques and the times for recording blood loss.</p><p>In our study, TEA reduced the blood transfusion rates and number of blood units transfused to one-third when compared with the control group. We found that TEA reduced the amount of blood transfused from 1.07 units to 0.07 units in the unilateral group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) and 2.42 units to 0.23 units in the bilateral group in comparison with the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005). All 14 patients of the bilateral control group required blood transfusion compared with only 23% (2/14) patients in the TEA group. More than half (9/14) of the patients from the unilateral control group required transfusion as compared with only 14% (1/14) patients in the TEA group. There was no significant increase in risk of DVT in the TEA group. None of our patients had symptomatic pulmonary embolism.</p><p>Our study has few limitations;firstly, we did not monitor plasminogen levels, D-dimer and fibrin degradation products. This would have given us a direct evidence of fibrinolysis and antifibrinolytic activity. Secondly, we did not investigate our patients for pulmonary embolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that three doses of IV TEA (10 mg/kg) &#x02014; first dose given before inflation of tourniquet and subsequently 4 and 12 h following the first dose &#x02014; is effective in reducing blood loss in TKA in both unilateral as well as bilateral cases in the Indian population. TEA reduces intraoperative blood loss and postoperative blood loss. It reduces the need of blood transfusion and therefore the associated risks of transfusion. In our study, we observed no increase in the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.</p><p>However, larger prospective, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to further assess whether this promising strategy to reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing TKA is safe with regard to thromboembolic complications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the contribution of anaesthesia consultant, Dr Shalini Saxena, Department of Anaesthesia, P.D.
