Introduction</title><p>Renal stones are common disorders that affect approximately 5% to 10% of the population and of 100,000 outpatients visit in the US 122 visits are related to the patients with renal stones and the incidence of renal stones is rising (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Pak, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Hiatt et al., 1982</xref>). Treatment of ureteral stones is an important part of urologists and minimally invasive procedures such as ESWL and ureteroscopy effectiveness has been proven in various studies (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Sierakowski et al., 1978</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Carstensen &#x00026; Hansen, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Miller &#x00026; Kane, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Segura et al., 1997</xref>). However, these methods are not completely safe and are expensive and can be complicated (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Lotan, 2002</xref>). On the other hand the expected treatment can be used in large numbers of patients. In different studies it is shown that small ureteral distal stones up to 98% may be excreted with expectant treatment and patient recovery (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Hubner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Ueno et al., 1977</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Coil et al., 2002</xref>). However, expected treatment can lead to complications such as urinary tract infections - hydronephrosis or negative effect on renal function (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Ueno et al., 1977</xref>). So the choice between minimally invasive therapies and expected treatment, especially in patients with less symptoms or small urethral stones, is difficult (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Moradi et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, expected treatment with pharmacological treatments that reduce the symptoms and accelerate the expulsion is expanding (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Borghi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Poppiglia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Cervenakov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Morita et al., 1987</xref>). A number of researchers have published reports stating stone expulsion using Alpha-blocker (Tamsulosin) (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Cervenakov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Morita et al., 1987</xref>). Their reason is that the alpha - 1 receptors have an important role in the physiology of the distal ureter (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Morita et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Malin et al., 1970</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Morse &#x00026; Resnick, 1991</xref>). It has been shown that medical treatment for ureteral stones in the management and following-up of patients with distal ureteral stones is helpful. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists are being studied a lot in this field and has been reported that they can be useful in the treatment of ureteral stones (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Pak, 1998</xref>). There are abundant Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the distal ureter and it is stated that Alpha-blocker is effective in the passage and expulsion of distal ureteral stone and reduce the duration of expulsion and reduce the need to take pain medication until expulsion (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Hiatt et al., 1982</xref>).</p><p>It is reported that Alpha-blocker accelerates the expulsion of crushed stones after shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) and alleviate symptoms associated with ureteral stent and increase the tolerance of ureteral stent in allergic patients and perhaps in the true selection of patients, the use of Alpha-blocker be useful in the management of patients with distal ureteral stones (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Sierakowski et al., 1978</xref>). Recent advances in endoscopic management of renal stones have allowed renal stones by minimally invasive techniques are successfully treated. These improvements include shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy (TUL) and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. Although these treatments are less invasive than traditional surgical methods, these methods are more expensive and have side effects related to themselves. Observations in the treatment of small ureteral stones, which is probable to expulsion and yet had not absolute indications for surgical intervention, are recommended. Ureteral stone expulsion rate 5mm and smaller in the proximal with no medical intervention is estimated to be 29% to 98%. And the most important factor in predicting passage and spontaneous expulsion of renal stones include placement of stones in the ureter and the largess of ureteral stones (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Morita et al., 1987</xref>). Recently, many studies about medical expulsion therapy (MET) of ureteral stones with pharmacologic materials are being conducted that indicate the increasing possibility of spontaneous expulsion of renal stones (which are not predictable). Since edema and spasm of the ureter can have inappropriate effect on the passage of ureteral stone to remove the spasm, and ureteral edema the pharmacologic agents are being used and with this aim materials such as calcium channel blockers, steroids and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and the alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist have been used for MET of ureteral stones. A recent meta-analysis study is conducted in which compare the expulsion of ureteral stone with two alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist and calcium channel blocker drugs and showed that prescription of any of these medications to patients with ureteral stones increase 65% the chance of expulsion (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Hollingsworth et al., 2006</xref>). So we have decided to use a study comparing expected treatment with tamsulosin and expected treatment without using this Alpha-blocker (Tamsulosin) factors and evaluate pharmacological factors in distal ureteral stone expulsion.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>Articles express differing results in the ureteral stone expulsion (MET). Cervenakov and his group conducted the first double-blind randomized study to compare MET with and without tamsulosin. Standard treatment involves injecting a narcotic drug and diazepam at the time of their visit and then continues daily treatment with NSAID. They show that the stone expulsion with or without tamsulosin was 80.4% and 62.8% respectively. In their study, most of the patients receiving tamsulosin had ureteral stone expulsion within 3 days and their pain was of control group. They concluded that tamsulosin increased the stone expulsion rate and decreased expulsion time. In addition, the drug showed a reduction in pain during the time of expulsion (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Cervenakov et al., 2002</xref>). Dellabella et al. 60 patients with symptomatic stones UVj in two groups of 30 subjects that in the study group tamsulosin and in the control group Floroglucinetrimetossibenzene (a spasmolytic drug used in Italy) was prescribed. In addition they prescribed to all the patients in both groups, an oral steroid (deflazacot) for 10 days and diclofenac as PRN. Expulsion for the group receiving tamsulosin was 100% compared to 70% for the control group. Tamsulosin group expulsion time was significantly lower, 65.7 hours in the control group versus 111.1 hours in the study group. In addition, the group receiving tamsulosin had less need of diclofenac injection (0.13 units compared to 2.83 units) (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Dellabella et al., 2003</xref>). Resim et al. investigated on 60 patients with distal ureteral stones that were divided into control group (receiving tenoxica and an NSAID) and study group (receiving tenoxica and tamsulosin). Stone size in study group was 5 to 12 mm and in the group receiving tamsulosin was 5 to 13 mm. The stone expulsion rate was 86.6% in the group receiving tamsulosin compared with 73.3% in the control group and none of the patients required discontinuation due to side effects of tamsulosin or not excluded. In addition, they showed that the group receiving tamsulosin had significantly less pain (based on a 10-part grading 5.70 vs 8.30, P &#x0003c;.0001 VAS visual analogue scale) and experienced less renal colic (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">De Sio et al., 2006</xref>). In the present study stone expulsion was occurred in 62.5% (30 out of 46) of the control group and 82% (41 out of 50) of the study group that had no significant difference. However, the mean expulsion time was significantly lower in the group receiving tamsulosin than control group that confirmed some of the results of previous studies. In addition, analgesics mean in the study group compared with the control group showed a significant decrease that is consistent with the above studies. Therefore, according to the present study and the mentioned studies using tamsulosin is appropriate in patients with distal ureteral stones that have no infection, unbearable pain, renal failure and contraindications of the drug to accelerate the stone expulsion, reduce the time of expulsion and decrease analgesic use.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, although the addition of tamsulosin to conservative treatment of distal ureteral stones in the distal ureteral stone expulsion showed no significant difference between the two groups, however, was effective in decreasing expulsion time, decreasing pain, and also reducing the need for analgesics. We suggest that future studies should be designed with a larger sample size to investigate the probability of the effect of tamsulosin on ureteral stone expulsion rate.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Asli</surname><given-names>M.
