The most important symptom for which patients seek medical advice is pain, which is perceived before the development of rash and lasts even after its resolution. The pain during the first 30 days after onset of herpes zoster is known as acute herpetic neuralgia. The results of considerable number of recent prospective studies have demonstrated that, more the severity of acute pain, greater is the risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). There is paucity of studies regarding the management of acute herpes zoster neuralgia. With this background, this study was designed to target the disease in its initial stage using potent antiviral drug alone and in combination with anti-inflammatory and other pain relieving drugs to evaluate their effect on acute herpetic neuralgia.</p><p>Aim and objectives of the study were (1) to compare the efficacy of valacyclovir with pregabalin and valacyclovir, pregabalin, and methylprednisolone and valacyclovir alone in acute herpetic neuralgia; (2) to study the side-effects associated with these combination therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a randomized, single-blind, parallel control study conducted from June 2014 to May 2015. Ethical clearance was obtained from institutional ethics committee before enrolling patients for the study. The sample size of 45 was decided based on the average number of patients with herpes zoster who attended the OPD of dermatology, AVBRH, Sawangi, Wardha in the past 3 years and follow-up period of 6 weeks. Patients were enrolled after considering various inclusion criteria such as patients of herpes zoster within 72 hours onset of rash, patients of both genders in the age group of 18&#x02013;70 years, herpes zoster ophthalmicus without eye involvement, and exclusion criteria such as herpes zoster in pregnant and lactating mothers, patients of herpes zoster with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tuberculosis, gastrointestinal ulcer disease, or with immune-compromised condition. A bowl containing total 45 chits with numbers written on it from A1&#x02013;15, B1&#x02013;15, and C1&#x02013;15 was kept and all chits were shuffled properly after each patient's selection. Each patient was asked to select one chit and was enrolled according to the chosen group.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. A detailed history of age, sex, onset of the rash, and duration and severity of pain was taken. Pain severity was graded after allotment of patients in each of the three groups using verbal rating scale (VRS) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. It is easy to use the four-point verbal categorical rating scale (VRS). It categorizes pain as mild, moderate, and severe and is used as a screening instrument.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In our study, we had categorized herpes zoster pain in three grades as mild, moderate, and severe using VRS. Treatment given to each group included, Group A (control) &#x02013;Tab.valacyclovir (1 g tds &#x000d7; 7 days), Group B&#x02013;Tab.valacyclovir (1 g tds &#x000d7; 7 days) + Cap. pregabalin (75 mg bd &#x000d7; 1month) and Group C &#x02013;Tab.valacyclovir (1g tds &#x000d7; 7 days) + Cap.pregabalin (75 mg bd &#x000d7; 1month) + Tab.methylprednisolone (0.64 mg/kg body weight in two divided doses for 7 days). Each patient was given medicines according to the allotted group enclosed in a white unmarked envelope. All the patients of the three groups were instructed to apply topical calamine lotion twice a day for 7 days followed by mupirocin cream twice a day for another 7 days.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Verbal rating scale (VRS)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-101-g001"/></fig><p>Patients were followed at the end of 1 week (to assure compliance of medication), 4 weeks (to asses complete resolution of acute herpetic pain), and at 6 weeks (to note patients with still persisting pain, i.e., PHN).

Among all the antiviral drugs (acyclovir, valacyclovir, andfamcyclovir), we have studied valacyclovir which is l-valyl ester of acyclovir with better bioavailability, less frequency of dosing, and better treatment compliance than acyclovir.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Both valacyclovir and famciclovir reduce the time to complete cessation of zoster-associated pain including PHN compared to acyclovir.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Valacyclovir is also less expensive as compared to famcylcovir.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Role of steroid in herpes zoster is controversial, but in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of acyclovir with and without prednisolone for herpes zoster, it was observed that combined antiviral and prednisolone therapy improve acute rash and neuritis but had no significant effect in chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In one of the placebo-controlled study on the efficacy of pregabalin in acute herpetic neuralgia, pregabalin was seen to be more effective compared to placebo in relieving acute pain of herpes zoster.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Combination therapy has better effect than monotherapy. Early institution of valacyclovir, i.e., within 72 hours of onset of herpes zoster rash, effectively inhibits viral replication, thus reducing the pathological impact on skin and nerves.</p><p>Systemic corticosteroid can be considered in combination with antiviral drugs because it has marked anti-inflammatory effect leading to resolution of acute inflammatory phase of the disease.</p><p>Pregabalin is a calcium channel-2&#x003b4; ligand with analgesic, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant properties that acts both centrally and peripherally relieving acute neuropathic pain.</p><p>In the present study, cure rate for acute herpetic neuralgia was more in group C compared to group B and A. This could be explained by the synergistic effect of all the three drugs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. We used a combination of drugs to treat pain in its acute phase to prevent PHN, and all drugs had different mechanism of action targeting viral replication (valacyclovir), inflammation (methylprednisolone), as well as central and peripheral pain (pregabalin).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Synergistic effect due to rapid and effective viral inhibition due to early institution of valalcyclovir along with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect of pregabalin and methylprednisolone, respectively</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-9-101-g008"/></fig><p>As age advances, chances of PHN also increase. Given the theoretic risk of immunosuppression with corticosteroids, some investigators believe that these agents should be used only in patients aged more than 50 years because they are at a greater risk of developing PHN.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, in our study, the average age of patients treated with this combination therapy was 39.31 years.
