</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par45">In summary, men with localised prostate cancer who were randomised to dutasteride exhibited a (1) significant decrease in mean tumour conspicuity, (2) a significant reduction on SI on DWI, and (3) a significant increase in tumour ADC, over a 6-month period compared to the men who were randomised to placebo.</p><p id="Par46">Before considering the clinical and research implications of our findings, it is worth reviewing some of the inevitable methodological issues that were inherent with both the design and conduct of this first ever study to use imaging as a primary endpoint in a study of localised prostate cancer.</p><p id="Par47">The first, and possibly most important, is that the men entered the study largely by means of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy but exited the study by an image-guided biopsy. As we now know (but were less aware of when the study was conceived) these two methods of assessment yield quite different results given a stable disease status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Fortunately, this aspect of the trial design does not impact on the objectives of our current analysis, which limits itself to the mpMRI-derived lesions.</p><p id="Par48">Second, the cohort is relatively small and, as a result, may not be fully representative of the spectrum of mpMRI-derived lesions in the population. The original MAPPED study was powered to show a 20% difference in tumour volume, and the predetermined end points were met. Clearly, further studies are going to be needed to improve the degree to which we are representative of the disease that we are studying. For instance, peripheral zone tumours were over represented in our cohort, and, as a consequence, transition zone tumours were less common. This might explain our observation of a reduction in ADC within the transition zone of the placebo-treated tumours - something we did not observe in the peripheral zone. The inherent heterogeneity of the transition zone is likely to introduce bias and that will only be countered by increasing the number of subjects assessed.</p><p id="Par49">Finally, the method used for the measurement of ADC may (even with the modified method used in this study) be prone to some edge effects and this is a problem that will affect any study using parametric assessment of small prostate lesions: the possibility that changes in lesion size will change <italic>apparent</italic> quantitative measurements because of edge effects must always be borne in mind.</p><p id="Par50">Despite these methodological issues, we feel that our findings are important both clinically and in terms of our future understanding of prostate cancer progression.</p><p id="Par51">From a clinical perspective our results show that men on dutasteride may be less likely to have their cancer called: reduced ADC (both absolute and relative to surroundings) and high signal on long <italic>b</italic> images are the key elements of tumour detection using DWI in PIRADS 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In response, as a minimal standard, radiologists should be made aware of the dutasteride or finasteride exposure to help them interpret the finding on mpMRI. For the future, the architects of PIRADS III or IV may wish to make specific recommendations for men exposed to these agents.</p><p id="Par52">As the exposure to antiandrogen therapy seems to reduce tumour conspicuity when mpMRI are performed to assess for prostate cancer, our findings support the idea that a lower threshold for triggering biopsy might be considered in men taking dutasteride or finasteride. In active surveillance it is possible that these drugs may increase the proportion of small, low grade tumours that are seen poorly or not at all, a factor which might be taken into account in follow-up protocols.</p><p id="Par53">From a research perspective our results are of considerable interest in that they point to a potentially valid, largely reliable and responsive imaging biomarker that may be providing non-invasive information on tumour status. In 2009, Padhani et al. alerted us to the importance (and potential utility) of assessing the effect of a drug (in absolute terms and in direction) on ADC values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our data provides a preliminary response to this challenge.</p><p id="Par54">Nevertheless, the question, &#x02018;What biological processes is mpMRI revealing to us?&#x02019; remains both important and pertinent.</p><p id="Par55">We know from radical prostatectomy studies that were conducted after short-term dutasteride exposure that cellular involution and epithelial shrinkage occurs in benign tissue in addition to the increase in the stromal/epithelial ratio in prostate cancer, suggesting that dutasteride may induce significant phenotypic alterations in both the benign and the neoplastic prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is possible therefore that the increase in ADC that we are observing in dutasteride-treated prostate cancer may be due to a change in the cellular components of the cancer.</p><p id="Par56">The ADC increase that we observed in the dutasteride arm of the study is certainly consistent with previous evidence; an increase in ADC values has been associated when a cytotoxic selective pressure was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, antiandrogen treatments (dutasteride being a weaker bedfellow) have been shown to reduce prostatic blood flow, causing nuclear shrinkage, cell vacuolisation, apoptosis and necrosis in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], resulting in an increase in the ADC values. There is some suggestion that these ADC values, whatever it is they are telling us about tumour status, may have some clinical relevance. De Souza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] previously showed that the ADC of high or intermediate risk prostate cancer is lower than that of low-risk tumours and suggested that in patients with low-risk, localised disease, tumour ADC may be a useful marker of progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">In conclusion, our results show that dutasteride is associated with an increase in tumour ADC and reduces tumour conspicuity on DWI. This may adversely impact on cancer detection rates in men exposed to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. As a minimum, radiologists should be made aware of the treatment status of the prostate.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DHT</term><def><p id="Par8">Dihydrotestosterone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LUTS</term><def><p id="Par9">Lower urinary tract symptoms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROI</term><def><p id="Par10">Region of interest</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SI</term><def><p id="Par11">Signal intensity</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are indebted to all the men who greatly contributed to the realisation of this study.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Guarantor</title><p id="Par58">The scientific guarantor of this publication is Prof. Mark Emberton.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par59">The authors of this manuscript declare relationships with the following companies:</p><p id="Par60">Mark Emberton is a UK National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Senior Investigator.
