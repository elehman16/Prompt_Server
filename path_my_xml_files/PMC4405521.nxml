The aim of this pilot study was to ascertain whether intranasal evaporative cooling may be an effective intervention in an acute migraine attack. Studies have previously demonstrated effectiveness of a variety of cryotherapy approaches. Intranasal evaporative cooling due to vascular anatomy, allows the transfer of venous blood from nasal and paranasal mucous membranes to the dura mater, thereby providing an excellent anatomical basis for the cooling processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a prospective, open-label, observational, pilot study. Twenty-eight patients who satisfied the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD 2) diagnostic criteria for migraine were recruited. A total of 20 treatments were administered in 15 patients. All patients provided pain severity scores and migraine-associated symptoms severity scores (based on a 0&#x02013;10 visual analogue scale, [VAS]).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Out of the 20 treatments, intranasal evaporative cooling rendered patients&#x02019; pain and symptoms free immediately after treatment, in 8 of the treatments (40%), a further 10 treatments (50%) resulted in partial pain relief (headache reduced from severe or moderate to mild) and partial symptoms relief. At 2&#x000a0;hours, 9 treatments (45%) provided full pain and symptoms relief, with a further 9 treatments (45%) resulting in partial pain and symptoms relief. At 24&#x000a0;hours, 10 treatments (50%) resulted in patients reporting pain and symptom freedom and 3 (15%) provided partial pain relief.

Cryotherapy is the most common non-pharmacological self-administered pain-relieving method currently used by migraine sufferers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The first manuscript documenting the application of ice mixtures was published by James Arnott in 1849 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Simple techniques based on cryotherapy, using various methods of cold and ice application have been reported over the last three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Friedman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] described a device using hollow metal tubes cooled by circulating cold water, applied to the periapical area of the maxillary molars. Sprouse-Blum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] reported benefit from applying frozen icepacks targeting carotid arteries at the front of the neck in migraine treatment.</p><p>Several pathophysiological mechanisms of action have been proposed. These mechanisms include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Neurovascular mechanism:</italic> Application of cold induces vasoconstriction with subsequent decreased downstream blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This leads to inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators which results in decreased vascular permeability and local oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Pain gating by differential effect on nerve conduction:</italic> Cryotherapy induces analgesia by slowing nerve conduction velocity, with small myelinated fibers being affected first, followed by large myelinated fibers and the unmyelinated fibers being affected last [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Cooling via the nasopharynx therefore offers the ability to cool across the thin cribriform plate via both direct conductive mechanisms that do not rely on spontaneous circulation as well as indirect haematogenous mechanisms. Numerous subarachnoid and pial arterial branches exposed to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have diameters in the range of the vessels of the retia mirabilia of animals in which selective brain cooling has been clearly established experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Vascular anatomy allows transfer of venous blood from the skin of the head as well as nasal and paranasal mucous membranes to the dura mater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] thereby providing an excellent basis for the convective process of intranasal evaporative cooling. The dura mater, with its high vascularization, may transmit temperature changes to the CSF compartment, which may influence the temperature of brain parenchyma directly or indirectly, via brain arteries.</p><p>The aim of this study was to ascertain whether intranasal evaporative cooling might be an effective and safe intervention in acute migraine treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is an investigator-initiated clinical trial, investigating the effectiveness of the RhinoChill<sup><bold>&#x000a9;</bold></sup> intranasal cooling system for the acute relief of migraine in an adult population, through short periods of intranasal cooling.</p><p>We conducted a single-centre, prospective, open-label, observational, pilot study. Participants were enrolled from October 2013 to July 2014, from the outpatient clinics of the Neurology Department, Cumbria Partnership NHS Trust, and through a community engagement advertising campaign.</p><p>Study design consisted of a screening visit or phone call, baseline visit, minimum of one treatment and a follow-up phone call at 2 and 24&#x000a0;hours after each treatment. The principle of the intranasal cooling, procedure and safety aspects of the intervention were explained to each of the participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient recruitment</title><p>The study participants were otherwise healthy adults who met ICHD 2 diagnostic criteria for episodic migraine with or without aura, or chronic migraine and were capable of giving informed consent.

The device requires a supply of oxygen or medical air to drive the evaporation process of the coolant. The 10&#x000a0;cm long intranasal catheters have spray ports on the dorsal surface to distribute coolant into the nasal cavity, upwards towards the base of the skull (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

PFH is a colorless, odourless, radiolucent liquid. PFH belongs to a class of perfluorocarbon fluids that are fully fluorinated with no functional reactive groups. They do not oxidize or hydrolyze and are thus chemically and biologically inert. They cannot undergo biological oxidation-reduction reactions to form reactive aldehydes, acid fluorides, radicals, or other acids. Since PFH does not react directly with biological tissue, they can form no reactive metabolites. PFH surface tension is lower than water so it will spread uniformly and quickly throughout the space in which it is sprayed. These properties facilitate RhinoChill coolant dispersion to the large diffuse surface area of the nasal cavity to maximize cooling.</p><p>Evaporation of the coolant provides rapid cooling to the nasal cavity of approximately 2&#x000b0;C, absorbing heat through evaporation and cooling local structures through direct conductive mechanisms and indirect haematogenous mechanisms. Safety of the device has been established in the cardiac arrest population where it has been used to induce rapid brain cooling for therapeutic hypothermia as neuroprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this study, the device was only used on its lowest setting of &#x02018;Low&#x02019; flow rate and for a maximum duration of 20&#x000a0;minutes as it was not the intention to induce therapeutic hypothermia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Therapeutic regimen</title><p>This trial was a feasibility study. To ensure patient safety, participants attended the hospital Day Case Unit during a migraine attack, to obtain their treatment under medical supervision. At onset of a migraine attack, the patient would contact the trial researcher and come into the hospital for treatment. On arrival, baseline observations were taken including infrared tympanic thermometry, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse and oxygen saturation. Migraine pain severity was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0&#x02013;10 with 0 being pain free and 10 very severe pain), which was extrapolated to provide a categorical scale of pain intensity using the Glaxo-scale of Severe, Moderate, Mild and None. The use of both scales allow for comparison with other published literature regarding non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical approaches to acute migraine treatment. The associated migraine symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, visual symptoms, face asymmetry, neck pain/stiffness and numbness/weakness in extremities) were also scored using VAS, whereby the patient provided a subjective composite score regarding the overall severity of their combined associated symptoms.</p><p>Following confirmation of an acute migraine attack, treatment was commenced. Lubricated nasal cannulae were inserted into both nostrils. If full insertion proved intolerable then a shallow insertion only (as far as tolerable - &#x000bc;, &#x000bd; or &#x000be; of the cannula) was completed. A maximum of 20&#x000a0;minutes of cooling was provided with predetermined early stoppage if there was full relief of pain or at the participant&#x02019;s request due to discomfort.</p><p>Migraine pain severity score, tympanic thermometry and NIBP, as well as pain and discomfort associated with the cooling device, was measured every 5&#x000a0;minutes throughout the treatment. Immediately after treatment was terminated, 2&#x000a0;hours post treatment and at 24&#x000a0;hours after treatment, pain severity and migraine-associated symptom composite scores were recorded. The participants were required to stay within the unit for a minimum of 1&#x000a0;hour following their treatment as a safety precaution. The patient was then phoned at 2&#x000a0;hours to enable recording of a migraine pain and symptom severity score.</p><p>The primary endpoint for this study was the reduction of pain and associated symptoms from baseline assessment, just after the treatment, at 2 and 24&#x000a0;hours post-treatment. Secondary endpoints were tolerance to RhinoChill cooling during treatment, pain and discomfort levels due to the cooling procedure itself, and adverse events noted throughout the treatment phase and during follow up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 using paired sample <italic>T</italic>-test and the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test, where p&#x02009;<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>&#x02009;0.05 would be considered significant.

Eleven patients had a single treatment, while 3 patients had 2 treatments and 1 patient had 3. All patients were reviewed on entry to the clinic when they attended for treatment and asked about their current frequency of migraines. The most common reasons for lack of repeated treatments was due to migraines occurring outside of the operating hours of the trial, as well as inability to travel due to severity of migraine, not being able to leave work and having difficulty with childcare arrangements. The 13 patients who did not receive a treatment stated that they had migraines at times that were out-of-hours offered by the trial centre. The cohort comprised 12 (80%) female and 3 (20%) male patients, with mean age of 43&#x000a0;years (range 29&#x02013;66 years). When asked about the normal duration of headache with standard medication and treatments, 14 (93%) patients stated that their headaches usually lasted longer than 24&#x000a0;hours after onset (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The study findings suggest that intranasal cooling rapidly relieves pain as well as migraine-associated symptoms.</p><p>Migraine is considered to be a neurovascular disorder. Even though the event initiating the actual migraine attack remain unknown, activation of the trigeminovascular system is considered to play an essential role in pathophysiology of the migraine attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We believe that the vascular anatomy of the nasal cavity allows transfer of venous blood from paranasal mucous membranes to the dura mater and may transmit temperature changes via both direct conductive mechanisms that do not rely on spontaneous circulation as well as indirect haematogenous mechanisms via dural vessels. This may influence the temperature of the brain parenchyma directly or indirectly, via brain arteries, possibly inducing vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow and inhibiting release of inflamatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators play a role in increased vascular permeability and local oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The effect of cooling might have impact on metabolic and enzymatic activity, albeit it is not clear what the mode of action is which impacts on the release of local neuropeptides.</p><p>Recent studies indicate that Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels may have a role in the headache and pain genesis due to their response to stimuli such as temperature, changes in osmolality, pH and environmental products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. TRP channels may represent novel targets for headache therapeutics. Out of the six subfamilies of TRP channels, Transient Receptor Potential V1, M8, A1 (TRPV1, TRPM8, TRPA1) seems to be the ones researchers believe are expressed on the external nociceptors, which could result in activation of nociceptors and produce pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Intranasal cooling might have had a stimulating effect on TRP channels, likely in antagonistic inhibitory way for TRPV1, TRPA1, and possibly as an agonist on TRPM8 channel.</p><p>Other inhibitory factors such as differential alteration of nerve conduction velocities mediated its effect via gate control mechanism, might have played a part in the process leading to the pain and symptoms termination.</p><p>A vasoconstrictor response of brain vessels to 100% oxygen inhalation has been known for decades. In patients with acute hemispheric infarction, regional vasoconstrictor responsiveness to 100% oxygen inhalation was decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Whilst it is clear that oxygen is a very useful therapy in cluster headaches, there is some evidence of the benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in relieving acute migraine, but the benefit of normobaric oxygen therapy in migraine remains rather controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The coolant, a non-ozone depleting six chain perflurocarbon, perfluorohexane (PFH), does not oxidize or hydrolyze and cannot undergo biological oxidation-reduction reactions to form reactive aldehydes, acid fluorides, radicals, or other acids. Since it does not react directly with biological tissue, and cannot form reactive metabolites or react with receptors, or channels, so we anticipate PFH doesn&#x02019;t have any direct benefit in the migraine treatment, other than acting as a coolant.</p><p>The therapeutic effect of intranasal evaporative cooling was not diminished by the shallow insertion of catheter, nor impacted by premature termination of the treatment. With respect to the duration of the treatment and depth of the nasal catheter insertion, further evaluation is required involving a study with a larger number of participants.</p><p>Our trial highlighted the importance of a non-pharmacological approach. Further trials to examine a non-pharmacological approach are warranted.</p><p>We acknowledge that a major limitation of this study is the small sample size and lack of a control group. A further randomized, placebo controlled trial is therefore essential to confirm the effectiveness of intranasal cooling as an acute treatment in migraine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion we found that there is a therapeutic effect from intranasal evaporative cooling in patients with migraine, giving benefit on headache as well as accompanying migraine symptoms to 13 patients (87%) at 2&#x000a0;hours post-treatment; even though this was an in-hospital treatment with a device and thus the placebo effect may be pronounced.</p><p>This study did not reveal any significant or severe side effects. Nasal cooling was well tolerated by majority of the participants and we found that nasal cooling was safe to use for this indication.</p><p>While these results are promising, a randomized placebo controlled, double blinded trial is needed to confirm the efficacy of intranasal cooling as an acute treatment in migraine. Further studies will also be required to clarify the mode of action of this therapeutic intervention.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CSF</term><def><p>Cerebrospinal fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIBP</term><def><p>Noninvasive blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP</term><def><p>Mean arterial pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICHD 2</term><def><p>International Classification of Headache Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRP</term><def><p>Transient Receptor Potential channels</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFH</term><def><p>Perfluorocarbon &#x02013; perfluorohexane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CGRP</term><def><p>Calcitonin Gene-related peptide.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Mark Glencorse is the European Clinical Research Manager for Benechill International GmbH.
