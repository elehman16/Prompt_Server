Vitamin D and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) provide benefit for the prevention of fractures and cardiovascular events, respectively, and both are involved in controlling inflammatory and immune responses. However, published epidemiological data suggest a potential interference of n-3 PUFA supplementation with vitamin D status. Therefore, we aimed to investigate in a randomized controlled clinical trial whether treatment with long chain n-3 PUFA affects vitamin D status in severely obese patients and potential interrelations of vitamin D and PUFA treatment with inflammatory parameters. Fifty-four severely obese (BMI&#x02265;40 kg/m2) non-diabetic patients were treated for eight weeks with either 3.36 g/d EPA and DHA or the same amount of butter fat as control. Changes in serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, plasma fatty acid profiles and circulating inflammatory marker concentrations from baseline to end of treatment were assessed. At baseline 43/54 patients were vitamin D deficient (serum 25(OH)D concentration &#x0003c;50 nmol/l). Treatment with n-3 PUFA did not affect vitamin D status (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.91). Serum 25(OH)D concentration correlated negatively with both IL-6 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) and hsCRP serum concentration (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03) at baseline. Strikingly, the negative correlations of 25(OH)D with IL-6 and hsCRP were lost after n-3 PUFA treatment. In conclusion, vitamin D status of severely obese patients remained unaffected by n-3 PUFA treatment. However, abrogation of the inverse association of 25(OH)D concentration with inflammatory markers indicated that n-3 PUFA treatment could compensate for some detrimental consequences of vitamin D deficiency.</p><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00760760">NCT00760760</ext-link>

The risk of developing obesity-related complications such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is proportional to the degree of obesity <xref rid="pone.0054634-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and tightly correlated with chronic low-grade adipose and systemic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0054634-Despres1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054634-Zeyda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> as well as vitamin D deficiency <xref rid="pone.0054634-Forouhi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

This secondary analysis aimed to investigate whether n-3 PUFA could have deleterious effects on vitamin D status in obese individuals. Accordingly, most patients from our study population exhibited vitamin D deficiency. All patients had normal serum levels of VDBP. Under physiologic conditions, serum PTH concentrations tend to correlate negatively with serum 25(OH)D concentration in case of severe vitamin D deficiency <xref rid="pone.0054634-Holick2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, but no such correlation was found in our study, a finding which has been also reported by others <xref rid="pone.0054634-Pitroda1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. There is no consensus on the threshold of 25(OH)D values below which PTH levels starts to increase. Furthermore it seems that the inverse relationship between serum PTH and 25(OH)D is not causative, but reflects biochemical abnormalities associated to obesity, as multiple linear regression analyses from other studies have demonstrated that BMI itself accounts for the decreased serum vitamin D and increased PTH concentration <xref rid="pone.0054634-Pitroda1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054634-Grethen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Vitamin D and n-3 PUFA are found together in cod liver oil, known for its unpleasant taste. Since purified re-esterified n-3 PUFA have become available, cod liver oil supplementation has further lost in appeal. Thus, concerns have arisen that supplementation with n-3 PUFA derived from fish-oil might, as a side effect, cause a diminished supplementation with vitamin D. There is scarce evidence from animal models receiving combined therapy with n-3 PUFA and vitamin D, so it is difficult to speculate on their combined effect. A large trial investigating the concomitant effect of n-3 PUFA and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of cancer and cardio-vascular disease is set to be finished by 2017 <xref rid="pone.0054634-Manson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, Niramitmahapanya <italic>et al.</italic> found that dietary PUFA intake negatively correlated with the vitamin D status of elderly patients, receiving supplemental vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and suggested that n-3 PUFA treatment affects vitamin D absorption <xref rid="pone.0054634-Niramitmahapanya1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We could show here that a considerable daily n-3 PUFA dose of 3.36 g did not impact the overall vitamin D status, irrespective of the season. VDBP concentration was also unaffected by the treatment. However, we cannot rule out that a higher n-3 PUFA dose affects vitamin D status. Inuits who consume high doses of n-3 PUFA and vitamin D from free-living fish and sea mammals have high circulating vitamin D concentrations <xref rid="pone.0054634-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In a cross-sectional analysis where serum 25(OH)D concentration and dietary intake of n-3 PUFA was assessed, the group with the highest vitamin D concentration had also the higher n-3 PUFA intake (1.5 g/d) <xref rid="pone.0054634-Rousseau1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. These epidemiological data further argue against a significant impact of n-3 PUFA on vitamin D status. Moreover, baseline vitamin D concentrations in the obese middle aged cohort investigated here positively correlated with plasma phospholipid EPA and total n-3 PUFA content, strongly arguing against a negative effect of n-3 PUFA in the regular diet on vitamin D uptake. The duration of our study can be considered long enough to detect an interaction between n-3 PUFA and vitamin D as the half-life of vitamin D is reported at circa 1 month in humans and serum 25(OH)D is essentially at the plateau concentration by 1 month <xref rid="pone.0054634-Vieth1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is hence rather unlikely that a longer duration of treatment would significantly impact vitamin D status. Another factor which could clearly influence a possible interaction between n-3 PUFA and vitamin D is the type of patient. In this case, pathologies affecting vitamin D absorption and metabolism, such as intestinal, severe liver or kidney disease have to be considered. However, the existence of these conditions was excluded in our study.</p><p>Inflammation considerably contributes to obesity-associated complications such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0054634-Zeyda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In this regard, anti-inflammatory therapies are currently under investigation as novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. We have shown that long chain n-3 PUFA reduce the concentration of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 in severely obese subjects <xref rid="pone.0054634-Itariu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. IL-6 regulates hsCRP production in the liver, thus a reduction in hsCRP concentration might also occur with longer treatment. Vitamin D is negatively associated with both BMI and inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 and hsCRP in healthy lean and obese subjects <xref rid="pone.0054634-Jablonski1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054634-Bellia1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We and others have shown that n-3 PUFA reduce systemic and adipose tissue inflammation, induce anti-inflammatory gene expression in circulating mononuclear cells and improve metabolic control in severely obese, overweight and elderly subjects <xref rid="pone.0054634-Itariu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054634-Bakker1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054634-Bouwens1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The data presented here indicate that the anti-inflammatory action of n-3 PUFA occurs even in vitamin D deficiency. Particularly noteworthy is the finding, that n-3 PUFA but not control treatment abolished the negative association of vitamin D concentration and inflammatory parameters. Hence it could be speculated that the anti-inflammatory action of n-3 PUFA may in part compensate for the detrimental outcome of vitamin D deficiency. Clearly, causalities of these interrelations need to be investigated in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, treatment with n-3 PUFA does not compromise the overall vitamin D status of obese patients, many of whom were vitamin D deficient, but abrogates the inverse association of vitamin D deficiency with inflammation. The fact that n-3 PUFA treatment reduces inflammation indicates that adequate n-3 PUFA intake could compensate for some detrimental outcomes of vitamin D deficiency. Cumulative effects of n-3 PUFA and vitamin D on unfavorable obesity-related complications remain to be evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0054634.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
