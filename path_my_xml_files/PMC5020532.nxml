One hundred and eight patients harbored L858R mutation in their tumors and 80 patients provided serial blood samples as pre-planned scheduled. Serial plasma L858R was detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Dynamic types of plasma L858R were analyzed using Ward&#x02019;s hierarchical clustering method.

However, due to the invasive procedures required to obtain tumor tissues, not all patients can provide enough high-quality tissues for <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation analysis. Circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma provides a noninvasive substitute for tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several studies have reported a concordance rate between tumor and plasma &#x0003e;90&#x000a0;%, even reaching 97&#x000a0;%, demonstrating the feasibility of detecting <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations in cfDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation status detection in cfDNA has been approved by the European Society for Medical Oncology and by China to be used with EGFR-TKI treatment for NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In addition to providing pretreatment information, plasma-based <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation detection makes it possible to monitor dynamic changes in this mutation during treatment. Several studies have reported a quantitative change in <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations during EGFR-TKI treatment by comparing pre- and post-treatment plasma, in which various types of plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The quantity of the plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation sometimes decreases, or sometimes decreases slowly or rapidly. Patients whose plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations decrease rapidly usually exhibit a better response to EGFR-TKI treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, these studies were not based on prospective clinical trials; therefore, the number of patients who had serial plasma specimens tested during EGFR-TKI treatments was limited, and very few plasma specimens were collected as part of a pre-planned schedule. The only recent study on plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation changes based on a prospective clinical trial was reported by Mok et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this phase III trial (FASTACT-2), patients received gemcitabine/platinum plus sequential erlotinib or placebo. <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation-specific cfDNA levels decreased at cycle 3 and increased at the time of disease progression. Positive plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant DNA at cycle 3 predicted a worse clinical outcome. In this study, the treatment was chemotherapy plus EGFR-TKI or placebo, not EGFR-TKI, and there was no information on the plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation at other time points except at baseline, cycle 3, and at disease progression. The dynamic types of plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations during the whole course of EGFR-TKI treatment and its correlation with clinical outcomes were not determined.</p><p>The present study was a pre-planned exploratory analysis of a randomized phase III trial comparing erlotinib with gefitinib treatment in advanced NSCLC patients containing <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations in tumor tissues (The Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group 0901, CTONG0901, NCT01024413). Serial plasma samples were collected as a pre-planned schedule, and the <italic>EGFR</italic> L858R mutation was detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We quantitatively measured changes in the L858R mutation and determined its correlation with clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and treatment</title><p>Serial plasma samples were taken from patients enrolled in CTONG0901, a single-center trial designed to compare erlotinib with gefitinib treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC who had <italic>EGFR</italic> activating mutations in tumor tissues. Eligible patients were over 18&#x000a0;years of age and had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC (AJCC/UICC, version 6) with <italic>EGFR</italic> activating mutations in their tumor samples, tested by direct sequencing as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previously untreated patients and those receiving any type of systemic chemotherapy regimen without prior exposure to any EGFR-TKI were recruited. Eligible patients were 1:1 randomized to receive erlotinib (150&#x000a0;mg, po, qd) or gefitinib (250&#x000a0;mg, po, qd) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation of treatment due to other reasons. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), post-progression survival (PPS), safety, and biomarker analyses.</p><p>This trial was conducted in Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute of Guangdong General Hospital. It adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee at Guangdong General Hospital (committee&#x02019;s reference number: GDREC [2009]011). All patients provided written informed consent for participation, with separate consent obtained for tumor specimens and/or blood samples for biomarker analyses. The pre-planned schedule for collecting serial blood samples during the course of EGFR-TKI treatment included baseline, 1&#x000a0;week after treatment, 1&#x000a0;month after treatment, and every 8&#x000a0;weeks until the appearance of disease progression. At each time point, 8&#x000a0;mL of blood was collected. Except for 1&#x000a0;week after treatment, other time points were exactly the same day when patients underwent computerized tomography (CT) scans for tumor response evaluation. Tumor response was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. The resistance was defined as disease progression according to RECIST, and the best response was the greatest reduction in tumor burden.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Biomarker analyses</title><p>Blood samples were collected in tubes containing EDTA according to a fixed schedule. Plasma was immediately separated from blood cells by centrifugation at 3000&#x000a0;rpm at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;min. Supernatants were collected and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until assays were performed. cfDNA was isolated from 4&#x000a0;mL plasma using a QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. To increase the testing sensitivity, we repeated the isolation five times and then pooled and concentrated the cfDNA from a total of 4&#x000a0;mL plasma for mutation testing.</p><p>We analyzed plasma only from patients containing the L858R mutation. Quantitative analyses of the L858R mutation and the endogenous reference gene <italic>antitrypsin</italic> in the cfDNA were performed by qPCR using the Roche LightCycler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 480 real-time PCR system (Roche Life Science, Penzberg, Germany) under the following conditions: 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min for 1&#x000a0;cycle followed by 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;s and 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;min for 50&#x000a0;cycles. An L858R target assay and human <italic>antitrypsin</italic> primers with the same amplification efficiency were developed by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences of the L858R mutation primers were as follows: forward primer, GCAGCATGTCAAGATCACAGATTT, reverse primer, CCTCCTTCTGCATGGTATTCTTTCT; MGB-probe, FAM-CAGTTTGGCCCGCCCA; <italic>antitrypsin</italic> forward primer, GACACCGAAGAGGCCAAGAA, reverse primer, GAAGATGTAATTCACCAGAGCAAAAA; and MGB-probe, FAM-TGTGTCTCTGTCAAGCTCCTTGAC. The qPCR mixture contained 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L 2&#x000d7; LightCycler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 480 Probes Master (Roche Life Science), 0.25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L primer mix, TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Probe Assay (Applied Biosystems), 1.75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L nuclease-free water, and 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L sample DNA or calibrator or H<sub>2</sub>O (for the no template control). Each sample was run in duplicate. The differences between replicates were lower than 2&#x000a0;cycle thresholds. If the result from one sample did not meet this criterion, the procedure was repeated. DNA from NCI-H1975 cells (harboring L858R mutation) was used as positive control. Human reference genomic DNA (catalog G1471, Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) was used as negative control. PCR grade H<sub>2</sub>O was the non-template control. Two wells of positive controls, two wells of negative control, and two wells of non-template control were included in every run. A mixture of plasma DNA with the L858R mutation was used for calibration. The level of the L858R mutation was normalized to that of the <italic>antitrypsin</italic> gene. The relative L858R copy number of each plasma sample was calculated as follows: <italic>R</italic>&#x000a0;(L858R&#x000a0;copy&#x000a0;number)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;[(Ct&#x000a0;sample&#x000a0;L858R&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;Ct&#x000a0;sample&#x000a0;antitrypsin)&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;(Ct&#x000a0;CalibratorL858R&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;Ct&#x000a0;calibrator&#x000a0;antitrypsin)]</sup>.</p><p>In plasma at the time of disease progression, we tested the exon 20 T790M mutation using a T790M mutation detection kit (Amoy Diagnostics, Xiamen, China) according to the principle of amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The plasma L858R copy number is described as the median range. Ward&#x02019;s hierarchical clustering method was used to categorize the dynamic types of L858R. Based upon the schedule of CT scans, we selected seven time points for Ward&#x02019;s hierarchical clustering analyses: baseline, 1&#x000a0;week after baseline, 8&#x000a0;weeks before the best response, the best response, 8&#x000a0;weeks after the best response, 8&#x000a0;weeks before disease progression, and disease progression. If a patient progressed early on during treatment and there were not seven time points available for analysis, the available time points were put on corresponding points of the model and the missing time points were supplemented by expectation maximum to maintain the stability of Ward&#x02019;s hierarchical clustering analyses. The entire population was classified into different groups according to Ward&#x02019;s hierarchical clustering analyses. The quantities of L858R mutations between groups were compared by unequally spaced repeated measures design analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ratio of change of L858R quantity from baseline to disease progression (<italic>r</italic>) was calculated as (quantity of L858R at disease progression &#x02212; quantity of L858R at baseline)/(quantity of L858R at baseline). Cut point of <italic>r</italic> to separate different groups was analyzed using maximally selected rank statistics by R software. Constituent ratio of <italic>EGFR</italic> T790M and two kinds of EGFR-TKIs between groups were compared by chi-square or continuity correction tests. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to that of disease progression or of death from any cause. OS was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. PPS was measured from the date of disease progression to the date of death from any cause. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and is expressed as a median value with a range and a two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI). A two-sided log-rank test was used to compare survival between groups. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) was used to evaluate independent predictive factors associated with PFS. A two-sided <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) software was used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>From December 2009 to July 2014, a total of 256 patients were enrolled in CTONG0901.

For the first time, we found that there were two different dynamic types of plasma L858R mutation during EGFR-TKI treatment. In the ascend type, the quantity of the L858R mutation increased to its highest level at disease progression, while in the stable type, the quantity of the L858R mutation did not increase and maintained a stable level at disease progression. Compared with the quantity of L858R at baseline, the quantity at disease progression increased by more than one time was the criteria for separating the two groups. The ascend type was associated with more therapeutic benefit from EGFR-TKI treatment than the stable type. Our results show, for the first time, that the entire L858R mutation population can be divided into two subtypes according to quantitative changes of the plasma L858R mutation.</p><p>In the present study, patients with different dynamic types achieved different benefits from EGFR-TKI treatment. However, the change of quantity of L858R mutation in cfDNA was not a useful predictive biomarker along the course of EGFR-TKI treatment because the difference of L858R mutation level was found until disease progression. Therefore, from this result, monitoring the dynamic change of <italic>EGFR</italic> activating mutation during EGFR-TKI treatment had low clinical predictive value. Two different dynamic types found in this study demonstrated that the <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation positive population could be divided into two subtypes. These two subtypes were correlated with different benefit from EGFR-TKI treatment and showed different dynamic characteristics of plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> activating mutation when disease progressed. The findings warrant further studies to explore the molecular mechanisms for the change of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation in plasma. Genomic information from next-generation sequencing (NGS) might contribute to find the changes of predominant clones and the changes of other relative genes when disease progressed. Furthermore, the level of plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation at disease progression might potentially influence subsequent treatment strategy. Our subsequent treatment analyses showed that patients with high levels of plasma L858R at disease progression achieved greater benefit from subsequent other first generation EGFR-TKIs than those with low levels of the L858R mutation. Better subsequent strategy might be made by combining the level of plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> activating mutation and resistant genetic information when disease progressed.</p><p>The <italic>EGFR</italic> exon 19 deletion and the exon 21 L858R mutations are the most common activating mutations. Patients whose tumors are characterized by these two mutations can achieve dramatic benefits from EGFR-TKI treatment. They are therefore considered typical activating mutations. However, an increasing number of studies have reported that two subtypes of patients achieve different benefits from EGFR-TKI treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The clinical trial CTONG0901, on which our exploratory study was based, started in 2009 and it was originally designed to compare the efficacy of gefitinib or erlotinib treatment in patients only harboring the <italic>EGFR</italic> L858R mutation. After 6&#x000a0;months, the protocol was amended to enroll patients with either exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Therefore, we separated the exploration for plasma L858R mutation from exon 19 deletion. The present study only focused on L858R mutation, and our future plan is to explore the plasma exon 19 deletion to validate the result of L858R mutation. Another reason why we focused on L858R mutation in this study was that exon 19 deletion was more complex to be quantitatively detected than exon 21 L858R. More sensitive method was needed to quantitatively detect exon 19 deletion. In 2009 when the CTONG0901 trial was initiated, we used the qPCR for quantitative analyses of plasma L858R mutations. The sensitivity of qPCR for reliable mutational analysis is minimum 1~5&#x000a0;% of mutant alleles in a wild-type background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Enough cfDNA from enrolled advanced NSCLC patients harboring relatively high abundance <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation in their tumors contributed to the high sensitivity in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the future, other testing methods, for example, droplet digital PCR or next generation sequencing, should be considered.</p><p>There are some limitations to the present study. We only detected T790M in the plasma at the time of disease progression by ARMS, which was the most commonly used method for detecting <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation when the study was designed. The sensitivity of ARMS detecting T790M was relatively low and only 17 out of 78 patients (22&#x000a0;%) were found to be T790M positive. We tried to detect the quantity of T790M mutation by qPCR during EGFR-TKI treatment but failed, and we could not do droplet digital PCR or beaming digital PCR at that time, which is more sensitive than qPCR or ARMS in detecting T790M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. More T790M-positive patients found by more sensitive methods and the dynamic combination of activating mutation and T790M mutation could provide more information to predict the benefits of EGFR-TKI treatment and to guide subsequent application of third-generation EGFR-TKI which target both <italic>EGFR</italic> activating mutation and T790M mutation. Another limitation was, although CTONG0901 was a randomized trial, this exploratory research was based on patients who provided serial blood samples as scheduled. Therefore, there must be some selection bias which potentially impacted the results. The conclusion needs further validation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our study suggests that the L858R mutation population can be divided into two subtypes according to changes in the plasma L858R mutation. Different dynamic types were correlated with different benefits from EGFR-TKI treatment. Because the difference of L858R mutation level was found until disease progression, monitoring the dynamic change of L858R mutation during EGFR-TKI treatment had low clinical predictive value. The molecular mechanisms for the two subtypes and the impact of plasma L858R level at disease progression on subsequent treatment strategy needs further exploration. The optimal strategies to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance by combining the level of plasma <italic>EGFR</italic> activating mutation and resistant genetic information when disease progressed warrant further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec12"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13045_2016_316_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Demographics and clinical characteristics of all patients. <bold>Table S2.</bold> Subsequent therapy after EGFR-TKI of two groups. <bold>Table S3.</bold> Survival comparison between two groups receiving different subsequent treatment after EGFR-TKI. <bold>Table S4.</bold> PFS and PPS between patients whose plasma at time of disease progression were with or without T790M.
