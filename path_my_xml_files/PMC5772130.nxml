Three laparoscopic phantom tasks (task 1: touching markers on a flat disk with a rod; task 2: straight rod transfer through a single loop; and task 3: curved rod transfer through two loops) in the training box were performed ten times, respectively. Performances were recorded by an optical position tracker. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: one group performed each task five times initially under a 2D system (2D start group), and the other group performed each task five times under a 3D system (3D start group).

However, complicated surgery using the laparoscopic approach is still challenging compared with open surgery due to technical limitations with the planar image from two-dimensional (2D) monitors. The recent utilization of stereoscopic vision from a three-dimensional (3D) monitor in laparoscopic surgery has overcome a lack in depth perception and improved surgical performance, such as operative time and accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further, laparoscopic performance using a 3D monitor by novices who had never performed laparoscopic surgery was also improved in relation to superior accuracy and dexterity compared with that under 2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the negative or positive effects of laparoscopic training of novices using 3D vision are still unclear. In this study, we compared operative data, including the path length of forceps, under 3D and 2D vision by 3D optical tracking systems in a laparoscopic training box and clarified the effects of 3D vision for novices in the early phase of training.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Training equipment</title><p id="Par6">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A shows the training setup. For the assessment of laparoscopic performance using stereoscopic images captured by a 3D system, we set the monitor on place where a subject directly faced the display with viewing distance ranged about 1.2&#x000a0;m and viewer&#x02019;s eye level is the same as the middle of the display. This setting was simulated as similar as possible to the usual position of surgeon and monitor in actual laparoscopic surgery in our institution. The distance between the tip of the endoscope and the object of the operation was fixed at 15&#x000a0;cm.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Setup for recording performance of participants. <bold>A</bold> The apparatus consisted of a monitor, position tracker, and training box including a phantom task. <bold>B</bold> Device for task 1 (touching markers on the flat disk with a rod). <bold>C</bold> Device for task 2 (straight rod transfer through single loop). <bold>D</bold> Device for task 3 (curved rod transfer through two loops)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="464_2017_5654_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par7">Devices used were a 3D laparoscope and 3D laparoscopy system (Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). With this laparoscope, two charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors are located at the distal end of the laparoscope to provide left and right images, respectively. These two image signals are processed by a special-purpose video system to generate a high-resolution 3D image that is then displayed on a 3D monitor and viewed through 3D glasses to provide realistic 3D images. This system can be switched from providing 3D images to 2D images by pressing a switch on the scope.</p><p id="Par8">The micron tracker (Claron Technology, Toronto, Canada) consists of CCD image sensors. This system enables the tracking and recording of 3D coordinates and rotation of forceps with an optical marker. Data are obtained as text data and can be analyzed by statistical software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par9">Study participants were 40 novices who had never performed laparoscopic surgery as an operator (20 medical student volunteers and 20 junior resident volunteers). The sample size was determined based on the outcome of our preliminary study. Participants performed three different laparoscopic phantom tasks in the training box five times each (one set) and performances were recorded by the optical position tracker in order to analyze the motion of forceps in a 3D space. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: one group performed a set of tasks initially under the 2D system (2D start group) and the other group performed the tasks under the 3D system (3D start group). Then both groups again performed the same set of tasks after switching to the alternate system (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All participants completed the tasks using 2D and 3D monitors with the same settings and on the same day. After participants completed the second set of tasks, we compared operative times, path lengths of forceps, and technical errors between systems. In addition, we investigated the learning curves for each group throughout all attempts.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Diagram of study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="464_2017_5654_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

In task 2, all 2D start group scores were significantly improved just after switching to the 3D system as opposed to the significantly worse scores for the 3D start group after switching to the 2D system. For task 3, mean operative times and mean path lengths in both groups did not differ significantly after switching to the opposite system. However, technical errors by the 2D start group were significantly improved after switching to the 3D system, whereas technical errors were significantly worse in the 3D start group after switching to the 2D system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">Several studies have proposed that stereoscopic vision using 3D results in benefits in laparoscopic performance by trainees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The present study also showed that the use of a 3D monitor for training improved laparoscopic surgical performance by novices. Blavier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reported a shorter operative time by novices who trained in the 2D environment after switching to a 3D environment and a longer operative time for novices who trained in the 3D environment after switching to a 2D environment. We also showed that the use of a 2D monitor impaired the performance of trainees after training using 3D indicated by a longer operative time due to longer path lengths and more frequent errors. Saseem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported similar findings, especially in complicated tasks. Our results showed that all scores for performance of task 1 (simple task) (median operative time, path length, and technical errors) in the 3D start group did not differ significantly between just before and after switching to a 2D monitor. However, in more complicated tasks, the scores for the 3D start group obviously worsened just after switching monitors, especially the score for technical errors. This inaccurate performance by novices after the loss of depth perception using 3D may be the major reason for the longer operative time under 2D vision.</p><p id="Par24">We considered that there would be differences in the learning effect among trainees depending on their degree of proficiency as surgeons. Therefore, under the same setting, the differences in the learning effect among experienced surgeons might be shorter compared with that among novices. We previously revealed that scores for performance of laparoscopic sutures in the training box by moderately experienced surgeons became significantly worse after switching monitors from 3D to 2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, in the task of straight rod transfer through a single loop (which was the same setting as task 2 in this study), the scores for performance by moderately experienced surgeons did not worsen after switching monitors from 3D to 2D. On the other hand, in the present study, the performance of task 2 by novices became significantly worse after switching monitors from 3D to 2D. This suggests that the deleterious effect of loss with depth perception using 3D is dependent not only on the difficulty of the task but also on the lack of experience of the surgeon. When a novice who is trained only using a 3D monitor participates in laparoscopic surgery using 2D for the first time, the surgical team should pay attention to the possibility of more frequent technical errors and longer operative times.</p><p id="Par25">There are several limitations in this study. First, we did not take into consideration the unsuitability of each participant for stereo vision. Several studies about 3D indicated that there are some people who have disadvantages of stereo vision, such as stereo blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], or the side effects (feeling discomfort, headache, or sickness) using a 3D monitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, each participant in this study improved their performance and did not feel any discomfort or sickness as side effects by 3D during the trial. We considered that the reason why the participants had no side effects might be stabilizing stereoscope not to move the background displayed on the monitor, or quite short operative time for each subject compared to actual surgery. Second, tasks in this study were simply designed just for novice. Therefore, the statistical difference of scores in each task might not explain the clinical importance by itself and it is unclear whether our performance data from novices using the training box can be extrapolated to actual laparoscopic surgery. However, in actual surgery, there are countless situations that request to perform simple operation such like task 1 and accumulation of each slight difference might become quite a large difference. Therefore, it remains unclear whether novices should start laparoscopic training or experience their first surgery using 3D or 2D. However, considering the obvious better performance of novices using 3D compared with 2D, laparoscopic surgery using 3D is recommended for novices as far as the environment permits. The more frequent errors by novices under 2D compared with 3D in the training box indicate that with poorly experienced surgeons more frequent accidents such as bleeding or injury could occur during actual surgery when switching from 3D to 2D.</p><p id="Par26">In conclusion, for novices, stereoscopic images improved their laparoscopic surgical techniques from the early phase of training. However, it is important to understand the learning effect showing that performance of novices trained only by 3D worsened after changing to the 2D environment even for a simple task.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Presented at the SAGES 2017 Annual Meeting, March 22-25, 2017, Houston, Texas.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par27">This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (SK: No. 15K01330, YS: No. 26108004) and Japan Science and Technology Agency (PRESTO YO: No. 20407).</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Disclosures</title><p id="Par28">Drs.
