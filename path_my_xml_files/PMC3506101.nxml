All the patients signed an informed consent after the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Patients were enrolled according to the following inclusion criteria: presence of unilateral pleural effusion occupying more than one-half of the hemithorax with an indication for therapeutic thoracentesis. The diagnosis of tuberculous etiology was confirmed by the presence of granuloma in histopathological examination after closed pleural biopsy or demonstration of acid fast bacilli in pleural fluid or biopsy specimens associated with exudative pleural effusion.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with history of smoking; patients with any lung parenchymal lesion as evident by clinical and radiological examinations, e.g. collapse, consolidation, fibrosis or mass with effusion; patients with history of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); patients with chronic liver or kidney diseases; patients with encysted pleural effusion; patients with any of the conditions which are contraindicated for spirometry, e.g. recent onset myocardial infarction; patients on oral corticosteroids.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study procedure</title><p>The study population consisted of 52 newly diagnosed cases of unilateral tuberculous pleural effusion. They were divided into two equal groups A and B by assigning every alternate case to each group. All the cases were subjected to detailed clinical examinations, chest radiography (both posterior-anterior and lateral views), color Doppler ultrasonography of thorax to detect the presence or absence of pleural thickening (hypo-echoic area &#x0003e;3 mm in thickness was considered to be thickening of pleura) and spirometry. The patients in group A were subjected to maximal therapeutic thoracentesis and those in group B were subjected to only diagnostic thoracentesis. All the patients in both the groups were initiated on category-I anti-TB regimen under DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course) as per the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). Follow-up of each case was done after first, second and sixth month of ATT. During the follow-up visits, patients were examined clinically and repeat chest radiograph, ultrasonography of thorax and spirometry were done to see any improvement. Any residual lesion or abnormalities observed after completion of ATT were also noted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Radiography</title><p>The pleural fluid on chest radiographs (pre-thoracentesis and post-thoracentesis) was classified as minimal, moderate and massive. Patients with pleural fluid level up to the lower border of fifth rib anteriorly were classified as minimal, up to the lower border of third rib as moderate and above the third rib as massive pleural effusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Thoracentesis procedure</title><p>Thoracentesis was performed by trained chest physicians using the standard technique, including pleural manometry.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The procedure was suspended if spontaneous cessation of fluid drainage occurred or if the patient experienced discomfort with exacerbation of symptoms (coughing, dyspnea or chest pain) or vagal manifestations (dizziness or nausea).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Spirometry</title><p>All the patients in the study were evaluated by spirometry. To measure FVC and FEV1, a ZAN 100 pulmonary spirometer (nSpire Health Inc; Longmont, California) was used, and the maneuvers were performed according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were compiled on Microsoft Excel worksheet where proportion and mean values were calculated. Significance of association between two attributes (qualitative data) was analyzed by Chi-square test. Epi-info software (version 3.2) was used to calculate Yates corrected Chi-square and Fischer exact <italic>P</italic> values in appropriate situations, using 2&#x000d7;2 fourfold tables. The mean values were compared by unpaired Student's t test. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed using IBM SPSS software (version 19.0), to compare the mean scores of FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC of groups A and B separately on four different occasions viz. before pleural aspiration, one month, 2 months and 6 months after ATT. <italic>P</italic> value was considered as per Wilks&#x02032; Lambda statistics. Partial Eta squared, given in the multivariate tests output box was used to represent the change in effect size; value more than 0.14 indicates very large effect size. <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>During the study period, 52 patients fulfilled the conditions of the study and they were divided into two groups A and B, having 26 patients each. Males were predominant in both the groups [88.46% (A) and 76.92% (B)] and the difference was statistically insignificant (Chi-square, Fischer exact two tailed <italic>P</italic> = 0.46). Most of the patients in both the groups [53.84% (A) and 61.53% (B)] belonged to the age group of 15 to 35 years. Mean age was 39.03 &#x000b1; 16.62 years (A) and 33.69 &#x000b1; 12.05 years (B), respectively, the difference being statistically insignificant (unpaired student's <italic>t</italic> = 1.33, <italic>P</italic> = 0.19). Thus, demographically, both the groups were comparable to each other at baseline.</p><p>On chest radiography, 30.77% patients of group A and 26.93% patients of group B had massive pleural effusion, while 69.23% and 73.07% patients of A and B groups, respectively, had moderate pleural effusion before thoracentesis. Initially, none of the patients in either group had minimal pleural effusion. At baseline, both the groups were comparable to each other in terms of the extent of pleural effusion (Yates corrected Chi-square test = 0.00, df = 1, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). After initiation of treatment, extent of pleural effusion had reduced in both the groups. At one month after ATT and during subsequent follow-up visits, none of the group A patients had either massive or moderate pleural effusion and only 61.54% had minimal pleural effusion. Among group B patients, 15.38% and 84.62% had moderate and minimal pleural effusion, respectively, after one month of treatment and all the patients had minimal pleural effusion as compared to only 26.93% patients of group A at 2 months of treatment. None of the group A patients had any pleural effusion whereas only five patients in group B had minimal pleural effusion after six months of treatment [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Extent of tuberculous pleural effusion on chest radiograph (<italic>N</italic> = 52)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ATM-7-215-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Regarding spirometry parameters, both the groups were comparable to each other at baseline in terms of mean percentage predicted of FEV1 (51.54 vs. 49.19, unpaired student's <italic>t</italic> test = 0.69, <italic>P</italic> = 0.49), FVC (50.50 vs. 49.23, <italic>t</italic> test = 0.33, <italic>P</italic> = 0.74) and FEV1/FVC (101.96 vs. 99.96, <italic>t</italic> = 1.09, <italic>P</italic> = 0.27).

This is particularly important in the present era of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, when extra pulmonary TB is more commonly encountered in clinical practice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Majority of patients with TB live in the most populous countries of Asian subcontinent, which accounts for nearly half of the new cases that arise yearly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In our country, where about 40% of the population is infected with the TB bacillus and which accounts for a fifth of the global burden of tuberculosis,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] priority of our National TB control program has always been given to the sputum smear positive pulmonary TB cases and there is a lack of data on the incidence of extrapulmonary TB patients. Thoracentesis is one of the commonest procedures done in hospital settings in our country but there are very few studies from this part of the world on the effect of thoracentesis in patients of tuberculous pleural effusion.</p><p>Our study on a series of patients of tuberculous pleural effusion showed male preponderance and most of the patients were in the age group of 15&#x02013;35 years. Similar age and sex distribution was also found by Singla R in his study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] In general, patients with tuberculous pleural effusion are found to be younger than patients with parenchymal TB. The high male preponderance may be due to the prevailing socio-economic conditions and health-seeking behavior of the patients in our country.</p><p>All the patients included in our study had moderate to massive pleural effusion and experienced dyspnea at rest or on exertion. Patients in group A, who underwent therapeutic thoracentesis, had immediate relief from dyspnea after drainage of pleural fluid whereas those in group B had a gradual relief from dyspnea. We did not include any objective tool like visual analogue scale or the Borg score to demonstrate the effect of thoracentesis on dyspnea. However, there was significant subjective clinical improvement in all the patients that underwent therapeutic drainage of pleural fluid. We speculate that the subjective improvement was perhaps related to altered nervous impulses from the lung or the chest wall. Estenne <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] suggested that the relief of dyspnea after thoracentesis resulted primarily from reduction in size of the thoracic cage, which allowed the inspiratory muscles to operate on a more advantageous portion of their length&#x02013;tension curve. Ana Maria <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] had demonstrated in their study that therapeutic thoracentesis relieves dyspnea not only at rest but also on exertion, improves six-minute walk test and allows quick and better re-adaptation of patients to routine activities. Feller-Kopman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] had also suggested draining the pleural space completely.</p><p>As in previous studies, we had shown that pleural effusion was associated with restrictive ventilatory impairment. The spirometry parameters before thoracentesis were comparable in both the groups of patients. There were significant improvements in FEV1 and FVC over the study period of six months in both the groups but the patients who underwent therapeutic thoracentesis had significantly higher improvements than those without therapeutic thoracentesis. However, there was no statistically significant change in FEV1/FVC after six months of treatment. Prior studies demonstrated that immediately after thoracentesis, the spirometry variables improved.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Initial significant impact with an improvement of &#x0003e;10% in both FEV1 and FVC has been reported. However, it should be noted that this improvement was observed immediately or 24 hours after thoracentesis, when the adjustment of the respiratory system to this new condition may not have occurred yet. Some previous studies have also shown that there is no improvement[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] or a relatively small improvement[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] in pulmonary function and arterial blood oxygenation following therapeutic thoracentesis. Results similar to that of our study were also reported by Singla,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Bhatia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and Wang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] in their studies on pleural effusion. Impairing full expansion of the ipsilateral lung as well as impedance of expansion of contralateral lung in cases with mediastinal shift and relative distension of the ipsilateral chest wall could be suggested as underlying mechanisms for restrictive pattern observed in patients with pleural effusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Therefore, alleviation of these mechanical effects of pleural effusion by aspiration of pleural fluid might explain the significant improvements in spirometry parameters in our study.</p><p>The number of patients with residual pleural thickening was less after therapeutic thoracentesis in our study and this was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). It has been estimated that up to 50% of tuberculous pleural effusions develop pleural thickening[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and such development can cause restrictive lung impairment. Therapeutic thoracentesis is thought to reduce such incidence by facilitating a more complete drainage of effusion, thereby reducing the amount of inflammatory exudate in the pleural space and causing less fibrin formation and deposition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] However, many recent studies have concluded that therapeutic thoracentesis has no additional benefit over standard anti-TB treatment and the development of residual pleural thickening does not appear to be influenced by such intervention.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>There had been some limitations of our study. The detection of pleural thickening was done by ultrasonography of thorax and there could have been some bias or inter-observer variations among the radiologists. Secondly, we did not assess the patients with pleural thickening beyond six months. Thirdly, we did not include any tool for objective assessment of improvement in dyspnea.</p><p>The obvious implication of our study is that thoracentesis should be considered in addition to standardized anti-TB treatment, especially if they are large, in order to relieve dyspnea, to hasten the resolution of pleural effusion, to accelerate the recovery of pulmonary function, to avoid the possibility of healing with pleural thickening and its risk of developing restrictive functional impairment. This rationale may be viewed with some skepticism in view of some recent contradictory evidence. Our findings also add to the existing evidence that directly observed intermittent anti-TB treatment is effective in tuberculous pleural effusion in the context of a resource poor setting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] We believe our findings are useful in practicing evidence-based medicine and provide preliminary benchmark data for further larger prospective studies in our country with a huge burden of tuberculosis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of
