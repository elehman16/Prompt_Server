Three dosage levels [0.2 mg (low), 1.0 mg (mid), and 4.0 mg (high)] were tested. Twelve volunteers in each dosage group were assigned to receive ADVAX and three to receive placebo in a double-blind design. Subjects were followed for local and systemic reactogenicity, adverse events, and clinical laboratory parameters. Study follow up was 18 months. Humoral immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-gp120 binding ELISA. Cellular immunogenicity was assessed by a validated IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot assay and intracellular cytokine staining. ADVAX was safe and well-tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Local and systemic reactogenicity events were reported by 64&#x00025; and 42&#x00025; of vaccine recipients, respectively. The majority of events were mild. The IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot response rates to any HIV antigen were 0/9 (0&#x00025;) in the placebo group, 3/12 (25&#x00025;) in the low-dosage group, 4/12 (33&#x00025;) in the mid-dosage group, and 2/12 (17&#x00025;) in the high-dosage group. Overall, responses were generally transient and occurred to each gene product, although volunteers responded to single antigens only. Binding antibodies to gp120 were not detected in any volunteers, and HIV seroconversion did not occur.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>ADVAX delivered intramuscularly is safe, well-tolerated, and elicits modest but transient cellular immune responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00249106">NCT00249106</ext-link>

Participants agreed to safe sexual practices and effective contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the duration of the 18-month study. Participants had to demonstrate a clear understanding of the possibility of HIV-1 seropositivity due to vaccine-induced antibodies in the event of a humoral immune response to encoded HIV-1 antigens. Exclusion criteria included chronic medical conditions, clinically significant abnormal laboratory parameters, infection with Hepatitis B or C virus, or recent receipt of a vaccine or blood transfusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ethical Complianc</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Rockefeller University Hospital and the University of Rochester Medical Center. Individual participants in this study provided written informed consent after appropriate review, discussion and counseling by the clinical study team.

ADVAX cGMP manufacturing, quality control testing and real-time stability studies were conducted at Vical Inc. (San Diego, CA).</p><p>This study was randomized, dose-escalating, and double blind with respect to active vaccine or placebo. Safety and tolerability of ADVAX or placebo in each dosage group were evaluated by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board at least 14 days after the 12<sup>th</sup> volunteer had received the second injection, and prior to initiation of enrollment of the next dosage group. The study design is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008617-t001">Table 1</xref>. The 0.2 mg low dose was chosen based on safety considerations, to minimize the initial exposure of this novel investigational vaccine. The maximum dose of 4.0 mg was chosen based primarily on manufacturing constraints, as this was the maximum amount of ADVAX that could be concentrated into a 1.0 mL intramuscular injection volume.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0008617-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008617.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Study Design.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0008617-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0008617.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vaccine Dosage</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Volunteers Receiving Vaccine&#x02236;Placebo</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vaccination Schedule (Months)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total Follow Up (Months)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2 mg</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02236;3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0, 1, 3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Middle</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0 mg</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02236;3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0, 1, 3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.0 mg</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02236;3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0, 1, 3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Eight volunteers withdrew consent after completing the screening process. Of the remaining four screen failures, three were assessed by the study team as being unable to comply with the protocol, and one completed screening after the trial was fully enrolled. The average interval from date of screening to enrollment was 16 days, ranging from 3&#x02013;35 days. All three vaccinations of either ADVAX or placebo were administered to all but one volunteer, who missed the final vaccine due to relocation. Two participants in total did not complete the trial for reasons unrelated to the vaccine or the study.

Three vaccinations with ADVAX were well-tolerated at all three dosage levels, with minimal local and systemic reactogenicity.</p><p>Cellular immunogenicity, as measured by IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot assays, was generally modest, sporadic, and transient, with no apparent dose response, which is in contrast to the stronger responses observed in small animals <xref rid="pone.0008617-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Responses occurred after the second or third vaccination in all but one volunteer who formed a transient response to Gag after the first vaccination. This relatively modest response is concurrent with other stand-alone intramuscular DNA vaccines, which have proven weakly immunogenic in humans <xref rid="pone.0008617-Mulligan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008617-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Given that DNA vaccines provide synergistic priming of the cellular immune response when boosted by viral vaccines, the IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot assay does not adequately measure the ability to prime the immune system. The magnitude of the ELISpot response also does not necessarily correlate with a protective immune response either in non-human primates <xref rid="pone.0008617-Sadagopal1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or in the recent STEP trial of an adenoviral-based vaccine <xref rid="pone.0008617-McElrath1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008617-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In our hands we have seen that the 16 hour detection platform of the ELISpot is more sensitive for IFN&#x003b3; detection than the 6 hour detection platform of the flow cytometry assay, which may account for the paucity of detectable responses on intracellular cytokine staining. The mechanism of priming by DNA vaccines remains to be elucidated. Because the correlates of protection to HIV remain unknown, the relevance of the IFN&#x003b3; ELISPOT and other assays ultimately remains unknown.</p><p>One volunteer in the low dosage group formed a particularly robust response to polymerase after the third vaccination, which was of high magnitude and sustained for at least nine months following vaccination. This was the same volunteer who formed polyfunctional antigen-specific T cell responses after vaccination. After unblinding, it was noted that this volunteer was a homosexual male who had a history of sexual relations with a long-term HIV-infected partner several years prior to enrolling in the trial. This volunteer remains HIV uninfected, and qualified for enrollment into the trial with a negative HIV ELISA, no bands on HIV western blot, and undetectable viral load. One explanation is that the robust response to polymerase after vaccination with ADVAX may reflect a &#x0201c;boosting&#x0201d; effect by ADVAX after &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; with exposure to HIV in the past, as described previously <xref rid="pone.0008617-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. It is also possible that this response is a non-specific cross reaction to both polymerase peptide pools. However, this finding may have implications for assessment of responses to HIV vaccines in high-risk, uninfected populations who may have prior immunologic exposure to HIV not detected by conventional screening assays. Further immunologic characterization of this volunteer pre- and post-vaccination is ongoing.</p><p>The fact that no antibody responses were detected is disappointing, but consistent with the performance of other stand-alone DNA vaccines delivered to date <xref rid="pone.0008617-Catanzaro1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.
