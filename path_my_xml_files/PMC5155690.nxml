During the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, estrogen feedback is inhibitory, but during the late follicular phase, estrogenic feedback stimulates GnRH secretion, culminating in the midcycle LH surge that triggers ovulation. Neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in these pathways and the switch from negative to positive estrogen feedback in the late follicular phase remain unclear.</p><p>Kisspeptin and neurokinin B (NKB), neuropeptides partially coexpressed by a population of neurons that also express the opiate, dynorphin, are now recognized as central to the regulation of human reproduction. Patients with loss-of-function mutations in kisspeptin, NKB, or their respective receptors (kisspeptin receptor and neurokinin-3 receptor [NK3R]) show hypogonadotropic failure of pubertal progression (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), whereas activating mutations in kisspeptin receptor are associated with precocious puberty (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Experimental characterization of the relative roles played by kisspeptin and NKB, as well as their functional hierarchy, has been largely carried out in nonhuman models (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In patients with genetic defects inactivating NKB signaling, exogenous kisspeptin, administered using a regimen shown to be maximally stimulatory in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), restored LH pulse frequency to normal (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This, and concordant data from animal models (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), has led to the conclusion that central NKB signaling is functionally upstream of kisspeptin. Data from animal studies of administration of exogenous NKB are discordant, with both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on LH secretion being reported (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), whereas it elicited little effect on gonadotropin secretion in a human study (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In women, gonadotropin response to exogenous kisspeptin is dependent on the sex-steroid milieu (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and is greatest in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), suggesting a role for kisspeptin in the preovulatory positive estrogenic drive to GnRH/LH secretion. Exogenous kisspeptin can increase LH secretion sufficiently to induce oocyte maturation after ovarian stimulation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), but the role of kisspeptin in physiological positive estrogen feedback is unclear. Involvement of kisspeptin in the ovulatory LH surge in rats and sheep is demonstrated by loss of the LH surge during kisspeptin receptor antagonist treatment (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The effect of kisspeptin appears largely through an increased frequency of pulsatile GnRH secretion (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which preferentially stimulates LH over FSH secretion from gonadotrophs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Recent data from animal models indicate that administration of an NKB receptor antagonist can slow LH pulsatility (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and this has also been demonstrated in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) where LH pulse frequency is often increased.</p><p>We investigated the role of kisspeptin and NKB signaling in the regulation of positive estrogen feedback in women by administration of an NKB receptor antagonist and an infusion of kisspeptin-10 during exogenous estrogen administration. We hypothesized that in this model of estrogen-induced LH secretion, kisspeptin would augment LH secretion and that pharmacological blockade of NKB signaling would reveal the functional hierarchy between kisspeptin and NKB in generating the preovulatory LH surge and in modulating GnRH/LH pulsatility.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy women, aged 18&#x02013;45 years with regular menstrual cycles (25&#x02013;35 d), were recruited from the community to this study, which was approved by South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee (reference 09/S1101/67); all volunteers provided informed written consent.

One milligramof kisspeptin-10 was dissolved in 5-mL sterile normal (0.9%) saline immediately before infusion. The syringe and line for infusion were first coated for 30 minutes with kisspeptin-10 to minimize peptide loss from adherence to the plastic. Sterile normal saline was infused as vehicle. The specific NK3R inhibitor AZD4901, formulated as 20-mg tablets, was gifted by AstraZeneca UK. Transdermal patches releasing 200-&#x003bc;g 17&#x003b2;-estradiol per 24 hours (Janssen) were used as exogenous estradiol treatment (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol</title><p>To standardize estrogen exposure and the onset of increased LH secretion, we used a model of follicular phase administration of transdermal estradiol (200 &#x003bc;g/d), which initially suppresses then at 48-hour increases LH secretion (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In preliminary studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/suppl/10.1210/jc.2016-2132/suppl_file/jc-16-2132.pdf">Supplemental Figure 1</ext-link>), we confirmed that LH secretion at 48 hours is increased to the same extent if the patches were removed at 32 hours or continued till 72 hours: for the main study, therefore, patches were removed at 32 hours. Sample size was based on previous proof of concept mechanistic studies (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Twenty women were randomly allocated to NK3R antagonist (AZD4901) 40 mg oral twice daily starting from cycle day 4&#x02013;6 for 6 days, or no treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Two transdermal estradiol patches were administered after 5 days (time 0 h), in the late follicular phase (cycle d 9&#x02013;11, according to the day of starting AZD4901). At 24 hours of estradiol treatment, volunteers attended our clinical research facility for 8 hours. After an hour of baseline sampling, volunteers were randomized (using sealed envelopes) to receive a continuous iv infusion of kisspeptin-10 (4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) or vehicle for 7 hours. In the NK3R antagonist treatment group, the last dose of AZD4901 was on the morning of kisspeptin-10 or vehicle administration. Estradiol patches were removed at the end of the infusion, ie, 32 hours after application. Volunteers attended for further measurement of reproductive hormones at 48 and 72 hours. In a subsequent menstrual cycle, all women returned to receive the alternate infusion of kisspeptin-10 or saline. Those receiving NK3R antagonist had at least 1 wash out cycle between treatment cycles. To compare the effect of exogenous vs endogenous estrogen on kisspeptin-10 response, another group of 10 women received iv kisspeptin-10 (4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) infusion for 7 hours on cycle day 10&#x02013;12 without exogenous estrogen treatment, with reproductive hormone measurements at equivalent time points.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Study protocol diagram.

During the 8-hour visit, blood samples were collected via an indwelling iv cannula at 10-minute intervals for assessments of LH pulsatility; FSH was measured hourly.

Pharmacological blockage of NKB-NK3R signaling slowed LH pulsatility and shortened the duration of kisspeptin-mediated LH secretion with &#x0201c;sharpening&#x0201d; of the LH response, and strikingly abolished the relationship between estradiol and LH response to kisspeptin. Taken together, these data support a central role for kisspeptin in the modulation of GnRH/LH secretion, and although NKB signaling is largely upstream of kisspeptin as previously reported (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), both pathways interact in determining the timing and characteristics of estrogenic negative and positive feedback on LH secretion.</p><p>The stimulatory effect of exogenous kisspeptin on LH secretion in women is dependent on the sex steroid environment (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This response is initially limited but increases markedly in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle when estradiol levels are rising (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). For most of the cycle, GnRH and thus LH secretion are inhibited by negative feedback from estradiol (and progesterone in the luteal phase), thus the low responsiveness to kisspeptin administration in previous studies is consistent with endogenous kisspeptin signaling being suppressed by the inhibitory steroidal actions, presumably at the GnRH neuron and/or gonadotroph level. Conversely, the enhanced LH response in the later follicular phase may indicate the development of increased endogenous kisspeptin signaling in the lead up to the midcycle surge. This is supported by animal studies, where kisspeptin expression is highest after an estrogen challenge in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (the site of positive estrogen feedback in rodents) in ovariectomized mice (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and at the time of GnRH/LH surge in sheep (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), but is prevented by administration of kisspeptin receptor antagonist (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The present data suggests a role of estradiol in modulating LH response to kisspeptin-10 infusion, which persisted well beyond the pharmacokinetic clearance of the exogenous kisspeptin-10. The striking positive relationship between estradiol concentration in the late follicular phase and the LH response to kisspeptin-10 infusion lends further support for the involvement of kisspeptin in estrogen feedback, as recently demonstrated for kisspeptin-54 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>The present data demonstrate that NK3R antagonist treatment, in an environment of high estrogenic negative feedback, reduced LH secretion and pulse frequency, whereas in the presence of kisspeptin-10 had a stimulatory effect on the secretion of both gonadotropins, but with a shorter duration of LH response. Hitherto, NK3R antagonists have been demonstrated to suppress LH secretion in states of high LH output, such as in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), or in the ovariectomized ewe and castrate monkeys (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and in intact female monkeys a delay of surge like, but no decrease in basal LH secretion was observed (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although it appears that the suppression of LH secretion by the present dose and regimen lasted only a few hours, this was sufficient to significantly lower estradiol concentrations after 5 days of NK3R antagonist treatment (ie, before the estrogenic treatment) compared with controls. Although this demonstrates a role of NKB in the regulation of LH secretion, NK3R antagonist had no effect on the timing of peak LH secretion in this model of estrogen administration, which is consistent with a lack of effect of NK3R antagonist on the estrogen induced LH surge seen in ovariectomized ewes (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The mechanisms critical for progression to positive estrogen feedback therefore appear to be largely independent of NKB but dependent on kisspeptin, consistent with rodent neuroanatomical data (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). A recent study using a different NK3R antagonist in normal women also showed a temporary suppression of LH levels lasting few hours after dosing, but no overall decrease in basal LH secretion after treatment throughout the follicular phase (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). NK3Ra did, however, delay LH surge in some women, probably as a consequence of delayed preovulatory estradiol rise, but the study did not assess the effect of NKB antagonism at the time of the switch from negative to positive estrogen feedback, when NKB might be no longer critical (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Unlike in the present study, no effect of NK3Ra on FSH secretion was observed (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that infusion of kisspeptin-10 can restore LH pulsatile secretion in men and women with inactivating mutations in NKB signaling, indicating that kisspeptin is functionally downstream of NKB in LH pulse generation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This is supported by the inability of the NK3R agonist senktide to stimulate LH secretion in <italic>Kiss1r</italic> knockout mice (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Consistent with this overall hierarchy, NKB antagonism (active during kisspeptin-10 administration as half-life of AZD4901 is 8.5 h) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) did not prevent the stimulatory effect of kisspeptin-10 infusion on LH secretion. NKB antagonist, however, shortened the LH response to kisspeptin-10, affecting its timing by reducing the variability of peak LH secretion, and disrupted the relationship between LH response and estradiol concentrations. These findings suggest a more complex interaction than a linear pathway between those neuropeptides at the time of the midcycle LH surge, but are also consistent with NK3R antagonist reducing endogenous kisspeptin stimulation of GnRH as a contribution to the observed effect.</p><p>LH pulse frequency increases in the late follicular phase, culminating in the midcycle LH surge (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Exogenous kisspeptin stimulates pulsatile LH secretion (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), but its role as a potential contributor to positive estrogen feedback has not been previously investigated. In this study, the increase in LH secretion during kisspeptin-10 infusion included increased LH pulse frequency and mass-per-secretory pulse. This resulted in a larger proportion of total LH secretion occurring in pulsatile bursts, and the regularity of LH secretory pattern showed greater orderliness in the lead up to the stimulatory phase of response to estrogen. Deconvolution analysis also indicated changes in the nature of the pulsatile LH secretion after NK3R antagonist administration, with reduced basal secretion and ApEn, indicating a more orderly, slowed pattern of LH and by inference GnRH secretion. The increase in LH pulse frequency resulting from kisspeptin-10 infusion and the slowing in LH pulsatility with NK3R antagonist administration both increased the regularity and orderliness of LH secretion and may be the basis for the reduced variability in the timing of peak LH secretion as well as shortened duration of stimulated LH secretion in response to kisspeptin-10. Consistent with some aspects of our findings, estrogen-induced LH surges were preserved in ovariectomized NK3R antagonist-treated ewes, although the onset-to-peak time was delayed (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In sheep, the NK3R agonist senktide increased LH secretion, resembling &#x0201c;surge-like&#x0201d; LH levels (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), whereas in monkeys, NK3R antagonist abolished LH surge, ovulation, and subsequent progesterone rise (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although our data primarily indicate that NKB signaling is largely upstream of kisspeptin signaling in mediating estrogenic positive effects, it clearly has a modulatory role in determining the pattern and duration of GnRH secretion during estrogen positive feedback.</p><p>A stimulatory effect of kisspeptin alone on FSH has been minimal and inconsistent in previous studies (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) but was robustly demonstrated in this model and was not prevented by NK3R antagonist treatment. NK3R antagonist also increased FSH secretion and markedly augmented stimulation by kisspeptin-10. These findings are consistent with well-established data from animal models showing that high GnRH pulse frequency favors LH secretion, whereas low pulse frequency favors FSH secretion (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and that this is the main drive to follicular estrogen production, the reduction in both of which (and presumed reduced inhibin production) is likely to have resulted in the observed increased FSH secretion. The differential effects of NK3Ra on FSH vs LH response to kisspeptin-10 are also similar to the effects in patients with NKB defects (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Although the present study has clear strengths (the use of specific NK3R antagonist, detailed LH pulse profiling and blinded pulse analysis), there are weaknesses. The sample size is small, and placebo was not administered to the control group receiving no NK3Ra. The limited LH suppression by the NK3R antagonist might be due to the small sample size and the dose of AZD4901 may be low compared with those used in animal studies, limiting the response (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Statistical analyses included adjustment for &#x003b1; for multiplicity of comparisons, but studies such as these should be regarded as mechanistic explorations. Moreover, this model of LH secretion after exogenous estrogen administration may not fully replicate physiological positive estrogen feedback in the preovulatory state.</p><p>In summary, using estrogen to standardize LH secretion in women to model the midcycle LH surge, we have shown that the increase in LH secretion by kisspeptin-10 infusion is related to estradiol exposure. We show for the first time that NK3R antagonist reduced LH pulsatility in healthy women. Assessment of the interaction between kisspeptin and NKB showed that the duration of kisspeptin-mediated LH secretion was shortened by the NK3R antagonist, and the quantitative relationship with estradiol exposure abolished. These data thus indicate that NKB pathways regulate GnRH/LH secretion in women, are predominantly upstream of kisspeptin signaling in mediating estrogen feedback, but modify this kisspeptin response. This extends our understanding of these critical events in human reproduction.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
