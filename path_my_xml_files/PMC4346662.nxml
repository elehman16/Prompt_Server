Previous qualitative and quantitative research has explored the mechanisms involved in successful and failed weight loss surgery to explore how effectiveness could be improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The results indicated that whilst successful surgery was associated with a reduction in hunger and preoccupation with food and a sense of being more in control of food intake, less successful surgery was associated with feeling unprepared for the changes required after surgery, reporting being unsupported in the time following surgery and a sense that psychological issues relating to dietary control, self esteem, coping and emotional eating remain neglected. This highlights key areas that need to be addressed to improve patient outcomes following surgery. It also reflects research emphasising the role of psychological factors in predicting outcomes following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Further, it confirms the conclusions made by several research teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] who have argued that WLS patients require multidisciplinary care including psychological input pre and post surgery. Similarly, it reflects recent studies which have offered either lifestyle interventions or counselling pre or post surgery to improve outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further, both NICE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and those by AACE/TOS/ASMBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] state that WLS should be undertaken only by a multidisciplinary team that can provide psychological support before and after surgery. Contrary to these guidelines, however, postoperative psychological support is currently missing in the current standard package of care that is commissioned by NHS England.</p><p>The present study therefore aimed to evaluate the impact of a health psychology-led bariatric rehabilitation service (BRS) on patient health outcomes following surgery. The BRS offered information, support and mentoring pre and post surgery and finds reflection in the rehabilitation services which are now a common place for patients post heart attack and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This approach was used as the model for the current intervention as longer-term weight loss success post WLS requires changes in the patients&#x02019; cognitions and behaviours relating to diet and exercise and adherence to their new dietary regimen which finds reflection in the behaviour change perspective of rehabilitation programmes for other chronic conditions. It was also developed to reflect the findings of previous qualitative and quantitative research exploring the predictors of failed and successful surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The present paper reports data for the primary outcome, namely weight loss, by 1&#x000a0;year. Data for the secondary outcomes relating to quality of life, emotional eating and coping are not presented here due to lower response rates for the questionnaire component of the study by 12&#x000a0;months making the study underpowered for these variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials/Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>St. Richard&#x02019;s Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, UK, offers an NHS-based bariatric service for patients with extreme obesity with a BMI over 40 (or 35 with serious co morbidities). Consecutive adult patients were recruited, if they consented, once they had been assessed by the multidisciplinary bariatric team (physician, anaesthetist, dietician, psychologist and surgeon) and approved for surgery. Recruitment took place over a 14-month period from October 2011 to December 2012. Those who could not effectively read or speak English were excluded as this would pose a difficulty in implementing the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and Procedures</title><p>The study involved an open-randomised parallel group control trial with patients allocated to receive either usual care or the bariatric rehabilitation service (BRS) pre and post bariatric surgery. Weight loss was assessed in the clinic at 1-year follow-up. Patients were randomised using third-party-blinded randomization provided by the clinical trial unit at the University of Surrey. Information sheets were sent out in advance of the patients&#x02019; preoperative appointment. Two weeks prior to their operation, patients attended the bariatric clinic for a preoperative appointment to have routine tests. At this appointment, patients saw the research fellow who explained the trial, obtained informed consent and randomised them to one of the two arms of the trial. Baseline measures were completed at this time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients allocated to the usual care (control) group received preoperative tests and a standard diet sheet postoperatively informing them about their desired diet and the stages of food progression from only consuming liquids to soft food then back to all foods. Patients returned for surgery approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks later, and after a median post surgical stay of two nights, they were discharged home. They then returned to the clinic at 6&#x000a0;weeks, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months to see the dietician and/or specialist nurse.</p><p>Patients allocated to the BRS (intervention) group received usual care as described above plus three one-to-one 50-min sessions with a health psychologist 2&#x000a0;weeks preoperatively, postoperatively (before they were discharged from hospital) and at 3&#x000a0;months follow-up. The design of the BRS was based on the preparation procedures for surgery and cardiac rehabilitation services used for patients post MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The programme was also developed in line with the needs of bariatric patients following previous qualitative and quantitative research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and ongoing input from users of two active support groups who had highlighted the need for increased psychological input. The health psychologist used both didactic and non didactic methods and addressed five key factors: (i) knowledge (i.e. information about dietary change), (ii) beliefs (concerning the causes and solutions to obesity), (iii) behaviours (with a focus on diet and physical activity), (iv) coping strategies (i.e. managing emotions without using food, identifying alternative and healthy methods of coping, managing other addictions) and (v) adjustment (i.e. exploring ways to work with the restriction imposed by the operation). Details concerning the structure of the sessions can be found in the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary Outcome Measure</title><p>Patients&#x02019; weight was obtained in the clinic 2&#x000a0;weeks preoperatively and postoperatively at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months.

The present study therefore aimed to provide an evidence base for psychological support pre and post bariatric surgery as a means to promote weight loss by 1&#x000a0;year.</p><p>The results showed that at 12&#x000a0;months follow-up, the health psychology-led bariatric rehabilitation service had no impact on weight loss in terms of BMI and change in BMI, with patients showing a mean change in BMI of &#x02212;16.49 regardless of group (control group&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;16.37 versus BRS group&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;16.6). Furthermore, no differences were found in terms of absolute BMI by follow-up (control group&#x02009;=&#x02009;34.53 versus BRS group&#x02009;=&#x02009;33.8) with these analyses being comparable for both the intention-to-treat and explanatory analyses.</p><p>These findings clearly indicate that psychological support pre and post bariatric surgery does not significantly influence weight loss and could be used to indicate that such psychological support is unnecessary and should be removed from NICE guidelines. There are several issues with the study, however, that need to be considered. First, follow-up weight was measured at 1&#x000a0;year post surgery rather than in the longer term. Research indicates that weight loss variability is most evident between 18 and 24&#x000a0;months post surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Perhaps the benefits of psychological support as delivered in the current trial could be seen at a later follow-up. Furthermore, the intervention may be effective at preventing weight regain rather than weight loss per se which requires a longer-term follow-up. Second, the present paper presents the results in terms of our primary outcome variable, namely weight loss. It is possible that the secondary psychological variables will show a greater difference between the two groups. The equivalent findings from the present study, however, may have less to do with the timing of the follow-up or the type of outcomes being assessed but the timing of the intervention itself. Due to recent changes in clinical practice, all patients in the present study were given a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as gastric bands were deemed less suitable for the patient demographic by the onset of recruitment. The gastric bypass produces fairly consistent changes in weight by 1&#x000a0;year leaving very little variability to be addressed by a psychological intervention. Accordingly, the first-year post surgery is characterised by a dramatic change in what can be consumed, the need to cope with side effects such as discomfort, pain and dumping and a gradual adjustment to the required changes in diet. The first year therefore is best characterised as a time when the surgery has a clear direct effect rather than being a tool to be worked with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Psychological support may therefore be more effective if delivered after this first year, when evidence shows increased variability in weight change and when issues such as emotional eating and coping become more of an issue and changes in eating behaviour return to being more under the volition of the individual. Similarly, psychological input may best be reserved in a targeted manner rather than being applicable to every patient in the postoperative setting.</p><p>To conclude, psychological support immediately pre and post surgery was found to have no effect on weight loss at 1&#x000a0;year. Further research is required to evaluate the longer-term implications for both weight loss and psychological variables and to explore alternative, more effective timings for such an intervention.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</bold></p><p>JO, AH and CP designed the study, AH coordinated data collection, CP provided access to the patients and JO analysed the data and drafted the paper with comments from AH.
