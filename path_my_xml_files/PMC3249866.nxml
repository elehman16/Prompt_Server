Surgery-induced tissue trauma activates the fibrinolytic system by releasing tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). t-PA converts plasminogen to plasmin, leading to increased blood loss. Total knee replacement (TKR) is often carried out using a tourniquet to minimize intraoperative blood loss. However, its application enhances local fibrinolysis, resulting in excessive blood loss during the post-operative period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Tranexamic acid, a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, is an effective antifibrinolytic agent. It acts by reversibly blocking lysine binding sites on the plasminogen molecules and inhibiting plasmin formation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Tranexamic acid is being increasingly used in orthopaedic surgery due to its efficacy, safety and low cost. There are several studies that have shown the efficacy of tranexamic acid in TKR.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Fibrinoacivity variations exist in different populations because of the racial differences and dietery habits. Indian food is rich in onions, chilli and spices which enhance fibrinoactivity. This may result in different bleeding, thrombogensity, fibrinolytic profile and efficacy of tranxemic acid in Indian population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] However, there is no study to-date that has analysed the effect of tranexamic acid on blood loss and transfusion requirements in northern Indian patients undergoing TKR. So we proposed to study the efficacy of this well used drug in Indian patients undergoing TKR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted at the tertiary care hospital, following the approval gained from the hospital ethics committee. A written informed consent was taken from all the patients. This randomized, double-blinded study comprised 40 patients who were scheduled for elective primary unilateral TKR for osteoarthritis. Randomization was done using a simple computer programme for randomly allocating treatment. The observer who assessed the loss and Persons who conducted anaesthesia were unaware of the study drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] All patients were evaluated in preanaesthesia visit a day prior and were advised premedication with tablet diazepam 5 mg and rantidine 150 mg orally a night prior and day of surgery in the morning. Intravenous access was achieved in operation theatre with 18G intravenous catheter and all patients were preloaded with normal saline 500 ml prior to spinal anaesthesia. Patients belonging to American Society of Anaesthesiologists I-III were enrolled irrespective of their age or sex. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) history or evidence of coagulopathy and bleeding disorders, (ii) renal dysfunction, (iii) current use of antiplatelet medication and anticoagulants, (iv) acute infection, (v) history of malignancy or coronary artery disease and (vi) thromboembolic event, 1 year prior to surgery, (vii) haemoglobin less than 8 g/dl.</p><p>Of the total number of patients, 20 received tranexamic acid 10 mg/kg IV, approximately half an hour before deflation of tourniquet and 3 hours after the first dose, while the other 20 received normal saline (placebo) at the same time as the test group. The drug was prepared loading two ampoules of tranexamic acid with strength of 100 mg/ml. For placebo, normal saline was loaded in similar syringes. The observers were unaware of the syringe contents.</p><p>Surgery was conducted under spinal anaesthesia, using 12.5&#x02013;15 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine. After elevating the limb, a pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mm Hg, and the time of inflation noted. The study drug was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg, 30 minutes before deflation of tourniquet and 2 mg/kg , 3 hours after the first dose. Noninvasive arterial pressure and heart rate were noted every 5 minutes. The patients underwent a standardized procedure performed by one of three surgeons who had experience of more than 50 surgeries. A compressive bandage was applied after closing the wound in layers and a vacuum suction drain was placed before deflation of tourniquet. Whole blood was administered if the blood loss was more than 15% of the body weight or postoperatively haemoglobin (Hb) was &#x0003c;8 g/dl or haematocrit &#x0003c;30%. Intraoperative and postoperative blood loss was estimated by two different methods. The first was a standard clinical method where approximate blood loss was taken as volume of blood recovered in the suction apparatus, drains and calculation of blood loss from sponges used during surgery. Each half soaked sponge was calculated as 25 ml of blood, and a fully soaked one as 50 ml. This estimation was done by senior resident or consultant. The second method was based on changes in Hb level. Assuming that blood volume (BV) on the fifth day after surgery was the same as that before surgery, we calculated the loss of Hb using the formula[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Hb loss = BV &#x000d7; (Hb<sub>i</sub> &#x02013; Hb<sub>e</sub>) &#x000d7; 0.001 + Hb<sub>t</sub></p><p>Note: Hb<sub>i</sub> &#x02013; Hb concentration before surgery; Hb<sub>e</sub> &#x02013; Hb concentration on the fifth day after surgery; Hb<sub>t</sub> &#x02013; total amount of allogenic Hb transfused; BV &#x02013; blood volume taken as 7% of total body weight of the patient.</p><p>A unit of banked blood was considered to contain 52 g Hb. The blood loss (ml) was related to the patients&#x02019; preoperative Hb value (g/l) (blood loss = 1000 &#x000d7; Hb loss/Hbi). Results were analysed using Student's paired test.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic profile of the patients and preoperative physical status were comparable in both groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient characteristics, laboratory and surgical data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-55-590-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The mean post-operative blood loss with tranexamic acid was less than half the blood loss in the placebo group (272 vs. 685; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).

Two patients who required multiple blood transfusions had preoperative low haemoglobin levels (10.3. and 10.9 g/dl). Three patients out seven in the study group who required transfusion had low haemoglobin levels (8.2, 8.6 and 9.2 g/dl).

The present study shows nearly 60% reduction in post-operative blood loss with prophylaxis, using tranexamic acid. The results of this study can be broadly comparable with other similar studies. Hippala and colleagues in two studies demonstrated 45% and 48% reduction in blood loss with the use of tranexamic acid in TKR.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Another study showed that tranexamic acid in knee arthroplasty reduces blood loss by nearly 50% and the number of transfused blood units by one-third, with treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The present study demonstrated that twice the number of patients in the placebo group required blood transfusion when compared to the tranexamic acid group. A meta-analysis of nine randomized control studies demonstrated that the use of tranexamic acid for patients undergoing TKR significantly reduces the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Other clinical studies have demonstrated a decrease in the percentage of patients receiving transfusion with tranexamic acid therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] A study by Lozano and colleagues demonstrated that only 17.6% patients on tranexamic acid received red blood cells transfusion, while 54% of patients in the control group needed the same in TKR.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Alvarez and workers also reported similar findings. They used same bolus dose. Authors questioned the usefulness of the postoperative reinfusion drains and autologous transfusion in addition to reduction of blood loss and transfusion after administration of tranexamic acid.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The application of a pneumatic tourniquet or venous occlusion enhances the fibrinolytic activity by several times above the basal level.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The acceleration of fibrinolysis is due to tissue plasminogen activator released from the vascular endothelium, which is triggered by anoxia or venous distension. The restoration of circulation could be expected to wash out and dilute factors, and turn the fibrinolytic activity towards normal, shortly after the release of the tourniquet. Apparently, the local acceleration of fibrinolysis and the haemostatic consequences last considerably longer and are more pivotal to post-operative bleeding than anticipated. The impact of tranexamic acid on blood loss is strong evidence supporting the role of enhanced fibrinolysis in this clinical setting.</p><p>Our study has few limitations as we did not monitor plasminogen levels, D-dimer, fibrin degradation products and thromboelastography. This would have given us the objective direct evidence of fibrinolysis and antifibrinolytic activity. Secondly we did not weigh sponges and measure haemoglobin levels of transfused blood which might have affected the precision of calculations. However the similar techniques and methodologies were used in both groups to assess the blood loss and conduct the study to minimize bias.&#x02019;</p><p>However there is sufficient clinical evidence along with support of other studies in favour of use tranxemic acid to prevent perioperative blood loss.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The findings of this study indicate that tranexamic acid results in significant reduction in blood loss and the amount of blood transfusion required in patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery. Routine administration of tranexamic acid may benefit patients undergoing TKR.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
