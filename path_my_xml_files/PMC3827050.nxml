Since puberty, by its very nature, is associated with weight gain, adolescents frequently experience dissatisfaction with their changing bodies. In a culture that glorifies thinness, some adolescents, mostly girls, become excessively preoccupied with their physical appearance and begin to diet obsessively in an effort to achieve or maintain a thin body. Socio-cultural agents, such as peers, parents, and the media are also hypothesized to contribute to lower self-esteem and development of eating disordered attitudes and behaviors <xref rid="pone.0078223-Shomaker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078223-TantleffDunn1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>
</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Risky behaviors, well-being and self-image</title><p>Low self-esteem and negative self and body image have been reported as the most important factors for risk-taking behavior <xref rid="pone.0078223-Neff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078223-NeumarkSztainer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Teenagers with low self-esteem often fall victim to a variety of unhealthy behaviors and may become more susceptible to peer pressure, while others may remain more self-centered. Furthermore, the desire to raise social status and impress peers leads many teenagers down a path of self-destruction <xref rid="pone.0078223-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>There are three factors, known as prospective predictors, which are considered common to many adolescents and thus targeted in health promotion programs; these are: self-image, body image and self-esteem. Development of a healthy self-image is the result of self-image change, a process which occurs over a lifetime, and starts with learning self acceptance and being liked and accepted by others.</p><p>Body image is determined by a series of individual and socio-cultural factors common to Western society. Negative body image is a widespread concern among college age females and often results in dieting behaviors, which can perpetuate the risk of eating disorder development. Body image dissatisfaction is increasingly being recognized as an important target for public health action <xref rid="pone.0078223-Cash1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078223-Paxton1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The third factor, self-esteem, is a widely used concept which refers to an individual's sense of his or her value or worth, or the extent to which a person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or likes him or herself <xref rid="pone.0078223-Blascovich1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The vast majority of the research argues that self-esteem is positively associated with adaptive outcomes and health-related behaviors <xref rid="pone.0078223-NeumarkSztainer2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0078223-Pyszczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, recent literature reviews suggest that self-esteem may not be the panacea it has been made out to be <xref rid="pone.0078223-Neff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and may be the result rather than the cause of improved academic performance <xref rid="pone.0078223-Baumeister1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Positive self-esteem has been proposed as an important defense against peer pressure and media influence, while low self-esteem is considered a risk factor that contributes to susceptibility to external influences, such as peer and media pressure.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Effective health promotion programs</title><p>There is growing evidence that effective health promotion interventions for a specific risk or protective factor (a prospectively identified mediator or moderator of a risk process) are likely to have direct effects on a range of health outcomes <xref rid="pone.0078223-NeumarkSztainer2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078223-Center1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In order to cope with those risk factors that contribute to negative self and body image as well as risky behaviors, it is necessary to carry out a risk and protective factor approach to adolescent health promotion via social interventions, in order to change the personal motivation that can lead to such disorders.</p><p>According to Neumark-Sztainer et al <xref rid="pone.0078223-NeumarkSztainer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078223-NeumarkSztainer2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, since interventions promoting enhancement of global issues such as self-esteem, emotional well-being and social support may result in a decrease in some health-compromising behaviors, the main objectives of school-based prevention programs should be to identify and criticize the aesthetic beauty model, to develop critical thinking skills and to challenge the glorification of thinness for girls and muscular ideal for boys. Such programs aim to support good health through positive self and body image in different social contexts, without interferences associated with body image.</p><p>While most programs have focused on girls <xref rid="pone.0078223-NeumarkSztainer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, a few universal prevention programs have focused on improvement in body image, knowledge about eating disorders, body satisfaction and self-image and reducing shape and weight concern of adolescents for both boys and girls <xref rid="pone.0078223-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0078223-Wilksch1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

Programs that take a more developmentally-oriented, affective approach, with a focus on increasing self-esteem and self-worth, decreasing feelings of alienation, accepting the different, and developing decision-making and positive communication skills have been suggested <xref rid="pone.0078223-Pratt1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0078223-Austin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Factors that may influence the effectiveness of prevention programs include program format, participant risk status, age of participants, type of intervention and number of sessions <xref rid="pone.0078223-Shaw1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078223-Stice1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>In Favor of Myself is</italic> an interactive (rather than educational) and universal program (?&#x0003e;rather targeted or universal-selective prevention program). It is delivered to mixed gender groups and aims to promote development of a healthy self-image and body image among adolescents to prevent later symptoms of hazardous behaviors (including eating problems). In contrast to other programs, its objectives are the enhancement of global issues such as promoting self-care, stronger &#x02018;self&#x02019; and better immunization to harmful external influences (rather than focusing on preventing eating disorders), thus it was assessed among healthy early-adolescence participants. It is a multi-component program with multiple target areas, including positive self-esteem, communication, media literacy and dissonance health education, to promote a positive attitude towards growing up, sense of self and self-esteem, body image, and communication among adolescents. The program aims to promote the ability to filter external media and culturally inappropriate messages about diversity of beauty and attractiveness. The program includes structured supervision and has the potential for high generalization due to its wide dissemination across various setting (schools, youth movements, community settings) as well as different socio-economic groups. It takes into consideration the impact of ethnic background, religion and the intersection of gender on body image and eating problems <xref rid="pone.0078223-NeumarkSztainer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Three hundred adolescents were recruited for the research study from the same grade level in a primary school with mixed gender and socio-economic populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078223-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

<italic>In Favor of Myself</italic> is an innovative, interactive educational outreach program, developed and implemented by a group of professionals aiming to empower adolescents to promote their growth and development by teaching a range of coping strategies to help adolescents resist media-based and culturally inappropriate messages and promote the diversity of beauty and attractiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Program objectives</title><p>The program focuses on the promotion of adolescents' knowledge of normal development including the different courses of puberty among different groups, as well as the myriad of changes that take place during adolescence and their impact. It also aims to increase awareness of media strategies and literacy among youth as a way to help lower unrealistic expectations and decrease concerns with appearance. It teaches participants to identify and counter prejudice and socio-political structures that contribute to the development of body preoccupation. By helping youth gain the skills necessary to critically evaluate strong societal messages for both males and females vis-&#x000e0;-vis self-esteem, happiness, ideal body type or image, the program aims to help mitigate the effects of these messages.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Program content</title><p>The program contains a kit with introductory material as well as a detailed guide for facilitators and material for eight interactive sessions (see enclosed photo).

The analysis showed that those with higher self-esteem at baseline, reported greater improvement with respect to awareness of media pressure (F(1,188)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.72, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004; Partial &#x003b7;2 0.09), and showed greater reduction in influence of appearance on self-worth (F(1,181)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6.07; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.016; Partial &#x003b7;2 0.07).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of <italic>In Favor of Myself</italic>, a widely disseminated media literacy and dissonance health education interactive universal program. The program aimed to promote positive attitude towards growing up, sense of self and self-esteem, body image and communication among adolescents. The program also aimed to promote the ability to filter external, media and culturally inappropriate messages about diversity of beauty and attractiveness.</p><p>At post-test, the intervention group presented with a statistically significant advantage compared with the control group for awareness to changes during adolescence, recognizing usage of media strategies, usage of positive vs. negative communication, self-worth contingent is less relied on others approval and appearance, and lower drive for thinness and desire to fix appearance. An important outcome is the evidence that the program did not reveal any iatrogenic effect for the intervention group. No changes in the intervention group or differences between the groups were found for self-esteem, body dissatisfaction or eating attitudes and behaviors (measured by EAT-26). The lack of changes in these variables reflects the baseline status of our research population. When comparing the mean values of EAT-26 and the EDI-2 body dissatisfaction subscale to those published by others <xref rid="pone.0078223-ODea1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0078223-Wade1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, this study population had much lower scores at baseline in the EAT-26 and in EDI-2 subscales, which may indicate that although they were from 4 different demographic areas, this population was relatively protected from disordered eating at their age (mean 13.5). In addition, this study was performed in less rural areas of the country which might partially explain the low baseline EAT and EDI scores. This explanation is supported by the values reported with respect to body figure perception. The mean current body figure perception was very close to the healthy perception and was not statistically different from the ideal figure. Shaw et al <xref rid="pone.0078223-Shaw1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> suggested that programs with participants older than 15 years, (our mean age is 13.5 yrs), have greater effects than programs with participants younger than 15, since programs are more effective when implemented during the peak risk period for the emergence of eating disorder symptoms, which has been identified as between 15 and 19 years, by prospective studies. Younger individuals may also have less insight and less ability to apply the principles and skills learned throughout the program, since they are still developing abstract reasoning skills. In addition, lower levels of eating disorder symptoms in younger individuals may lead to lower effect sizes. Moreover, changes in body image are more related to girls than boys and at an older age than the population in this study. Nevertheless, the intervention succeeded in decreasing the gap between current and ideal body figure of girls in the intervention group, thus, it may explain the improvement in drive for thinness.</p><p>Support for the effectiveness of prevention intervention strategies designed either to prevent or ameliorate body dissatisfaction or reduce risk factors for eating disorders, is very mixed. Recently, Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al <xref rid="pone.0078223-Gonzlez1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> reported that a media literacy-based universal program, delivered to mixed-gender groups, is an effective intervention to reduce long-term, self-reported disordered eating attitudes and internalization of the aesthetic body ideal. Only 15 of 66 eating disorder prevention programs (23%), evaluated in controlled tests, produced significant reductions in current or future symptoms of eating disorders <xref rid="pone.0078223-Stice1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and the effects persisted, after a minimum of 1 year of follow-up, in only three of them (5%). Odea &#x00026; Abraham <xref rid="pone.0078223-ODea1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> also demonstrated that an interactive educational program, aimed at improving self-esteem, can improve drive for thinness. In contrast to our study, these authors succeeded in improving body image and body dissatisfaction as well as self-esteem, while others reported that effect on risk factors for body dissatisfaction, body image and eating disorder symptoms occurs less consistently. For instance, the intervention described by McVey et al. <xref rid="pone.0078223-McVey1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> appeared to have an impact on internalization of media ideal for both boys and girls, but the impact on disordered eating for girls occurred only post-intervention. In addition, reduction in weight-loss behaviors was not maintained at follow-up and the program did not have any impact on body satisfaction. In their nine-session intervention, Wick et al <xref rid="pone.0078223-Wick1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> improved knowledge and body self-esteem, but their study did not appear to impact eating behaviors <xref rid="pone.0078223-Wick1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>The failure to demonstrate change in self-esteem is not well understood, mainly in light of the high correlation between self-esteem and self-worth contingent upon others' approval and appearance. Still, those with higher self esteem at baseline, reported a greater improvement with respect to awareness of media pressure and showed a greater reduction in influence of appearance on self-worth, which might give some indication about the suitability of the intervention for this population. For example, it may be that participants with low self-esteem need more intensive intervention.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations and Strengths</title><p>A number of limitations in this study must be acknowledged. First, the results must be interpreted with caution, as randomized allocation to intervention and treatment groups was not possible due to timetable conflicts imposed by the school. The lack of random assignment to group conditions might reduce the external validity of this study. Second, the control group was smaller than the intervention group. The research group was balanced with respect to the proportion of girls and boys (55% girls and 45% boys) but the control group was not. (67% girls and 33% boys). This difference might have introduced bias in the comparison between the research and control groups. Third, in this study we used self-report questionnaire thus the answers are subjective and conclusions must be drawn cautiously. In addition, owing to limited resources, longer-term follow-up with the current population was not possible.</p><p>Limitations should be considered in the context of the strengths of the study, including the low attrition rates and the high response rate over the three assessment points (82%). Although 256 adolescents filled out the baseline questionnaire, 210 completed the questionnaire during all three-assessment times. Those who did not complete them all, did not drop-out but rather missed school that day or simply did not feel like completing the forms.</p><p>More strengths of the program are the use of multiple tools to assess change in perceptions, the examination of both negative and positive outcomes and the use of follow-up assessment to examine the medium-term effects of the intervention. The study included all 3 components of evaluation: process, impact and outcome on knowledge; targeted risk and protective factors, as well as resulting behavioral effects.</p><p>To increase the chances of the intervention producing a positive effect and a more consistent impact, the program targets multiple risk factors. (Media images, stereotypes, interpersonal communication, peer influence, media literacy and critical perspective towards the ideal self and body image).</p><p>This study provides <bold>initial indication</bold> that In favor of myself may produce effective impact on promoting healthy self- perception. It has a well- established manual and a structured training and supervision program for those who deliver it. The program includes inherent observational and other methods to verify and ensure fidelity in its implementation. The participatory approach increases program generalizability, as well as leaders' sense of ownership. It increases incentive and motivation to continue, because of the vested interest in its success and effectiveness. The program can serve either as a universal or as selective program to promote adolescents' physical and emotional well-being.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Future Directions</title><p>Given that these promising findings are preliminary, future research is needed and should include greater numbers of ethnically diverse individuals, use of random assignment to both intervention and control groups and plan a longer follow-up. Future research may also benefit from use of extensive qualitative data in the form of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Such data have the potential to reveal much about the subjective impressions of the program with regard to both process and outcomes.</p><p>To increase the program's impact, it is suggested that this program be applied with ongoing training, professional development of teachers and feedback from evaluation. Moreover, repetition of its topics every year, (if it is delivered via school-based setting), may be suggested in order to address the developmental stage of youth and build a solid foundation of health promotion activities to increase the sustainability of the intervention.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0078223-Smolak1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Smolak L, Levine MP (1996) Adolescent transitions and the development of eating problems.
