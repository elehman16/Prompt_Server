It remains controversial whether the defects are treatment induced or disease related. Although the mechanisms underlying these metabolic defects are not understood, it is assumed that the initiating pathophysiology is weight gain, secondary to centrally mediated increases in appetite. To determine if the AAPs have detrimental metabolic effects independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease, we administered olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo for 9 days to healthy subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 10, each group) under controlled in-patient conditions while maintaining activity levels. Prior to and after the interventions, we conducted a meal challenge and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal. We found that olanzapine, an AAP highly associated with weight gain, causes significant elevations in postprandial insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon coincident with insulin resistance compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, an AAP considered metabolically sparing, induces insulin resistance but has no effect on postprandial hormones. Importantly, the metabolic changes occur in the absence of weight gain, increases in food intake and hunger, or psychiatric disease, suggesting that AAPs exert direct effects on tissues independent of mechanisms regulating eating behavior.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Over the past decade, there has been increasing recognition that some of the second-generation antipsychotic medications, termed the atypical antipsychotics (AAPs), are associated with an increased incidence of obesity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The implications for public health are tremendous (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) due to the large number of adult patients treated with these agents and the increasing use of off-label prescriptions to children (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and the elderly (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Prospective studies have provided evidence of drug-specific effects within the broad category of AAPs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Olanzapine, a well-tolerated and highly effective agent, is associated with some of the most severe metabolic consequences, including weight gain and increases in fasting glucose, insulin (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and lipids (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Aripiprazole tends to cause less weight gain than olanzapine (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and is often considered metabolically neutral (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Despite accumulating evidence of AAP-induced metabolic impairments, there remain unresolved issues as to whether metabolic disease is part of the natural history of schizophrenia and bipolar illness or if the metabolic impairments are only secondary to weight gain.</p><p>By administering the drugs to healthy volunteers, one can determine whether metabolic effects are independent of disease. A handful of studies have used this approach, reporting either no effect (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) or decreases in insulin sensitivity in the presence of modest weight gain after short-term administration (10&#x02013;15 days) of olanzapine compared with other AAPs or placebo (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Weight-independent effects in control subjects have only been reported in two studies, with olanzapine decreasing insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and increasing fasting glucose and leptin after an oral glucose tolerance test (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The effects of the AAPs on hormonal responses to the &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; stimulus of a mixed-nutrient meal challenge have not been thoroughly investigated, and no study has been conducted in an in-patient setting in which activity was controlled.</p><p>We hypothesized that meal ingestion that elicits both neural and incretin-mediated hormonal responses would be more likely to reveal olanzapine-induced changes in meal-related metabolism compared with the traditional measurements used to assess insulin secretion and sensitivity, which involve intravenous glucose administration and bypass activation of the brain-gut-pancreas axis. We also expected that detrimental effects on metabolism would be specific to olanzapine and that a comparator AAP such as aripiprazole would not be different from placebo. To address these hypotheses, we administered olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo for 9 days to healthy subjects under controlled in-patient conditions while maintaining their activity levels. Prior to and after the interventions, we conducted a meal challenge to replicate the physiological stimuli that patients would typically experience in daily life as well as a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Selection and description of participants.</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania, and all participants gave their written informed consent. Subjects underwent screening at the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania after an overnight fast. All subjects were given a structured neuropsychiatric interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Inclusion criteria included no past or present psychiatric history, weight stable, minimal exercise routine that only included walking, BMI = 19&#x02013;24.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &#x0003c;85 mmHg, and women taking oral contraceptives with constant dosing regimens. Exclusion criteria included prescription medications, hemoglobin &#x0003c;11 g/dL, drug or alcohol dependence, homelessness or inability to give informed consent, currently on a weight loss diet, and moderate to significant exercise regimen. If subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, they were instructed in pedometer usage. Subjects wore the pedometer for 5 days: 3 weekdays and 2 weekend days. The average number of steps over the 5 days was used as the target level of activity during their inpatient stay.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study design and experimental procedures.</title><p>Subjects were admitted into CTRC for 12 nights and randomly assigned into one of three arms. Subjects and study personnel were blinded as to the assignment. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, vital signs and weight were measured daily prior to breakfast, and subjects were supervised on a daily walk to maintain activity levels. Subjects ate ad libitum throughout the inpatient stay. Visual analog scales for ratings of hunger and satiety were given daily prior to and after each meal and snack. Subjects were given daily symptom questionnaires to evaluate side effects of drug administration. On days 1 and 3, after administration of a standardized meal the evening before an overnight fast, subjects underwent either a meal challenge or a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp administered in a randomized order. On day 2, unknown to the subjects, food intake was monitored. Food items selected from the menu of the metabolic kitchen were given in excess and were weighed prior to and after each meal. On days 4 and 5, subjects were given 5 mg of drug or placebo in the morning to determine drug tolerability. On days 6&#x02013;12, subjects were administered 10 mg of olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo each evening until the end of the study. On days 10 and 12, the metabolic challenges were repeated, and food intake was monitored on day 11. Upon discharge, subjects were given 5 mg of drug to take the next two evenings and then received follow-up calls to ensure no adverse effects.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="3232tbl1"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.</title><p>At 6:30 <sc>a.m.</sc> after an overnight fast, two intravenous catheters were inserted: one into an anticubital vein for infusions and one retrograde into a contralateral hand vein warmed by a heated hand box or heating pad to obtain arterialized venous blood.

Olanzapine was found to elicit hyperinsulinemia as well as acute increases in postprandial GLP-1 and small elevations in glucagon concentrations. The rapidly induced metabolic dysregulation occurred in the absence of weight gain and psychiatric disease, independent of changes in hunger or food intake, as indicated by our behavioral and metabolic data. These results confirm that olanzapine exerts direct effects on insulin-sensitive tissues and suggest that the mechanisms regulating the increase in food intake may be distinct from those mediating the metabolic abnormalities.</p><p>Unique to the current study is the use of the mixed-nutrient meal challenge to unveil olanzapine-induced changes in postprandial responses. One of the most notable findings is the magnitude and consistency of the postprandial hyperinsulinemia. Nine out of ten subjects exhibited an increase in postprandial insulin AUC compared with baseline, with 6 out of 10 subjects doubling their insulin response. Olanzapine-induced increases in postprandial insulin have not previously been documented, but investigation has been limited to studies that had insufficient postmeal sampling frequency (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) or did not use a mixed-nutrient stimulus (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The olanzapine-induced postprandial hyperinsulinemia was associated with a decrease in insulin sensitivity as measured by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. In contrast, aripiprazole administration, which also induced insulin resistance, was not accompanied by significant increases in postprandial insulin concentrations. The effects of aripiprazole on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity using standardized methodologies for assessment of insulin sensitivity have not previously been investigated. The clamp technique facilitated our ability to document the decrease in insulin sensitivity even in the absence of significant changes in postprandial insulin. Insulin resistance is typically characterized by elevations in EGP and circulating FFAs (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), but we did not find changes in either variable after AAP administration. These data agree with the report that modest decreases in glucose disposal independent of increases in EGP or lipolysis occurred after olanzapine administration to healthy control subjects (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>We had hypothesized that meal ingestion, which elicits incretin responses (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and neurally mediated insulin release (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), would be more likely to unveil the effects of a centrally mediated psychiatric agent than glucose methodologies that bypass activation of the brain-gut-pancreas axis. Our findings of increases in postprandial insulin and the incretin hormone GLP-1 support this initial hypothesis. However, elevations in GLP-1 coincident with insulin resistance and increases in glucagon are surprising since GLP-1 inhibits glucagon release (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and is attenuated in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The olanzapine-induced insulin resistance observed in this study does not parallel the normal etiology of insulin resistance associated with increased body adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and attenuated GLP-1 concentrations. The lack of consistency suggests that other unknown factors may be mediating the increases in postprandial insulin and GLP-1, which were correlated (<italic>R</italic> = 0.44, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, an important physiological incretin, also stimulates insulin release (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and could be playing a role in the increased insulin concentrations. We speculate that meal ingestion activates a central nervous system mechanism, perhaps vagal, contributing to the hyperinsulinemia and the increases in GLP-1 as well as glucagon, which is also sensitive to vagal mediation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The observed postprandial hyperinsulinemia may then be a consequence of peripheral insulin resistance and increased neural activation of gut and pancreatic hormone release. Elevated postprandial GLP-1 has not previously been observed after olanzapine administration; although there is one negative report (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>Olanzapine has been shown to be a high-affinity muscarinic receptor antagonist (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and in vitro can block acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors on the pancreatic islet, thereby inhibiting insulin release (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Based on these data and data from our own laboratory showing that vagally mediated, early phase insulin can be inhibited by muscarinic blockade (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), we (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and others (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) speculated that olanzapine induces metabolic impairments by attenuating insulin release through muscarinic blockade. Surprisingly, we found significant increases in both early phase and postprandial insulin release after olanzapine. As vagally mediated insulin secretion can be induced by changes in peripheral metabolism (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and olanzapine has been shown to exert procholinergic effects independent of muscarinic antagonism (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), we now speculate that antagonism of peripheral muscarinic receptors may result in a compensatory centrally mediated increase in vagal efferent activity, thereby enhancing insulin release.</p><p>The study has a number of limitations. It is possible that small changes in body fat may have mitigated the reported decrease in <italic>Rd</italic> and <italic>SI</italic> so we have limited the interpretation of findings to be independent of weight gain, rather than body adiposity. Increases in body adiposity seem less likely for aripiprazole, which trends toward decreasing body weight. Since dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements were not conducted, the reported values for EGP and changes in <italic>Rd</italic> were not expressed as a function of lean body mass. However, within the short timeframe of this study, it is unlikely that small increases in visceral or hepatic fat would have been detected by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Due to limited plasma volume, we did not measure certain metabolic variables that could be mediating the observed outcomes. Two important variables that will be measured in future studies are glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, known to enhance insulin secretion (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and cortisol, which can induce insulin resistance (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Finally, although the study was powered to detect significant differences in olanzapine-induced changes in postprandial insulin release based on pilot data from our own laboratory, it was not powered to detect aripiprazole-induced changes in postprandial metabolism.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that olanzapine induces insulin resistance and postprandial metabolic dysregulation in response to the real-life stimulus of meal ingestion. Postprandial hyperinsulinemia may be one of the early precipitating factors in the pathophysiology of olanzapine administration contributing to fat deposition. We have also shown that aripiprazole, an AAP considered metabolically sparing, has modest effects on insulin sensitivity. These data suggest direct and differential effects of the AAPs on insulin-sensitive tissues in the absence of psychiatric disease, weight gain, or increases in hunger. The rapidly induced metabolic impairments are likely mediated by mechanisms separate from those regulating food intake as we did not observe increases in food intake, hunger, or the hunger-related hormone ghrelin. With longer olanzapine administration, AAP-induced central nervous system effects would likely mediate the increased food intake necessary for the known weight gain and this would then exacerbate the metabolic effects reported here. Our findings suggest that interventions inhibiting weight gain in AAP-treated patients may be only partially effective in preventing metabolic disease since the drugs are exerting direct effects on tissue function. Developing AAPs without the debilitating metabolic side effects will depend on the individual contribution of the different neurotransmitters and also on the complex interaction between the peripheral and central nervous system and their effects on behavior and metabolism.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-0430/-/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-0430/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>See accompanying commentary, p. <related-article related-article-type="companion" id="d35e1269" vol="62" page="3022" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="23970523" ext-link-type="pubmed">3022</related-article>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant DK-084383 (K.L.T.).
