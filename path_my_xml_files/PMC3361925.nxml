Movement of air through <italic>Pranavaha Srotas</italic> is hampered in this disease resulting in the cry of organ heading toward complete failure for want of air. <italic>Tamaka Shvasa</italic> is well known for its episodic and chronic course which comes under the life-threatening disease. It is analogous to bronchial asthma due to similarity in symptoms, pathogenesis, onset, causes, and precipitating factors. In this study, 40 patients of <italic>Tamaka Shvasa</italic> were registered and randomly divided into two groups, out of which 31 patients completed the treatment. In Group A, <italic>Shvasahara Leha</italic> (5 g twice a day) was given for 2 months, while in Group B <italic>Vasa Haritaki Avaleha</italic> (5 g twice a day) was given for 2 months and follow-up was done for one month in both groups. The effects of therapy in both groups were assessed by a specially prepared proforma. Diagnosis was done by adult asthma diagnosis questionnaire and differential diagnosis with COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) was done by differential diagnosis questionnaire as both these conditions are overlapping. The results of the study indicate that the <italic>Vasa Haritaki Avaleha</italic> provided better relief than <italic>Shvasahara Leha</italic> in <italic>Tamaka Shvasa</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bronchial asthma</kwd><kwd><italic>Shvasahara Leha</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Tamaka Shvasa</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Vasa Haritaki Avaleha</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asthma is a serious health problem throughout the world, and worldwide deaths from this condition have reached over 1,80,000 annually.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] This clinical condition is similar with <italic>Tamaka Shvasa</italic> in <italic>Ayurveda</italic>.
