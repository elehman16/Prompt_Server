A total of 270 healthy Chinese older people, 65 to 75 years old, were recruited from the Ganquan-area community in Shanghai. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: multi-domain CogTr, single-domain CogTr, and a wait-list control group. Twenty-four sessions of CogTr were administrated to the intervention groups over a three-month period. Six months later, three booster training sessions were offered to 60% of the initial training participants.

As adults age, their risk for cognitive decline rises, resulting in an increasingly poor quality of life. Nearly half of community-living residents aged 60 years and over present to health care centers because of concerns about cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. By 2050, the number of individuals over 65 years of age will increase to 1.1 billion worldwide, and as a result, the number of patients with dementia is estimated to reach 37 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>High levels of mental activity can potentially decrease an individual's risk for developing dementia by approximately 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and can reduce the probability of incipient cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Valenzuela and colleagues have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between declining dementia risk and extent of mental activity in the later years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Increasing mental activity in older people by directed cognitive training (CogTr) interventions represents a promising and novel approach to resisting age-related cognitive decline and even potentially curtailing the rise of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have explored the effects of CogTr interventions in healthy older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, two recent meta-analyses drew different conclusions on whether cognitively intact older adults benefit from CogTr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For the first time, Valenzuela <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] focused on meta-analysis of the effect of CogTr on longitudinal performance in healthy adults. They demonstrated that CogTr could help slow the rate of age-related cognitive decline in a range of cognitive tasks with, on average, a moderate effect size (ES) of 0.6. They concluded that cognitive exercise training in healthy older individuals produces strong and persistent protective effects on longitudinal neuropsychological performance. On the other hand, Papp <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] found no evidence that structured cognitive intervention programs delay or slow progression to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in healthy older people. Because different clinical trials were identified within each review, a small, heterogeneous, and methodologically limited literature may be the reason for this negative conclusion. Among the studies included in the meta-analyses, most used single-domain CogTr, focusing either on memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], processing speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], reading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], solving arithmetic problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], or strategy training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For example, the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly trial (ACTIVE), the largest randomized control trial of single-domain interventions, explored how memory, reasoning, and processing speed training could improve targeted cognitive abilities. The results showed that CogTr enhances the targeted cognitive functions even in the 12-month follow-up evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Because single-domain CogTr intervention targets highly specific cognitive abilities, this type of intervention allows researchers to evaluate training-related effects on near-transfer measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, single-domain CogTr neglects the complicated interactions between multiple mental processes required to create and preserve a viable and healthy mental state capable of the flexible thinking necessary to interact appropriately with one's world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Previously, few studies evaluated the effects of multi-domain CogTr interventions in healthy older adults. Recently, Oswald <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] demonstrated that multi-domain training (including memory, information processing, attention training) in 375 healthy older adults produced positive effects on cognition. Neely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] conducted multi-domain training (including attention training, coding training and relaxation training) on community older residents and found a positive effect even at six-month follow-up.</p><p>The first aim of the present study was to explore whether community dwelling, healthy, older adults could benefit from CogTr. The second aim was to distinguish the different effects of single-domain and multi-domain CogTr interventions in healthy older adults. Specifically, we used a block-randomized, controlled, single blind trial to answer the following questions: Can healthy older adults benefit from CogTr? Does multi-domain CogTr improve and maintain cognitive abilities more than single domain CogTr? Can single-domain CogTr enhance untargeted cognitive functions in healthy older adults? Does booster training either augment or help maintain previous training effects? Which cognitive domain benefits most from CogTr?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Board of Tongji Hospital in Shanghai, China and all participants gave written informed consent before being enrolled in the study (LL(H)-09-04).</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>All participants were community dwelling, older adults with good functional capacity and no evidence of significant cognitive impairment, living independently at the time of enrollment. The participants were recruited from three community centers around Tongji Hospital in Shanghai via a dispatched notice and broadcasting by the local institute of community service from March 2008 to April 2008.</p><p>All participants were interviewed in person by professional interviewers before being admitted to the study. To be eligible, subjects could not exhibit hearing, vision, or communication difficulties that would prevent completion of cognitive training. Vision, hearing and communication status were evaluated during the eligibility screening by a trained interviewer. Other eligibility criteria included age (65 &#x02264; age &#x02264; 75 years) at screening, and educational level (&#x02265; 1 year). The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination score of 19 or above was required for enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The normal cut-off point of the MMSE is lower in China than in US due to a lower educational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Medical eligibility was assessed with a health status checklist designed for our study. Exclusion criteria included obvious cognitive decline, a diagnosis of AD, serious functional decline (having difficulty with independent living), and major medical or psychiatric conditions such as cancer, current chemotherapy or radiation treatment, major depression disorder, and schizophrenia).</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A block-randomized, controlled design was used to test whether community dwelling elderly could benefit from CogTr. Using the Statistics Analysis System (SAS) software, the randomization table was generated with a block randomization procedure (randomization occurred within three blocks) provided by an independent statistician who had no information about the study subjects. Each subject received a number within a concealed envelope indicating his/her randomization assignment. The study employed a three-group design, including one wait-list control group and two intervention groups, one receiving single-domain CogTr and one receiving multi-domain CogTr. According to the sample size equation n = (&#x003c3;/&#x00394;)<sup>2</sup>&#x000d7;(&#x00396;<sub>&#x003b1;/2</sub>+&#x00396;<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, &#x003b1; = 0.05, &#x00396;<sub>&#x003b1;/2 </sub>= 1.96, &#x003b2; = 0.1, &#x00396;<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>= 1.65, the values of &#x003c3; and &#x00394; were determined on the basis of our previous studies. Combined with our previous drop-out rate, ninety individuals were assigned to each group. The statistical power level was set to 0.80, and the statistical significance level was set at 0.05. The non-training control group served to match for the social contact associated with CogTr and to determine the net effects on cognitive function specific to our CogTr intervention. Each intervention group received 24 sessions of CogTr over a three month period, conducted by qualified trainers. Three booster-training sessions were offered to 60% of the initial training sample six months after completion of the first 24 sessions of CogTr. All participants, including the control group, attended a lecture on different aspects of healthy living every two months. Cognitive assessors were blinded to intervention assignment. Training exposure and social contact were equal across interventions. Measurement outcomes were collected at baseline, immediately after CogTr completion, and during a 6-month and 12-month post training follow-up interview.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>CogTr employs standardized exercises to provide structured practice of tasks relevant to specific aspects of cognition with the intention of specifically addressing cognitive functioning and/or cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Most definitions of CogTr include four components: repeated practice, focusing on tasks that require problem solving, using standardized tasks, and targeting specific cognitive domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The CogTr interventions adopted for this study were based on the above definitions.</p><p>CogTr intervention took place in small group settings, with an average class size of 15 individuals. The training occurred at a frequency of twice a week over a 12 week period for 24 sessions from June to August 2009. The multi-domain CogTr targeted on memory, reasoning, problem solving strategies, visuospatial map reading skill development, handcraft making, and health and physical exercise. The single-domain CogTr focused specifically on reasoning training, including the towers of Hanoi, numerical reasoning, Raven Progressive Matrices, and verbal reasoning.</p><p>Each session lasted 60 minutes. A lecture was presented during the first 15 minutes of each hour, focusing on education about the diseases common in older persons. Then, all participants were trained in one specific cognitive technique during the second 30 minutes of each session. The trainer taught the participants about a certain strategy or technique. All participants received instructions about the rule, including its methods and function and how to use it in daily life, such as Loci memory training, face/name memory training, and so on. Sometimes, the participants needed to be tested on the content to assess their learning success. The last 15 minutes were used to consolidate the newly practiced skills by solving some real-life problems. Participants received structured training in topics delivered via PowerPoint presentations. The instructor followed a manual of structured curricular format for training, but allowed discussion based on the needs and interests of participants. Participants were assigned homework once a week including cognitive tasks relating to the content of the latest session, health knowledge reading, Chinese calligraphy, and simple graph drawing. The homework was reviewed every week.</p><p>At the end of each session, participants evaluated the type of intervention used for that session. Subjects were asked to provide feedback on performance achievement, to describe their opinion of or to provide suggestions for each intervention, and to document the self-training practice they performed outside the training sessions during their daily life in a booklet which they handed in to the study personnel after completing all 24 training sessions. A study observer monitored each individual's performance and assessed the quality of the skill-related practice during the intervention. The observers provided useful feedback to the instructor with the aim of preventing participants from developing poor practice habits and precluding the inadvertent reinforcement of detrimental training.</p><p>Six months after completion of the initial 24 cognitive training sessions, booster training was provided to a randomly selected 60% of subjects in each intervention group. Booster training, which comprised one additional 60-minute training session every month for the next three months from April to June 2010, reinforced the initial training by reviewing previously practiced content.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Composite outcome measures were created to represent multiple cognitive domains that matched the content of each intervention. All measures were administered at baseline and three times post-test after the intervention. Each of the composite measures was designed to assess ability rather than performance on a single test. The outcome measures included the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS, Form A) which has good reliability and validity in a Chinese community-living older sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the Color Word Stroop test (CWST), the visual reasoning test and the trail making test (TMT). These measures were chosen for their sensitivity to the cognitive functions most vulnerable to aging. Details of each test are given below.</p></sec><sec><title>The RBANS</title><p>The RBANS consists of six scores: Total Score and five Index Scores. The latter include Immediate Memory, Visuospatial/Constructional, Language, Attention, and Delayed Memory. With the exception of the delayed memory index which is based on four subtests, each of the other four Index Scores is based on two subtests. The RBANS was designed for evaluation of disease progression and intervention efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. All participants in the present study received a version of form A of the RBANS modified for Chinese subjects without altering difficulty level. For example, 'Fujian, China' was substituted for 'Cleveland, Ohio' in the story memory and story recall test. Administration and scoring of the RBANS were conducted by trained study personnel according to the directions detailed in the manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The CWST</title><p>The Color Word Stroop Test (CWST) was administered according to standard techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The most common CWST indices include the number of naming errors and reaction time. Interference scores are measured by both color-interference time, defined as the time difference required for accurately reading aloud color-ink words versus black-ink words, and word-interference time, the delay in identifying the ink-color of color words versus non-color words [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The CWST was used to track perseverations, a measure of executive functioning, attention capacity across different experimental conditions and reading speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The Visual Reasoning Test</title><p>The visual reasoning test is a part of the visual gnostic function tests included in the the World Health Organization Neuropsychological Battery of Cognitive Assessment Instruments for the elderly (WHO-BCAI). It consists of nine items. The test involves tasks requiring identification of patterns in graphic series problems. The visual reasoning test is correlated with cognitive functions of reasoning, summarizing, and analytical ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The Trail Making Test</title><p>The Trail Making Test (TMT) is one of the most frequently used neuropsychological tests in clinical practice, largely due to its good reliability, validity, and sensitivity to cognitive impairment and brain damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The TMT is a pencil and paper task, requiring participants to connect a series of circles in order. Part A of the test (Trails A) includes numbered circles only, whereas Part B (Trails B) contains numbered and colored circles and necessitates alternating between number and color to correctly connect each circle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Successful completion of both trails depends on visual scanning, motor speed and dexterity, speeded processing, while trail B also requires flexibility, working memory, and alternating attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We noted completion time, number of errors, number of reminder prompts and number of approximate errors for both trails. The approximate errors referred to errors found by the participants and revised before they finished the test.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To evaluate the effects of initial CogTr and booster training over one year, a general linear model (GLM) - repeated measures was used. The within-subject factor was defined as time, and the between-subject factor was defined as group. The within-subject dependent variables were outcome measures at four time points: baseline, immediately after intervention completion, 6 months post-test and 12 months post-test. The outcome measures at baseline were defined as covariates to control for the slight, but not statistically significant, between group imbalance prior to intervention. Main effects for group and time were determined. The time*group interaction determined the net effect of CogTr intervention, whereas the time*booster*training interaction assessed the training-specific effects of each booster intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The repeated measures pairwise comparisons were Bonferroni corrected to protect against false positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) was used to assess CogTr effects. Those participants who attended at least one of the CogTr sessions and were followed up after intervention were all included in the statistical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The net effect size (NES) was used to compare outcome scores (immediate, 6-month, and 12-month post training) to baseline scores and to control group scores. The NES of training at a specific timepoint was defined as: ((trained mean - control mean at timepoint n) - (trained mean - control mean at baseline))/intra-subject SD. Similarly, the NES of each booster training was defined as: ((booster mean - non-boosted mean at timepoint n) - (booster mean - non-booster mean at baseline))/I ntra-subject SD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, covariate-adjusted intervention effects were examined by including covariates of outcome measures at baseline in all analyses. Analyses were performed using the SPSS, version 17.0, with <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 as the significance level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Demographic information</title><p>From the 320 eligible individuals who were contacted for participation, 270 agreed to attend our study while 50 subjects refused to participate prior to randomization from March 2008 to April 2008.

Immediate and long-term follow-up provided powerful proof for the improvement and maintenance of training-related effects on cognitive function.</p><p>The data presented here demonstrated that: (1) cognitive function varied along with time. RBANS total score, index scores and the visual reasoning test showed that the change in cognitive outcomes varied with time due to different group design and that each group benefitted differently after CogTr. CogTr was effective in improving test-related cognitive functions. (2) Multi-domain CogTr produced a significant effect on the RBANS total score, the visual reasoning test and immediate and delayed memory indices, while single-domain CogTr showed improvement in RBANS total score, the visual reasoning test, delayed memory and visuospatial/constructional index score, and CWST word interference. These results demonstrated that both multi-domain and single-domain CogTr resulted in training-related effects in cognitive improvement. Multi-domain CogTr resulted in better improvement in memory ability, while single-domain training gave better results for visuospatial/constructional and attention ability. (3) Besides the visual reasoning test, single-domain CogTr revealed effective improvement on the RBANS total score, delayed memory, visuospatial/constructional abilities, language, and CWST word interference. These results showed the generalization of benefit to non-trained cognitive functions, and such benefits persist. (4) It is notable that the RBANS total score, delayed memory and the visual reasoning test showed significant training effects in the multi-domain CogTr group at the 12-month posttest, while the single-domain CogTr only showed training effect on CWST word interfere at the 12-month posttest. The multi-domain CogTr effect showed better performance than single-domain CogTr at long-term follow-up and resulted in a steady gradual increase after intervention in most measure outcomes. These results proved that multi-domain CogTr had a better training effect on maintenance. (5) Booster training had a significant effect on the RBANS total score, the visual reasoning test, the completion time of TMT, and the visuospatial/constructional index score. These results prove that booster training was effective and enhanced the initial training effect on reasoning, and executive and visuospatial/constructional ability. (6) Reasoning ability showed a good training effect in both intervention groups and had no significant group differences at immediate and 6-month follow-up. Meanwhile, the multi-domain group showed better performance at the 12-month follow-up, which was consistent with the training effect maintenance on other cognitive tests. Furthermore, booster training also had a significant effect on the visual reasoning test. These results indicate that reasoning ability may be the domain most sensitive to CogTr (7). The completed training group outperformed the partial training group on visuospatial/constructional, reasoning, attention and processing speed abilities. These results also proved that cognitive training was effective.</p><p>Compared to previous studies on CogTr in healthy older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], our study drew some similar conclusions. First, CogTr in healthy older people produced positive effects. CogTr helped normal older people perform better on a series of measures of specific cognitive abilities. Effect sizes of cognitive abilities posttest are mostly consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Second, CogTr can result in a generalization of the training effect since untargeted cognitive domains also showed a better performance after single-domain CogTr and the effect was maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Beneficial effects of CogTr were limited not only to trained functions but extended to other cognitive abilities. Third, booster sessions consolidated the effects of initial training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], although the effects were limited to reasoning, visuospatial/constructional abilities and faster processing.</p><p>Some important findings are described in this study for the first time. First of all, the comparison between multi-domain and single-domain CogTr with healthy older adults found that certain domains benefit differently from CogTr. Memory ability benefits more from multi-domain CogTr, while visuospatial/constructional and attention abilities benefit more from single-domain CogTr. Furthermore, although the CogTr impact on cognitive function decreased over time, it remained statistically significant, attesting to the durability of the intervention effects. Multi-domain CogTr has more advantages for effect maintenance. Secondly, the largest effect was observed in reasoning ability. The NES of initial training and booster training were larger than the values showed in the ACTIVE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The difference may be due to more training sessions (24 versus 10) in our study. Thus, we concluded that reasoning ability may be the domain that is most sensitive to CogTr.</p><p>It is interesting that the single domain training, which focused on reasoning, outperformed multi-domain in other cognitive domains but not in the reasoning domain. Why did single-domain training outperform multi-domain training in other cognitive domains? The reason might be the generalization of the training effect. Several studies have proved that non-trained cognitive domains could also be improved after single-domain training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The reason why multi-domain training outperformed single domain training in the reasoning domain may be that reasoning, as an important mental process, needs to collaborate with other brain processes. Single-domain CogTr usually doesn't consider the elaborate collaboration with other mental processes, which is necessary to create and maintain a viable healthy mind capable of flexibility in thinking, recalling, linking, and reacting to one's world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, multi-domain training may have more advantages than single-domain training because of the collaboration.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that 53 subjects drop out before completing the baseline cognitive testing due to the following reasons. First, there was a long time lag between randomization and baseline assessment, therefore, some older adults had totally forgotten our study or changed their contact information. Second, the baseline assessment was conducted in summer. Some older adults refused to attend the assessment due to the hot weather. Third, all subjects in our study came from three communities in Shanghai, which could not be fully representative of the entire population of non-demented older people in China. This may cause bias in our study and limit the generalization of our results. We may need to select multiple cities for recruitment in the future to avoid this bias. Whether our conclusions could be applied to other populations deserves to be further studied. Although the limitations exist, this study represents an important extension of previous knowledge of the effects of CogTr on brain aging. Several cognitive domains, such as memory, visual reasoning, visuospatial/constructional and attention improved significantly after CogTr. More importantly, such benefits were maintained over time. The clinical role of CogTr with healthy individuals was primary prevention to reduce disease incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Decline in cognitive abilities has been shown to lead to an increased risk of functional difficulty in independent living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. There was evidence that improvements in cognitive function can have a positive effect on daily functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The generalization of the training effect on daily functioning has also been seen in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]<sup>. </sup>Thus, CogTr not only can improve cognition but may also have positive effects on daily functioning. CogTr, which produces no toxic effects, deserves to be further studied for its possible preventive and palliative therapeutic value. With acceptable compliance and training benefits and reasonable cost of implementation, our study may encourage future use of these CogTr methods to improve or maintain cognitive and daily function in cognitively impaired older adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, cognitive training can improve memory, visual reasoning, visuospatial/construction, attention and neuropsychological status in community-living older persons and can help maintain their functioning over time. Multi-domain CogTr enhanced memory proficiency and single-domain CogTr augmented visuospatial/constructional and attention abilities, while multi-domain CogTr had more advantage in training effect maintenance.
