Differences in the slope of CAR between workdays and the weekend reflect the anticipation or preparation for a stressful work life in the approaching week. These may include anticipation of job-related stress or preparation of strategies for managing an upcoming task(s) that may act as a cognitive or internal stressor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></p><p>Little information is available on the day-to-day psychological and psychiatric differences among employed individuals, but it is widely believed that Monday is the "worst day of the week" in terms of mood and well-being.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref> Larsen and Kasimatis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> observed a weekly mood cycle, with the average ratings of depression being the lowest on Fridays and Saturdays and the highest on Mondays and Tuesdays.

However, the differences in cortisol levels and CAR between workdays and weekends were not enough to discriminate the physical or psychological stress between the first or second workday after transition from the weekend and other workdays. Different approaches are needed to explain the stress experienced by working individuals transitioning from the weekend and to elucidate the day-to-day differences in the stress between workdays.</p><p>The objectives of this study are to test the hypothesis that there are differences in the adrenocortical status between weekends and workdays, as well as between the first or second workday after transitioning from the weekend and the other workdays in working subjects. This hypothesis is based on the observation that working subjects usually perceived more stress on workdays than non-workdays, with Mondays having more stress than other workdays.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> In order to test our hypothesis, working individuals were recruited based on their job status, job tenure, education level, and age. The differences in adrenocortical secretory activities after the awakening period between workdays and the weekend, as well as the day-to-day differences in levels of cortisol, DHEA, and the molar C/D ratios at the time of maximal adrenocortical activities were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>For this study, 74 full-time employed individuals working in the hospital were recruited (35 male and 39 female subjects). The mean age of the study subjects was 41.39 &#x000b1; 10.22 years. Due to age-related decreases in DHEA levels,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref> no participant over the age of 56 years of (ages ranged between 22-55 years old) was included. The subjects worked Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. All of the subjects had worked more than three months at the position they held at the time of this study, and none of the subjects were taking any type of medication. None of the study subjects had any pathological conditions such as diabetes, cancer, hypotension, or hypertension. The samples were collected between May and July of 2008. Among the 74 participants, more than one batch of samples was collected from some of the participants. Saliva samples were collected from 31 subjects for the preliminary experiment, and from 46 participants for the main objectives of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Saliva collection</title><p>All participants were instructed to abstain from smoking, eating certain kinds of food items, and consuming caffeine-containing beverages. They were instructed to neither brush their teeth nor rinse their mouth with water before collecting the saliva samples. The participants were instructed to label the samples by providing information regarding the sampling time, date, and duration of sleep on the provided labels. A minimum volume of 2 mL of saliva was collected directly into a collecting tube by expectoration. We selected this collection method because cotton-based saliva collection is not adequate for the salivary immunoassay of DHEA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref> This study was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down by the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided their informed consent and were provided with information about their hormone levels. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the local research ethics committee.</p><p>A batch of samples collected from a participant was simultaneously excluded when a saliva sample was missed or was collected outside of the designated time point (s) if discovered after the examination of the labels on each tube. In addition, a batch of samples was rejected if a sample was useless, reddish in color, or if the sample contained an insufficient volume to perform the steroid assays. In conclusion, we accepted saliva samples collected from 26 subjects for the preliminary experiment, and 28 subjects for the main objectives of the present study. General information on the saliva collection time and basic health of the 28 subjects who collected saliva samples for 7 consecutive days is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. All saliva samples were analyzed at the Hormone Research Center at Chonnam National University.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of salivary cortisol and DHEA levels</title><p>Steroid levels in the saliva were determined using a radioimmunoassay (RIA), employing a previously described liquid-phase double-antibody method.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref> Iodine-125-labeled cortisol [cortisol-3-(O-carboxymethyl) oximino-(2-[<sup>125</sup>I]iodohistamine)] was obtained from PerkinElmer life and analytical sciences (MA, USA). Since iodine-125-labeled DHEA [DHEA-7-(O-carboxymethyl) oximino-(2-[<sup>125</sup>I] iodohistamine)] is not commercially available in Korea, it was prepared by modifying a previously described protocol for the radioiodination of steroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref> Cortisol and DHEA antisera were purchased from Biogenesis (Oxford, UK). Cortisol antiserum cross-reacts with aldosterone (0.001% cross reactivity), 11-deoxycorticosterone (4.1%), 11-deoxycortisol (5.7%), 21-deoxycortisol (0.5%), corticosterone (1.2%), and other steroids (&#x0003c; 0.01%). DHEA antiserum cross-reacts with 5&#x003b1;-androstane-&#x003b2;, 17&#x003b2;-diol (6.3% cross reactivity), androstenedione (1.3%), testosterone (0.1%), and other steroids (&#x0003c; 0.05%). Multiple quality control samples were prepared, kept frozen, and used in each assay. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for cortisol were 7.34% (n = 20) and 8.28% (n = 9), respectively. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for DHEA were 6.90% (n = 20) and 8.28% (n = 7), respectively. The analytical sensitivities of the assay for cortisol and DHEA were 10 pg/mL and 1 pg/mL, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The results are presented as means &#x000b1; standard deviations (SDs) and as medians and percentiles. Since cortisol and DHEA levels were repeatedly measured for seven consecutive days, the inter-subject variations were eliminated in determination of the day-to-day differences by using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for a randomized complete block design (RCBD). The seven daily measurements of cortisol levels, DHEA levels, or the molar C/D ratios from each participant were considered to be a complete block. This complete block was used to determine the day-to-day differences,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref> and a post-hoc test (Duncan's multiple-range test) was performed to determine the significance of the day-to-day differences. Pearson's correlation coefficients for the cortisol and DHEA levels, the molar C/D ratios for each day of the sample collection week, and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 for Windows (San Diego, CA, USA), and statistical calculations were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Background information</title><p>The cortisol levels at different periods after awakening (immediately upon awakening, 15, 30, and 45 minutes after awakening) were measured from saliva samples collected on workdays from 26 subjects (16 male and 12 female, aged 28-55 years old) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Since cortisol levels from each participant were repeatedly measured for seven consecutive days, the inter-subject variations were eliminated in determination of the day-to-day within subject differences by using ANOVA for a RCBD. Seven consecutive measurements of cortisol levels from each participant were considered a block. The complete block was used to determine the day-to-day differences in the cortisol levels.

The principal finding of the present study is that the molar C/D ratios represented well the differences in the adrenocortical status between workdays and Sunday, as well as between the first two workdays and the subsequent workdays. The cortisol levels measured 30 minutes after awakening were different between workdays and Sunday, but the cortisol levels were not different among the workdays. The molar C/D ratios 30 minutes after awakening provided additional information regarding the differences in the adrenocortical status between workdays.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only four papers have demonstrated differences in adrenocortical activities between workdays and the weekend, and cortisol awakening response (CAR) was a common factor analyzed in all of these studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> None of these studies analyzed the DHEA levels after the awakening period. The present study shows a clear workday-related change in the cortisol levels on workdays but not on Sunday. This result confirms our hypothesis and the results of a previous study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> Elevated cortisol levels and more pronounced CAR on workdays is believed to reflect anticipation or preparation for a stressful work life in the approaching week. This anticipation may refer to job-related stress or the preparation of strategies to manage upcoming tasks that may act as cognitive or internal stressors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref></p><p>Since there is a tendency for the cortisol response to be attenuated after repeated identical psychological stressors,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref> it is believed that cognitive or internal stressors on individual workdays differ from one other, as suggested by the changes in the cortisol levels. The psychological stress caused by transitioning from weekend to workweek activities is not fully explained by increased cortisol levels upon awakening on workdays or more pronounced CAR, because cortisol levels and the slope of CAR on workdays were not different from each other.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref></p><p>Interestingly, the molar C/D ratios 30 minutes after awakening on the first 2 workdays (Monday and Tuesday) were significantly higher than those on the other workdays or Sundays. The molar C/D ratio was affected by both the cortisol and DHEA levels; however, since the DHEA levels did not change, the increased cortisol levels observed on the first two workdays is the primary cause for the elevated molar C/D ratios. The relatively low DHEA levels on Monday and Tuesday contributed to the differences in the molar C/D ratios on the other workdays, because the cortisol levels had minimal changes on these days. These results suggest that, although the day-to-day changes in the molar C/D ratios primarily mirrored the cortisol levels, subtle changes in the adrenocortical status were amplified in measurements of the molar C/D ratios because the ratios simultaneously reflect changes in the cortisol and DHEA levels.</p><p>The molar C/D ratio has been used as an index for adrenocortical status because the ratio represents the adrenocortical steroidogenic balance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref> The relationship between cortisol and DHEA levels is considered important in understanding psychiatric, cognitive, and affective disorders. Goodyer and collogues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> showed that persistently depressed adolescents exhibited higher C/D ratios than adolescents that have never been depressed as well as remitted adolescents. An elevated C/D ratio is associated with increased anxiety, negative mood, and deficits in various aspects of cognitive function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> Since the degree of novelty, unpredictability, and uncertainty of a situation is considered an important factor that triggers the adrenocortical stress response,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref> elevated molar C/D ratios on the first two workdays in working individuals is considered a general response to upcoming job stress or uncertainty of workload.</p><p>A population-based study demonstrated that Monday mornings and evenings were indicated to be "the worst" in terms of stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref> Stress scores were higher on workdays than on weekends, with the score increasing on Mondays after the weekend lows.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> In the present study, 66% of the subjects choose Monday morning as the most stressful when they were asked "Which morning is the most stressful in your week?" (data not shown). Interestingly, this weekly pattern of stress coincided with the weekly molar C/D ratio rhythm. Although little information is available on the psychological and psychiatric differences between Monday and other weekdays among working individuals, it is reasonable to assume that the physical and psychological burden increases on Monday after the leisure activities of the weekend.</p><p>This study is limited by the relatively small number of participants and the narrow range of employment types. We attempted to recruit a large number of full-time working subjects, but missed samples from many participants further decreased the number of viable subjects. Although the number of study subjects included in the present study was not as large as other studies in the same field,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> all the subjects included in the present work held full-time employment. None of the study subjects were unemployed, employed part-time, retired, or students. Therefore, these results are only helpful in understanding the day-to-day differences in adrenocortical activities in full-time working individuals. These results cannot be generalized to other populations. A second limitation of this study is that no systemic studies were performed to assess the impact of stress on the work environment, economics, job-related satisfaction, or work load of each participant. Further studies have been requested to define the relationship between day-to-day differences in work-related stress and day-to-day differences in adrenocortical activities.</p><p>Taken together, the present study demonstrated differences in cortisol levels 30 minutes after awakening between the workdays and Sunday. Moreover, we showed that the molar C/D ratios 30 minutes after awakening were different between the workdays and the weekend, as well as being different between the individual workdays. Although the cortisol levels and the molar C/D ratios commonly represent upcoming psychological work-related stress, cortisol levels represent the differences in the adrenocortical response between the workdays and the weekend, whereas the molar C/D ratios also represent the differences in the adrenocortical response on the first and second workday after weekend.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD)
