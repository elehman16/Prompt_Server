Age range 16&#x02013;78&#x02005;years; 75% female; 28% from most deprived quintile. 45/51 (88%; 20 intervention group) followed up. 19 (76% of the intervention group) used the website, for a mean of 18&#x02005;min (range 0&#x02013;49). 17 went beyond the 2 &#x02018;core&#x02019; modules. Median number of logins was 1 (IQR 1&#x02013;2, range 0&#x02013;7).

The website did not advise medication changes, but suggested contacting a health professional if inadequate control was identified, with clear advice for seeking help in an emergency. The website is interactive, aiming to engage the user in recognising that their asthma is uncontrolled, and illustrate the benefits via case vignettes (based on real life examples) of taking their medications as prescribed. The website is tailored based on their current use of preventer inhalers (never been prescribed; prescribed but do not really use; use regularly). There is a &#x02018;4-week challenge&#x02019; that users can sign up to, where they commit to taking their preventer regularly for 4&#x02005;weeks, are guided through establishing their personal barriers to regular use (see screenshot in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">online supplementary data</xref> file for further illustration) and developing potential solutions to these barriers.</p><p>The intervention group was given website login details and a computer link, and advised to use the website as much or as little as they wished (total time to visit all pages once &#x0223c;90&#x02005;min).

For continuous outcomes that were not normally distributed, changes from baseline were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Categorical variables were compared between groups using Fisher's exact test. All analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics V.22 and Microsoft Office Excel.

Recruitment targets were achieved, and attrition rates were comparable to rates of other published digital interventions.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> We had no upper age limit, unlike similar asthma digital intervention studies. This is important as our recent metareview only found one study that included participants over 50&#x02005;years of age, and descriptions of participants&#x02019; characteristics were limited, with socioeconomic status ignored.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This information is important to understand the &#x02018;reach&#x02019; of the intervention.</p><p>In terms of primary efficacy outcomes, there were no significant between-group differences in terms of ACQ and mini-AQLQ, although it is important to note that this pilot trial was not powered to show such differences. However, there are some interesting findings in analysis, as both the ACQ and mini-AQLQ demonstrate encouraging and consistent trends in favour of the intervention group, with one subdomain of the AQLQ (activity limitation) reaching the MCID and statistical significance. It is worth noting that for both primary efficacy outcomes, a proportion of those in the comparison group demonstrated an improvement in MCID scores as well as the intervention group. This is often the case in unblinded complex intervention trials, and validates our approach of making this a pilot RCT, and not just a feasibility study. In terms of website use, 76% of individuals logging in is comparable with other behaviour change websites,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and it is encouraging that an average of only 18&#x02005;min usage resulted in consistently positive trends across almost all outcomes. Asthma-specific research indicates that users like to spend 5&#x02013;8&#x02005;min per online session.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Our exploration of usage patterns suggests that some users missed sections that they could potentially have benefited from. These two facts combined lead us to conclude that it would be preferable to provide the core modules initially and then &#x02018;release&#x02019; further sections weekly or fortnightly, a strategy that has been used successfully for a weight loss intervention also developed using LifeGuide software.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Qualitative process evaluation interviews of those in the intervention group have been completed and will be reported separately. Findings from this qualitative work will inform the further development of this resource, prior to evaluation in a full-scale trial.</p><p>We assessed the feasibility of collecting a range of secondary outcomes in any future RCT, and in doing so demonstrated a significant improvement in the PAM, which indicates that those in the intervention group had improved knowledge, confidence and skills to manage their asthma. Significant between-group differences in the numbers of patients showing a MCID improvement in adherence and reliever use should be interpreted with caution due to baseline between-group imbalances. The feasibility of researchers undertaking spirometry in the participants&#x02019; own homes using a portable handheld device was found to be low, as reported in other studies.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Potential solutions include more intensive training of research staff; use of a device providing test-by-test acceptability information or undertaking trial visits in a dedicated clinical research facility by staff experienced in spirometry. However, this latter solution could have a negative effect on recruitment, as 21% of our study visits were undertaken in the evening and weekend, which facilitated recruitment of a population who can rarely make it into such RCTs (full-time employed). There is a balance between precision of measurements versus encouraging a more representative sample. Whether spirometry is required at all in a study aimed at people with mild-to-moderate asthma is not clear, and there is precedence in the literature for not including these outcome measures in similar primary care-based trials or for using simpler to perform lung function measures such as peak expiratory flow rate.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Lack of time and opportunity were the biggest barriers to using the website and providing the contents on a smartphone app or tablet would be worth investigating. During the introduction questions at the start of the website, 95% of users agreed to statements which showed that asthma was negatively impacting on their lives. However, at the end of the trial, 42% of users doubted the personal relevance of the website, anecdotally reporting that the website would be more useful for people with symptomatic asthma. To be in the trial in the first place, all users were symptomatic (as defined by ACQ score), so challenging this mismatch between users&#x02019; perceptions and the reality would be warranted in future versions of a mobile friendly digital intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Blinding to group allocation during analysis was not possible due to the different numbers in each group being known by the researcher undertaking the analysis. As with many digital interventions, the &#x02018;reach&#x02019; is a potential issue and our low response rate is a concern, even taking into account our very broad recruitment strategy. Similar trials have described similar recruitment difficulties.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, given how common asthma is, improvements in even a small proportion of patients could lead to significant benefit overall, particularly with an intervention such as that trialled here which is entirely internet based and once developed is very economical to make available to large numbers of people. Therefore, what seems like a low reach can still improve outcomes for a large number of people. We have described our population in detail, and our baseline characteristics demonstrate that patients were recruited from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Those excluded due to not having internet access were older than those who were excluded for other reasons (data not shown), but this is becoming less of an issue with year-on-year increases in the number of households with internet access (84% in 2014, UK).<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Comparable studies in the literature</title><p>Our recently published metareview suggests digital interactive interventions to support asthma self-management show promise, but there is no clear picture about the &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; of the interventions.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the development of this intervention, we have described its contents fully including an analysis of behaviour change techniques used,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> allowing more meaningful future comparisons.

Further qualitative work to understand usage patterns with intervention group participants have been completed and will inform a future version of the resource. To overcome the &#x02018;practical barriers&#x02019; to using the intervention, future versions need to be mobile and tablet compatible, and will require further user testing. Following this development work on the resource, these findings suggest that a large-scale phase 3 RCT is merited, with some exploration of recruitment strategies and minor modification to outcome measurement methods. Low-intensity digital interventions that are easier to deliver at scale may be a more successful strategy, particularly in those with mild-to-moderate asthma.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Chief Scientist Office who funded this project (ref CAF 11/08).
