The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of VP on different aspect of sepsis by measuring of sepsis biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this trial, a total number of 42 septic shock patients were included. The first group received norepinephrine (NE) infusion to reach the target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of &#x02265; 65 mm Hg and the second group received arginine vasopressin (AVP) infusion in addition to NE. Serum lactate, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, pentraxin 3 (PTX3), angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang 1 and 2) levels were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Level of IL-6 and IL-10 decreased, but there was no significant difference between the two groups after 48 h. CRP and PTX3 levels were not also significantly different between groups. Although Angs were not statistically different, there was a trend toward higher Ang-1 in and lower Ang 2 in AVP group after 24 and 48 h. In addition, lactate level did not differ between NE and AVP groups. There was no interaction between VP and hydrocortisone use on IL-6, IL-10, and PTX3, but a significant statistical interaction on Ang 1 and Ang 2 were observed.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although analysis of sepsis biomarkers showed no significant difference between two groups, no immunomodulatory effect for VP alone, subgroup analysis of hydrocortisone used in this study showed that the combination of glucocorticoids and AVP had a significant effect on Angs level which eventually causes less endothelial permeability and higher MAP in this group of patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sepsis biomarkers</kwd><kwd>septic shock</kwd><kwd>vasopressin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Septic shock is one of the main reasons for intensive care unit mortality and based on the latest guidelines, norepinephrine (NE) is the first vasopressor of choice in these patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Recognition of relative deficiency of vasopressin (VP), an endogenous peptide hormone, during septic shock led to its usage as a vasopressor.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, VP generally is added to NE or other vasopressors and is not recommended as a single initial agent.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Arginine VP, through V1 receptors, increases vascular tone and mean arterial pressure (MAP).

This is why procalcitonin has failed in some studies as a diagnostic marker for sepsis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, recent studies reported usage of a panel of biomarkers to reflect evolving nature of sepsis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Various markers have been studied in sepsis. IL-6 is the main cytokine in the hyperinflammatory phase of sepsis which produces the features of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] IL-10 has potent anti-inflammatory properties, which is protective against tissue damage through suppression of proinflammatory biomarkers synthesis[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but in excess amount is prognostic for mortality.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Pentraxins (PTXs) are part of acute phase reactant proteins which include &#x0201c;short&#x0201d; PTXs such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and &#x0201c;long&#x0201d; PTXs such as PTX3. Higher levels of PTX3 during early phase of sepsis were associated with mortality.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Among endothelial activation markers, angiopoietin (Ang) 1/2 system hold the most promise.

The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee (91-02-33-18310-63707), and informed consent was signed by patients' next of kin.</p><p>The study was a randomized, controlled trial. Septic shock patients were enrolled if they were older than 18 years old not &#x0003e;12 h had passed after ICU admission. Septic shock criteria include two or more of SIRS criteria, hypotension, infection, and organ failure.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Exclusion criteria were VP use for other indications, heart failure (class III or IV of NYHA) and acute coronary syndrome, serum sodium lower than 130 mEq/L, poor-prognosis patients (death anticipated within hours), end-stage renal disease, mesenteric ischemia, vasospastic diseases (e.g., Raynaud's phenomenon), and pregnancy, refusal to sign the consent form.</p><p>Patients were randomly enrolled in one of the two study groups. The randomization was based on a random number list. One group received NE (Laboratorios Normon, Spain) infusion to achieve MAP &#x02265;65 mm Hg.

Tehran, Iran) at a rate of 0.03 u/min.</p><p>Titration of NE infusion rate to reach map of &#x02265;65 mm/Hg and addition of other vasopressors and inotropes such as dopamine, dobutamine, and epinephrine were left to the discretion of patient's primary physician. VP was discontinued if any life-threatening adverse effects were occurred (arrhythmias, hyponatremia, digital, and mesenteric ischemia). If target MAP was achieved for &#x0003e;8 h, vasopressors were slowly tapered over the next 24&#x02013;48 h.

Other routine measures include systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, MAP, central venous pressure (CVP), body temperature, and oxygen saturation. In addition, serum creatinine and sodium, platelet count, liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin) and arterial blood gas were collected on a daily basis. The baseline procalcitonin level was also measured for each patient. A 12-lead electrocardiograph was performed daily. Other diagnostic procedures were carried out whenever indicated. Survival of patients was recorded for 28 days after randomization. Suspected adverse reactions which occurred during the trial were documented.</p><p>Blood samples were collected from study participant at baseline, 24 h, and 48 h after randomization and were centrifuged for 20 min at 2000 g and then, the plasma was separated and kept at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. The levels of IL-6, IL-10, PTX3, Ang-1, and Ang-2 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Day Biotech CO., LTD, Shanghai, China). Serum lactate was measured on a Roche Cobas Integra 400 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).</p><p>The primary outcome was to compare sepsis biomarkers (Ang 1 and 2, PTX3, IL-6 and IL-10 and lactate) in these two groups and evaluate the effect of VP on these markers. Systemic hemodynamics, ICU mortality and 28-day mortality, organ failure, NE requirements for each group and the effect of corticosteroid on the biomarkers were also assessed as secondary end-points.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results were reported as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation or number (%).

The cause may be due to the cytokine-induced downregulation of V1 receptors, which is reversed by glucocorticoid.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, VP stimulates V3 receptor at pituitary and increase cortisol level[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as a result VP may have an indirect anti-inflammatory effect.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p>In our findings, hydrocortisone use had a positive effect on patients MAP and SOFA. However, its use had no effect on NE dose requirements. Moreover, as it is illustrated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, addition of hydrocortisone to VP significantly increase Ang-1 and decrease Ang-2 levels in VP group while it did not convey the same result in NE group.</p><p>There are some hypotheses for significant effects we have found (a) Relative deficiency of both VP and cortisol may cause vascular smooth muscle unresponsiveness to catecholamines.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] As a result combination of these two may lead to a better response in septic shock patients, (b) Inflammatory markers such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and interferon gamma may cause downregulation of V1 receptor and decreasing VP effect during inflammatory phase of sepsis.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Glucocorticoid use with anti-inflammatory effect may decrease these markers and upregulate V1 receptors, (c) Combination of VP sparing effect of glucocorticoid and catecholamine and glucocorticoid sparing effect of VP may result in lower dosage requirement of these three agents, (d) There was no randomization in patients receiving corticosteroid and its administration was based on severity of shock and only patients with more severe illness received glucocorticoid. This might have caused a bias in the results of the analysis, (e) To identify the complex interaction of the infection, cytokine level and treatment, very large numbers of patients are required to find true patterns. Therefore, small sample size of this trial might not be an appropriate setting for this analysis.</p><p>Some of the limitations of our study were relatively small sample size, the study designed as an open-label trial and VP dosage was not adjusted according to body weight.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In summary, patients in VP group had lower NE requirements, higher MAP, and lower HR. Analysis of sepsis biomarkers (lactate, IL-6, IL-10, CRP, PTX3, Ang 1 and 2) showed no significant difference between two groups. Although sub group analysis of hydrocortisone use in this study showed that the combination of glucocorticoid and VP had a significant effect on MAP, SOFA, and Ang levels.</p><p>Future trials with a
