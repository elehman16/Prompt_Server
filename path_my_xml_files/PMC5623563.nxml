Most children experience several relapses, needing repeated courses of corticosteroid therapy. This exposes them to side effects and long-term complications. For most patients, long-term prognosis is for complete resolution of the disease over time and maintenance of normal kidney function. Therefore, it is vital to focus on minimising adverse events of the disease and its therapy. Unfortunately, no randomised controlled trials are available to determine the optimal corticosteroid treatment of an infrequent relapse of nephrotic syndrome. Recent studies show that treatment schedules for the first episode can safely be shortened to 2&#x02009;months. The hypothesis of the REducing STEroids in Relapsing Nephrotic syndrome (RESTERN) study is that a 4-week reduction of alternate-day steroids after inducing remission is effective and safe, reduces steroid exposure by 35% on average and is therefore preferable.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The RESTERN study is a nationwide, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority intervention study. Children aged 1&#x02013;18&#x02009;years with a relapse of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome are eligible for this study. Study subjects (n=144) will be randomly assigned to either current standard therapy in the Netherlands or a reduced prednisolone schedule. The primary outcome of the RESTERN study is the time to first relapse after the final prednisolone dose. The secondary outcomes are the number or relapses, progression to frequent relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome and the cumulative dosage of prednisolone during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This non-inferiority trial will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the medical ethical committee of Arnhem-Nijmegen and the Dutch Competent Authority (Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, CCMO). After completion of this study, results will be published in national and international peer-reviewed scientific journals. Papers will be published according to CCMO guidelines. The final report will be made available to trial participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NTR5670, EudraCT no 2016-002430-76.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nephrotic syndrome</kwd><kwd>pediatrics</kwd><kwd>corticosteroids</kwd><kwd>randomised clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Kidney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nationwide inclusion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Large study cohort.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Two common practices in the Netherlands regarding the current treatment of relapsing nephrotic syndrome.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Side&#x000a0;effects and toxicity of steroids might jeopardise the double-blind design of the study.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nephrotic syndrome is characterised by the triad of severe proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and oedema.

Moreover, the digital questionnaires include questions about side effects and steroid toxicity at different time points, for example, during the period of daily prednisolone, alternate-day prednisolone and study medication. First, patients are asked if the different side effects were present during the specific time period. Second, the level of inconvenience is assessed (ranging from not at all inconvenient to very inconvenient). Local paediatricians and paediatric nephrologists will be requested to provide patient information at different time points. Patients randomised who did not take their allocated treatment will be considered as having deviated from the protocol.

The placebo arm provides the participants with a reduced prednisolone exposure, which is therefore unlikely to result in any adverse events. However, the main concern in this study is that the reduced treatment schedule may result in an earlier relapse, which is the primary endpoint of the study. An external Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be convened to monitor safety outcomes and to provide the principal investigator with recommendations regarding reconsideration of the trial. The DSMB will consist of two members: a methodologist and a paediatric nephrologist with experience in clinical trials, both independent of the trial. Interim analysis performed by the DSMB will take place 3&#x02009;months after the first 40 participants have received study medication. Aim is to check for a significant difference in relapse rate between the two groups. Further details about the interim analysis can be found in the statistical analysis plan. An independent research coordinator will monitor the study to verify that the rights and well-being of human subjects are protected, the reported trial data are accurate, complete and verifiable from source documents and the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and GCP. The coordinating investigators will report the serious adverse events and will submit an annual safety report to the medical ethical committee and competent authority.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The RESTERN study has been approved by the medical ethical committee of Arnhem-Nijmegen and the Dutch Competent Authority (Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, CCMO).

Using a nationwide, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority study, the hypothesis will be tested.</p><p>Currently, corticosteroid treatment duration in children with infrequent relapses of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome is based on empirical recommendations from the ISKDC and APN. The&#x000a0;RESTERN study is the first randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate a reduced corticosteroid schedule for the treatment of relapsing nephrotic syndrome in childhood. So far, most studies have been conducted to investigate the initial treatment schedule. Recently, it has been shown that a reduction in prednisolone duration for the treatment of a first presentation of nephrotic syndrome in children, with or without increased cumulative dosage, is clinically safe and results in similar treatment outcomes, while potentially reducing side effects.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18 20 21</xref> For frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome, an abstract from a single randomised controlled trial suggests that children with relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome relapse less frequently if treated with tapering doses of prednisolone for 7&#x02009;months compared with the standard treatment of 2&#x02009;months. Unfortunately, these results have never been published, which makes it impossible to examine them closely and evaluate for any bias.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 27</xref>
</p><p>In this study, a treatment duration of 6&#x02009;weeks alternate-day prednisolone after inducing remission for the standard therapy group was chosen as this is the current standard therapy in the Netherlands for the treatment of a nephrotic syndrome relapse. As the KDIGO recommendation of at least 4&#x02009;weeks alternate-day steroid treatment is based on a rather small study,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the Dutch guidelines traditionally follow the 6-week alternate-day steroid schedule described by the APN. However, a potential limitation of this study could be that some clinicians already reduced the alternate-day treatment schedule from 6 to 4&#x02009;weeks after inducing remission based on the notion of this in the KDIGO guideline.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our choice of 6&#x02009;weeks alternate-day prednisolone may therefore discourage eligible patients to participate in our study as this may increase the prednisolone duration for some patients. The use of different treatment protocols in the Netherlands underlines the need for our randomised controlled trial to determine the optimal dosing regimen for a nephrotic syndrome relapse. In case non-inferiority is shown, our results are also transferable to the KDIGO recommendation of at least 4&#x02009;weeks of alternate-day steroid treatment. However, in case inferiority is shown, additional research is needed.</p><p>The results of the RESTERN study may provide evidence to adapt current recommendations for national and possibly international guidelines to treat children with relapsing nephrotic syndrome. If corticosteroid exposure could be reduced to treat relapses of nephrotic syndrome, this would reduce the toxicity of prednisolone and thereby decrease the side effects and long-term complications associated with corticosteroid therapy in children with relapsing nephrotic syndrome.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study started recruitment in December 2016 and is currently recruiting.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e319" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018148.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e320" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018148.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MFS is the principal investigator of the RESTERN study, initiated the project and drafted the protocol.
