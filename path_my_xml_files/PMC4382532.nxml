Therefore, molecular imaging could be used for early treatment stratification and modification. Morphological measurements of pathology {e.g. using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>])} have disadvantages in the era of targeted therapy with cytostatic molecules, as tumour size changes do not always occur early. New methods for evaluating response to treatment such as molecular imaging could overcome this challenge. When QIBs become validated endpoints, this has important clinical implications as ineffective treatment can be modified earlier. Several publications have shown the utility of FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/CT for early detection of changes in pathology and correlation with patients&#x02019; outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The advantages of using biochemical QIBs over morphological in the assessment of cytostatic molecules continues to gain acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], including patient stratification and prognostic impact before therapy is initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, this requires standardized and reproducible image acquisition, reconstruction and evaluation. Standardization and harmonization of PET/CT in multicentre clinical studies is now well developed after much effort was put into it within the past few years from professional organizations such as the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM), European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA). Despite that, assessment of sites&#x02019; compliance with the imaging guideline (IG) in multicentre clinical studies is usually not performed in many trials and only a handful of publications of actual results could be found.</p><p>The objective of this study is to explore the need to perform an extensive prospective quality control (QC) on imaging data collected during the course of a study assuring that imaging data actually meet the quality standards needed to address the question at hand. To this end, a retrospective analysis of imaging data collected during a clinical trial was performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Between October 2008 and February 2010, 369 patients with soft tissue sarcoma whose disease has progressed during or following prior therapy were randomly assigned to receive pazopanib or placebo in the EORTC 62072/VEG110727 phase III clinical trial. The results of the main study were published in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. During this trial patients were offered the opportunity to participate in an FDG PET/CT imaging sub-study. The objective of this imaging sub-study was to investigate whether early changes in tumour metabolism as determined by the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) were predictive for disease stabilization, response or duration of progression-free survival (PFS). The hypothesis underlying this imaging sub-study (for which 50 patients were planned) was that for a clinically relevant endpoint in patients with a PET response (=25&#x000a0;% decrease in SUV<sub>max</sub>) the PFS was 12&#x000a0;weeks longer than in patients without PET response. The prognostic and predictive value of SUV<sub>max</sub> on the baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) FDG PET/CT was to be evaluated independently. As inter-institutional variations in SUV were expected due to scanner and protocol differences, the imaging protocol demanded strict adherence to standardized acquisition and processing parameters. In this retrospective analysis, evaluation of compliance with the IG directly affecting the quantification of PET results (e.g. SUV) and international standards was performed by assessing presence of image artefacts, reviewing the FDG uptake in the liver and verification of scanning-related parameters, such as uptake time (UT), from information available in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) headers and image transmittal forms (ITFs).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Eligibility and recruitment</title><p>In order to be eligible for this imaging sub-study, patients had to participate in the EORTC 62072/VEG110727 trial.

The amount of radioactivity in the syringe had to be measured before and after the injection to calculate the net injected dose of FDG, be reported on the ITF and entered accordingly in the scanner. The administration of IV diuretic (e.g. furosemide 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mg) was allowed and had to be given 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min after tracer administration. The patient was to void immediately before scan start.</p><p>Given the major impact of UT on SUV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the UT was required to be 60&#x000a0;min with maximum acceptable deviation of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;min.

However, since the main trial accrued very rapidly while the IG were developed at a rather late stage, only 44 patients could actually be enroled which should have resulted in 88 scans (1 BL and 1 FU scan per patient). Of 88 scans, 81 were uploaded to the central database. In two patients there was no definitely metabolically active lesion at BL so no FU scan was performed; two patients were never included in the PET imaging protocol as they did not meet the screening criteria for the imaging sub-study; two patients were taken off the study before the FU FDG scan was performed and in one patient the BL scan could not be retrieved by the site.</p><p>Of the 81 scans received, proper anonymization had been performed on 36 scans by the sites submitting the scans.

Of 11 sites, 6 submitted test data prior to patient accrual; the other sites denominated their first patient&#x02019;s scan as the test data scan.

The results from this multicentre international FDG sub-study confirm that this has a large impact on data with FDG scans used for primary endpoint. Providing IG to the sites is not sufficient. While retrospective QC is useful to identify compliant and noncompliant data, the results from this study clearly demonstrate that prospective QC is of the utmost importance as it has an impact on study outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In retrospect, it is almost impossible to retrieve the necessary data or to have any impact on improving quality. As documented by Velasquez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], centralized QA in the multicentre multiobserver settings greatly improves the final outcome. The results presented here confirm that prospective rapid QC review and feedback is mandatory to improve compliance with the IG, and is imperative to ensure that imaging data used for endpoints are in fact reliable, rather than a mere reflection of change in imaging technique used. Besides general site visits by monitors, specific site visits with respect to the imaging scans would improve both compliance and quality.</p><p>Some sources of error in PET quantification can be readily identified. Unfortunately, it is an inevitable shortcoming that the injection time in the DICOM header is stored by manual input in the scanner computer, and these data cannot be stored appropriately in the DICOM header. As it is impossible to separately store information on the injection time and the calibration time, the operator has to choose, resulting in one missing time point. Furthermore, sponsors rely on the sites to ensure synchronization of all clocks in the PET department. It is felt that instances of erroneous input of injection time and non-synchronization of clocks reflect the real world situation, but are rather very infrequent. Studies have shown the use of LSUV<sub>mean</sub> as a reliable marker for QC purposes of scans longitudinally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The data presented here confirm that compliance with the IG has a significant impact on this parameter, and it should be considered as a metric during QC of FDG scans.</p><p>Design and execution of a multicentre international imaging sub-study as part of a larger clinical study (i.e. translational research study) requires extensive planning with many considerations. Proper power calculation of the study should include certain excess attrition rate due to poor quality of scans, patient dropout or ineligibility based on BL scan. At the time of this project, no reliable data in the literature were available to suggest what could be a reasonable number of attrition for the above-noted reasons. Proper on-site training of all involved staff and prospective QC with rapid feedback to sites could improve compliance and quality of the collected imaging data and are prerequisite to obtain data sets with sufficient statistical power for making study-related conclusions.</p><p>Poor compliance with the study IG and inadequate quality of scans, when major artefacts are observed affecting visual and quantitative assessment, should be identified and reported to the sites and the sponsor immediately prior to the FU scan or the next patient enrolment. Mandatory test data submission and review, prompt feedback to sites and site authorization pending test data approval have proven very important, leading to increased and sustainable compliance with the imaging protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The recently proposed approach by van den Hoff et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], allowing comparison of data sets from different acquisition times, may correct for differences in UT. However, it may not be performed with the same accuracy on other data sets or may need some data set-specific recalibration. In general, avoiding the need for corrections or at least minimizing the potential impact of any correction should be preferred. Thus, performing the studies with standardized imaging procedures should be the aim.</p><p>To reach an international standardization and harmonization in the use of QIBs in multicentre clinical studies, producing high-quality reliable results, it is paramount to ensure prospective QC in the execution of the imaging protocol and obligatory compliance with the specified parameters. It was not until the second half of 2011 that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published central review charter draft guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] for the industry, addressing both challenges in part. In clinical studies where efficacy is assessed with the aid of QIBs, the imaging protocol should become a regulatory document and complied with in the same regard as the actual clinical study protocol. The sponsor has an obligation to ensure that the study protocol mandates strict compliance with the IG and a plan for protocol violations should be put in place.</p><p>Molecular imaging with QIBs could have a major impact benefiting patients (earlier start of alternative treatment or spare of side effects in case of ineffective treatment) as well as the health care system (lower financial burden associated with ineffective treatment). For clinical studies, this may lead to a shorter duration of trials, improved cost-effectiveness and faster approval of compounds by the regulatory agencies. Pay for performance or P4P is a programme initiated in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (in 2004) and the USA (in 2005) aiming to ensure high-quality health care delivered to patients is rewarded. In 2008 the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (MIPPA) was accepted. It applies to physicians, non-physician practitioners and independent diagnostic testing facilities as suppliers of imaging procedures who are submitting claims for the technical component of advanced diagnostic imaging procedures. All such suppliers in order to receive reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are obligated to obtain and maintain accreditation of their imaging facilities. However, PET/CT scanners used for imaging patients in multicentre clinical studies require further harmonization. At the time this FDG sub-study design was finalized (2008), no formal programme for cross-calibration of scanners existed. Since then, the SNM Clinical Trials Network (CTN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], American College of Radiology (ACR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and EANM Research Ltd (EARL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have developed programmes for PET/CT scanners&#x02019; harmonization and qualification to participate in multicentre clinical studies. However, a requirement by formal government or regulatory agencies to mandate the use of those programmes has not yet been proposed. It is in the best interest of the public, the academia and the pharmaceutical industry to use the accreditation programmes effectively and rigorously, ensuring data comparability across sites and longitudinal patient&#x02019;s scans.</p><p>Standardized imaging protocols for FDG scans have been published by Shankar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and Boellaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and are available for implementation within multicentre clinical studies. A more recent publication in the process of finalization is the effort of the QIBA Profile: FDG PET/CT as an Imaging Biomarker Measuring Response to Cancer Therapy with the Uniform Protocols in Clinical Trials (UPICT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Yet from a recent publication by Rausch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] it is clear that day-to-day practice is far from standardized in a single country.</p><p>Imaging sub-studies should be developed in parallel with the main study to ensure readability of the translational research project at the same time as the main study. A recent publication from Josephson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] discussed many of the barriers in front of drug development as to the use of QIBs in translational sub-studies. In addition, a very basic factor such as rapid recruitment in the main study, later start of the imaging sub-study and inability to recruit enough patients for the latter must be seriously considered. The sponsor must foresee possible inability to achieve the preplanned statistical design, leading to an underpowered sub-study, or even the main study (if QIBs are used for the endpoints and compliance is poor), which could also be due to low compliance and quality of the scans.</p><p>Great effort has been undertaken by the SNM and EANM towards the importance of understanding International Conference on Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines and ensuring that the imaging department staff is trained in GCP. Yet little to no support has been given to this goal from the pharmaceutical industry or recruiting investigators at sites. Increased GCP education for the imaging personnel involved in the chain of patients&#x02019; scans from the ordering of scans to the delivery of the imaging data to the sponsor will improve the results. If a patient is referred for a PET scan, yet the imaging department is not informed that the patient is taking part in a specific clinical study, requiring the use of an imaging protocol different from the local routine clinical practice, this could hamper compliance and result in a high attrition rate of data for the endpoint of the sub-study. The results from this review indicate that low compliance with the IG warrants intense education on the basic GCP principles such following the prescribed IG and properly de-identifying the data submitted to the sponsor.</p><p>Validation of FDG scans for early treatment response and patient stratification has great potential, but is pending due to conflicting results being presented in the literature, while no data on IG compliance are required to be published by the investigators and the sponsors as of yet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of QIBs in patient care and novel therapies is feasible, but only when all involved in the clinical study jointly aim at achieving high quality. A QIB such as FDG is a very sensitive marker to IG deviations, requiring strict adherence to protocol. Rigorous compliance with the IG is as crucial as compliance with the clinical protocol, as shown in this study. IG noncompliance with respect to UT resulted in a large variability in LSUV<sub>mean</sub> and could possibly affect tumour uptake quantification. Effective approaches in the use of QIBs have been proposed by various academic groups and scientific societies. Regulatory authorities, the pharmaceutical industry (including imaging companies) and investigators play a pivotal role in developing and implementing standardized processes for the use of QIBs. Increased education of the imaging personnel in multicentre clinical trials will improve compliance with the IG and ultimately deliver better cost-effective surrogate endpoints of clinical studies. Government efforts towards laws and rules mandating the use of accredited QIB facilities in multicentre studies could facilitate the desired change in the quality of the results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The EORTC 62072/ VEG110727 trial was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The following co-authors declared no conflict of interest: Ivalina Hristova, Ronald Boellard, Wouter Vogel, Felix Mottaghy, Sandrine Marreaud, Sandra Collette, Roberta Sanfilippo.
