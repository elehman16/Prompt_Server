It is not known if small amounts of acid used in dialysate to buffer the bicarbonate can meaningfully contribute to overall buffering administered during HD. We aimed to investigate the metabolism of acetate with use of two different acid buffer concentrates and determine if it effects blood bicarbonate concentrations in HD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The Acid-Base Composition with use of hemoDialysates (ABChD) trial was a Phase IV, prospective, single blind, randomized, cross-over, 2 week investigation of peridialytic dynamics of acetate and bicarbonate associated with use of acid buffer concentrates. Eleven prevalent HD patients participated from November 2014 to February 2015. Patients received two HD treatments, with NaturaLyte&#x000ae; and GranuFlo&#x000ae; acid concentrates containing 4 and 8&#x000a0;mEq/L of acetate, respectively. Dialysate order was chosen in a random fashion. The endpoint was to characterize the dynamics of acetate received and metabolized during hemodialysis, and how it effects overall bicarbonate concentrations in the blood and dialysate. Acetate and bicarbonate concentrations were assessed before, at 8 time points during, and 6 time points after the completion of HD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Data from 20 HD treatments for 11 patients (10 NaturaLyte&#x000ae; and 10 GranuFlo&#x000ae;) was analyzed. Cumulative trajectories of arterialized acetate were unique between NaturaLyte&#x000ae; and GranuFlo&#x000ae; (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003), yet individual time points demonstrated overlap without remarkable differences. Arterialized and venous blood bicarbonate concentrations were similar at HD initiation, but by 240&#x000a0;min into dialysis, mean arterialized bicarbonate concentrations were 30.2 (SD&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.16) mEq/L in GranuFlo&#x000ae; and 28.8 (SD&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.26) mEq/L in NaturaLyte&#x000ae;. Regardless of acid buffer concentrate, arterial blood bicarbonate was primarily dictated by the prescribed bicarbonate level. Subjects tolerated HD with both acid buffer concentrates without experiencing any related adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">A small fraction of acetate was delivered to HD patients with use of NaturaLyte&#x000ae; and GranuFlo&#x000ae; acid buffers; the majority of acetate received was observed to be rapidly metabolized and cleared from the circulation. Blood bicarbonate concentrations appear to be determined mainly by the prescribed concentration of bicarbonate.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on 11 Dec 2014 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02334267?term=NCT02334267&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02334267</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12882-017-0683-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hemodialysis</kwd><kwd>Dialysate</kwd><kwd>Bicarbonate</kwd><kwd>Acetate</kwd><kwd>Acid-Base</kwd><kwd>Hemodynamics</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Fresenius Medical Care North America</institution></funding-source><award-id>Not applicable</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">In end stage renal disease (ESRD), the body lacks the ability to effectively excrete its acid load, and thus hemodialysis (HD) therapy assumes an important role in regulation of acid-base homeostasis by providing base from the dialysate to neutralize acids produced from catabolism of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Bicarbonate dialysates are commonly utilized to buffer acidic anions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and prescriptions are recommended by Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines to be individually titrated to achieve a predialysis blood bicarbonate concentration of &#x02265;22&#x000a0;mEq/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If dialysate bicarbonate concentrations are not prescribed properly, metabolic acidosis or metabolic alkalosis may occur, which have been associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In the absence of liver disease, precursors of bicarbonate (e.g. acetate, lactate, citrate) are rapidly metabolized by the liver and other tissues into bicarbonate and used for regulation of acid-base homeostasis. However, it is currently not established to what extent dialysate acid buffer concentrates that include metabolic precursors of bicarbonate contribute to the overall bicarbonate administered and subsequent blood bicarbonate concentrations. Current practice and labeling of products denote that metabolic precursors of bicarbonate should be considered to contribute to the buffer administered and are typically added to the ordered bicarbonate dose, yielding a &#x0201c;total buffer&#x0201d; prescribed.</p><p id="Par18">The aims of the Acid-Base Composition with use of hemoDialysates (ABChD) trial was to use two commonly used acid dialysate buffers to: 1. study the pragmatic dynamics of the levels of acetate patients receive from the acid dialysate during HD; 2. establish the extent to which acetate is metabolized into bicarbonate, and 3. characterize the overall peridialytic dynamics of blood bicarbonate concentrations.

The protocol amendments were performed to feasibly accomplish study enrollment and clarify items in the protocol. The first protocol amendment included updating eligibility criteria for the permitted mean 2 week interdialytic weight gain before screening from &#x02264;2&#x000a0;kg to &#x02264;3.5&#x000a0;kg, defining actions to determine the presence of significant residual renal function when the quantity of urine output was in question, clarify parameters of the patients prescription to be captured and that remained unchanged with use of differing hemodialysate types, clarify potential intradialytic saline infusions to be captured, and extend the predefined time points to collect blood specimens postdialysis.</p><p id="Par39">The second protocol amendment included extending the screening period from 30&#x000a0;days to 45&#x000a0;days, updating the requirement that patients were receiving dialysis three times per week 1 month before participation to that patients were on a stable dialysis prescription for the prior month with the stipulation that they received all scheduled outpatient dialysis treatments within 2 weeks prior to screening, updating that screening laboratories are to be collected at the study site for determining eligibility and not captured from historic values, permitting the use of glucocorticoids/corticosteroids for controlled and clinically stable autoimmune diseases, clarifying the procedures for reconciliation of concomitant medications, and defining permitted rescreening conditions for patients who missed a study HD treatment for non-clinical reasons.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par40">Since there have not been previous studies performed with a validated acetate assay to give us an expected reference value and variations in acetate blood levels to base an estimation upon, a formal power estimation was not performed for determining a sample size to drive <italic>p</italic>-values. It is notable to mention that there have been reports in the literature of normal acetate blood levels that are more than 10 fold different using differing invalidated assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the sample size was chosen via medical judgment based on educated assumptions from the study team, and considerations of sample sizes utilized for other intense physiological studies with high number of measurements. We chose a predefined sample size of a minimum of 10 and up to 20 prevalent HD patients to achieve 10 subjects that completed both study HD treatments in this trial. This study design that included inpatient admission of subjects for a well-controlled study environment for collection of specimens was not considered feasible in a large population of patients, therefore we selected a cross over design, whereby patients act as their own control. Notably, this study was designed to have a very high number of sampling time points (16 arterialized and 8 venous blood draws during each treatment, as well as, 9 inflow and 9 outflow dialysate samplings per treatment), which yielded 84 data points per patient per treatment to determine the main study endpoints. The sample size with a cross-over design and the high number of collection time points was overall determined to be appropriate for assessment of the endpoints of the protocol.</p><p id="Par41">The analysis of the endpoints was included data on the Per Protocol (PP) population, which included all data for patients who were administered at least one study related HD treatment, had post-interventional HD treatment bicarbonate and acetate data available, and did not meet any pre-specified protocol criteria for exclusion of study data; these analyses were performed after the completion of study procedures. The analysis of vital signs and general laboratories not related to the study endpoints were performed on the Safety Population, which included patients who had at least one HD treatment. For determination of the primary endpoint, descriptive statistics using standard methods were calculated and time plots were generated per patient for each HD treatment for bicarbonate and acetate concentrations in arterial, venous, inflow and outflow samples. The secondary endpoint was analyzed by assessing peridialytic changes, per patient per treatment using linear mixed effects models that were constructed with time and baseline predialysis values as fixed effects, and the patient as a random effect. Additionally, the slopes of the models were further investigated for excursions of bicarbonate blood concentrations. Exploratory analyses of a select cohort of the study population was performed using the same methods utilized for the entire study population; these analyses were performed due to unexpected findings in inflow dialysate acetate concentrations in some of the HD treatments for three patients that were not consistent with the known concentrations of acetate in the acid dialysate buffer types. To ensure proper dialysis access function during study HD treatments, variations in access recirculation of &#x0003e;&#x02009;50% calculated via 30&#x000a0;min of HD blood urea nitrogen measurements were prespecified to be removed from the analysis.

We identified that a small fraction of dialysate acetate was delivered to patients during HD using NaturaLyte&#x000ae; or GranuFlo&#x000ae; acid buffer concentrates, as seen by slight increases in venous blood acetate concentrations leaving the dialyzer and returning to the patient. However, acetate that was delivered was found to be rapidly cleared from the circulation since arterialized blood acetate concentrations were relatively unchanged during and after dialysis. We believe that the small amount of acetate in the dialysate solutions used does not appear to overwhelm the liver&#x02019;s capacity for metabolism. We observed bicarbonate concentrations were within and did not exceed the prescribed target range with use of both NaturaLyte&#x000ae; and GranuFlo&#x000ae; acid buffer concentrates. During dialysis there were no differences between acid buffer concentrates in the cumulative curves of venous blood bicarbonate concentrations (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.4; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which indicates patients were delivered similar concentrations of bicarbonate and there were no differences in the postdialysis period, suggesting that the acid buffer concentrate type does not influence the ultimate concentration of bicarbonate. Notably, we found that there was incomplete diffusion of bicarbonate from the dialysate delivered to the patient with venous blood concentrations being considerably lower than inflow dialysate; this was also true for acetate. Overall, the concentration of acetate in NaturaLyte&#x000ae; and GranuFlo&#x000ae; acid buffer solutions did not impact the overall buffer received by patients as observed by bicarbonate levels being within the prescribed concentration with both dialysate acid buffer types, and we found that the concentrations of bicarbonate prescribed is the major determinate of buffer delivery from the dialysate. These findings show that the speculated concept of a total buffer, where the prescribed bicarbonate equals the sum of bicarbonate in the dialysate bicarbonate buffer plus the precursors in the acid buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], is false. Since, all dialysate buffers use a precursor of bicarbonate for an acid to buffer the bicarbonate in the dialysate, which have the same metabolic pathway as acetate, dialysate solutions that are acetate free would be anticipated to have similar impacts on the overall bicarbonate prescription as found to have in this study, but further investigations are needed.</p><p id="Par62">The normal physiological concentrations of acetate in human blood have not been well established. The reported ranges vary considerably from 0.05&#x000a0;mmol/L to 0.52&#x000a0;mmol/L in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and for dialysis patients, predialysis acetate concentrations range from 0.02&#x000a0;mmol/L to 0.78&#x000a0;mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These variations are expected with the myriad of proprietary detection methods used for determining blood acetate concentrations, many of which utilized gas chromatography methods that recently have been reported to not be appropriate for quantitative measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We used a colorimetric assay kit validated for detection of dialysate and blood acetate concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and to our knowledge this is the first fully validated method in humans. However, relative normal physiological values of acetate concentration in HD patients have not been elucidated due to a lack of widespread testing. We observed predialysis acetate blood concentrations of approximately 0.5&#x000a0;mmol/L, which is consistent with some previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">Currently, there are few reports that have investigated the dynamics of acetate concentrations in the blood associated with bicarbonate HD. A recent Spanish randomized clinical trial by S&#x000e1;nchez-Canel et al. investigated the acid-base status of 22 patients receiving hemodiafiltration (HDF) with bicarbonate dialysate containing 3&#x000a0;mEq/L of acetate, or acetate free biofiltration (AFB), which is a bicarbonate and acetate free dialysate technique that is combined with sodium bicarbonate infusion into the venous blood leaving the dialyzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This study found acetate concentrations rise about 0.05&#x000a0;mmol/L by the midpoint of HDF, are similar post-HDF, and return to baseline after HDF. As expected, acetate concentrations were unchanged during and after AFB. With both HDF and AFB the bicarbonate concentrations were not remarkably different, but repleted to a slightly greater extent with AFB. The HDF results show consistent trends with our observations for venous blood values that only a small amount of dialysate acetate is delivered to the patient and does not alter blood bicarbonate concentrations or the bicarbonate administered.</p><p id="Par64">Conversely, a French study of HD patients treated with bicarbonate dialysate containing 4&#x000a0;mEq/L of acetate or bicarbonate dialysate buffered with hydrochloric acid reported large increases in blood acetate concentrations that contrast our findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. With use of an acetate acid buffered dialysate, 78% of patients had a 10 fold increase in blood acetate concentration from predialysis to postdialysis. Surprisingly, with use of a hydrochloric acid buffered dialysate, 12% of patients had &#x0003e;3 fold increase in blood acetate concentration from predialysis to postdialysis.</p><p id="Par65">In a historic study comparing an acetate dialysate versus an acetate acid buffered bicarbonate dialysate in the United States, it was found that blood bicarbonate concentrations decreased predialysis to postdialysis with use of acetate dialysate, while the bicarbonate concentrations rose about 6&#x000a0;mEq/L with use of acetate acid buffered bicarbonate dialysate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; this observation supports the concept that acetate delivered from the dialysate does not alter the concentration of delivered bicarbonate, which remained within the prescribed target range. The study reported that blood acetate concentrations rose by about 0.06&#x000a0;mmol/L by the end of HD with use of acetate acid buffered bicarbonate dialysates.</p><p id="Par66">Although our results found that acetate in acid dialysate buffers do not alter the prescribed bicarbonate concentrations received from HD, it is important to denote that there is a longstanding controversy of the optimal bicarbonate prescription for physicians to utilize. The results of a DOPPS analysis suggest all-cause mortality increases by 8&#x02013;9% for every 4&#x000a0;mmol/L increase in the prescribed concentration of dialysate bicarbonate in HD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This risk is thought to be linked to the development of metabolic alkalosis, which is supported by findings from a recent study of Japanese patients that found that a pH &#x0003e;7.4 is associated with increased risks of both all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality in dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A study conducted in France on 12 patients observed that with use of a bicarbonate prescription of 38&#x000a0;mmol/L, there was a pH of 7.43 at the start of HD and pH of 7.51 at the end of the HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which indicates there was some alkalosis associated with use of this level of bicarbonate prescription in this cohort. Despite that some reports suggest that higher bicarbonate prescriptions may lead to increased risks of negative outcomes, a recent series of literature reviews identified that after adjustment for the confounding factors of nutritional status that higher bicarbonate levels may not adversely affect patient outcomes, and that higher levels of pre-dialysis blood bicarbonate levels might indicate a need for nutritional assessments and interventions for optimizing protein intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Currently, the optimal bicarbonate prescription is not known and individualized patient management is prudent at this time.</p><p id="Par67">It is notable to mention that our study has several limitations that could have contributed to some of the findings. Primarily, these include no formal power calculation for determination of sample size, a small patient number, and short study duration. A formal sample size calculation was not performed due to there not being any been previous studies that have been performed with a validated acetate assay to provide the necessary reference value and variations for acetate blood levels to base an estimation upon. Despite a small patient number, the crossover design and high number of collection time points (84 data points per patient per treatment and 1680 data points to calculate the main study endpoints) made the statistics in this study strong and the data had low variability. Overall, this allowed for sound conclusions to be drawn based on both single and multiple time point comparisons. Although the duration of the trial was only 2 weeks, this intensive interrogation of the metabolic dynamics of levels of short lived analytes (acetate and bicarbonate) should not require a long term study.</p><p id="Par68">Another limitation of this study is that it was only single blinded, and not double blinded. However, with the laboratories and patients being blinded from dialysate assignment in this investigation that assessed changes in laboratory values, the parties that we thought could have potentially influenced the results were blinded. Also, we did not study acetate-free dialysate types and the metabolic differences remain uncharacterized.</p><p id="Par69">An additional limitation of the study was that the investigation was performed on a patient population that is not consistent with the average HD population in the United States. The patients in this study were majorly of African American race (81.8%) and were on average about 4&#x000a0;years younger and had a BMI that was 4&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> higher than the general dialysis population in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, the patient population resembles the dialysis patient population in the geographical area (USRDS geographical network 8) that the study was conducted. Dialysis patients in this area typically are 60.6% of African American race and have a mean age of 55.1&#x000a0;year old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Further, a lower percent of patients in this study were diabetic (40%) compared to overall rate of 63% in the population of patients at Fresenius Medical Care North America. Although there are some differences in the study population versus the general dialysis population, the overall intent was not to match the general population for generalizability, but to have internal validity in determining the changes in peridialytic acetate and bicarbonate levels in humans using two acid dialysate types containing different acetate concentrations to buffer the bicarbonate dialysate during treatment.</p><p id="Par70">An additional limitation is that we did not capture information or adjust for the patients&#x02019; lean body mass, and since animal studies have indicated that acetate may be metabolized in the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We did measure BMI, however, it was decided to not adjust our analysis since this body composition measure is considered to be inaccurate in patients with ESRD that are known to have volume overload and muscle wasting affecting the metric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. With time changes in fat and/or muscle mass may alter acetate metabolism, however, with a cross over study design, every patient was her/his own control, so the lean body mass of the patient was expected to remain relatively constant for the 2 week duration of the trial. There is a need for further long-term trials that investigate acetate metabolism adjusting for body composition using methods bioelectrical impedance vector analysis to quantify lean muscle mass.</p><p id="Par71">Furthermore, we&#x02019;d like to note that this study was conducted using traditional diffusion based hemodialysis treatments using high-flux dialyzers. As such, we cannot generalize these findings to convective hemodiafiltration therapy. Several studies suggest that acetate-free dialysis may be preferred in hemodiafiltration treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and in vitro studies in endothelial cell cultures suggest that acetate-free bicarbonate solutions may be more favorable with respect to the cell-to-cell influences on acid-base physiology in one tissue type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">Despite the limitations, this study does have the strengths of being a randomized trial of stable HD patients that did not have any common clinical abnormalities that could alter acetate and/or bicarbonate metabolism and dietary intake was controlled proximal to study treatments. Additionally, this study provides a comprehensive profile of the dynamics of peridialytic concentrations of acetate and bicarbonate in both the arterialized and venous blood and dialysate of HD patients, which has not been investigated previously, and current reports do not define if arterialized or venous blood was used for analyses. Additional studies to further establish physiologic dynamics and determine the normal values of acetate are needed, and after this, the characterization of the transmembrane kinetics of acetate across the dialyzer membrane using mass transfer calculations will be of importance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par73">In conclusion, the results of this clinical trial indicate that acetate concentrations in NaturaLyte&#x000ae; and GranuFlo&#x000ae; acid buffer concentrates do not cause excursions in blood bicarbonate concentrations that were above the prescribed level in patients during HD or in the postdialysis period. These findings suggest that acetate delivered to the patient from the dialysate is rapidly metabolized by the body, but has a minor impact on blood bicarbonate levels during or after HD. There is incomplete diffusion of both bicarbonate and acetate delivered from the dialysate to the blood. The concept of a &#x0201c;total buffer&#x0201d;, which suggests acetate is directly metabolized in a 1:1 ratio into additional bicarbonate yielding significantly higher blood bicarbonate concentrations, did not appear to exist. As compared to the NaturaLyte&#x000ae; acid buffer, use of GranuFlo&#x000ae; is associated with a slightly faster reduction in the arterialized blood to inflow dialysate concentration gradient of bicarbonate during the course of a HD treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
