However, randomized controlled trials are needed to scientifically determine the effectiveness of strength training on the muscle cell level. Furthermore, close examination of the feasibility of a high-load strength training program is warranted. The Physical Exercise and Prostate Cancer (PEPC) trial is designed to determine the effectiveness of strength training on clinical and muscle cellular outcomes in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients after high-dose radiotherapy and during ongoing androgen deprivation therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for 9-36 months combined with external high-dose radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer are randomized to an exercise intervention group that receives a 16 week high-load strength training program or a control group that is encouraged to maintain their habitual activity level. In both arms, androgen deprivation therapy is continued until the end of the intervention period.</p><p>Clinical outcomes are body composition (lean body mass, bone mineral density and fat mass) measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry, serological outcomes, physical functioning (muscle strength and cardio-respiratory fitness) assessed with physical tests and psycho-social functioning (mental health, fatigue and health-related quality of life) assessed by questionnaires. Muscle cellular outcomes are a) muscle fiber size b) regulators of muscle fiber size (number of myonuclei per muscle fiber, number of satellite cells per muscle fiber, number of satellite cells and myonuclei positive for androgen receptors and proteins involved in muscle protein degradation and muscle hypertrophy) and c) regulators of muscle fiber function such as proteins involved in cellular stress and mitochondrial function.

The risk of PC increases with age, and the median age of onset is approximately 70 years. Treatment depends on stage, histology and the serum PSA level, beside the patients' general health and age. Radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is used in patients with locally advanced tumors and/or those with high Gleason scores, characterized as intermediate or high-risk profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. ADT has potentially negative effects on several clinical outcomes, such as muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Physical exercise during and after cancer treatment has been shown to be effective to reduce several negative clinical consequences followed by cancer and cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Compared to breast cancer patients relatively few studies in PC patients have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. More evidence on the efficacy of strength training on clinical outcomes in PC patients is therefore desirable. At the same time more attention should be paid to the effect of ADT on the muscle cell level because the reduced testosterone levels influence the underlying regulators of muscle mass and muscle function. Furthermore, the effects of strength training on the same regulators are of particular interest during ADT, and as far as we know they have not previously been explored in PC patients.</p><p>Ageing is associated with a reduction in muscle mass, typically by 1-2% per decade from the age of 30 to the age of 50. Thereafter the rate of muscle loss increases progressively to 10% per decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is well known that decreased levels of serum testosterone are followed by reduced muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In PC patients treated with ADT for 6-12 months, lean body mass (LBM) has been reported to decrease by 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This reduction may affect muscle strength markedly because muscle mass is the dominant tissue in LBM.</p><p>Loss of bone mineral density (BMD) has been observed in PC patients on ADT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has also been shown that ADT increases body weight and fat mass in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Decreased levels of testosterone and body changes during ADT, may also influence mental health, fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in PC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Total skeletal muscle mass reflects the size of all individual muscle groups in the body. Furthermore, the size of each muscle group is primarily determined by the size of the individual muscle fibers<sup>1</sup>, and to a lesser extent by the number of fibers. Regulation of muscle fiber size is first and foremost driven by an increase in the number and size of myofibrils (contractile proteins) within the muscle fiber (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This process is normally supported by an increased number of satellite cells and (often) increased number of myonuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Importantly, satellite cells seem to play a significant role in regulation of muscle fiber size. Satellite cells are mononuclear progenitor cells that are found between the sarcolemma and the basement membrane in the muscle fibers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Satellite cells are normally in a quiescent state, but are activated by adequate stimuli (e.g. strength training). Upon activation the satellite cells donate their nuclei to the existing muscle fibers and thus facilitate skeletal muscle hypertrophy by increasing the protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. During regeneration after muscle injury, satellite cells may also fuse and thereby form new mature muscle fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, satellite cells seem to support muscle hypertrophy by production of local growth factors (e.g. IGF-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A schematic drawing of a muscle fiber (muscle cell) in longitudinal- and cross sectional plane</bold>.

Consequently, graded dosage of testosterone has been shown to both increase the muscle fiber size, reflected by increased muscle fiber cross sectional area, and number of satellite cells in a dose dependent pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Suppression of testosterone reduces the positive stimuli on muscle protein synthesis, and patients treated with ADT experience reduced LBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Low levels of testosterone might also influence the regulation of muscle mass through its inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Consequently, ADT might facilitate muscle atrophy both by inhibiting important pathways involved in muscle hypertrophy, as well as stimulating pathways involved in protein degradation.</p><p>Muscle strength is mainly determined by the size of muscles, but other qualities of muscles, such as endurance and stress tolerance, are more related to the content and function of stress proteins and proteins involved in the mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, castration has been shown not only to reduce muscle fiber size, but also to affect the mitochondrial structure negatively in rat muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, castration seems to reduce the stress induced up-regulation of stress proteins in heart muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Whether castration also affects the stress protein response and mitochondrial function in human skeletal muscles is currently not known.</p><sec><title>Effects of strength training</title><p>Strength training has the potential to increase muscle mass and BMD in both young and elderly males and females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Although the response to strength training differs among individuals, most studies report an increase in muscle fibre cross sectional area by 10-60% over 9-30 weeks of training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, an increase in BMD from 1 to 4% has been observed over 16-52 weeks of strength training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Effectiveness of exercise on clinical outcomes has been reported in numerous studies in cancer patients. Research has so far shown promising effects on among others muscle strength, aerobic fitness, fatigue, anxiety and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the effect of exercise during ADT in PC patients has been less studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These studies have shown positive results in muscular and aerobic endurance, fatigue and QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Less promising is the effect of physical exercise on body-composition endpoints. It could therefore be hypothesized that ADT compromises some important cellular signals regulating the exercise induced increase in lean body mass with strength training.</p><p>The increase in muscle fiber size in response to strength training seems to be dependent, at least to some extent, on satellite cell activation in order to incorporate new myonuclei in the growing muscle fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In healthy subjects, strength training increases the number of myonuclei and the number of satellite cells in both young and elderly individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The mechanisms behind the activation of satellite cells during strength training in humans are not fully understood, but changes in local growth factors and testosterone interactions seem to be important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Whereas reduced levels of testosterone during ADT negatively affect the regulation of muscle mass, strength training might counteract these detrimental effects on muscle fibres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). On the other hand, it might be that the very low testosterone levels, comparable with castration, blunt the effects of strength training in these patients. Interestingly, healthy young men treated with a GnRH analog over 12 weeks showed the same increase in mRNA of important local growth factors in response to strength training as placebo treated controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, the accumulation of muscle mass during the strength training intervention was reduced in the testosterone-suppressed group compared to the placebo treated controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic muscular adaptations to strength training in healthy men and PC patients on ADT</bold>.

In A), the muscle fiber cross sectional area is increased as a result of an increase in the number and size of myofibrils within the muscle fiber, and this increase in size is supported by an increased number of satellite cells and (often) increased number of myonuclei. In B), ADT results in decreased muscle fiber cross sectional area and reduced muscle function. In C), muscle fiber cross sectional area and muscle function is normalized in ADT treated PC patients on strength training.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-12-123-2"/></fig><p>The effects of strength training on mitochondrial function and protection against cellular stress in muscle fibers are less studied than the effect on muscle size. Nevertheless, in previously untrained healthy men strength training has been observed to positively affect both mitochondrial proteins and stress proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Consequently, strength training has the potential to counteract several negative effects of ADT on muscle size and function.</p><p>To our knowledge no previous studies have investigated the effect of strength training on the regulation of muscle size and of muscular function on a cellular level in PC patients during ADT. Furthermore, previous clinical data need to be confirmed. Here, we present the design and methods of an ongoing trial called the Physical Exercise and Prostate Cancer (PEPC) trial, which aims to explore the effects of strength training on clinical outcomes as well as explore mechanisms of the effect on muscle cellular outcomes in patients with PC during ongoing (neo)-adjuvant ADT.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The overall aims of the PEPC trial are to evaluate the effectiveness of a high-load 16 week strength training program on a) clinical outcomes including serological parameters such as lipid profile (low and high density lipoprotein cholesterol) and low grade inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP)) b) muscle cellular outcomes as muscle fiber size, regulators of muscle fiber size and regulators of muscle fiber function and c) feasibility of a high-load strength training program in PC patients who at intervention start have discontinued their high-dose radiotherapy and are on ongoing (neo)-adjuvant ADT throughout the intervention period.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a randomized clinical trial with two arms comparing an exercise intervention group (EG) that receives a 16 week high-load strength training program with a control group (CG) that is encouraged to maintain their habitual activity level and not start strength training.

Sample size calculation is based on comparing the clinically relevant difference in change before and after the 16 weeks period in LBM between the EG and CG. To detect a 3 kilograms difference in change between the groups, and assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 3 kilograms, 22 patients are needed in each group with a significance level (two sided) of 5% and a power of 90%. Due to dropouts we plan to include 30 patients in each group. According to previous studies, this number should also be sufficient to detect differences in the cellular muscle outcomes (Sinha-Hikim et al., 2006).</p><p>Changes in outcome variables from start of intervention will be compared between the EG and CG groups by analysis of covariance using the baseline measurement as a covariate. P-values below 5% will be regarded as statistically significant. If obvious deviations from normal distributions are detected, changes in outcome will be compared between groups by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The primary analysis population will be the intention to treat population using last observation carried forward to impute any missing values. In addition a per-protocol analysis including only patients with no missing observations of the variable of interest will be performed. Should imbalances in important variables be detected sensitivity analyses will also be added including these as covariates in the model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous research has examined the effect of physical exercise on clinical outcomes such as body composition, physical function, mental health, fatigue and quality of life in PC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Still research on the effect of physical exercise in this patients group is less extensive than in other cancer groups, such as for example patients with breast cancer. Two of the most pronounced clinical side effects of ADT are the negative effect on muscle mass and muscle strength. However, studies investigating the effects of ADT and exercise at the muscle cell level are still lacking. Expanded knowledge in this field among PC patients is therefore required.</p><p>The clinically indicated ADT in PC patients enables the study of testosterone's role in regulation of muscle mass during strength training. The main question is whether normal adaptations to strength training are disturbed when the level of testosterone is below 1 nmol/L (castration level); e.g. is the activation of satellite cells and hypertrophic effect of strength training blunted in these patients? Furthermore, by investigating important factors for the regulation of muscle mass and muscle function, the cellular effects of ADT on muscle tissue will be elucidated. Currently, three other ongoing trials are investigating the effect of exercise on muscular outcomes assessed by muscle biopsies in patients with breast, lung and testicular cancer receiving chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However, the effects of high-load strength training on muscular adaptations in PC patients during ADT have not previously been investigated.</p><p>Compared to previous studies in PC patients the intensity and/or duration in our strength training protocol is somewhat increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The rationale for choosing a strenuous strength training protocol is the fact that the effect on total muscle mass has been moderate or absent in previous studies on PC patients. One possible explanation for negligible effects on muscle mass in previous studies may be that the stimuli for muscle hypertrophy have been too low. In healthy men, it is suggested that a training intensity of 75-80% of 1 RM (6-12 RM sets) combined with multiple sets in each exercise (starting from 1-2 and progressing to 3-6 sets per exercise), give optimal stimuli for muscle hypertrophy when performed 2-3 times per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Consequently, in order to maximize the stimuli for muscle hypertrophy we chose to implement this strength training protocol in our patients. Importantly the training protocol should still be tolerable and safe.</p><p>Positive findings from the PEPC trial will help in the construction of more effective training protocols to counteract the negative effects of ADT on muscle tissue, BMD and physical function. More importantly, the results on the cellular effects of ADT in muscle tissue will provide novel understandings of muscle mass regulation by testosterone. Such knowledge will improve our understanding on how aging in general and reduced testosterone production during ADT specifically, induces loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia). In turn this knowledge can be used to establish more effective strategies against sarcopenia in both healthy elderly and in patient populations at risk. New strategies could include both new medical treatments and training strategies focused to overcome the cellular changes inducing sarcopenia.</p><sec><title>Summary</title><p>Knowledge of the effect of exercise on clinical outcomes such as physical functioning and quality of life outcomes has increased over the last decades. Studies testing aerobic exercise in breast cancer patients are most frequent. Studies in other cancer groups testing the effects of strength training program are still lacking. The PEPC trial focuses on the effect on a high-load strength training program on both clinical and muscle cellular outcomes in PC patients during ADT. As far as we know this is the first study having a muscular cellular outcome in these patients. By testing a high-load strength training program the study will provide new knowledge on optimal training programs in PC patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
