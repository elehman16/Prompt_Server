Vilazodone, currently approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults, has also been evaluated in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Post-hoc analyses of vilazodone trials were carried out to examine its effects on suicidal ideation and behavior in adults with MDD or GAD. Data were pooled from vilazodone trials in MDD (four studies) and GAD (three studies). The incidence of suicide-related events was analyzed on the basis of treatment-emergent adverse event reporting and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) monitoring. Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was analyzed on the basis of a C-SSRS category shift from no suicidal ideation/behavior (C-SSRS=0) at baseline to suicide ideation (C-SSRS=1&#x02013;5) during treatment. In pooled safety populations (MDD, <italic>n</italic>=2233; GAD, <italic>n</italic>=1475), suicide-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in less than 1% of vilazodone-treated and placebo-treated patients.

In a meta-analysis carried out by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that was based on a reclassification of adverse events from antidepressant clinical trials, it was concluded that these medications were associated with a modest increase in the risk for suicidality in pediatric patients (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Hammad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). These results contributed to the FDA&#x02019;s current requirement that all approved antidepressants carry a black-box warning of an increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults.</p><p>The FDA also requires clinical trials of new psychotropic drugs to include a prospective assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior using instruments such as the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Posner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These instruments are generally more sensitive than reports of suicide-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Although such TEAE data are useful, patient reporting of TEAEs is not as comprehensive or as consistent as C-SSRS monitoring (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Gassmann-Mayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The C-SSRS is an 11-category rating system that incorporates both individual patient responses and external sources (e.g. family, friends, health records) into the evaluation of a patient&#x02019;s suicide risk, thereby making it easier to identify potential concerns and distinguish between suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2012</xref>).</p><p>These regulatory measures draw attention to a serious safety issue that warrants ongoing scrutiny, but there are some limitations and unintended consequences that should also be considered (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Ho, 2012</xref>). First, several meta-analyses of clinical trial data have found no overall association between FDA-approved antidepressants and the emergence of suicidal ideation or behavior in adults, although some increase in risk has been observed in younger adults (&#x02264;24 years) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Stone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In&#x000a0;addition, an analysis of healthcare claims data found no significant increase in suicides or suicide attempts after initiation of antidepressant treatment; rather, the highest risk of suicide attempt occurred in the month before treatment initiation (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Simon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This finding, along with results from other claim-based analyses (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), points to the challenge of balancing the beneficial effects of antidepressants on suicidal thoughts and behaviors against the potential negative effects of these drugs. Finally, the FDA black-box warning may have contributed to an overall decline in the diagnosis and treatment of MDD (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Libby <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and an increasing trend in adolescent suicides (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bridge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Ongoing efforts are needed to provide clinicians with information on the effects of antidepressants and other psychoactive drugs on suicidal ideation and behavior. Although clinical trial reports usually provide suicide-related results, such information may be limited as suicidal events are uncommon, particularly when trials specifically exclude patients with a current risk of suicide. Analysis of pooled data from multiple studies may provide a more robust approach for understanding the risk of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behavior. Therefore, a post-hoc analysis was carried out using suicide-related data from the clinical trials of vilazodone, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDD in adults.</p><p>In addition to MDD trials (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Rickels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Croft <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Mathews <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), vilazodone has been investigated in adults with GAD (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Gommoll <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Durgam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).

The incidence of suicide-related TEAEs was analyzed descriptively in the pooled safety populations (MDD, GAD) and in the long-term MDD population. MedDRA terms for suicide-related TEAEs included completed suicide, depression suicidal, intentional overdose (or overdose), intentional self-injury, multiple-drug overdose intentional, poisoning deliberate, self-injurious behavior, self-injurious ideation, suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt.</p><p>Suicidal ideation on the basis of C-SSRS data was defined as a &#x02018;yes&#x02019; response to any one of the five suicidal ideation questions (categories 1&#x02013;5 of the C-SSRS); suicidal behavior was defined as a &#x02018;yes&#x02019; response to any one of the five suicidal behavior questions (categories 6&#x02013;10 of the C-SSRS).

Such results were not unexpected, given the lifetime histories of suicidal ideation and behavior in these studies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and the higher 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation seen with MDD (39% to 42%) compared with GAD (12%) in the USA general population (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Kessler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>C-SSRS suicidal ideation occurred less frequently with active treatment than with placebo both in the pooled MDD population (vilazodone, 19.9%; placebo, 24.7%) and in the pooled GAD population (vilazodone, 7.7%; placebo, 9.4%). The incidence of C-SSRS suicidal behavior was also lower with vilazodone relative to placebo in the pooled MDD population (vilazodone, 2.1%; placebo, 3.7%). In the pooled GAD population, the incidence of suicidal behavior was similarly low in both treatment groups (vilazodone, 1.2%; placebo, 1.3%). Along with the C-SSRS shift analyses, which showed higher rates of improvement with vilazodone relative to placebo in GAD and MDD patients with suicidal ideation at baseline (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>), these lower incidences of C-SSRS suicidal ideation and behavior with vilazodone relative to placebo are consistent with other studies that have shown approved antidepressants to have protective effects on suicidality in adults (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Barbui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the high rate of improvement observed with vilazodone in the C-SSRS shift analysis of GAD studies (44.7%) was based on relatively small numbers of patients (vilazodone, <italic>n</italic>=38; placebo, <italic>n</italic>=24) and this outcome should be interpreted with some caution.</p><p>As some increased risk of suicidality among younger adults has been found in other antidepressant trials (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Stone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), post-hoc analyses of overall suicidality and suicidal behavior were carried out using data from younger adults (18&#x02013;24 years) who participated in the vilazodone studies. These patients represented &#x0223c;10 and 15% of the pooled MDD and GAD populations, respectively. In the MDD studies, younger patients had lower odds with vilazodone relative to placebo for both overall suicidality (OR=0.59) and suicidal behavior (OR=0.43). In the GAD studies, however, the odds among younger patients were slightly higher with vilazodone versus placebo for overall suicidality (OR=1.14) and suicidal behavior (OR=1.13). For all of these outcomes, however, the 95% CI had a lower limit less than 1 and a higher limit greater than 1, indicating no significant difference between vilazodone and placebo in younger adults.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The primary limitation of this post-hoc analysis is that the studies excluded patients who fulfilled any of the criteria for suicide risk. In addition, patients with comorbid depression and anxiety were not allowed in any of the studies, which may have had an effect on the current post-hoc analyses. As shown previously in studies with MDD (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Trivedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and GAD (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bomyea <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), patients who have both disorders are at an increased risk for suicidality. Given the exclusion criteria of the individual studies, the results of this post-hoc analysis may not be generalizable to a broader adult patient population. Another potential limitation is that in addition to the analyses carried out in younger patients, no adjustments were made for sociodemographic and clinical factors that have been associated with suicidal ideation, such as lower education level, sex (male), unemployment, previous suicide attempt, greater depression symptom severity, and number of depressive episodes (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Trivedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). More studies are needed to explore the effects of these factors on suicide-related outcomes in patients treated with antidepressants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Little or no evidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or behavior was found in patients with MDD or GAD who received vilazodone in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Among patients who entered these studies with no recent suicidal ideation or behavior at baseline, more than 85% continued to have no suicidality during treatment. During the double-blind treatment, the incidences of suicide-related events, whether assessed on the basis of patient-reported adverse events or regular C-SSRS monitoring, were similar or lower with vilazodone than with placebo. In a 52-week, open-label study of vilazodone in MDD patients, the incidence of suicidal ideation decreased over time, with serious suicidal ideation (C-SSRS=4 or 5) occurring in 0 to less than 1% of patients at all study visits. The potential risk for treatment-emergent suicidality was low with vilazodone, irrespective of age or psychiatric diagnosis. However, as is the case with all antidepressants, continued monitoring of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is recommended in all patients who receive this treatment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Writing and editorial support was provided by Mildred Bahn at Prescott Medical Communications Group (Chicago, Illinois, USA), a contractor of Allergan (Jersey City, New Jersey, USA).</p><p>This study was funded by Forest Research Institute Inc., an Allergan affiliate, Jersey City, New Jersey, USA.</p><sec><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>M.E.
