There are significant data to suggest deficits in phonological working memory may be one of the factors that contribute to the difficulties persons who stutter have establishing and/or maintaining fluent speech, particularly when presented with cognitively demanding tasks (for review, see [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; cf., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Reduced speed and accuracy in aspects of phonological working memory, including phonological encoding and sub-vocal rehearsal, have been observed in children and adults who stutter in vocal (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) and nonvocal tasks (e.g., [13, [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Additionally, neuroimaging results using diffusion tensor tractography and magnetoencephalography lend further support to the assumption that the phonological processing of persons who stutter differs from fluent controls (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]).</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Phonological working memory</title><p>Theoretically, Baddeley&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] model creates a framework for understanding the contributions of phonological working memory to fluent speech production. Baddeley&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] model of working memory is comprised of the central executive and three supporting systems: (1) phonological loop, (2) visuospatial sketchpad, and (3) episodic buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151107.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The central executive is thought to support the retrieval and transfer of information from long-term memory to short-term memory and vice versa. The phonological loop is comprised of the following two critical components: a phonological store and a sub-vocal rehearsal system. The phonological store facilitates the ability to hold material to be remembered in a phonological code. This phonological code is vulnerable to decay over time (i.e., trace will last approximately 2 seconds), hence the need for the sub-vocal rehearsal system. The sub-vocal rehearsal system is a silent verbal repetition process that refreshes the phonologically encoded material, allowing it to be preserved in memory for a longer period of time (&#x0003e;2 seconds). The second system, the visuospatial sketchpad, stores and manipulates visual and spatial information for retention. The third and final component of Baddeley&#x02019;s model, the episodic buffer, passively binds information from various distinct sources (i.e., phonological, visual, spatial) into chunks or episodes for transference to the central executive [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0151107.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0151107.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Adapted version of Baddeley&#x02019;s theoretical model of working memory [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0151107.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Nonword repetition, phoneme elision, and nonword reading tasks</title><p>A variety of experimental paradigms have been completed with persons who stutter to enhance our understanding of the contribution of various subsystems of phonological working memory to stuttered speech. Nonword repetition tasks have been used to explore phonological working memory in adults who stutter (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Nonword repetition tasks tap into phonological working memory by requiring phonological encoding and, potentially, sub-vocal rehearsal of a novel phonological string prior to repetition without the influence of semantic information. Results from several nonword repetition studies have demonstrated that adults who stutter are less accurate repeating nonwords than their fluent peers (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Phoneme elision tasks using nonword stimuli have also recently been implemented to investigate the abilities of persons who stutter to phonologically encode, sub-vocally rehearse, and manipulate novel phonological strings prior to producing a novel word.</p><p>Ludlow et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] completed one of the first investigations of nonword repetition with adults who stutter. Ten adults who do and do not stutter repeated two, 4-syllable nonwords multiple times. Adults who stutter demonstrated significantly decreased accuracy compared to fluent controls, even when provided with the opportunity to repeat the nonwords. The authors interpreted these findings to indicate that adults who stutter present with phonological encoding deficits as compared to adults who do not stutter. Additional research has also supported the finding of differences in phonological processing specific to adults who stutter.</p><p>Byrd et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] employed a nonword repetition task as well as a phoneme elision task. Fourteen adults who stutter and 14 adults who do not stutter listened to 48 nonwords, were provided multiple attempts at production, and then were required to repeat the target nonword with a sound missing. There was no difference in performance accuracy on the phoneme elision task between adults who stutter and fluent controls; this task was equally challenging for both talker groups. However, for the nonword repetition task, results showed repetition accuracy was comparable for adults who do and do not stutter for their repetitions of 2&#x02013;4 syllable words, but the adults who stutter required a greater mean number of attempts before accurate repetition of 7-syllable words. The authors attributed the significant findings for the nonword repetition task to suggest that there is a deficit in the sub-vocal rehearsal system of adults who stutter, which is highlighted when the required productions are at lengths that are more challenging to recall.</p><p>Additionally, Sasisekaran [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] tested behavioral and kinematic responses of 18 adults who do and do not stutter during nonword repetition and nonword reading tasks. Talker groups did not differ in their nonword repetition accuracy, but adults who stutter demonstrated a higher percentage of errors in nonword reading than fluent controls. However, the stimuli used in their nonword repetition task were one to four syllables in length while the stimuli for their nonword reading task were either six or 11-syllables long. Thus, it is possible that the nonwords used for the repetition task were not sufficiently complex to tax the phonological working memory of the adults who stutter in a manner that would yield the talker group differences previously observed by Byrd et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>More recently, Sasisekaran and Weisberg [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] explored the nonword repetition accuracy of 10 adults who stutter when auditorily presented with nonword stimuli that varied by complexity and phonotactic constraint. Adults who stutter demonstrated decreased accuracy repeating complex nonwords compared to their fluent peers. Additionally, adults who stutter exhibited significant practice effects as measured by reduced movement variability for 3-syllable stimuli, but motoric variability persisted for the longer 4-syllable words. The authors attributed talker group differences in nonword repetition accuracy to deficits in phonemic encoding and/or speech motor processes for adults who stutter.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Vocal versus nonvocal tasks</title><p>Sasisekaran, DeNil, Smyth, and Johnson [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] explored nonvocal phonological encoding of adults who stutter using a phoneme monitoring task. Ten adults who stutter and 12 adults who do not stutter completed phoneme monitoring tasks during a silent naming condition and a perception condition. During the silent naming condition, participants pressed a button to indicate whether or not a target sound was present when they silently named a picture. In the perception condition, participants silently indicated whether or not a target sound was heard during auditorily presented items. Results revealed adults who stutter were significantly slower in phoneme monitoring during the silent naming task. The authors suggested that these results support the notion that adults who stutter exhibit phonological encoding deficits during silent encoding and segmenting of phonological units as compared to fluent controls.</p><p>In an attempt to extend past findings beyond the restriction to vocal performance, Byrd, McGill, and Usler [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] explored the vocal and nonvocal nonword repetition and phoneme elision abilities of adults who stutter compared to adults who do not stutter. Nonvocal conditions were added in this study in order to avoid possible confounds related to errors of motor execution. In the vocal nonword repetition task, participants listened to and repeated two sets of 4- and 7-syllable nonwords (<italic>n</italic> = 12 per set; 24 total). For the nonvocal nonword repetition task, participants listened to the same set of 24 nonwords and silently identified each target nonword from a subsequent set of three nonwords. In the vocal phoneme elision task, participants repeated the 24 nonwords with a designated phoneme eliminated. Similar to the nonvocal nonword repetition task, in the nonvocal phoneme elision task, participants listened to phoneme elision instructions and silently identified which subsequently presented nonword accurately fulfilled the condition. Adults who stutter produced significantly fewer accurate initial vocal productions of 7-syllable nonwords compared to adults who do not stutter. There were no participant group differences for the silent identification of nonwords, but both groups required significantly more attempts to accurately silently identify 7-syllable nonwords as compared to 4-syllable nonwords. For the vocal phoneme elision condition, adults who stutter were significantly less accurate than adults who do not stutter in their initial production and required significantly more attempts to accurately produce 7-syllable nonwords with a designated phoneme eliminated. This group difference was also significant for the nonvocal phoneme elision condition for both 4- and 7-syllable nonwords. The authors suggested performance differences on these vocal and nonvocal tasks further support the notion that phonological working memory may contribute to the difficulty adults who stutter have establishing and/or maintaining fluent speech.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Paradigm Selection</title><p>Taken together, results from multiple experimental investigations support the idea that phonological working memory, particularly the subsystems that Baddeley [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] describes as phonological encoding and/or sub-vocal rehearsal, may be uniquely compromised in persons who stutter. To further extend previous investigations of phonological working memory in adults who stutter that have been restricted to auditory input, the current investigation utilizes visual stimuli in a word jumble paradigm. This methodological distinction includes the additional task demands of (1) visual decoding of letter strings, (2) grapheme-to-sound conversions, and (3) lexical search/retrieval operations.</p><p>Baddeley [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] describes a model of the phonological loop that accounts for both visual and auditory input eventually arriving at the phonological output buffer, which may either lead to sub-vocal rehearsal or spoken output. Baddeley [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] posits that visually presented material is decoded at the level of visual analysis then transferred from an orthographic to a phonological code to be temporarily stored within the phonological output buffer (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151107.g002">Fig 2</xref>). While the phonological code is held within the phonological output buffer, the central executive facilitates a rapid retrieval process from the lexicon. In the current experimental paradigm, participants were asked to reorder the orthographic-phonological code through a nonvocal manipulation process. This silent manipulation assists in the trial and error reordering of the visual and phonological information multiple times prior to finally supplying a complete, lexically appropriate solution to the phonological output buffer which will then be executed through spoken word production. Thus, successful performance on this meta-linguistic task requires neural facility with several phonologically based lexical skill sets, including phonotactic sensitivities, visualization of re-ordered lexical strings, and matching those manipulations with lexical reality.</p><fig id="pone.0151107.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0151107.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Adapted version of Baddeley&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] proposed structure of the phonological loop with visual and/or auditory input.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0151107.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Purpose and Related Predictions</title><p>The purpose of the present study is to analyze the ability of adults who stutter to use phonological working memory in conjunction with lexical access as measured by performance on a word jumble task. In contrast to previous investigations of phonological working memory that have utilized auditory input only (e.g., nonword repetition, phoneme elision), the current paradigm presents visual stimuli that must then be translated into a phonological code to be reordered. Specifically, the word jumble paradigm requires participants to (1) initially encode a visually presented, randomly ordered orthographic string, and subsequently, (2) mentally manipulate, in trial and error fashion, various phonologically possible arrangements, that (3) trigger the emergence and recognition of a real word. We predict that adults who stutter will demonstrate increased response times and decreased accuracy in rearranging jumbled stimuli to arrive at real words compared to adults who do not stutter.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Participants</title><p>The current study and consent form documentation was approved by the University of Texas at Austin&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board (IRB approval number 2014-03-0068) and written, informed consent was obtained for each participant.

receptive language, phonological processing, and stuttering severity were complete immediately preceding the administration of experimental tasks. Experimental tasks were completed in a quiet room over one session lasting approximately 30 minutes. Participants viewed stimuli on a 35&#x0201d; Dell computer monitor. The distance between the participant, seated on a chair, and the computer screen was approximately 18 inches. Stimuli were presented using 40 point, Arial, black font on a white background using Microsoft PowerPoint. Scrambled words were presented one at a time on the computer display. Participants were asked to silently manipulate the scrambled letters to form an English word. Participants were given one opportunity to verbally produce each unscrambled stimulus real word. After the participant successfully unscrambled the letter string to arrive at a word, or failed to produce a response, he or she manually advanced to the next scrambled stimulus by left-clicking the mouse. There was no time limit, but participants were encouraged to respond as quickly as possible to each stimulus.</p><p>Participants were read the following directions prior to beginning the task: &#x0201c;You will see a string of jumbled letters appear on the screen. Mentally manipulate or switch around the letters so that they form a real word. Verbally state your answer as soon as you have unscrambled the word. Each word jumble only has one correct answer. Please do not mouth, whisper or &#x0201c;think out loud.&#x0201d; You only have one opportunity to state your answer. After you have said the word, advance to the next slide by clicking the mouse. Do you have any questions?&#x0201d; One practice item preceded the experimental tasks. Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions after the practice item. No participants were observed moving their mouths, whispering, or thinking aloud during the experimental tasks.</p><p>For all participants, the stimuli were presented according to increasing complexity. Thus, participants were first presented with the 3-letter words, then the 4-letter words, followed by the 5-letter words, and finally ending with the most challenging, 6-letter words. The order of words within the letter-length classes was counterbalanced across participants in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Coding</title><p>Participant responses were recorded by hand using a paper score sheet and digitally using a Shure SM58 microphone placed approximately six inches from the speaker&#x02019;s mouth. Responses were also documented using a Sanyo VPC-HD1010 digital video recorder, an Olympus WS-321M digital voice recorder, and the record presentation function on Microsoft PowerPoint. Multiple recording methods were used to ensure that participants&#x02019; responses were recorded in the case of technical difficulty. Each response was coded for accuracy and speech reaction time (SRT). Participants&#x02019; attempts to unscramble the word were scored as either being 1) correct, 2) an error (e.g., stating &#x0201c;atom&#x0201d; given the jumbled stimulus &#x0201c;attoom&#x0201d;), or 3) no response (e.g., &#x0201c;I can&#x02019;t figure it out.&#x0201d; or advancing to the next stimulus without attempting to answer). Stuttered productions and responses beginning with non-specific vocalizations (e.g., &#x0201c;uhm&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;er&#x0201d;) were excluded from further analysis. These exclusions occurred three times for adults who do not stutter and four times for adults who stutter. All responses for each participant were reviewed offline by the initial scorer and also by a trained research assistant to ensure accuracy in transcription and no discrepancies were found.</p><p>Participants&#x02019; SRTs, in milliseconds, were calculated by analyzing participants&#x02019; verbal responses using Praat software. The record function on Microsoft PowerPoint simultaneously created a new audio recording when each word jumble stimulus appeared on the screen. Audio files were exported from Microsoft PowerPoint and analyzed using Praat software. Thus, SRT was calculated from the beginning of the recording, which coincided exactly with the appearance of the visual stimulus, to the onset of the participant&#x02019;s vocal response for each word jumble stimulus. The first author and a trained research assistant independently, visually inspected each of the waveforms and spectrograms of the participants&#x02019; responses to determine SRT for each word jumble stimulus. Inter-rater reliability was 90% and intra-rater reliability was 100%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec021"><title>Results</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23.

To confirm the assumptions of ANCOVA, no significant interactions between the covariates (i.e., CTOPP BW, CTOPP NWR) and Word Length or Talker Group variables were found; furthermore, variance inflation factor (VIF) for all variables was below 2.5, indicating no multicollinearity.

A word jumble task was chosen because the metalinguistic operations underlying successful performance requires an ability to translate sequences of graphemes into their phonemic equivalents, in reiterative fashion, in search of, and eventual access to, a lexical word. Results revealed that adults who stutter were significantly, and progressively, less accurate than adults who do not stutter at solving word jumbles at the 4-letter, 5-letter, and 6-letter lengths, and moreover, demonstrated significantly longer SRT at the longest word length. Thus, rather than seeing a uniform deficiency in phonological processing, processing deficits emerged when the level of cognitive load was increased. This section will focus on potential areas of processing deficiencies in phonological working memory for adults who stutter during their performance on this demanding word jumble task.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Grapheme to phoneme conversions and phonological encoding: Effect of cognitive load on working memory</title><p>Previous research has speculated that phonological encoding differences in persons who stutter may contribute to their difficulty establishing and maintaining fluent speech production, particularly when cognitive load is taxed (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). An example of a cognitive load effect can be seen in a rhyming study conducted by Weber-Fox and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. They compared rhyming performance between adults who do and do not stutter when only visual orthographic input was provided. Participants manually selected a &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; button to indicate whether or not the two visually presented words rhymed. Out of the four conditions, the condition considered to be the most phonologically challenging was the only one to reveal talker group differences. In this condition, participants were presented with two words that were orthographically similar but did not rhyme (e.g., &#x0201c;cost&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;most&#x0201d;). Adults who stutter were significantly slower to respond than their fluent peers in this condition. Weber-Fox et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] contend that their findings do not demonstrate that adults who stutter have fundamental phonological processing deficits but that their ability to phonologically encode may be atypically vulnerable when the cognitive demand increases. In the word jumble task, performance differences between adults who do and do not stutter were noted at the longest word lengths (i.e., 5- letter and 6- letter words). The series of phonologically-dependent operations involved in solving a complex word jumble may recruit a high cognitive load and, thus, may have negatively impacted both the accuracy and SRT of adults who stutter in the current study.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Sub-vocal stimuli manipulations</title><p>Nonword repetition and phoneme elision paradigms, which require sub-vocal rehearsal, have demonstrated significant performance differences in adults who stutter relative to adults who do not stutter (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Such tasks heavily depend on sub-vocal rehearsal (i.e., keeping the stimuli in short term memory storage In the present task, sub-vocal rehearsal is not required as defined by Baddeley [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] because the participant has continual visual access to the word as he/she is attempting to unscramble it. However, the participant is required to nonvocally manipulate the stimulus in a trial and error fashion to arrive at a lexically appropriate solution. The numerous trial and error rearrangements, including assessing if the reordered letter strings match a lexical word, provides a robust processing load on phonological encoding and rehearsal networks. A similar cognitive load effect was seen in Byrd et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Adults who stutter, relative to fluent controls, demonstrated significant difficulty manipulating a novel phonological string, even when vocal output was not required. Unlike the visual stimuli used in the present study, Byrd and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] provided auditory input only. Thus, deficits in covert manipulation of phonological strings, irrespective of modality (i.e. verbal versus visual), appear to be relevant in explain and understanding the performance of adults who stutter on such demanding tasks.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Lexical access</title><p>The nature of the word jumble task requires participants to hold the changing phonological strings in the output buffer while simultaneously accessing the lexicon to determine if their solution to the paradigm is congruent with a real English word. Adults who stutter exhibited both increased SRT and decreased accuracy at the longest (6-letter) word length, whereas, adults who do not stutter demonstrated increased SRTs for 6-letter strings, but also increased accuracy. In other words, adults who do not stutter appeared to present with a speed-accuracy trade-off, such that increased SRT was required in order to produce the accurate solution to the word jumble task at the 6-letter length. Conversely, adults who stutter did not appear to benefit from increased SRT. That is, the slowness of their responses did not correspond with the accuracy of their responses. The absence of the speed-accuracy tradeoff for adults who stutter suggests that lexical access and/or the organization of the mental lexicon may be compromised in adults who stutter. Nevertheless, as has been previously argued by Hakim and Ratner [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] &#x0201c;it is difficult to know whether weaknesses in responding to the tasks reflect difficulty in encoding the input, storing it in memory, or accessing it efficiently (p.194).&#x0201d; More specific to the present study, it is challenging to parse out these individual processes (i.e. grapheme to phoneme conversion, phonological encoding, sub-vocal manipulation of serial ordering of segmental elements, lexical access) that take place nearly simultaneously as part of completing the word jumble paradigm.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Speech Motor and Additional Considerations</title><p>It is also possible that adults who stutter demonstrated a temporal instability in motor programming that resulted in slower and less accurate word jumble responses. Although stuttered responses were excluded from analysis, it is possible that adults who stutter demonstrated increased response times due to avoidance of anticipated stuttering. Previous research using nonword repetition and phoneme elision tasks with adults who stutter lends support to the assumption that there is an interplay between phonological encoding and motor programming (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). Future research could include follow-up questions to determine if participants detected difficulty responding due to anticipated disfluencies and/or if they used any fluency-enhancing strategies that may have impacted the onset of their responses.</p><p>Additional research is warranted to better understand the various subsystems involved in motor speech, lexical access, and phonological processing for adults who do and do not stutter. Perhaps, neuroimaging data can be used to further explain the role of phonological processing in stuttered speech.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Word Jumble Processing in Adults who Stutter: Possible Neural Correlates</title><p>In the past decade there has been an upsurge in brain-based studies reporting <italic>structural</italic> (white matter integrity, gray matter volumes), <italic>functional</italic> (overactive and underactive brain regions), and <italic>neuro-pharmacological</italic> (imbalances of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia) anomalies in persons who stutter (see Craig-McQuaide et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for meta-analyses). Collectively, the compromised neural areas, networks, and chemical regulators implicated in stuttering involve cortical/ subcortical areas performing speech motor planning and execution, and their subsequent integration with a phonological interface&#x02014;e.g., the &#x02018;speech sound map.&#x02019; Neurons in the speech sound map area are hypothesized to encode sound, syllable, and word sequences to be articulated [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This section of the discussion will provide an overview of diffusion tractography studies in persons who stutter, focusing on region-to-region white matter connectivity within the dorsal stream [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The dorsal stream contains the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the arcuate fasciculus. Of particular importance to the present study, these pathways are thought to sustain the &#x0201c;dorsal phonological route underlying grapheme-phoneme decoding&#x0201d; ([<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], p. 935).</p><p>To provide a framework for interpreting neuroimaging studies completed with persons who stutter, it is critical to first understand the general assumptions underlying the relationship between the dorsal stream and phonological processing. Saygin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported composite scores on measures of phonological awareness (elision, blending, nonword repetition, letter knowledge) positively correlated with white matter volume of the left arcuate fasciculus in typically developing children. With that in mind, it is interesting to note that Chang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported lower tract densities in adults who stutter in connections between Broca&#x02019;s area and both left primary motor cortex and premotor cortex. Chang and Zhu [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] also reported lower fractional anisotrophy (FA) values in children who stutter in basal ganglia-to-thalamus-to-cortex loops as well as connections between posterior superior temporal regions and the left inferior frontal gyrus. While FA is a fairly non-specific biomarker of fiber neuropathology, lower FA values are associated with slower speed and reduced quality of signal transmissions, or less-than-ideal synchronization of signals between relevant brain regions [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>A more recent investigation by Connally et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported lower FA values in the arcuate fasciculus bilaterally, as well as an inverse correlation between FA value and stuttering severity in the left angular gyrus. Cai et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] established a region-to-region connectivity matrix in adults who stutter showing a wide array of inferior connections in several regions of left peri-Rolandic sensorimotor cortex and left premotor areas, most notably between left ventral premotor cortex and mid-regions of primary motor cortex. Correlational analyses between severity of stuttering and white matter connectivity in the speech network revealed that all significant correlations were negative&#x02014;low FA values correlated with high stuttering severity.</p><p>Additionally, Cieslak et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported three white matter tracts that significantly differentiated adults who stutter from fluent controls: (1) the left arcuate fasciculus connecting the left inferior temporal gyrus to the left insular cortex was missing 39% of the &#x02018;tract&#x02019; volume, (2) the right arcuate fasciculus was also missing streamlines (38% of the &#x02018;tract&#x02019;) connecting inferior temporal gyrus to the supramarginal gyrus and surprisingly, (3) a &#x02018;novel&#x02019; left temporo-striatal tract connecting left inferior temporal gyrus to the left accumbens area of the basal ganglia was found only in adults who stutter (7 of the 8 participants who stutter). This white matter pathway overlaps with the uncinate fasciculus, which has been functionally linked to &#x0201c;auditory working memory/sound recognition&#x0201d; ([<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], p. 3538). Thus, findings from diffuse tensor tractography studies provide a neural basis for behavioral differences in phonological working memory for persons who stutter relative to fluent controls.</p><p>Additional supportive evidence of network dysfunction in frontal speech motor areas in adults who stutter has been reported in a whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) mapping study [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] using a delayed reading (isolated nouns) paradigm. The temporal patterning of cortical activations during single word reading in adults who stutter were found to be reversed relative to fluent controls. Within the initial 400 milliseconds after seeing a word, timing order of cortical activation in fluent controls proceeded from left inferior frontal cortex (articulatory programming) to left lateral central sulcus and dorsal premotor cortex (motor preparation); in contrast, adults who stutter showed an early left motor cortex activation followed by a long delayed left inferior frontal signal. This implies that the functional synchronization between preparation and execution of an articulatory motor sequence in persons who stutter is out of phase. High temporal resolution methodologies, such as MEG recordings, are essential to further identify subtle serial ordering anomalies in activating the speech production system. Taken together, behavioral data from the current study and previously reported neuroimaging results support the idea that differences in phonological processing and/or lexical access may contribute to the persistence and maintenance of stuttered speech production.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Through the use of behavioral tasks such as nonword repetition and phoneme elision, researchers have demonstrated that phonological working memory may contribute to stuttered speech production (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; cf., [<xref rid="pone.0151107.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). The current investigation extended past research by taxing phonological working memory using phonologically scrambled visual stimuli (i.e. word jumble task). As the cognitive load increased, adults who stutter attempted to solve significantly fewer word jumble tasks compared to fluent controls. Of the trials attempted, adults who stutter were significantly less accurate in their completion of word jumble tasks at the 4-letter, 5-letter, and 6-letter lengths compared to adults who do not stutter. Furthermore, adults who stutter demonstrated increased SRT at the 6-letter word length as compared to fluent controls. Additionally, adults who do not stutter demonstrated a significant negative correlation between accuracy and SRT at the longest word length; however, adults who stutter did not appear to present with this speed-accuracy trade-off. These results may be interpreted to further support the notion that differences in various aspects of phonological working memory, including visual-to-sound conversions, lexical access, and sub-vocal manipulations, may uniquely compromise the speech fluency of adults who stutter. Various neural underpinnings for both phonological processing deficits and speech motor control deficits may overlap and be responsible for the &#x0201c;on-off&#x0201d; fluency problems characterizing stuttering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151107.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Accuracy and speech reaction time data for adults who do and do not stutter.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151107.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to sincerely thank the Michael and Tami Lang Stuttering Institute and Dr. Jennifer and Emanuel Bodner for their endowed support of our research efforts.
