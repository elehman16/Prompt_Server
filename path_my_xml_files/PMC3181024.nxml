Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects more than a billion people worldwide and contributes to up to 40 per cent of maternal deaths in the developing countries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>. In a typical singleton pregnancy, about 600 mg of iron is required, which amounts to 4-6 mg per day of absorbed iron. Since diet alone cannot supply this amount of iron, additional supplementation is needed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>. But despite routine supplementation, many women continue to remain anaemic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>. Hence there is a need to review the additional factors affecting gastric absorption and utilization of dietary or supplemental iron. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, the curved Gram-negative ciliated bacillus, implicated in gastric ulcers and gastric cancer has been shown to be associated with IDA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>. A recent meta-analysis of 12 case reports and series, 19 observational epidemiologic studies and six interventional trials concluded <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection to be a major risk factor for iron deficiency or IDA especially in high risk groups. The pooled OR for the development of IDA was found to be 2.8 (CI 1.9, 4.2) and the need for further research into the impact of <italic>H. pylori</italic> therapy on iron stores was emphasized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>. In pregnant women, it has been found to be associated with low initial haemoglobin (Hb), unfavourable change in Hb during the course of pregnancy and a high chance of growth retardation and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in children of these mothers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>. Various mechanisms have been hypothesized for the development of IDA in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection; some of which are low gastric pH, low vitamin C levels in stomach, sequestration of serum iron and ferritin by gastric <italic>H. pylori</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>.

Several investigators have evaluated the safety of individual drugs, including proton pump inhibitors used in the anti <italic>H. pylori</italic> triple drug therapy in pregnant women and the meta-analysis reports no increased risk for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery or major congenital birth defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>.</p><p>Thus the present pilot study was planned to examine the impact of eradication therapy on response to therapeutic oral iron folate supplementation in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected pregnant women with IDA.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>This randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial was conducted from December 2005 to March 2007 in the Departments of Obstetrics &#x00026; Gynaecology, Pathology and Microbiology of University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi, India. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethics committee.</p><p><italic>Recruitment of study subjects</italic>: Since there was no background data available on the expected prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in pregnancy or impact of eradication therapy in pregnant women with IDA, this trial was conducted as a pilot study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.</xref>). In order to lend statistical power to study, the aim was to recruit a minimum of 40 <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected iron deficient anaemic women. The process started with a random screening of pregnant women who had Hb between 7 to 10.9 g per cent as per routine antenatal clinic testing. They further underwent serum iron studies. Those with confirmed IDA were then subjected to stool antigen testing to determine their <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection status.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig.</label><caption><p>Flow chart showing study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMR-134-224-g001"/></fig><p><italic>Diagnosis of IDA</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>: Complete blood count [Hb, packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet count, total leukocyte count (TLC)] was done using T890 Coulter automated blood cell counter (Beckman Coulter Inc, USA). Peripheral blood smear was evaluated after staining the slides with Standard Wright's stain. Reticulocyte count was done using New Methylene blue staining. Tests for iron deficiency [serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), percentage transferrin saturation] were done<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> and serum ferritin determined by ELISA kit (Dia Metra, Italy). The diagnosis of iron deficiency was established when serum iron was &#x0003c;60 &#x003bc;g/dl, serum TIBC was &#x0003e;350 &#x003bc;g/dl and percentage saturation was &#x0003c;16 per cent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>.</p><p><italic>Diagnosis of H. pylori infection</italic>: Women with established iron deficiency anaemia underwent stool antigen testing for <italic>H. pylori</italic> (premium platinum HpSA kit, Meridian biosciences Inc, USA). This is a rapid enzyme immunoassay, which uses monoclonal anti <italic>H. pylori</italic> capture antibodies adsorbed to plastic wells of ELISA tray. Diluted stool samples and conjugate (peroxidase conjugated to monoclonal antibodies) were added to wells and incubated. Colour was developed in presence of bound enzyme and was interpreted spectrophotometrically (OD 450 recorded with air at zero, positive and negative cut-offs were as based on the manufacturer's protocol). Women with history of having taken antacids or antibiotics in past one month were excluded as it interferes with test results.</p><p>Finally, 40 women between 14 to 30 wk gestation with mild to moderate IDA and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection were included in the study. Those with severe anaemia, megaloblastic or normocytic normochromic anaemia and known bleeding diathesis were excluded. All women confirmed their participation by signing a written informed consent form.</p><p>A detailed history, and physical and obstetric examination were carried out for all recruited women, who were further randomized for the purpose of treatment into: Group I (n=20): who received <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment and therapeutic iron and folic acid supplementation, and Group II (n=20): who received placebo and therapeutic iron folic acid supplementation.</p><p>Women were each assigned a sequential serial number and directed to third party for drug dispensing. This third party dispensed anti <italic>H. pylori</italic> therapy or placebo as per computer generated random number sequence, which was not known to the investigators.</p><p>For the purpose of blinding, placebo capsules were prepared using sucrose as filler identical to amoxicillin capsules and omeprazole capsules. Tablet clarithromicin was put into capsules so that corresponding placebos could be made.

Women were called for follow up after 72 h and then weekly to assess compliance, intolerance, and any side effects. At every visit, patients were enquired about intolerance, GI disturbances and they were all followed up till delivery to collect data regarding abortion, preterm delivery or low birth weight. Routine antenatal care was provided to all women and they continued to receive therapeutic iron and folic acid supplementation even after the study period of 6 wk was over.</p><p>The compliance was almost 100 per cent as all study subjects were under close follow up. The outcome measure was to assess the improvement in haematological parameters (complete blood count and serum iron studies) following interventional therapy, in response to iron folate supplementation for 6 wk. In case a woman delivered before 6 wk duration, only haemoglobin could be done. Serum samples collected at the time of serum iron studies were also stored frozen for serum ferritin analysis to be done at a later date. Due to limited number of ferritin kits available, paired (before and after treatment) samples of only 9 subjects were randomly selected for analysis,. Since the samples were identified only with laboratory numbers, investigators were unknown to the identity or study group of the subjects or their iron profiles.</p><p>Non parametric tests were used to analyze the data. Pre intervention values of all parameters were compared between group I and group II by Mann Whitney U test. Change (post -pre) was calculated for each parameter and the change was compared between the groups by Mann Whitney U test. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare pre- and post-values of each group separately. <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>With an aim to recruit 40 <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive pregnant women with IDA, 201 antenatal women in second and third trimesters with Hb between 7 and 10.9 g% (as detected in the routine screening done at first hospital visit) were investigated for the type of anaemia. Of these, 80 (39.8%; 95% CI 35.7, 44.3) were confirmed to have iron deficiency anaemia. The remaining 121 subjects did not qualify for recruitment criteria of microcytic hypochromic anaemia on peripheral blood smear or serum iron parameters.

A policy of routine Hb screening at the first visit was adopted in the hospital, according to which 57.05 per cent had mild to moderate anaemia (Hb 7 to 10.9 g %) and 1.26 per cent had severe anaemia (Hb &#x0003c;7 g %). Pure iron deficiency in mild to moderate anaemic women was found to be 39.8 per cent. In the present study, 62.5 per cent of these subjects had infection with <italic>H. pylori</italic>, indicating a high prevalence in our pregnant population with IDA. However, prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in European pregnant population was found much less and ranged between 18-23 per cent only<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>. Although Lancier <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> have suggested that pregnancy may by itself increase the susceptibility to <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection due to changes in the humoral and cell mediated immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, the high occurrence found in the present study may reflect a high <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection background prevalence in general population in our country. Valiyaveetil <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> in their study of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in adults with IDA in south India also found a high prevalence (61.5%). This high prevalence can be explained by differences in genetic and socio-economic factors, the spread of infection being specially facilitated by overcrowding, poor sanitation and living conditions, which are more prevalent in developing countries like ours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>.</p><p>We used the stool antigen test which is an FDA approved simple diagnostic test with sensitivity and specificity of 94.3 and 91.8 per cent respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, whereas other diagnostic modalities for <italic>H. pylori</italic> are of limited use in pregnancy due to their invasive nature (biopsy-urease test), use of radioactive nucleotide (urea breath test) or inability to differentiate recent and remote infection (serology).</p><p>Young age of recruited subjects is a pointer towards early acquisition of infection in our population. Also, infection was present in women from all socio-economic strata and educational profile, which contrasted with the data obtained from the developed countries, where researchers found a high prevalence in low economic strata<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>. Dyspepsia was not found to be a consistent feature of infection. Many earlier studies have refuted the association of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and dyspepsia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>.</p><p>Weyermann <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> found the <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected women to be having lower Hb at the beginning of pregnancy and an unfavourable change in Hb during the course of pregnancy. Farag <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> also reported higher odds of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in women with severe anaemia, but only among those who were consuming diets with low heme iron. The relatively high (near normal) percentage saturation and serum iron levels in the recruited subjects may be an indirect marker of a short term insult to the erythropoesis due to <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, which acts as a limiting factor in the iron utilization for erythropoesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the <italic>H. pylori</italic> induced IDA, including the effect of <italic>H. pylori</italic> induced gastritis on gastric acid secretion and hence intragastric <italic>p</italic>H, decrease in the gastric ascorbic acid levels, sequestration of iron from lactoferrin by special receptors on the bacillus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>. It has also been suggested that these sequestering proteins are preferentially expressed in iron deficient states, thus predisposing to IDA in nutritionally vulnerable states like children and pregnant women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>.</p><p>Several researchers have examined the effect of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication on IDA in children and nonpregnant adults, showing improvement of refractory iron deficiency anaemia even without iron replacement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>. But there are insufficient data on similar beneficial effect of anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> therapy in pregnancy. In the present study conducted in pregnant women with IDA, the response to oral iron folic acid supplementation was significantly better after <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy. Infected treated group showed significantly better change in median Hb and PCV levels than the placebo group. A significantly greater improvement was seen in serum iron profile after eradication therapy. Serum ferritin also showed a better improvement in the eradication group.</p><p>The small number of study subjects was a limitation of the present study. Also, serum ferritin could not be done for all study subjects due to financial constraints. Further, longer follow up even after cessation of iron therapy will truly reflect the efficacy of eradication therapy in IDA of pregnancy.</p><p>In conclusion, high prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was seen in pregnant women suffering from iron deficiency anaemia. The infection can be eradicated safely with triple drug therapy that significantly enhances the response to oral iron folic acid supplementation in pregnant women suffering from IDA. Further studies on a large number of women with a longer follow up of at least 12 to 24 months are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors thank the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India, for partly funding the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold><italic>Competing interests</italic>:</bold> The authors have no competing interests.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cardenas</surname><given-names>VM</given-names></name><name><surname>Mulla</surname><given-names>ZD</given-names></name><name><surname>Ortiz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Graham</surname><given-names>DY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Iron deficiency and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection in the United States</article-title><source>Am J Epidemiol</source><year>2006</year><volume>163</volume><fpage>127</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16306309</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Mumbai: International Institute for Population Sciences.
