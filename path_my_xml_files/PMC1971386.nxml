As part of a proposed randomised trial to assess the effect of dose intensity on outcome in ovarian carcinoma, a pilot study has been undertaken to determine the toxicity and efficacy of the high intensity therapy. Nineteen patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma received initial treatment with cisplatin 120 mg m-2 i.v. day 1, and cyclophosphamide 1,000 mg-2 i.v. day 1, given at 21-day intervals for six cycles. The average relative dose intensity of this therapy is 1.14 when compared with the CHAP regimen. Severe toxicity was experienced by most patients. The median received average relative dose intensity was 0.90, with only one patient receiving treatment to the proposed intensity. Randomised studies of the effect of dose intensity in ovarian carcinoma are essential, but an initial step must be to assess whether the proposed high dose treatment can be delivered.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00222-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="319" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00222-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="320" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00222-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="321" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00222-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="322" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
