This <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis evaluated the association between the improved outcomes and quality of responses achieved with VR-CAP <italic>versus</italic> R-CHOP in LYM-3002. Patients were randomized to six to eight 21-day cycles of VR-CAP or R-CHOP. Outcomes included progression-free survival, duration of response (both assessed by an independent review committee), and time to next anti-lymphoma treatment, evaluated by response (complete response/unconfirmed complete response and partial response), MIPI risk status, and maximum reduction of lymph-node measurements expressed as the sum of the product of the diameters. Within each response category, the median progression-free survival was longer for patients given VR-CAP than for those given R-CHOP (complete response/unconfirmed complete response: 40.9 <italic>versus</italic> 19.8 months; partial response: 17.1 <italic>versus</italic> 11.7 months, respectively); similarly, the median time to next anti-lymphoma treatment was longer among the patients given VR-CAP than among those treated with R-CHOP (complete response/unconfirmed complete response: not evaluable <italic>versus</italic> 26.6 months; partial response: 35.3 <italic>versus</italic> 24.3 months). Within the complete/unconfirmed complete and partial response categories, improvements in progression-free survival, duration of response and time to next anti-lymphoma treatment were more pronounced in patients with low-and intermediate-risk MIPI treated with VR-CAP than with R-CHOP. In each response category, more VR-CAP than R-CHOP patients had a sum of the product of the diameters nadir of 0 during serial radiological assessments. Results of this <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis suggest a greater duration and quality of response in patients treated with VR-CAP in comparison with those treated with R-CHOP, with the improvements being more evident in patients with low- and intermediate-risk MIPI. <italic>LYM-3002 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT00722137</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive and generally incurable form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is responsible for approximately 4.3&#x02013;5% of new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<sup><xref rid="b1-1020895" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-1020895" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Prognosis is poor for patients with MCL, with 5-year relative survival rates of about 30%.<sup><xref rid="b2-1020895" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) represents a standard of care for the treatment of newly-diagnosed patients with MCL who are considered ineligible for intensive therapy and stem cell transplantation.<sup><xref rid="b4-1020895" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Complete response/unconfirmed complete response (CR/CRu) rates of up to 48% have been demonstrated with R-CHOP in this population of patients.<sup><xref rid="b5-1020895" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, progression-free survival (PFS) in the study achieving this result was limited (median 16.6 months).<sup><xref rid="b6-1020895" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>VR-CAP (bortezomib, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone), which substitutes bortezomib for vincristine in R-CHOP, has been approved by regulatory agencies in the USA, European Union and Japan for the treatment of MCL.<sup><xref rid="b7-1020895" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-1020895" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This recommendation is based on findings from the randomized, phase 3 LYM-3002 study (NCT00722137), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of VR-CAP compared with R-CHOP in patients with newly diagnosed, measurable stage II, III or IV MCL who were ineligible or not considered for stem cell transplantation.</p><p>Results from the primary analysis of LYM-3002 demonstrated a 59% improvement in median independent radiology review committee-assessed PFS with VR-CAP compared with R-CHOP [24.7 <italic>versus</italic> 14.4 months, respectively; hazard ratio (HR) 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50&#x02013;0.79; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001], and a 96% improvement in investigator-assessed PFS (median 30.7 <italic>versus</italic> 16.1 months, respectively; HR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41&#x02013;0.65; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).<sup><xref rid="b10-1020895" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Significant and clinically important improvements in secondary efficacy endpoints were also demonstrated with VR-CAP compared with R-CHOP, including higher CR/CRu rate (53% <italic>versus</italic> 42%; <italic>P</italic>=0.007), longer median time to next anti-lymphoma therapy (TTNT; 44.5 <italic>versus</italic> 24.8 months; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; HR 0.50), longer median duration of CR/Cru (42.1 <italic>versus</italic> 18.0 months), and longer median duration of overall response (DOR; 36.5 <italic>versus</italic> 15.1 months). Overall response rates were high and were similar with the two regimens (92% <italic>versus</italic> 89% for VR-CAP <italic>versus</italic> R-CHOP, respectively).

The trial protocol was approved by local ethics committees/institutional review boards. All patients provided written informed consent prior to the commencement of the study.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed every 6 weeks during treatment, and every 6&#x02013;8 weeks during follow-up, until disease progression, study discontinuation, initiation of alternative therapy, or death. By central radiology acquisition guidelines, slide thicknesses for helical and conventional CT scans were 5 mm and 7&#x02013;10 mm for the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and 3 mm and 5 mm for the neck, respectively. All CT results were assessed by a blinded independent radiology review committee and by investigators, using modified International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria (IWRC) for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.<sup><xref rid="b11-1020895" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> For each patient, up to ten measurable sites of disease at baseline (clearly measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions, &#x0003e;1.5 cm in the long axis, &#x0003e;1.0 cm in the short axis) were tracked. At each follow-up, the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) was calculated (i.e., the sum of the long axis and short axis of all measureable sites). Lesions that became smaller than 5 mm &#x000d7; 5 mm were recorded as &#x02018;too small to measure&#x02019;, and given a default value of 0 mm &#x000d7; 0 mm (SPD nadir of 0). All other sites of disease were considered assessable (including objective evidence of disease identified by radiological imaging, physical examination, or other procedures as necessary) but were not measurable.

Depth of response was evaluated by measuring the maximum reduction in measurable lymph nodes from baseline, as assessed by CT, expressed as the SPD, and provided by the independent radiology review committee. Of note, achievement of an SPD nadir of 0 was not a prerequisite for achievement of CR or CRu, thus patients could meet the criteria for CR/CRu yet not achieve an SPD of 0. Equally, a patient with an SPD of 0 who did not otherwise meet the criteria for CR/CRu, or those with CR/CRu who did not have bone marrow/lactate dehydrogenase confirmation, would be classified as having a PR. An additional analysis was conducted investigating CR and CRu as individual categories. For this <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis, response, DOR, and PFS were based on assessment by the independent review committee. At the time of analysis, overall survival data were immature (the median overall survival in the VR-CAP arm was not estimable) and thus are not included.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat population, except for response endpoints (analyzed in the response-evaluable population).

For comparison, response rates across all patients with high-risk MIPI were similar between the VR-CAP and R-CHOP groups (overall response rate: 81% <italic>versus</italic> 83%; CR: 24% <italic>versus</italic> 24%; CR+CRu: 34% <italic>versus</italic> 32%; PR: 47% <italic>versus</italic> 51%) but the depth of response appeared greater with VR-CAP (patients with SPD=0, CR: 64% <italic>versus</italic> 53% with R-CHOP; CR/CRu 47% <italic>versus</italic> 38%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the LYM3002 study, despite similar overall response rates, VR-CAP resulted in improved outcomes (PFS, TTNT, DOR) compared with R-CHOP in newly-diagnosed patients with MCL.<sup><xref rid="b10-1020895" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The findings of our <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis suggest that this may be driven by a longer DOR and more profound disease elimination in those patients who received VR-CAP than in those who received R-CHOP, both overall and when stratified by response category. Within each response category, PFS, TTNT, and DOR were longer in patients receiving VR-CAP than in those receiving R-CHOP, and a greater proportion of patients became lesion-negative (SPD nadir of 0 for all measurable lesions), indicating that responses observed with VR-CAP were both longer and deeper than those observed with R-CHOP. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, because of the small sample sizes (16 patients per arm), the observation that CRu patients had a higher percentage of SPD nadirs of 0 and a longer DOR could be due to random variations. Of particular interest was the finding that results across all time-to-event outcomes in patients receiving VR-CAP who achieved PR were comparable to those seen in patients receiving R-CHOP who achieved CR/CRu.</p><p>Our analysis of response depth (based on the diameters of the lymph nodes chosen to be followed as measurable lesions by the independent radiology review committee and for which serial radiological measurements were provided) indicates that VR-CAP produced a deeper response than R-CHOP. In patients with PR, VR-CAP resulted in a higher rate of patients with an SPD of 0 compared with R-CHOP. Achievement of an SPD nadir of 0 suggests a better clearance of residual disease from the lymph nodes &#x02013; a benefit that is likely to contribute to the observed longer remission duration &#x02013; and was associated with improved PFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-1020895">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, although outcomes for lesion-negative PR patients were similar regardless of treatment (as were outcomes for lesion-positive PR patients) the longer PFS with VR-CAP <italic>versus</italic> R-CHOP in patients with PR is likely being driven by the higher percentage of lesion-negative patients. Although it appears counter-intuitive to have lesion-negative patients categorized as only partial responders, we highlight that the PR grouping here included patients who did not otherwise meet the criteria for CR/CRu. However, within the CR category, although being lesion-negative was again prognostic for improved outcomes <italic>versus</italic> lesion-positive CR, and although outcomes were similar in lesion-positive CR patients regardless of treatment, outcomes in lesion-negative CR patients were further enhanced in the VR-CAP group <italic>versus</italic> the R-CHOP group, a finding which suggests there may be other factors at play following treatment with VR-CAP, which could not be quantified here (as discussed further below).</p><p>Recalling that achievement of an SPD nadir of 0 was not a prerequisite for CR, these data introduce the concept that not all CR, by standard criteria/CT scanning, are equal. This suggests the need to use additional methodologies beyond radiology to further characterize the depth of complete remissions; however these methodologies were not used in this study. One such example is positron emission tomography CT scanning, which has improved the accuracy of disease staging in lymphoma over CT alone and is now considered the standard for response assessment in most lymphomas.<sup><xref rid="b14-1020895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-1020895" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> When the LYM-3002 study was initiated, positron emission tomography CT was not a widely available technique and could not easily be applied to global studies, but may have provided improved methods of characterizing depth of response. Another example is determination of minimal residual disease. In an analysis by Pott <italic>et al.</italic> of two studies involving transplant-eligible and -ineligible patients with previously untreated MCL, molecular remission, defined as minimal residual disease negativity by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity: 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) in both peripheral blood and bone marrow, was found to be an independent predictor of clinical outcome after combined immunochemotherapy.<sup><xref rid="b16-1020895" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In the analysis by Pott <italic>et al.</italic>, most patients received R-CHOP induction; other patients received rituximab, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or alternating R-CHOP/R-DHAP (rituximab, high-dose cytarabine and cisplatin) induction. In contrast, Howard <italic>et al.</italic> found that the attainment of a molecular remission to R-CHOP was not predictive of PFS in previously untreated patients with MCL,<sup><xref rid="b6-1020895" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> noting that the criteria for molecular remission were slightly looser (disappearance of polymerase chain reaction-detectable disease in the peripheral blood or bone marrow). These data, in conjunction with our analysis, indicate the need for further refinement of characterization of response and the importance of incorporating new techniques into studies of this nature.</p><p>Since the initiation of the LYM-3002 study, another notable update to the response criteria has been the removal of the CRu category and its replacement in the IWRC<sup><xref rid="b11-1020895" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and in the Lugano classification criteria with updated definitions of CR and PR.<sup><xref rid="b14-1020895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In acknowledgment of this update, we conducted an additional analysis investigating the DOR in which achievement of CR and CRu were considered separately. Long-term outcomes differed substantially when considering achievement of combined CR/CRu <italic>versus</italic> achievement of CR alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1020895">Figure 3</xref>); thus, our work supports the elimination of CRu as a separate response category. Based on our analysis, grouping these patients under the PR category appeared more appropriate and may have more clinical relevance. This observation is of particular relevance for early clinical phase trials, in which response is often the primary endpoint, designed to characterize treatment effect of novel therapeutic approaches.</p><p>In the overall LYM-3002 analysis, the improvement in PFS with VR-CAP <italic>versus</italic> R-CHOP was seen across each MIPI risk grouping, although in high-risk patients this was not statistically significant.<sup><xref rid="b10-1020895" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In the present analysis, the beneficial effect of VR-CAP in prolonging outcomes within each response category was predominantly seen in low-and intermediate-risk MIPI patients, and was less striking in the high-risk group. This may be driven by the greater proportion of CR/CRu patients receiving VR-CAP across the MIPI groupings who became lesion-negative by SPD assessment. It would be interesting to further investigate the biological drivers behind this observation &#x02013; what are the differential characteristics of MIPI high-risk disease that result in lower rates of lesion-negative CR and that obviate the improved outcomes seen with VR-CAP <italic>versus</italic> R-CHOP in these patients in other MIPI categories? For example, is it possible that patients with high-risk MIPI status have more rapidly proliferative disease, and thus the deeper response achieved with VR-CAP <italic>versus</italic> R-CHOP does not translate into substantially improved outcomes due to rapid disease return? Such findings support the suggestion of Dreyling that future studies should address the goal of personalized medicine.<sup><xref rid="b17-1020895" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Since commencement of our study, maintenance treatment with rituximab has become the standard of care for the treatment of newly-diagnosed, elderly patients with MCL,<sup><xref rid="b4-1020895" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b17-1020895" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and conceivably the use of VR-CAP with rituximab maintenance therapy could further prolong PFS. In addition, newer regimens showing enhanced efficacy relative to R-CHOP have since been introduced;<sup><xref rid="b18-1020895" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-1020895" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> a further study comparing VR-CAP with these combinations may be warranted, and in reference to the availability of newer and more sensitive methods of detecting disease elimination, should include analysis of depth of response, relationship of response categories and long-term outcomes. Tailoring therapies to different &#x02018;types&#x02019; or stages of disease (e.g. patients with high-risk MIPI) could perhaps also be considered.</p><p>In conclusion, this <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis of the association between the improved outcomes and quality of responses achieved with VR-CAP <italic>versus</italic> R-CHOP in the LYM-3002 study suggests a longer duration and better quality of response in VR-CAP <italic>versus</italic> R-CHOP patients, which was more evident in patients with low- and intermediate-risk MIPI. In addition, the results suggest that the extent of disease elimination, rather than the category of achieved response, may be a better predictor of treatment outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed MCL. In an era of an increasing number of regimens being developed in MCL, additional approaches should therefore be incorporated in clinical trial designs to further define the quality of responses.</p></sec>
