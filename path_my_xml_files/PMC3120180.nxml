The original double-masked oral insulin trial enrolled 372 subjects with a projected 5-year risk of diabetes of 26&#x02013;50% (60% male, 88% Caucasian, median age 10.3 years) between 1994 and 2002 (median follow-up of 4.3 years). Participants were randomly assigned to 7.5 mg oral insulin or placebo intervention once a day.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Follow-up study</title><p>In 2009, the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Network funded a follow-up study of the DPT-1 oral insulin trial subjects to determine whether the beneficial effect was prolonged. Each of the eight DPT-1 centers contacted those subjects eligible for recontact on the basis of the following criteria: <italic>1</italic>) they were diabetes-free at time of last contact and <italic>2</italic>) they agreed to future contact on the DPT-1 consent form. The study was completed in two phases. Phase 1 consisted of a questionnaire follow-up by phone to eligible subjects to determine current diabetes status, date of diagnosis, diabetes treatment, symptoms at time of diagnosis, most recent diabetes-associated laboratory work before diagnosis, and willingness to return for a clinical visit if diabetes-free. Subjects who were diabetes-free were eligible for phase 2, which consisted of an in-person clinic visit for a one-time oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess glycemic status, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), C-peptide, and Ab testing.</p><p>The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at participating locations, and all participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Laboratory measures</title><p>All test procedures and assays performed have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).

The OGTT includes samples for glucose and C-peptide levels at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured in a single reference laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System Software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All variables not normally distributed were log-transformed for analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide was calculated using the trapezoid rule. The intention-to-treat principle was used for this analysis. Kaplan-Meier life tables were used to determine the time to type 1 diabetes onset by treatment group and were compared using the log-rank &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> statistic. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests or Fisher exact test. Mean differences were tested using ANOVA. Data were summarized using mean (SD) or median (interquartile range). All tests for significance were two-tailed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk for type 1 diabetes by treatment adjusted for time on study and time since treatment ended.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s9"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 372 subjects who participated in the original DPT-1 study, 275 were eligible for the follow-up study; 97 developed type 1 diabetes at the end of the study in 2003 (0.02 [Q1&#x02013;Q3: 0&#x02013;0.5] median years after treatment to type 1 diabetes diagnosis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

The overall oral insulin effect in individuals with confirmed IAA levels &#x02265;80 nU/mL was maintained with additional follow-up; however, once oral insulin was stopped, the rate of developing diabetes in the oral insulin group became similar to the rate in the placebo group. This regression provides evidence that subjects with IAA levels &#x02265;80 nU/mL who received oral insulin before type 1 diabetes onset have delayed progression while on oral insulin, but once treatment ended, the risk of type 1 diabetes increased to the level observed in the placebo group. Because the loss of benefit coincided with the discontinued oral insulin, it is hypothesized that the immunological effect is tied temporally to the insulin intervention. In contrast, individuals with IAA levels &#x0003c;80 nU/mL displayed the opposite effect with a nonstatistically significant increasing risk of type 1 diabetes with oral insulin, while similarly the effect is attenuated, once therapy stopped.</p><p>The mechanism through which oral insulin mediates the apparent treatment response is unclear, but tolerance induction through this route may operate via effects on the adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Several nonclinical studies of the response to oral antigen have identified the induction of T cells that are associated with, and can adoptively transfer, protection from autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These cells are typically antigen specific, are CD4<sup>+</sup>, secrete the immune suppressive cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and have been termed T<sub>H</sub>3 cells or regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In other settings in which antigen-induced tolerance was achieved via a mucosal route (intranasal), there is evidence of activation-induced cell death of responder T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), a possibility that should be explored in future studies of oral antigen administration. Preliminary evidence has recently shown that these processes could be counterproductive, at least theoretically, if T<sub>regs</sub> are also deleted or sequestered (M. von Herrath, personal communication) and that the balance of induction/deletion is strongly influenced by the dose (frequency), with more frequent dosing being more harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). A further intriguing, and hitherto unexplained, finding of the oral insulin study has been the reliance of the therapeutic effect on the presence of high levels of IAAs. It is possible that the mechanistic pathway requires the induction of adaptive T<sub>regs</sub> from cohorts of preexisting insulin-specific T cells, or perhaps that antigen presentation by insulin-specific B cells is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In summary, the T-cell field has matured sufficiently to allow rational hypotheses as to the mechanistic effects of oral insulin to be proposed and examined experimentally.</p><p>In previous mouse model studies, such as those that influenced the initiation of the DPT-1 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), oral insulin therapy was successful in preventing type 1 diabetes onset; however, therapy was dose dependent, with a reduction in insulitis seen at lower doses (1 mg), disappearing at higher doses (5 mg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Although the majority of human studies reported no beneficial effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">21</xref>) that focused on evaluating time of intervention, antigen dosing, and administration interval reported that oral insulin given in low doses (1 mg) delays &#x003b2;-cell failure in new-onset patients &#x0003e;20 years of age. This double-blind placebo-controlled study randomized 191 subjects who were 5&#x02013;60 years of age to receive 1 mg insulin dose, 10 mg insulin dose, or placebo. Ergun-Longmire et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">21</xref>) demonstrated that age and duration of diabetes in combination with different immunological and metabolic markers have varying responsiveness to varying doses of oral insulin. The addition of the DPT-1 follow-up study finding that IAA titer is associated with drug therapy responsiveness will have a considerable impact on future human studies, such as those with antigen-specific immunotherapy, where understanding that variation in biomarker levels may have a large impact on immunotherapy success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The results of the randomized clinical trials designed to delay or prevent type 1 diabetes progression to date have indicated that timing of intervention, dosing and frequency, age at diagnosis, baseline C-peptide level, and number and type of Ab are important factors that need further investigation when designing effective treatment interventions. This study of a subgroup within the DPT-1 study provided new evidence that IAA titer affects responsiveness to oral insulin therapy. These results and advances in the immunological field (i.e., antigen-specific immunotherapy) using the TrialNet Network will provide ample opportunity to retest this hypothesis as well as others that evaluate varying dose and frequency of oral insulin therapy, evaluate other immunologic and metabolic biomarkers, and assess responsiveness to drug therapy as a prevention strategy in type 1 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by cooperative agreements with the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; the National Center for Research Resources; the American Diabetes Association; the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; and the U.K. Department of Health via the National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre award to Guy&#x02019;s &#x00026; St Thomas&#x02019; NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with King&#x02019;s College London.</p><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p><p>K.V. researched data, contributed to discussion, wrote the manuscript, and reviewed and edited the manuscript.
