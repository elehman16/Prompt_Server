Inflammation in other parts of the body such as the peritoneum has been described and may explain the accumulation of ascites, a painful and disabling feature of this disease.

It was first recognized during the 1940s and is still a cause of heart failure in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A recent community-based study of over 1000 people in Mozambique found an overall prevalence of 19.8&#x000a0;%. The commonest observed presentation of this disease is ascites which often requires repeated paracentesis because current medical treatment which includes diuretics, digoxin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors does not spare the patient from repeated paracenteses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>While data on the management of ascites due to EMF are lacking, there is a state of clinical equipoise amongst physicians managing these patients on the usefulness of corticosteroid therapy in preventing accumulation of ascites. The use of corticosteroids in the management of EMF, although not backed by randomised clinical trials, is informed by the pathological finding of global inflammation and fibrosis which is not limited to the heart. The infiltration of the peritoneal cavity with leukocytes and exudative ascites suggests on-going inflammation of the peritoneum that is independent of disease duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is therefore plausible that anti-inflammatory therapy can be useful to slow the progression of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Indeed, anecdotal reports in African settings have described complete disappearance of ascites with corticosteroids therapy; however, safety, efficacy, and optimal duration of therapy of steroid use are all unknown. Prednisolone is an intermediate acting corticosteroid drug with predominant glucocorticoid and low mineral corticoid activity, making it useful for the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory and auto-immune conditions. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and widely distributed throughout the body plasma protein bound on transcortin and albumin. It was chosen because it is inexpensive and readily available in Uganda. It has a moderate side effect profile and the pill burden is limited compared to other corticosteroids such as dexamethasone.</p><p>In this patient population, abdominal swelling due to ascites is the commonest presenting feature of EMF, and is often accompanied by abdominal pain, general weakness, and effort intolerance. The ascites is usually out of proportion to the amount of peripheral oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recurrent hospitalisation and paracenteses result in high social and economic costs to patients and caretakers. In this pilot study, we determined the safety and efficacy of prednisolone to prevent re-accumulation of ascites among EMF patients in Uganda.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of patients with endomyocardial fibrosis and ascites conducted at Mulago National Referral Hospital (Kampala, Uganda) from April 2012 to January 2013. Scientific and ethical approval was obtained from Makerere University College of Health Sciences School of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee (REC REF 2011-252), The National Drug Authority, and the trial registration number ISRCTN63999319 was obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link>. We hypothesised that a sample of 19 participants per group would give the study 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a 35&#x000a0;% difference between the two groups. This was based on the assumption that 95&#x000a0;% of patients would develop grade 3 ascites with standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Ascites was graded as follows using the International Ascites Club (IAC) grading grade 1: mild, only visible on ultrasound, grade 2: moderate symmetrical distension of abdomen and grade 3: large or gross ascites with marked abdominal distension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Starting with all study participants at IAC grade 2, the primary end point for the efficacy outcome was re-accumulation to IAC grade 3.</p><p>Participants were recruited from the outpatient cardiology clinic and inpatient ward Mulago Hospital Complex with the assistance of two research assistants and a screening questionnaire. Inclusion criteria were (a) 13&#x000a0;years and older and (b) a diagnosis of EMF with ascites based on published echocardiographic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Participants were excluded if they were critically ill, had unstable vital parameters, or were pregnant. Those previously exposed to corticosteroids were allowed to enrol after a wash out period of 1&#x000a0;month. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants over 18&#x000a0;years of age. Assent and parental consent were obtained from participants younger than 18&#x000a0;years. A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) was responsible for the review the unblinded data.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Baseline demographics and medical history were obtained using a standard questionnaire. A physical exam was performed to measure abdominal girth, weight, and grade of ascites. All participants with international ascites grade 3 ascites underwent paracentesis so that no participant had greater than international ascites grade 2 ascites at baseline. Leukocyte count and albumin were measured in all samples of ascites. Venous blood was collected for a complete blood count with differential, blood glucose, and albumin. The serum-to-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was calculated as the difference between the ascites and serum albumin concentrations.</p><p>Participants were randomized to the prednisolone or placebo groups using a computer-generated sequence of random numbers generated by an epidemiologist. Blinding was done by using tablets of prednisolone and placebo with similar shape, size and taste from the manufacturer. The drugs were packaged by the manufacturer who did not know the study hypothesis into opaque tins. A sealed envelope containing the actual drug codes was kept by the study epidemiologist. The principal investigator assigned participants to a specific study arm while the research assistants dispensed the drugs to the patients who did not know to which study arm they had been assigned. The seal on the drug codes was only broken at the end after the final analysis had been done.</p><p>Prednisolone was administered orally at a dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg per day or matching placebo at the same dose&#x000a0;with a ceiling dose of 60 mg per day. All study participants were followed up every 4&#x000a0;weeks until they reached the primary endpoint or for a maximum of 8&#x000a0;weeks. When the primary end point was reached, the study drugs were tapered off by halving the dose every week over a period of 1 month and then stopped. They were then redirected to the cardiac clinic for regular follow up and care. At each follow-up visit, side-effects were assessed by self-report using a standardized questionnaire and a physical exam. A random blood sugar was done at each visit using a contour glucometer. Adherence to treatment was assessed by pill count.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using STATA software package, version 11 and it was on intention to treat basis. Baseline characteristics of study participants were described as mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables or number (percent) for categorical variables, and were compared using t-tests, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, Chi-square tests, or Fisher&#x02019;s Exact tests as distributionally appropriate.</p><p>The primary outcome of this study was accumulation of grade 3 ascites requiring paracentesis. The relative risk of the primary outcome in the prednisolone group was calculated as the ratio of the proportion of participants who reached grade 3 ascites in the prednisolone group and the placebo group. In a separate analysis, the time to reaccumulation of grade 3 ascites was compared between groups. The frequencies of specific adverse events were described by study group and were compared using Chi-square tests or Fisher&#x02019;s Exact tests as distributionally appropriate. All tests were two-sided and a P value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Results</title><p>Study flow chart is described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The baseline characteristics of our subjects were mostly in agreement with what is known about the risk factors for this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The differences, of a small number of our study population having eosinophilia and majority having transudative ascites could have been because we saw these patients late after the acute stage of disease had passed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], or it could be that the picture of EMF in our context is different than the patients described by Rutakingirwa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In this study population, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse effects among the two study arms. There was a number of self-limited gastrointestinal bleeds but none requiring blood transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Prednisolone increased the risk of developing epigastric pain and muscle pains by 23 and 12&#x000a0;% respectively, but this was not statistically significant between groups. Only one study participant developed high random blood sugar which reduced on stopping the study drug. The short duration of drug exposure was the main study limitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prednisolone did not prevent reaccumulation of ascites in this patient population but was safe.
