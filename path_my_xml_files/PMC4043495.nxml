This study assessed the impact of the ten-valent pneumococcal nontypable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) on these end points. The primary objective was to demonstrate vaccine efficacy (VE) in a per-protocol analysis against likely bacterial CAP (B-CAP: radiologically confirmed CAP with alveolar consolidation/pleural effusion on chest X-ray, or non-alveolar infiltrates and C-reactive protein &#x02265; 40 &#x000b5;g/ml); other protocol-specified outcomes were also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>This phase III double-blind randomized controlled study was conducted between 28 June 2007 and 28 July 2011 in Argentine, Panamanian, and Colombian populations with good access to health care. Approximately 24,000 infants received PHiD-CV or hepatitis control vaccine (hepatitis B for primary vaccination, hepatitis A at booster) at 2, 4, 6, and 15&#x02013;18 mo of age. Interim analysis of the primary end point was planned when 535 first B-CAP episodes, occurring &#x02265;2 wk after dose 3, were identified in the per-protocol cohort. After a mean follow-up of 23 mo (PHiD-CV, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10,295; control, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10,201), per-protocol VE was 22.0% (95% CI: 7.7, 34.2; one-sided <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002) against B-CAP (conclusive for primary objective) and 25.7% (95% CI: 8.4%, 39.6%) against World Health Organization&#x02013;defined consolidated CAP. Intent-to-treat VE was 18.2% (95% CI: 5.5%, 29.1%) against B-CAP and 23.4% (95% CI: 8.8%, 35.7%) against consolidated CAP. End-of-study per-protocol analyses were performed after a mean follow-up of 28&#x02013;30 mo for CAP and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (PHiD-CV, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10,211; control, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10,140) and AOM (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3,010 and 2,979, respectively). Per-protocol VE was 16.1% (95% CI: &#x02212;1.1%, 30.4%; one-sided <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.032) against clinically confirmed AOM, 67.1% (95% CI: 17.0%, 86.9%) against vaccine serotype clinically confirmed AOM, 100% (95% CI: 74.3%, 100%) against vaccine serotype IPD, and 65.0% (95% CI: 11.1%, 86.2%) against any IPD. Results were consistent between intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Serious adverse events were reported for 21.5% (95% CI: 20.7%, 22.2%) and 22.6% (95% CI: 21.9%, 23.4%) of PHiD-CV and control recipients, respectively.

</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editors-summary"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pneumococcal diseases are illnesses caused by <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic>e bacteria, pathogens (disease-causing organisms) that are transmitted through contact with infected respiratory secretions. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> causes mucosal diseases&#x02013;infections of the lining of the body cavities that are connected to the outside world&#x02013;such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; lung infection) and acute otitis media (AOM; middle-ear infection). It also causes invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs) such as septicemia and meningitis (infections of the bloodstream and the covering of the brain, respectively). Although pneumococcal diseases can sometimes be treated with antibiotics, CAP and IPDs are leading global causes of childhood deaths, particularly in developing countries. It is best therefore to avoid <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infections through vaccination. Vaccination primes the immune system to recognize and attack pathogens rapidly and effectively by exposing it to weakened or dead pathogens or to pathogen molecules that it recognizes as foreign (antigens). Because there are more than 90 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> variants (&#x0201c;serotypes&#x0201d;), each characterized by a different antigenic polysaccharide (complex sugar) coat, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> vaccines have to include antigens from multiple serotypes. For example, the PHiD-CV vaccine contains polysaccharides from ten <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> serotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Although in most countries PHiD-CV has been licensed for protection against IPD and pneumococcal AOM, at the time of study, it was not known how well it protected against CAP and overall AOM, which are important public health problems. In this double-blind randomized controlled trial (the Clinical Otitis Media and Pneumonia Study; COMPAS), the researchers investigate the efficacy of PHiD-CV against CAP and AOM and assess other clinical end points, such as IPD, in Latin American infants. Double-blind randomized controlled trials compare the effects of interventions by assigning study participants to different interventions randomly and measuring predefined outcomes without the study participants or researchers knowing who has received which intervention until the trial is completed. Vaccine efficacy is the reduction in the incidence of a disease (the number of new cases that occur in a population in a given time) among trial participants who receive the vaccine compared to the incidence among participants who do not receive the vaccine.</p></sec><sec><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers enrolled around 24,000 infants living in urban areas of Argentina, Panama, and Colombia. Half the infants were given PHiD-CV at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and a booster dose at age 15&#x02013;18 months. The remaining infants were given a hepatitis control vaccine at the same intervals. The trial's primary end point was likely bacterial CAP (B-CAP) &#x02013;radiologically confirmed CAP, with the airspaces (alveoli) in the lungs filled with liquid instead of gas (alveolar consolidation) or with non-alveolar infiltrates and raised blood levels of C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation). In a planned interim analysis, which was undertaken after an average follow-up of 23 months, the vaccine efficacy in the per-protocol cohort (the group of participants who actually received their assigned intervention) was 22% against B-CAP. Intent-to-treat vaccine efficacy in the interim analysis (which considered all the trial participants regardless of whether they received their assigned intervention) was 18.2%. At the end of the study (average follow up 30 months), the vaccine efficacy against B-CAP was 18.2% and 16.7% in the per-protocol and intent-to-treat cohorts, respectively. Per-protocol vaccine efficacies against clinically confirmed AOM and vaccine serotype AOM were 16.1% and 67.1%, respectively. Against any IPD and against vaccine serotype IPD, the respective vaccine efficacies were 65% and 100%. Finally, about one-fifth of children who received PHiD-CV and a similar proportion who received the control vaccine experienced a serious adverse event (for example, gastroenteritis); 19 children who received PHiD-CV died compared to 26 children who received the control vaccine.</p></sec><sec><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that in Latin America, a region with an intermediate burden of pneumococcal disease, PHiD-CV is efficacious against a broad range of pneumococcal diseases that often affect young children. The accuracy of these findings may be limited by the withdrawal of 14% of participants from the trial because of adverse media coverage and by the low number of reported cases of AOM. Moreover, because most study participants lived in urban areas, these findings may not be generalizable to rural settings. Despite these and other study limitations, these findings provide new information about the magnitude of the effect of PHiD-CV vaccination against CAP and AOM, two mucosal pneumococcal diseases of global public health importance.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these websites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001657">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001657</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information for patients and health professionals on all aspects of pneumococcal disease and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pneumo/default.htm">pneumococcal vaccination</ext-link>, including personal stories</p></list-item><list-item><p>

Twenty-three participants were unblinded by the study safety physician as part of the emergency unblinding process or because the study participant was at risk for pneumococcal disease because of a medical condition diagnosed during the study. As a consequence they were censored at the time of unblinding, as defined in the statistical analysis plan. Three additional participants were unblinded by the study safety physician because of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction but remained in the per-protocol cohort for efficacy analysis. The randomization list was generated by the sponsor using a standard SAS (SAS Institute) program and was used to number the vaccines. A randomization blocking scheme was used to ensure that balance between treatment groups was maintained.</p><p>Since there were minor differences in vaccine appearance, an observer-blind methodology was used to maintain double-blinding and avoid possible observer bias.

In fact, assessment of the relative efficacy of a new vaccine compared to a licensed vaccine for which the impact in Latin America had not been previously determined would not permit understanding of the vaccine's real public health value in that region. The ethical acceptability of a pneumonia efficacy trial in Latin America with a 7vCRM control group that does not allow meaningful conclusions to be drawn would therefore be questionable.

Chest X-ray and laboratory tests to guide diagnosis and treatment were performed according to local routine clinical practice and the judgment of the treating physician. A child with an acute respiratory tract infection, referred by the treating pediatrician for a chest X-ray as part of the clinical assessment, was considered for suspected CAP study end points. Children with only symptoms of wheezing diseases (such as bronchiolitis and hyperreactive bronchial syndromes) were not considered for suspected CAP end points.

The latter category included any suspected CAP with pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray (including perihilar infiltrates and other abnormal findings).

X-rays were categorized as non-interpretable if the quality of the chest X-ray did not allow conclusions to be made regarding the presence or absence of abnormalities on the pulmonary parenchyma.

The suspected CAP case definition, being the broadest, encompassed all other CAP case definitions and was selected because it reflects the first step in the clinical assessment of a sick child by the treating physician: to identify potential pneumonia cases that require further evaluation. The radiologically confirmed CAP case definition represents the next step in the clinical reasoning process, where the chest X-ray is examined in an attempt to confirm the presence or absence of pneumonia. However, for study purposes and end point evaluation, as described above, assessment of X-rays was performed by external readers, independently of disease management procedures. The consolidated CAP case definition was proposed by the WHO to facilitate comparisons between pneumonia efficacy trials <xref rid="pmed.1001657-World6" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

Training in order to standardize assessment of AOM cases was provided before the start of the study and regularly thereafter to the physicians involved with the study, which followed recommendations provided by an external consultant with expertise in AOM. Initially, cases of AOM were captured only when parents sought medical attention for children with symptoms of AOM. However, approximately 2 y into the study (July 2009), because of a lower than expected AOM rate, the surveillance was enhanced through regular telephone calls or home visits by study personnel, who advised parents to visit the clinic if their child had symptoms suggestive of AOM. If AOM was suspected by the physician, the child was referred to one of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists involved in the trial. Study pediatricians and physicians on duty in emergency departments were asked not to initiate antibiotic treatment before referral to the ENT specialist.</p><p>A C-AOM diagnosis required either altered visual appearance of the tympanic membrane (e.g., redness, bulging, loss of light reflex) or the presence of middle-ear effusion (as demonstrated by simple or pneumatic otoscopy or by otomicroscopy). At least two of the following clinical symptoms, which started within the previous 5 d, were also required: ear pain, ear discharge, hearing loss, fever, lethargy, irritability, anorexia, vomiting, or diarrhea.</p><p>The severity of each suspected AOM case was assessed, combining objective elements of the Friedman scale (the Ear Treatment Group&#x02013;five items [ETG-5] and otoscopy scale with eight grades of severity [OS-8]) <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> with subjective elements in the clinical/otologic scale developed by Dagan et al. <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Dagan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This scale is based on five symptoms: temperature, irritability, and ear tugging on the day of the visit, as reported by parents, and redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane, as observed by otoscopy. Scores of 0 to 4, 5 to 7, and 8 to 15 were considered indicative of mild, moderate, and severe AOM, respectively. Clinical data were collected by the pediatrician or general physician who referred the child to the ENT specialist. Objective data related to observation of the ear drum were collected by the ENT specialist. When fluid was suspected to be in the middle ear, following specific informed consent, tympanocentesis was performed using a Channel Directed Tympanocentesis speculum (Walls Precision Instruments). Bacterial AOM was determined if the fluid, assessed via standard microbiological culture methods, contained a bacterial pathogen recognized as causative of AOM.</p></sec><sec id="s3f3"><title>Invasive disease surveillance</title><p>Invasive disease was defined as any disease where <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> or <italic>H. influenzae</italic> was identified in normally sterile body fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural effusion, synovial fluid, or peritoneal fluid.</p><p>Various clinical syndromes of focal invasive disease were recorded.

All data cleaning processes were blinded to study group, and analyses before the end of the study were conducted by an external statistician (from S-Clinica, Belgium) who performed the analyses using SAS and the StatXact 8.0 procedure in SAS based on cleaned datasets and quality control programs provided by GlaxoSmithKline.</p></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The per-protocol cohort for efficacy comprised participants who had complied with vaccination and did not fulfill elimination criteria. In the per-protocol analysis, follow-up was censored at whatever came first: data lock point, time of last contact (in case of withdrawal), time of unblinding, time of booster vaccination (if the booster dose was not given correctly), or 18 mo of age (if the booster dose was not given by this age). The intent-to-treat analysis assessed efficacy against disease episodes from administration of the first vaccine dose.</p><p>The incidence (percentage) of first disease episodes was calculated as the number of first episodes during the respective follow-up period divided by <italic>n</italic>, multiplied by 100. VE was estimated as one minus the hazard ratio and obtained, with its 95% CI, from a Cox regression model based on time to first disease episode. The Cox model was applied for VE and associated 95% CI and <italic>p</italic>-value computations when at least one event was observed in each group. Where zero cases were observed in one or more groups, the Poisson model, conditional to the number of cases, was applied without specific correction.</p><sec id="s3l1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary confirmatory objective was to demonstrate VE of PHiD-CV vaccination (three doses in children aged &#x02264;18 mo or four doses if aged &#x0003e;18 mo) against first episodes of B-CAP occurring at least 2 wk after administration of the third dose of PHiD-CV in the per-protocol cohort for efficacy. The study was designed to detect a VE of 20% at study end, but allowed an earlier efficacy conclusion if a higher VE was achieved at the time of the interim analysis. As defined in the study protocol, the interim analysis was planned to occur at least 18 mo after study start, once 535 first B-CAP episodes were identified.</p><p>A sample size of 24,000 healthy infants was planned to allow 21,600 evaluable children for the per-protocol CAP efficacy analysis. Power for B-CAP efficacy at the interim analysis and at the final analysis was calculated according to various VE assumptions and numbers of first B-CAP cases. With 535 first B-CAP cases and assuming a true VE of at least 25%, the study had 87.6% power to be conclusive at the interim analysis considering an adjusted one-sided alpha level of 1.75%.</p><p>At the interim analysis, the primary objective was considered to be conclusive and final if the one-sided nominal <italic>p</italic>-value for the null hypothesis (B-CAP VE &#x02264; 0%) was lower than the adjusted (Pocock adjustment) one-sided significance level of 1.75% (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0175), a value accounting for the possibility of a second analysis of the primary end point if the first was inconclusive (East, version 2.0, survival module: one-sided tests with early rejection of null hypothesis only; Cytel). The interim analysis was performed by an independent statistician to maintain blinding for the sponsor. The results were first shared with the IDMC, which, following agreement on the conclusions, sent them to the study sponsor.</p><p>After the interim analysis was performed, issues were discovered in Panama in relation to informed consent for some children (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001657.s012">Text S1</xref>). Corrective actions were implemented, with notification of the ethics committees and IDMC. Deficiencies in the informed consent process led to exclusion of some children from analyses, or where analyses had already been performed without awareness of the deficiencies, these deficiencies were addressed by performing a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact on study outcomes of the use of data from children for whom deficiencies were noted and could not be corrected. Specifically, for 60 children, the parent was a minor at the time of providing initial informed consent, and re-consent once the parent was aged 18 y could not be obtained, and for 53 children parental age was unknown. Therefore, in line with guidance from the European Medicines Agency <xref rid="pmed.1001657-International1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001657-European1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, a descriptive sensitivity analysis was conducted on the primary objective in which children with informed consent issues were excluded to confirm the validity of the interim analysis. Children for whom the original signed informed consent form was missing (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;31) were also excluded from this sensitivity analysis, which was performed by an independent statistician on the database used for the interim analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3l2"><title>First secondary outcome</title><p>For the sequential secondary confirmatory objective (efficacy against C-AOM at the end of the study; not part of interim analysis), the number of first C-AOM episodes required to show VE&#x0003e;0% with 80% and 90% power (non-adjusted one-sided test, nominal type I error of 2.5%) was calculated according to various true VE assumptions. If VE was 20%, 662 and 880 first C-AOM episodes were required to demonstrate positive VE with 80% and 90% power, respectively. If VE was 15%, 1,226 and 1,637 first C-AOM episodes were required for 80% and 90% power, respectively. Since the objective of the trial was to demonstrate VE in terms of a lower incidence of B-CAP or C-AOM in the vaccine group compared to the control group, only comparison in one direction was deemed necessary, hence the use of a one-sided statistical hypothesis linked to VE (with associated one-sided alpha level).</p><p>The first secondary objective (to demonstrate VE of PHiD-CV against first C-AOM episodes) was considered significant if the primary objective was significant and the one-sided <italic>p</italic>-value for VE against C-AOM was &#x0003c;0.025, allowing for control of the primary confirmatory B-CAP objective and the sequential secondary confirmatory C-AOM objective.</p></sec><sec id="s3l3"><title>Other secondary outcomes and safety</title><p>Other analyses, including VE against first IPD episodes, were descriptive, and therefore there was no adjustment for multiplicity for the associated informative <italic>p</italic>-values. Interpretations of nonoverlapping 95% CI boundaries should therefore be made with caution, as no predefined criteria were fixed, with no formal control of the alpha level. A two-sided Schoenfeld residual test for the null hypothesis that the VE is homogeneous over the age/time range was performed in order to assess the proportionality assumption associated with the Cox model.</p><p>An analysis of VE against consolidated CAP was conducted among children who received the booster vaccine dose; VE was calculated for cases reported before the booster dose, given at 15&#x02013;18 mo of age, and for cases reported after the booster dose. In another subanalysis, AOM severity was categorized according to the five symptoms on the Dagan scale. Cases were analyzed for which the presence or absence of each of the five symptoms had been recorded. In addition, a second complementary analysis of severity was conducted, considering cases that had at least one symptom score recorded, with the assumption that unrecorded symptoms were not observed.</p><p>Immunogenicity analyses are reported for the per-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, defined as vaccinated children who met all eligibility criteria, complied with protocol-defined procedures, and had at least one antibody assay result available.

When the error was detected, in agreement with the independent ethics committee, 501 parents/guardians were recontacted to confirm their agreement to the use of the immunogenicity data of their child/ward. For 262 children, parents/guardians could not be contacted to provide consent or did not agree to the use of immunogenicity data. In addition, two children were excluded because the original informed consent forms were lost during the re-monitoring activities. Therefore, 264 children were excluded from the intent-to-treat cohort for immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001657.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

This suggested that PHiD-CV vaccination reduced all-cause mortality by 27.0% (95% CI: &#x02212;31.8%, 59.6%), although this difference was not statistically significant. The majority of the reported fatal cases (nine in the PHiD-CV group, 16 in the control group) involved children aged less than 1 y. None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Efficacy of PHiD-CV was shown against a variety of CAP, AOM, and IPD end points, with consistent results between the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses. In the interim analysis, VE against first episodes of B-CAP was 22.0% and therefore (as predefined in the protocol) was considered conclusive for the primary objective. In this analysis, efficacy against WHO-defined consolidated CAP was 25.7%. In the end-of-study per-protocol analyses, VE was 16.1% against C-AOM, 67.1% against vaccine pneumococcal serotype C-AOM, 100% against vaccine serotype IPD, and 65.0% against IPD of any serotype.</p><p>This study thereby provides a comprehensive assessment of clinical protection of PHiD-CV against invasive and mucosal infections in Latin American children. In addition, despite the lower immunogenicity of PHiD-CV compared to 7vCRM, the antibody levels achieved were sufficient to provide a level of protection against WHO-defined CAP with alveolar consolidation (22&#x02013;26%) that was consistent with the 20&#x02013;37% efficacy reported in previous studies with other PCVs, including 7vCRM <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Black2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001657-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It should be noted that these studies were conducted with vaccine candidates of different serotype valencies and carrier proteins (seven- and nine-valent CRM<sub>197</sub>-conjugated vaccines, and 11-valent vaccine containing tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid carrier proteins), and took place in a variety of geographic and socioeconomic settings.</p><p>In our study, VE against WHO-defined consolidated CAP among children aged 12&#x02013;24 mo and 24&#x02013;36 mo remained above 20%, which was consistent with results obtained with 9vCRM in the Gambia <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Cutts1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and South Africa <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Guiaz1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> but differed from studies of 7vCRM in the US <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Black2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and an 11-valent vaccine in the Philippines <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Lucero1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In the latter two studies there was evidence of diminished efficacy already in the second year of life. The reasons for waning VE in some studies but not others are unknown but might be associated with inconsistent use of booster vaccination between studies, differences in strength of natural boosting between populations, or proportional increases in pneumonia caused by pathogens other than <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> or by non-vaccine serotypes <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Black2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It should be noted that, with the descriptive analyses of VE per age subgroup and pre-/post-booster dose, it is difficult to disentangle the effect of age from the effect of the booster dose.</p><p>The number of AOM cases identified in Panama was lower than expected, and various factors might have contributed to this outcome. Case detection was especially low during the first 2 y of the study, and by the time it was enhanced, the age period of expected peak in AOM incidence <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Monasta1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> had likely passed for most participants. The requirement for evaluation by a pediatrician followed by further assessment by the ENT specialist and exclusion of children at high risk for pneumococcal infection could also have contributed. Some parents might have been reluctant to seek medical advice because of perceptions of AOM as a usually mild disease or might have obtained care from nearby pharmacies or clinics not involved in the study.</p><p>Regardless of the factors responsible, the relatively low incidence of AOM may help with interpretation of the C-AOM protection results since, in the prespecified primary outcome (the per-protocol analysis), the lower limit of the 95% CI around the 16.1% point estimate was slightly below zero (95% CI: &#x02212;1.1%, 30.4%). Analysis of the intent-to-treat cohort gave a similar point estimate (19.0%) but with a 95% CI lower limit above zero (95% CI: 4.4%, 31.4%). This suggests that the lack of statistical significance in the per-protocol analysis was due to a lack of cases rather than to true lack of efficacy.</p><p>Nevertheless, we consider these results as highly relevant to other settings, as the AOM cases had both pediatrician and ENT confirmation, and around half of the C-AOM episodes were mild, with the remainder being moderate or severe, thus representing the broad spectrum of clinical AOM. In any case, differences in case definitions contribute little to differences in PCV efficacy estimates against AOM <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Palmu1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Notably, VE against AOM episodes caused by vaccine serotypes in our study was similar to that observed in two European studies, the Finnish Otitis Media (FinOM) trial of two seven-valent PCVs (one investigational) and the Pneumococcal Otitis Efficacy Trial (POET) of the 11-valent predecessor to PHiD-CV conducted in the Czech Republic and Slovakia <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001657-Prymula2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We note that the most common serotypes causing AOM in both Latin America and Europe are members of serogroups 6, 14, 19, and 23 <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Bardach1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001657-Rodgers1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>Similar to the Pneumococcal Otitis Efficacy Trial and in contrast to the Finnish Otitis Media trial, VE against AOM caused by nontypable <italic>H. influenzae</italic> in COMPAS suggested a beneficial effect, although the result was not significant (95% CI included zero). It should be noted that the COMPAS study was not powered to assess the nontypable <italic>H. influenzae</italic> end point. Also similar to the Pneumococcal Otitis Efficacy Trial, there was no evidence for replacement of vaccine serotypes with non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes or other otopathogens during 31 mo of intent-to-treat follow-up for AOM analysis; in contrast, evidence of replacement disease was found early in the follow-up of the Finnish Otitis Media trial with 7vCRM, as of 2 mo of age <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Jokinen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Overall, as AOM is a common disease <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Monasta1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, the 16%&#x02013;19% VE observed against C-AOM represents substantial reductions in AOM case numbers, from both public health and health care cost perspectives. In previous double-blind randomized trials of PCVs (all seven-valent) administered in infancy, VE estimates against clinical AOM were 0%&#x02013;7% <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Jansen1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and appeared unaffected by population variability <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Fireman1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. With the 11-valent protein D conjugate vaccine, VE against clinical AOM was 34% <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Prymula2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. However, comparisons of C-AOM results among trials are complicated by differences in care-seeking and case detection methods, as well as disease burden.</p><p>All invasive disease cases were first episodes and pneumococcal, and, as anticipated from the regional epidemiology of pneumococcal serotypes <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, most were caused by vaccine serotypes. The results presented here are similar to those obtained in a recently published cluster-randomized double-blind trial conducted in a different socioeconomic setting, Finland. There, PHiD-CV was highly effective against IPD when given either in a 3+1 or 2+1 vaccination schedule to infants or as a two-dose catch-up to children in the second year of life <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Palmu2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. As in COMPAS, following the 3+1 PHiD-CV schedule, VE against IPD caused by any vaccine serotype was 100% in the Finnish study. This point estimate is similar to or slightly higher than those observed in studies of other PCVs against IPD <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Cutts1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001657-Klugman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001657-Black3" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001657-Fitzwater1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.</p><p>One limitation of this study, as noted earlier, lies in the low number of reported AOM cases, despite efforts to improve surveillance during the study. Another limitation was the study setting being in mostly urban areas, potentially affecting its generalizability to rural populations. This setting was chosen to aid recruitment and to improve the likelihood of capturing all pneumonia cases, as that might have been difficult in rural areas without easy access to health care centers and pediatric hospitals. An additional study limitation was that approximately 14% of participants were excluded from the per-protocol efficacy analyses, mainly because of early withdrawal and noncompliance with the primary vaccination schedule in both groups. This was predominantly as a result of adverse media coverage of the study in 2007/2008 linked to unfounded rumors of a causal relationship between PHiD-CV vaccination and infant mortality <xref rid="pmed.1001657-SociedadArgentinade1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Subsequent investigations of the blinded safety results were conducted by the IDMC and local regulatory authorities. Although these concluded that the study could continue as planned, many parents became unwilling to allow their children to continue to participate.</p><p>Nonetheless, these exclusions do not appear to have affected the robustness of the study, as VE results were consistent between the intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Importantly, a 27% reduction (not statistically significant) in overall mortality in PHiD-CV recipients was observed, which was most evident in children in the first year of life, when the risk of severe pneumococcal disease is highest <xref rid="pmed.1001657-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Reductions in all-cause mortality reported in other pneumococcal conjugate VE studies in young children, both with a nine-valent vaccine, were 14%&#x02013;16% in the Gambia <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Cutts1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and 5% in South Africa <xref rid="pmed.1001657-Klugman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, COMPAS is, to our knowledge, the first double-blind randomized controlled trial to assess pneumococcal conjugate VE in Latin America, a region with an intermediate pneumococcal disease burden. The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of PHiD-CV and document the magnitude of its impact against CAP and AOM, which are mucosal diseases of public health importance, commonly encountered in young children in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001657.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
