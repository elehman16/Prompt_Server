Adult inpatients with a current manic episode fulfilling DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for bipolar type I disorder were included. Patients were randomized to amisulpride (400&#x02013;800 mg/day) or haloperidol (5&#x02013;15 mg/day) for 3 months and all received valproate. The primary effectiveness criterion was the percentage of responders (defined by a decrease of &#x02265;50% of the Y-MRS) in patients completing the study. Safety was evaluated by adverse event reporting, determination of extrapyramidal function and clinical examination. Sixty-two patients were randomized to receive valproate-amisulpride, and 61 to receive valproate-haloperidol. At study end, responder rates were 72.6% in the amisulpride group and 65.5% in the haloperidol group. Remission rates were 83.9% and 89.7%, respectively. At study end, neither response rates nor remission rates differed significantly between groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred significantly (p = 0.009) more frequently in the haloperidol group (86.4%) than in the amisulpride group (66.1%). In conclusion, the valproate&#x02013;amisulpride combination was as effective as the valproate &#x02013; haloperidol combination in bipolar I patients, with a better safety profile.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>amisulpride</kwd><kwd>valproate</kwd><kwd>haloperidol</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>mania</kwd><kwd>bipolar disorder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bipolar I disorder is an episodic, lifelong illness characterized by alternating phases of mania and depression. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar type I disorder estimated in general population surveys conducted in Europe ranges from 0.3% to 1.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Pini et al 2005</xref>). Bipolar disorder carries with it an increased risk of psychiatric or somatic morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Krishnan 2005</xref>), substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Levin and Hennessy 2004</xref>), and suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Angst et al 2005</xref>), and is highly detrimental to stable social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Elgie and Morselli 2007</xref>).</p><p>Current practice guidelines recommend first-line treatment of acute mania with either lithium, valproate, or an atypical antipsychotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">APA 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Goodwin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Grunze et al 2003</xref>). As monotherapy, atypical antipsychotics show similar efficacy to mood stabilizers (lithium or valproate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Smith et al 2007</xref>), whereas combination of the two classes of drug brings superior efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Scherk et al 2007</xref>) and is considered useful in cases of severe mania or inadequate response to monotherapy. Combining antipsychotic drugs with lithium or valproate achieves a more rapid onset of response, better control of agitation and insomnia, and a lower risk of rebound depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bowden 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Scherk et al 2007</xref>). Although haloperidol has been used widely for the acute treatment of mania, its use is associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal effects than the more recent atypicals and may carry a higher risk of switch to depression and poor adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Tohen et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Smulevich et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, few randomized clinical trials have compared atypical with classical antipsychotics in the treatment of acute mania. Sachs and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Sachs et al 2002</xref>) compared treatment with a combination of haloperidol and a mood-stabilizer with a combination of risperidone and a mood stabilizer and to a mood stabilizer alone in a 3-week study. Both antipsychotic combinations were superior to mood stabilizer alone in terms of symptomatic control of mania, with no significant difference being observed between them. However, extrapyramidal side-effects were observed significantly more frequently with haloperidol than with the other two study treatments. In addition, a number of randomized studies have compared haloperidol monotherapy with olanzapine monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Shi et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Tohen et al 2003</xref>), quetiapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">McIntyre et al 2005</xref>), risperidone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Segal et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Smulevich et al 2005</xref>), and aripiprazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Vieta et al 2005a</xref>) in acute mania. The majority of these have demonstrated comparable response or remission rates with the atypical antipsychotic to haloperidol, with the exception of the aripiprazole study. However, response rates to haloperidol in this study were particularly low compared with other studies, because the definition of response included the requirement to stay on medication for 12 weeks. A meta-analysis of these studies showed similar reduction of manic symptoms and comparable response rates for haloperidol and for the atypical antipsychotics, but lower dropout rates due to adverse events, lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, and better control of depressive symptoms with the atypical antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Scherk et al 2007</xref>).</p><p>Amisulpride is an atypical antipsychotic which has been suggested to show superior efficacy to both haloperidol and risperidone in improving affective symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Peuskens et al 2002</xref>) and for which there is some evidence for efficacy in affective disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Montgomery 2002</xref>). A prospective open-label study of amisulpride as add-on therapy to mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute mania reported by Vieta et al showed a 3-fold reduction in YMRS total scores after 6 weeks treatment with adjunctive amisulpride. Sixty-five percent of patients were considered responders (at least 50% improvement of YMRS scores) and remission was achieved by 50% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Vieta et al 2005b</xref>). Also, a longitudinal study evaluating relapse rates before and after the introduction of amisulpride in patients treated for bipolar I disorder showed a 3-fold reduction of relapse rates after the introduction of amisulpride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Carta et al 2006</xref>). Amisulpride also shows a low incidence of extrapyramidal side-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Leucht et al 2002</xref>) and less propensity to produce weight gain compared with some other atypical antipsychotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Leucht et al 2002</xref>). Therefore, combination treatment with amisulpride and a mood-stabilizer may be of interest in the treatment of bipolar disorder. In order to test this hypothesis, we have performed a randomized, open-label clinical trial comparing amisulpride and valproate combination therapy with haloperidol and valproate combination therapy in the treatment of acute mania.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of valproate and amisulpride combination treatment with that of valproate and haloperidol combination treatment for 3 months in patients with type I bipolar disorder presenting with a manic episode. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the clinical and biological safety of the two combination treatments, to evaluate efficacy after 3 weeks, and to assess patient satisfaction at 3 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, comparative phase II study. The study duration was 3 months. The study was conducted in 27 centers in 5 European countries (Czech Republic, France, Poland, Slovakia, and Spain) between May 2004 and June 2005.</p></sec><sec><title>Entry criteria</title><p>The study included subjects aged 18&#x02013;65 years with a current diagnosis of bipolar I disorder according to DSM-IV-TR criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">APA 2000</xref>). Subjects were required to be currently in a manic episode fulfilling DSM-IV-TR criteria and to have experienced at least 1 manic episode in the past. The total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Young et al 1978</xref>) was to be at least 20, with a score of at least 3 for at least 2 of the following YMRS items: elevated mood, increased motor activity, energy, sleep, or content (grandiosity). The score on the severity scale of the Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder questionnaire (CGI-BP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Spearing et al 1997</xref>) was to be at least 5.</p><p>Women of childbearing age were expected to be using an effective method of contraception and all subjects had to be able to comply with the study protocol. Pregnant and breast-feeding women were excluded.</p><p>Subjects with antecedents of intolerance to benzamide drugs, haloperidol or valproate, contraindications to any of these drugs, with comorbidities that might affect implementation or interpretation of the study, with clinically relevant abnormalities in biochemical (notably hypokalemia, transaminases higher than twice the upper limit of normal, or bilurubin or alkaline phosphatase outside the normal range), hematological or electrocardiographic (in particular, heart rate &#x0003c;55 bpm, congenital QT prolongation, or QTc Bazett interval &#x0003e;450 ms in males and &#x0003e;470 ms in females) parameters, those having participated in a clinical trial within the previous 3 months, and subjects with current or recent substance abuse or dependence were not included in the study.</p><p>Treatment with fluoxetine in the previous 4 weeks, with injectable long-acting antipsychotics if the interval between two injection periods had not elapsed at inclusion, with a mood stabilizer other than valproate at an effective dose for less than 7 days preceding the screening visit, and for whom a treatment switch was not justified, was not allowed. Other prohibited drugs included Class Ia and Class III antiarrythmic drugs, beperidil, cisapride, sultopride, thioridrazine, erythromycin (iv), vincamine (iv), halofantril, pentamidine, and sparfloxacin.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>Subjects fulfilling the entry criteria were randomized to receive either amisulpride and valproate or haloperidol and valproate. During the screening visit, the investigator contacted the contract research organization in charge of the operational management of the study by telefax in order to obtain a patient treatment number. Each number corresponded to one or other of the study treatments. Study medication was provided in numbered containers divided into separate packs containing sufficient drug to last the patient between 2 consecutive study visits, the total quantity covering the entire study period. Randomization was stratified by country and numbers allocated on a patient by patient basis rather than in blocks. The randomization code was generated and maintained centrally by the contract research organization in charge of the operational management of the study. Patients were randomized into the study and allocated study treatment in a sequential order according to this list, in each country. The allocation sequence was not revealed before treatments had been assigned.</p><p>The treatment phase was preceded by a 3-day wash-out period which could be reduced to 1 day in case of aggravation of mania. The treatment phase lasted for 12 weeks. Subjects were hospitalized during the washout period and for at least the 2 first weeks of the active treatment period; hospital discharge was decided when considered appropriate by the investigator. Study visits were scheduled on Day &#x02013;3, Day 0, Day 4, Day 7, Week 2, Week 3, Week 8, and Week 12. Evaluations made at Week 3 and Week 12 were used for the efficacy evaluation. A latitude of 3 days and 7 days respectively was allowed for these study visits either side of the planned date. Additional visits could be made if considered appropriate by the investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Amisulpride was provided as scored 400 mg tablets (Solian<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) and haloperidol as scored 5 mg tablets. Valproate was provided as the pharmaceutical form approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder in participating countries (sustained-release sodium valproate + valproic acid tablets 500 mg for the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Spain, or enteric-coated valproate semisodium tablets 500 mg or 250 mg in France). No blinding of study medication was attempted in order to simplify the procedures and to enrol a more representative sample. Treatment was initiated at a dose of 600 mg/day for amisulpride and 10 mg/day for haloperidol. In both cases, the starting dose of valproate used was that specified in local prescribing recommendations (10&#x02013;15 mg/kg in Czech Republic, 20 mg/kg/day in France, 5&#x02013;15 mg/kg in Poland, 10&#x02013;15 mg/kg in Slovakia, 20&#x02013;30 mg/kg/day in Spain). From Day 4 onwards, the dose could be adjusted at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion at any study visit, as a function of the clinical state of the subject. For amisulpride, dose adjustment was made in steps of 200 mg within a range of 400&#x02013;800 mg/day. For haloperidol, the adjustment was made in steps of 5 mg within a range of 5&#x02013;15 mg/day. Dose adjustments were made on the day after the study visit and could be made as many times as deemed necessary. The dose of valproate could be adjusted accordingly if plasma levels were outside the 40&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g/mL range at the Week 3 study visit, or in case of emergence of side-effects. Otherwise, the dose of valproate was not changed during the course of the study. Treatment was pursued for 12 weeks.</p><p>At each study visit, the patient was expected to return the previous medication pack and receive a new one covering the period until the next study visit. A pill count of returned medication was made, and the number of returned pills recorded on a drug tracking form. On this basis, the investigator evaluated reported the overall compliance of the patients at each study visit on the case report form (yes or no).</p><p>Concomitant use of other psychotropic drugs was prohibited, except for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics in case of insomnia and lorazepam if needed to control agitation, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, and hostile behaviors. The maximum daily dose of lorazepam was 6 mg in the first week and 2 mg in the second and third weeks. Thereafter benzodiazepine use was prohibited. Antiparkinsonian drugs (eg, biperiden or procyclidine or tropatepine) could be introduced to control incapacitating extrapyramidal symptoms documented by the Simpson Angus Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Simpson and Angus 1970</xref>). The use of other drugs entering in the exclusion criteria for the trial (eg, anti-arrhythmic drugs) was also prohibited.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of effectiveness</title><p>The primary efficacy criterion was the proportion of subjects fulfilling a combined criterion of response, defined as a reduction of at least 50% of the YMRS score, and completion of the 12-week treatment period. This outcome was chosen because the trial was aimed at assessing effectiveness, rather than pure efficacy, and because it has been successfully used before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Vieta et al 2005a</xref>). Secondary efficacy criteria included the proportion of responders at Weeks 3 and 12, the proportion of subjects in remission, defined as a YMRS score &#x02264;12, at study end, changes from baseline in YMRS score and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Overall and Gorham 1962</xref>) score at Weeks 3 and 12, changes from baseline in the Montgomery and &#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Montgomery and &#x000c5;sberg 1979</xref>)) and the Global Assessment Scale (GAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Endicott et al 1976</xref>) at study end and the change item and patient satisfaction item of the CGI-BP at study end. The maintenance of response was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. A sustained response was defined as reaching a YMRS score &#x02264;12 and a MADRS score of &#x02264;15 for at least 2 consecutive visits. Subjects switching to depression or relapsing into mania were identified. A switch to depression was defined as an increase in the CGI-BP depression score of at least 2 points and a MADRS score &#x02265;15. A relapse into mania was defined as an increase of at least 25% in the YMRS total score following a sustained response. A posthoc analysis of efficacy was performed on patients with prominent psychosis defined by a score of at least 3 for the &#x0201c;Content&#x0201d; item of the YMRS scale at D0, or a score of at least 4 for at least 2 of the 5 following items of the BPRS scale at D0 (conceptual disorganization, grandiosity, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content). A second posthoc analysis was also performed on patients with depressive symptoms at inclusion defined by a score at baseline of at least 10 on the MADRS scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of safety</title><p>Safety was assessed by recording spontaneously reported adverse events throughout the study. Adverse events were classified according to severity and to presumed relationship with treatment. Extrapyramidal function was assessed with the Simpson Angus scale (SAS), the Barnes akathisia scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Barnes 1989</xref>) at each study visit, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">NIMH 1976</xref>). Vital signs and body weight were measured at each visit. Standard laboratory tests were performed before the first treatment administration, at Weeks 3, 8, and 12. Treatment compliance to treatment was assessed by the investigator by counting unused tablets.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analysis was designed to test the hypothesis that the effectiveness of combination treatment with amisulpride and valproate would be superior to that of combination treatment with haloperidol and valproate after 3 months. To this end, a priori power calculations were performed to determine the target population size. A difference between treatment groups in the proportion of subjects meeting the primary endpoint of 22% was considered to be the minimum clinically relevant difference based on a previous trial with aripiprazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Vieta et al 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Vieta and Carne 2005</xref>). It was estimated that, in order to have a power of 80% to demonstrate such a difference with a one-tailed &#x003b1;-risk of 0.05, 60 subjects should be included in each treatment arm.</p><p>Three study populations were considered. The safety population was defined as all subjects exposed to at least 1 dose of study medication. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of study medication and provided at least one postbaseline efficacy measure. The per protocol (PP) population was defined as those members of the ITT population who did not present a major protocol violation. Since this was a superiority study, the ITT population was used for determination of effectiveness, as this is the most conservative assumption. Supportive analyses were performed on the PP population. Missing data were handled by the principle of last observation carried forward (LOCF).</p><p>Categorical variables were compared with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and quantitative variables with the Wilcoxon test or by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Two-tailed comparisons were performed throughout, with a probability (p) value of 0.05 taken as significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS software package (Version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki (Hong Kong Amendment), Good Clinical Practices (European Guidelines), and pertinent national legal and regulatory requirements. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject. Subjects were free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, without effect on their medical care. The protocol was submitted to and approved by the appropriate local ethics committee in each country.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>One hundred and twenty-six subjects were screened for inclusion and the 123 who fulfilled the entry criteria were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment arms, 62 to amisulpride, and 61 to haloperidol. The median number of patients included by center was 5 (range: 1&#x02013;25). Two subjects randomized to the haloperidol group never received the study medication and were excluded from the safety population. An additional subject in this group provided no postbaseline efficacy data and was thus excluded from the ITT population. The ITT population thus consisted of 62 subjects in the amisulpride arm and 58 subjects in the haloperidol arm. Major protocol deviations were detected in 15 subjects in the amisulpride group and in 3 subjects in the haloperidol group, who were excluded from the PP population. The PP population corresponded to 102 subjects overall, 75.8% of the group originally randomized to amisulpride and 90.2% of the group originally randomized to haloperidol. The major protocol violations detected mostly concerned deviations from the permitted time windows for study visits at Weeks 3 and 12 (10 violations in the amisulpride group and 2 in the haloperidol group) or use of prohibited psychotropic medication (6 in the amisulpride group; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Fifteen subjects in the amisulpride group and 23 in the haloperidol group failed to complete the 12-week treatment period as planned, principally due to the occurrence of an adverse event (7 subjects in the amisulpride group and 15 in the haloperidol group; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The number of subjects fulfilling this criterion was 45/62 (72.6%) in the amisulpride group and 38/58 (65.5%) in the haloperidol group. These proportions were not significantly different (p = 0.402; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test).

In the subgroup of patients with prominent psychosis, the number of subjects fulfilling the primary endpoint was 35/46 (76.1%) in the amisulpride group and 27/41 (65.9%) in the haloperidol group, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.292; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test).</p><p>No significant differences between treatment groups were observed for remission rates, response rates, or mean change in YMRS scores. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, 52 subjects in the amisulpride group (83.9%) and 52 subjects in the haloperidol group (89.7%) were considered to be in remission (YMRS score &#x02264;12); this difference was not statistically significant. Response rates at study end were 87.1% (54/62 subjects) in the amisulpride group and 93.1% (54/58 subjects) in the haloperidol group. Mean YMRS scores declined rapidly in both groups with no obvious difference in the rate of response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

One subject in the amisulpride group and 6 subjects in the haloperidol group relapsed into mania after having achieved a sustained response, all of whom belonged to the subgroup of patients with prominent psychosis. There was a trend toward a lower risk of relapse for patient treated by amisulpride during the 3-month treatment period (p = 0.055). A switch to depression was observed in 6 subjects in the amisulpride group and in 10 subjects in the haloperidol group (p = 0.223).

The incidence of adverse events in general and of extrapyramidal symptoms in particular was lower in the amisulpride group than in the haloperidol group.</p><p>The study used a composite primary efficacy outcome measure combining antimanic treatment response and study completion, because the extent of adherence to protocols in clinical trials in acute mania can be very low, with more than 50% of premature study discontinuations in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Licht 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2002</xref>). This renders the findings of such trials difficult to interpret, particularly when using classical methods for managing missing data such as LOCF. Restricting the analysis to subjects who complete the study thus increases the robustness of the results. Nonetheless, in the present study, discontinuation rates were relatively low, 24% in the amisulpride group and 38% in the haloperidol group. Since the emergence of adverse events was the principal driver of nonadherence, the better-tolerated amisulpride was associated with better adherence. This has important consequences for effectiveness of treatment in everyday clinical practice where patient follow-up may be less intensive than in a randomized clinical trial.</p><p>The response rate in the haloperidol group from this study was similar to that observed in the combination treatment group (70%) in a previous study of haloperidol or perazine combined with valproate versus valproate alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Muller-Oerlinghausen et al 2000</xref>). The decrease in YMRS score observed was rather larger than that reported for the haloperidol group in a study of adjunctive risperidone versus haloperidol in combination with lithium or valproate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Sachs et al 2002</xref>). Treatment responses in the amisulpride and valproate group were of comparable magnitude to those reported in previous trials of other atypical antipsychotics combined with lithium or valproate in the treatment of acute mania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Sachs et al 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Tohen et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Yatham et al 2004</xref>).</p><p>Comparable efficacy between the two treatment groups was observed across all efficacy end-points evaluated, supporting the robustness and consistency of the findings. Although superiority of amisulpride over haloperidol was not demonstrated, both drugs had notably high response rates. In a comparative study of olanzapine and haloperidol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Tohen et al 2003</xref>), olanzapine did not differ from haloperidol in achieving overall remission of bipolar mania. In another monotherapy trial, comparing aripiprazole with haloperidol, the atypical antipsychotic did prove to be superior using the same measure of effectiveness as this one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Vieta et al 2005a</xref>). However, in this study anticholinergic medication was not allowed and this caused a high number of drop-outs in the haloperidol arm, thus reducing the number of patients achieving the end-point.</p><p>No difference between treatments in terms of switch to depression or relapse into mania was observed, which concerned a relatively small number of subjects (no more than 10 per group). However, the frequency of switch to depression appeared to be in favor of the amisulpride group (11.3% vs 19.0%). Switch to depression in either treatment group was independent of baseline MADRS depression symptoms scores. Given the potential antidepressant effect of amisulpride observed in other patient groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Montgomery 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Peuskens et al 2002</xref>), this merits a dedicated study in bipolar depression.</p><p>The difference between the two treatment groups in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms is consistent with what is known of the comparative tolerability of amisulpride and haloperidol in schizophrenia. Antiparkinsonian medication was required by 55.2% of subjects receiving haloperidol compared to 19.4% of those receiving amisulpride. These data can be compared with the proportions of patients requiring such medication in the risperidone (17%) and haloperidol (38%) arms of the earlier valproate combination study of these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Sachs et al 2002</xref>). There was no obvious specific tolerability issue associated with amisulpride treatment. The adverse event profile of amisulpride was consistent with that described in clinical trials in patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Rein et al 2000</xref>). Overall, the observation of similar efficacy to haloperidol, with improved tolerability, is consistent with data from clinical trials comparing other atypical antipsychotics to haloperidol in acute mania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Scherk et al 2007</xref>).</p><p>Concerns have been raised about the poor generalizability of many trials in the field of bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Vieta and Carne 2005</xref>). This trial tried to overcome such concerns with a pragmatic design which imposed fewer constraints on patients and stipulated less stringent entry criteria. Anticholinergic drugs were thus allowed, and all patients received valproate. Nonetheless, inspection of the characteristics of included patients revealed that the patients were typically middle-aged, with a mean duration of illness of 12.6 years and experiencing relatively frequent and recent mood episodes. Typically, patients had been previously treated with, and presumably responded to, valproate rather than lithium. It will be important to determine whether the results can be replicated in patients who are responsive to lithium, in patients with earlier disease, and in patients not treated with a mood stabilizer.</p><p>The study has a number of limitations. Firstly, the absence of a placebo group precludes estimation of the absolute size of the treatment effect. However, the adoption of a placebo arm may limit inclusion into the study to less severely ill patients and thus restrict the generalizability of the findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Vieta and Carne 2005</xref>). This limitation needs to be addressed in future studies by comparing outcome in patients receiving mood stabilizers alone with that in patients treated with mood stabilizers and adjunctive amisulpride treatment. Secondly, the open design introduces possible bias from the expectations of patients or investigators, although randomization should to some extent reduce the potential sources of bias inherent in open studies. Thirdly, although it matched what was anticipated in the a priori power calculations, the sample size was rather small, particularly considering the rates of premature study discontinuation (31.7%) and of major protocol violations (15.0%). For this reason, potentially relevant trends towards inter-group differences in secondary outcome measures, such as relapse into a new manic episode or change in depressive symptoms, could not be confirmed. In future studies of this type, it would be important to include more patients per group in order to address a wider variety of outcome measures. A related limitation concerns the duration of the study. Although a 12-week duration conforms to contemporary methodological guidelines for clinical trial design in acute mania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">European Medicines Agency 2007</xref>) and seems justified in an initial study, it does not allow the potential long-term benefit of treatment in preventing future mood episodes. A longer study duration would be necessary to confirm or refute the observed trend towards more effective relapse prevention in patients receiving amisulpride.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomized comparative study of amisulpride for the treatment of acute mania. Although the size and goals of the study were relatively modest, it yielded encouraging information on the potential benefit provided by amisulpride in this patient population and opens perspectives for future studies aimed at clarifying the role of this antipsychotic in the treatment of mania. As well as benchmarking the treatment effect size for monotherapy with mood stabilizers, or possibly for other atypical antipsychotic drugs, such studies should address the use of amisulpride for preventing manic relapse, efficacy for functional outcome, and quality of life, collection of data for relatives or carers, and possible differential efficacy in different patient groups.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that combination treatment with amisulpride and valproate represents a relatively effective and well-tolerated treatment option for acute mania.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the principal investigators of all participating study centers and their teams for their enthusiastic contribution to this project:</p><p><bold>Czech Republic:</bold> Dr J Tomanova (Brno-Bohunice); Dr L Hosak (Hradec Kr&#x000e1;lov&#x000e9;); Dr D Seifertova (Praha 8 &#x02013; 1); Dr T Petranova (Plzen-Lochot&#x000ed;n); Dr J Boucek (Olomouc); Dr V Hanuskova (Opava); Dr P Navratil (Praha 6); Dr V Burian (Tabor); Dr L Macak (Tabor). <bold>France:</bold> Pr P Thomas (Lille); Dr G Ruetsch (Poitiers); Dr J-A Meynard (La Rochelle); Dr M Cazenave (Bordeaux); Dr J Louvrier (Bully Les Mines); Dr GP Badet (Dijon); Dr M Abbar (N&#x000ee;mes); Dr J-C Samuelian (Marseille); Dr J Palazzolo (Nice); Dr B Millet (Rennes); Dr G Allio (Sotteville Les Rouen). <bold>Poland:</bold> Dr I Krupka Matuszczyk (Katowice); Dr H Marmurowska (Lublin); Dr J Landowski (Gdansk); Dr M Janiszewski (Torun); Dr A Przewlocka (Krakow); Dr J Bukowski (Gorlice). <bold>Slovakia:</bold> Dr P Cernak (Pezinok); Dr E Palova (Kosice); Dr L Nabelek (Bansk&#x000e1; Bystrica); Dr L.
