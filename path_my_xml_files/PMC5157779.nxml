<bold>Objective:</bold> To test the effectiveness of a targeted print&#x02010;based intervention to improve screening adherence in first degree relatives of people with colorectal cancer (CRC).</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> People with CRC and their adult first degree relatives were identified through a population&#x02010;based cancer registry and randomly allocated as a family unit to the intervention or control condition. The control group received general information about CRC screening. The intervention group received printed advice regarding screening that was targeted to their risk level. Screening adherence was assessed at baseline and at 12 months via self report.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> 752 (25%) index cases and 574 (34%) eligible first degree relatives consented to take part in the trial and completed baseline interviews. At 12 months, 58% of first degree relatives in the control group and 61% in the intervention group were adherent to screening guidelines (mixed effects logistic regression group by time interaction effect =2.7; 95%CI=1.2&#x02013;5.9; P=0.013). Subgroup analysis indicated that the intervention was only effective for those with the lowest risk.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Provision of personalised risk information may have a modest effect on adherence to CRC screening recommendations among first degree relatives of people diagnosed with CRC.</p><p>
<bold>Implications</bold>
<bold>:</bold> Improved strategies for identifying and engaging first degree relatives are needed to maximise the population impact of the intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="azph12579-kwd-0001">colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd id="azph12579-kwd-0002">bowel cancer</kwd><kwd id="azph12579-kwd-0003">population screening</kwd><kwd id="azph12579-kwd-0004">Fecal Occult Blood Test</kwd><kwd id="azph12579-kwd-0005">targeted advice</kwd><kwd id="azph12579-kwd-0006">familial risk</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="25"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="4529"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>azph12579</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:4.9.8 mode:remove_FC converted:15.12.2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="azph12579-note-0001"><p>The authors have stated they have no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>

</xref> Early detection through biennial fecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been shown to reduce CRC&#x02010;related mortality by 15&#x02013;25%.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">

</p><p>First degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with CRC are at higher risk of developing CRC than the general population.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> The level of risk depends on the number of relatives affected,<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> the age at which relatives were diagnosed,<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">

<sup>6</sup>
</xref> The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) defines three levels of risk for first degree relatives of CRC patients: at or slightly above average risk (Level 1); moderate risk (Level 2) and potentially high risk (Level 3). For those categorised at Level 1 risk, population&#x02010;based screening recommendations for biennial FOBT are applicable; more intensive forms of screening such as colonoscopy or genetic testing are recommended for those at moderate or high risk.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">

</xref>
</p><p>In Australia, the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) was initiated in 2006. This involves the mail&#x02010;out of an FOBT kit to people turning 50, 55, 60 and 65 years of age. An expansion to the program is in progress to enable biennial screening for all Australians aged between 50 and 74 by 2020.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> The NBCSP targets the general population and is not designed to address the screening needs of those with elevated levels of risk. The program advises those with a family history of CRC to consult their GP for screening advice, but does not offer specific screening recommendations for this group. This means that there is no systematic mechanism in place for providing targeted screening advice to FDRs for whom population screening recommendations may be inappropriate.</p><p>Studies indicate that many FDRs are not being screened in accordance with guideline recommendations. Ait Ouakrim et al. found Australian self&#x02010;reported lifetime screening adherence of 47% for FDRs at slightly above average risk.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">

<sup>11</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>There is some evidence to suggest that telephone or face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face counselling is effective in improving screening rates among first degree relatives of CRC patients.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">

<sup>14</sup>
</xref> However, such approaches may not be feasible to implement due to the costs involved. A mail&#x02010;based approach, involving targeted screening advice is likely to be less costly to implement, and if effective, more sustainable. One US study found that targeted printed advice was more effective than generic advice in improving screening rates for FDRs;<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">

A mixed effects logistic regression model that included group (control vs intervention), time (baseline vs follow&#x02010;up), a group by time interaction, risk category (1 and 2), age (under 50 and over 50) and sex, while accounting for correlation among individuals in the same family and within individuals over time was fitted to the data. The group by time interaction term assessed, using the Wald test, whether adherence at follow&#x02010;up differed between groups adjusting for any baseline differences. The intervention effect is presented as the ratio of the odds of adherence at follow&#x02010;up for intervention versus control group, relative to the odds of adherence at baseline for intervention versus control group, adjusted for other covariates included in the model, with 95% confidence intervals. A post hoc sub&#x02010;group analysis was conducted separately for risk categories 1 and 2 to determine whether the intervention was effective for each risk category. The primary analysis was conducted as a complete case analysis, where those without follow&#x02010;up data were excluded. As a sensitivity analysis we also undertook multiple imputation,<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">

It is also one of the few trials internationally that examine the impact of a registry&#x02010;based approach to improve cancer screening. Because of the number of test options available, the measurement of CRC screening outcomes is challenging<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> with most studies focusing on increasing the use of a single test type rather than adherence to guideline recommendations for people of different risk levels.</p><p>Our results indicated that the targeted intervention was effective at improving adherence at follow&#x02010;up, but this was a small overall effect, with minimal between groups difference at follow&#x02010;up. Further, post hoc subgroup analysis indicated that the intervention effect was only statistically significant for those in category 1. This may be due to the lower baseline screening adherence rates observed for those in risk category 1 compared to those in risk category 2. This finding may also reflect that targeted recommendation provided to risk category 1 participants was in accordance with population&#x02010;based screening recommendations. Thus, the information provided may have acted as a prompt or booster to other forms of screening information to which risk category 1 participants had been exposed to (e.g. via mass media, screening invitations received through the NBCSP). In addition the number of individuals in risk category 2 was small, thus there was low statistical power for this sub&#x02010;group analysis.</p><p>There are few studies with which to directly compare these results. A Cochrane review on the impact of personalised risk communication on uptake of screening tests included a sub&#x02010;analysis of studies on CRC screening. This showed that providing individuals with a CRC risk score or risk category resulted in greater uptake of tests than not providing this information.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref> However, the outcome assessed, screening uptake is not synonymous with screening adherence as assessed in the current study. Our outcome takes into account the potential for screening intervention to result in inappropriate increases in screening, and as such, may provide a better indication of the usefulness of the intervention. Glanz et al.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">

</xref> used similar recruitment and had similar numbers of FDRs in their risk categories and found that face&#x02010;to face and telephone counselling was effective in improving CRC screening adherence.</p><p>Overall, our results and those of Glanz et al.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> are discouraging of a strategy that sources FDRs through index cases listed in a population&#x02010;based registry. A mere quarter of eligible index cases agreed to their relatives being approached and, of these relatives, one&#x02010;third agreed to be involved. This recruitment method is intensive with many steps involved to approach the FDRs. Our study showed that in Australia, at least, the scope of this strategy to make gains in adherence to screening guidelines is modest. Over half the participants were adherent to guidelines at baseline and nearly four fifths had been screened for CRC (includes over&#x02010;screened). These rates exceed current population estimates<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">

</xref> and are in part due to the inclusion of FDRs under age 50 who are adherent by not having screening. Our results also suggest that FDRs may already have received and acted on advice or been sensitised to act by the occurrence of cancer in their relative. In line with this, the pattern of increase between baseline and follow&#x02010;up surveys in overscreening and of decrease in under&#x02010;screening was very similar in the control and intervention groups.</p><p>It is possible the procedure followed had unmeasured benefits for high&#x02010;risk FDRs who were excluded due to the urgent (ethical) need to send them targeted advice rather than risk allocating them to a control group with no intervention. Hence the benefits of the strategy implemented in this study are probably greater than we report here.</p><p>Most of the study participants who were non&#x02010;adherent at follow&#x02010;up were over&#x02010;screened (having a test at a younger age than recommended or having a more intensive test than recommended). This indicates that different strategies may be needed to shift those who are due/overdue for a test compared to those who are over&#x02010;screened due to age or test type. There is a paucity of research on reducing rates of over&#x02010;screening. However, in the context of limited health care resources, this is an important focus for future research. For example, one recent study assessed colonoscopy waiting times in public hospitals in South Australia for patients who had returned a positive FOBT through the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. Results indicated that only 23% of cases underwent colonoscopy within the 30&#x02010;day benchmark.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> It is likely that the proportion of patients with a positive FOBT who receive a colonoscopy within recommended time frames could be increased by reducing inappropriate screening colonoscopies.</p><sec id="azph12579-sec-0150"><title>Limitations</title><p>Selection bias may have operated at two levels: the modest consent rate of index cases (25%) completing the baseline interview and subsequently, the consent rate of first degree relatives referred to the study by them (38%). It is also possible that there were biases introduced due to the two different methods used for recruitment of FDRs. In particular, where index cases opted to pass on the study invitation to their FDR, we had no way of knowing whether this information was received. Thus, the factors influencing non&#x02010;response may have differed by recruitment method. Due to recruitment taking longer than anticipated, we also had to terminate recruitment prior to reaching our target sample size. The consent rate was similar to Glanz et al.<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">

</xref> using a similar registry&#x02010;based recruitment method to contact FDRs. The loss to follow&#x02010;up at 12 months was 21% and was similar for the intervention and control groups; however, the overall sample obtained was smaller than planned, which resulted in the detectable difference being larger than anticipated.</p><p>A further bias to the study may come from the reliance on self&#x02010;reported screening history. Previous studies, however, have found high rates of specificity and sensitivity between self&#x02010;reported screening history and documented screening tests for both FOBTs (82% sensitivity and 78% specificity) and endoscopy (79% sensitivity and 90% specificity).<xref rid="azph12579-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">
