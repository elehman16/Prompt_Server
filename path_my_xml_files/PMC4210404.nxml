individual in a specific environment that affects the human body alignment or human body
position<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A posture can be described as
good or bad depending on the status of the body alignment. Good posture improves the growth
and development of the body, and it helps to promote a healthier life both psychologically
and socially<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, bad
posture that deviates from proper body alignment will overload a specific muscle or joint,
which in turn can cause deformation in the human body structure. The resulting deformation
in human body structure may also cause malfunctioning of the musculoskeletal, respiratory,
nervous, or internal organ systems<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In recent years, it has become manifest that many people have deformation of their bodies
due to imbalance of the musculoskeletal system caused by bad posture, in particular,
inappropriate working postures. Manual therapy and exercise are recommended to treat the
deformation of the body that is caused by poor posture. There are studies in progress to
examine the effects of manual therapy and exercise treatments.</p><p>Manual therapy promotes the mobility of motion to eliminate pain. Such treatments must be
done by trained therapists in order to mitigate the causes of the problem. The advantage of
manual therapy is that it can help to reduce the problem of malfunction immediately<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In agreement with this, Park<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> said that manual therapy is effective for
body correction. Byun<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> also stated that
chiropractic is effective in the treatment of scoliosis. However, the disadvantage of manual
therapy is that it must be performed by expert therapists, and even when it is done by an
expert therapist, if the techniques are not performed properly, it can cause severe injury
to tissue and other structures<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Posture correction by exercise requires more time but is safer and can be done by the
patients themselves at home. Hence, much research has been done regarding posture correction
through exercise. Many studies have been performed concerning the effects of stretching as a
means of posture correction<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, the effects
of yoga on deformed pelvis correction<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>,
the effects of pilates on posture correction<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the effects of ballet on posture correction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. These studies have demonstrated that
exercise does have positive effects on posture correction. Most of these studies were based
on treatment principles related to the relaxation of contracted muscles.</p><p>However, posture correction can also be done by stretching contracted muscles, and through
exercise that strengthens the weaker muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, existing research on the effects of muscle
strengthening exercises on posture is insufficient.</p><p>Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an exercise program
consisting of some basic TaeKwonDo movements to strengthen muscles for posture correction.
TaeKwonDo is a popular sport in Korea for promoting a healthier body. Although the Seogi,
Makki, Chigi, and Jireugi postures in TaeKwonDo are muscle strengthening exercises, there is
no exercise program which specifically addresses posture correction. Therefore, this study
also examined the efficacy of an exercise program utilizing basic TaeKwonDo movements on
posture correction to provide basic information on rehabilitation programs employing basic
TaeKwonDo movements in order to improve health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were students attending a TaeKwonDo learning center in Busan.
They were grade students attending an elementary school who had attained TaeKwonDo level 2
or higher, who had a differences in shoulder height or leg length. They were informed of the
purpose of this study and joined voluntarily. This study complied with the ethical standards
of the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was received from each
participant. There were 24 subjects altogether, and they were randomly divided into an
experimental group of 17 students, and a control group of 7 students. The average age of the
experimental group was 13.1&#x02005;years, their average height was 147.6&#x02005;cm, and their average
weight was 44.4&#x02005;kg. The average age of the control group was 13.1&#x02005;years, their average
height was 150.0&#x02005;cm, and their average weight was 42.1&#x02005;kg.</p><p>A physical examination of each student was performed before the intervention. The
experimental group performed an exercise program consisting of basic TaeKwonDo movements for
8 weeks. The control group performed general TaeKwonDo exercises. After 8 weeks, the
physical examination was repeated to observe the effects of the exercise program utilizing
basic TaeKwonDo movements. The examination focused on the inclination of the neck, shoulders
and pelvis.</p><p>A digital camera (DHC-H50, Sony, Japan) was used to examine and record the posture of the
subjects. The camera was set about 2&#x02005;m from the subjects at a position where the subjects&#x02019;
images filled about 80&#x02013;90% of the camera screen. The height of the camera was level with the
chest, and a tripod stand was used to keep the camera horizontal. The pictures were taken
from the front and the right side where the shoulder was visible. The neck, shoulder, and
pelvis inclinations were examined using Posture pro 7 (PP7, Ventura Designs, USA).</p><p>For the exercise program, eight basic TaeKwonDo movements considered effective for posture
correction were selected. The exercise program employing basic TaeKwonDo posture-correction
movements included Olgul Makki (outer wrist face lift-up Makki), Batangson Arae Makki (palm
hand underneath pressing Makki), Olgul Yop Makki (inner wrist face assisting side Makki),
Momtong An Makki (outer wrist trunk inner Makki), Hwangso Makki (bull Makki), Meongye Chigi
(yoke chigi), Juchumseogi (riding stance), and Apkubi (forward inflection stance).</p><p>Each first level movement was performed for 10 seconds, and each second level movement was
performed for 20 seconds. After 10 seconds of exercise, 10 seconds of rest were taken, and
after 20 seconds of exercise, 20 seconds of rest were taken. A warm up exercise was
performed for 10 minutes, the main exercise for 30 minutes, and cool down exercise for 10
minutes, making a total of 50 minutes for the exercise program.</p><p>Because the experiment involved 24 subjects, the Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to verify
the normality of the data. A nonparametric method was used because the data were not
normally distributed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the differences in the
inclinations of the neck, shoulders and pelvis of both groups. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test
was used to determine the effects of the exercise program consisting of basic TaeKwonDo
movements on the inclination of the neck, shoulders and pelvis. For the analysis, we used
SPSS for Windows (Ver. 21.0) statistical software, with a significance level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results for the differences in the neck, shoulders and pelvis inclination between the

practices self-defense and attack using the hands and feet. The ultimate goal of TaeKwonDo
is to train the mind and body to live healthily<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. TaeKwonDo is a self-disciplining sport that involves skillful use
of the bare hands, and it gathers energy to concentrate the mind, so it can strengthen both
the mind and the body. TaeKwonDo is a traditional martial art of Korea and its techniques
include Poomsae, Kyorugi (sparring), Breaking, and so on<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is possible to develop a posture-correcting exercise program using moderate practice of
basic TaeKwonDo movements to strengthen the weaker muscles. This study examined the effects
of an exercise program employing basic TaeKwonDo movements. Six upper extremity movements
and two lower extremity movements that are effective for posture correction were selected
for use in the exercise program. The upper extremity movements, Olgul Makki and Olgul Yop
Makki, strengthen the upper trapezius muscles, lower trapezius muscles and serratus
anterior. Batangson Arae Makki and Momtong An Makki strengthen the pectoralis minor muscles
and lower trapezius muscles. When performing Hwangso Makki movement, the chin is slightly
pulled toward the neck to lengthen the back muscles of the cervical vertebrae, and then the
sternocleidomastoid muscles are also stretched. Meongye Chigi is a movement that strengthens
the middle trapezius muscles. The lower extremity movement, Juchumseogi, elicits eccentric
contraction of the gluteus maximus, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and adductor magnus
muscles. It also elicits concentric contraction of the quadratus lumborum, pectineus, tensor
fasciae latae, adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus, rectus femoris, and
sartorius muscles. In the Apkubi posture, the front leg movements elicit contraction of the
semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles, causing posterior inclination of the pelvis. The
back leg movement elicits eccentric contraction of the quadratus lumborum, iliopsoas
pectineus, tensor fasciae latae, adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus, rectus
femoris, sartorius, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles. It also induces concentric
contraction of the tibialis anterior muscles facilitating anterior inclination of the
pelvis.</p><p>Myers<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when the
sternocleidomastoid muscles, and the muscles originating in the scapula and inserted
cervical vertebrae cause imbalance, abnormal alignment is induced in the neck. Park and
Jung<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that in cases of round
shoulders, the upper and middle trapezius muscles are weakened. Golding and Golding<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Jung<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that when the sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, anterior
scalene, and semispinalis capitis muscles contract on only one side, there is lateral
flexion and rotation toward the opposite side. Kendall<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that contraction of the lower part of serratus anterior
muscles causes scapular depression. Park and Jung<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> said that contraction of the lower trapezius muscles causes
different heights of the right and left shoulders, and when the pectoralis minor muscles are
shortening, they elicit the coracoid process: and the scapula moves medially and inferiorly,
causing drooping of the shoulder. Park<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>
stated that when there is a shortening of the semitendinosus and semimembranosus, the
ischium is pulled inferiorly and anteriorly, leading to pelvic imbalance. Myers<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> mentioned that in the relation between the
foot arch and the pelvic inclination, the tibialis anterior muscles are functionally
connected to the rectus femoris and satorius muscles, and the iliotibial tract and tensor
fasciae latae muscles. So, contraction of the tibialis anterior muscles can cause pelvic
imbalance.</p><p>Taken together, it can be said that abnormal alignment of the cervical vertebrae, shoulder,
or pelvis are a closely related to imbalance of related muscles. TaeKwonDo movements include
motions that can strengthen the muscles that are related to abnormal alignments of the body.
Therefore, considering the fact that TaeKwonDo movements are helpful for muscle
strengthening, we concluded that if we could design an exercise program utilizing TaeKwonDo
movements that strengthened the muscles of the upper and lower extremities, it would be
effective for posture correction.</p><p>Accordingly, this study was conducted to examine the effects of an exercise program
consisting of basic TaeKwonDo movements on posture correction. The results demonstrate that
in the subjects who performed the exercise program employing basic TaeKwonDo movements,
anterior and posterior neck inclination significantly reduced from 10.2&#x000b0; to 5.8&#x000b0;, and right
and left neck inclination reduced from 2.9&#x000b0; to 0.8&#x000b0; after the intervention; shoulder
inclination was 1.4&#x000b0; before the intervention and reduced to 0.6&#x000b0; after the intervention; and
pelvic inclination also reduced significantly from 1.6&#x000b0; to 0.5&#x000b0;. These results show that if
the cause of abnormal body alignment is imbalance of the muscles, it can be resolved by
performing an exercise program utilizing basic TaeKwonDo movements.</p><p>This study presents a new concept in TaeKwonDo. The exercise program consisting of basic
TaeKwonDo movements is not just beneficial for maintaining health, or for recreation, it can
also be used for rehabilitation purposes. We hope that this kind of exercise program will
contribute greatly to the health promotion of the populace.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Solberg</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Plastic changes in spinal function of pre-pubescent
