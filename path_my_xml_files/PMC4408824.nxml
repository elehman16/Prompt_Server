different anatomical combinations, which culminate in a common feature: a single
ventricle is responsible for the systemic and pulmonary circulation. In most cases it is
possible to characterize the presence of two distinct ventricles - right and left - when
one of them is hypoplastic and called rudimentary and the other, well-formed, called
main camera.</p><p>Among the most common anatomical forms is Tricuspid Atresia, in its different
presentations, responsible for 0.3 to 5.3% of the congenital heart diseases, present in
approximately 0.6 of every 10,000 live births<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. With regard to the dominant right ventricle, the main anatomical
representation is the hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), which represents about
3.8% of the congenital heart diseases, present in approximately 1.8 to 3.65 of 10,000
live births<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>From the diagnosis in the neonatal period, different surgical approaches can be adopted,
according to the anatomical and pathophysiological findings, so that the dominant
ventricle becomes solely responsible for the systemic circulation and the systemic
venous return is delivered directly to the pulmonary arteries. A series of palliative
surgery is performed in a staged manner until the final stage, the total cavopulmonary
operation, which is currently performed by the extracardiac conduit interposed between
the inferior vena cava and the right pulmonary artery (RPA).</p><p>The occurrence of thromboembolic events in the postoperative evolution of the total
cavopulmonary operation can reach 20%. In a meta-analysis recently published<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, the incidence of thromboembolism found
ranged from 3 to 20%, with differences related to surgical technique, population
considered and accuracy of imaging methods. The demonstration can be given by the
formation of venous, arterial or intracardiac thrombosis, leading to death in about 25%
of patients, even when they received specific and immediate treatment<sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The etiology of thrombotic complications in patients undergoing the Fontan operation is
multifactorial.</p><p>Literature reports support the hypothesis that other factors, in addition to venous
stasis and low flow velocity contributes to thrombus formation. Among them, we could
note the presence of change in coagulations factors such as Protein S, protein C,
antithrombin III, factor VII and VIII.</p><p>Based on the findings of imbalance between the pro and anticoagulant factors, many
studies suggest that these patients maintain resistant to an anticoagulation or
hypercoagulable state<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>There is still not a consensus in the literature about the best drug in the prevention
of thrombus formation in patients in the postoperative period of total cavopulmonary
connection with extracardiac conduit, and the commonly used drugs are acetylsalicylic
acid (ASA) and warfarin.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>Primary objectives</title><p>1. To compare the efficacy of oral anticoagulants (warfarin) and antiplatelet
(ASA) for prophylaxis of thrombosis and thromboembolic events in the postoperative
period of total cavopulmonary operation with extracardiac conduit.</p><p>2. To identify laboratory findings: hematocrit, liver function and coagulation
factors in the preoperative and postoperative periods.</p><p>3. To identify and compare the viability of different treatments, as the clinical
features, adhesion, safety and social implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>1. To identify flow changes by the extracardiac conduit in children in the
postoperative period of total cavopulmonary connection, assessing the occurrence
of slow flow and/or auto-contrast, through echocardiographic study series.</p><p>2. To identify changes in the internal wall of the extracardiac conduit by
echocardiographic and angiotomographic serial examinations.</p><p>3. To identify the occurrence of subclinical pulmonary embolism (PE) by
scintigraphy ventilation/pulmonary perfusion.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The project was approved by the Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Hospital Research Ethics Committee - Syrian
Sanatorium Association, and Research Ethics Committe of the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo
Medical School (HCFMUSP) - CAPPesq.</p><p>This is a prospective randomized study, with a 2-year follow-up, with the inclusion of
30 patients who underwent total cavopulmonary operation with extracardiac conduit in the
period between 2008 and 2011. The follow-up was performed in the outpatient sector of
the same institution, with consultations and assessments carried out by the researcher
in the predetermined periods according to the study protocol.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were:</p><p>1. Children with heart with univentricular morphology in staged programming, for total
cavopulmonary shunt operation.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were:</p><p>1. Some aspect of anatomical or angiographic features that contraindicated the
cavopulmonary operation, including:</p><p>a. Main ventricular ejection fraction less than 60%, or significant impairment of
atrioventricular valve related to the predominant ventricle.</p><p>b. Serious anatomical alteration of the pulmonary venous return (untreatable)</p><p>c. Anatomy of severely unfavorable pulmonary tree.</p><p>2. Inability to perform outpatient treatment;</p><p>3. Any medical condition that prevented the randomization, for example, any indication
that the patient used necessarily one of the two drugs evaluated, or contraindication to
the use of them.</p><p>4. Refusal of legal guardian to sign the Post-information Consent</p><p>The age during operation was not considered as indication or contraindication factors,
being operated children of different ages.</p><p>The children, within the routine protocol of the institution, underwent preoperative
hemodynamic studies with cardiac catheterization and mean pulmonary artery pressure
measurements (mPAP).</p><p>The preoperative evaluation was consisted of two-dimensional color Doppler
echocardiogram, electrocardiogram and cardiac catheterization. Once they were eligible
for total cavopulmonary connection, and signed the informed consent form, patients were
randomized to Group I or Group II, following randomization list generated by specific
program.</p><p>From this point forward, the child was subjected to evaluation of demographic and
clinical characteristics, consisting of history and physical examination, and then
evaluated according to the study protocol. Data were recorded on a follow-up and
evaluation form. Depending on the group allocated by randomization, the patient received
warfarin (Group I), at an initial dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day; or antiplatelet drug ASA (Group
II), at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (maximum dose of 100 mg/day). Both were started at the
time when the patient was receiving oral medication, and until then, was to use low
molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) subcutaneously at a dose of 1mg/kg/day, once a
day. In the randomized cases appropriate for the use of warfarin, patients were kept in
use of subcutaneous heparin until the INR values reached 2-3.</p><p>In the preoperative evaluation (Phase 1), a two-dimensional color Doppler
echocardiography, transthoracically, electrocardiogram, and hemodynamic study by cardiac
catheterization were performed, as well as lab tests with dosage of liver enzymes, INR,
hematocrit, and factors coagulation VII, VIII, protein C. In the immediate postoperative
period (Phase 2), until the tenth postoperative day (PO) the surgical technique used was
recorded (whether or not fenestration and size of the extracardiac conduit), evolution
and occurrences during the period, transesophageal echocardiogram, electrocardiogram and
INR control would be performed.</p><p>The outpatient follow-up began in the 3<sup>rd</sup> month of the postoperative period
(Phase 3), assessing progress and clinical complications, electrocardiogram,
transesophageal echocardiogram and laboratory analysis: INR, hematocrit, liver enzymes
and coagulation factors: Protein C, Factor VII and Factor VIII. The evaluation in the
6<sup>th</sup> month (Phase 4) was similar to the one in Phase 3, however,
angiography of the chest was performed in this moment. In Phase 5 (one year after
surgery) we performed an evaluation similar to that in Phase 4, adding
ventilation/perfusion pulmonary scintigraphy. The last evaluaiton, two years after
surgery, in Phase 6, was identical to that one in Phase 5.</p><p>The collection of blood sample was performed by peripheral puncture. The sample
assessment methodology consists of coagulometric method for dosing Factor VII, VIII and
PT/PR/INR, Functional Method for Protein C and dry chemical method for dosing AST, ALT
and GGT.</p><p>The preoperative echocardiogram was performed by transthoracic two-dimensional color
doppler and postoperative examinations by transesophageal routes, Philips IE 33 device
(Bathel-Andover), with pediatric probe in children weighing less than 20kg and adult
probe in children with weighing greater than or equal to 20 kg, by a single examiner.
The evaluation of the conduit was performed in longitudinal and cross-sectional cut,
evaluating the flow by color flow mapping, and Doppler, with the thrombus evaluated by
two-dimensional method. The ventricular systolic function was performed by subjective
analysis and ventricular diastolic function by plotting the pulmonary vein Doppler.</p><p>Angiotomography was performed by two radiologists examiners. Iodinated contrast material
was applied at a dose of 1.5 ml/kg, and only one acquisition was made during apnea; two
minutes after contrast injection, without synchronization with the
electrocardiogram.</p><p>The ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy was performed after one and two years after
surgery. The examinations were performed with the camera flicker with two detectors,
equipped with a low energy collimator, parallel channels and high resolution.</p><p>Pulmonary inhalation tests were performed with radioaerosol closed system to prevent
ambient air contamination, using Tc99m-DTPA. The pictures were taken after 10 minutes of
continuous inhalation when it is expected that 10% of the dose inserted into the system
to be absorbed into the alveolar space in the lungs. Planar images were acquired with
128 x 128 matrix, with 350.000 counts per projection. The projections were carried out
in the anterior, posterior, anterior and posterior oblique and lateral chest
incidences.</p><p>Perfusion studies were performed with the same equipment, with intravenous
administration of albumin macroaggregates, labeled with Tc99m. The children performed
forced expiratory maneuver (Valsalva). The dose was 2-3 mCi, with the number of
particles not exceeding 500.000. In case of clinical signs of cyanosis, the number of
particles was reduced to a maximum of 100.000. Images were acquired in the same
projections of the inhaled study, accumulating 1000k counts per projection.</p><p>The interpretation criteria followed standardization scheme as guidelines established by
PIODED. The exposure dose for children was about 1 mSv per procedure.</p><p>Data were recorded on a follow-up chart being stored and analyzed periodically.</p><p>During the follow-up period, when identified the presence of thrombus or thromboembolic
events in patients using ASA, these patients were subjected to specific treatment.
Intravenous heparinization and subsequent anticoagulation were performed, and its
consequent end of the follow-up period was within the assessment protocol.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of all information collected in this research was initially
carried out in a descriptive manner.</p><p>For quantitative variables (numerical) some summary measures were calculated, such as
mean, median, minimum and maximum values, standard deviation, and one-dimensional
scatter plot graph was drawn. The qualitative variables (categorized) were analyzed
by calculating the absolute and relative frequencies (percentages), besides the
construction of bar graphs.</p><p>The inferential analyzes used in order to confirm or refute evidence found in the
descriptive analysis were:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Pearson's chi-square test, Fisher's exact test or its extension to the study
comparing the profiles of the treatment groups, according to gender, diagnosis, first

to investigate the factors that interfere in thrombusis-free-survival time,
including the drug used in the prophylaxis (OAC or ASA), the age of total
cavopulmonary connection (arbitrarily divided into: less than five years and greater

preoperative period (&#x0003e; to 18 mmHg), the presence of fenestration, history of
thrombus and ventricular dysfunction in every phases during the evaluation; survival
curves were constructed, and then, the log-rank test was used.</p><p>The results of these tests confirmed that the thrombus free time is not related to
the following factors:</p><p>&#x02022; Use of aspirin or OAC (<italic>P</italic>=0.156) - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figure 1</xref></p><fig id="f06" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Thrombus-free survival curve comparing the ASA group to the OAC group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-29-04-0595-g01"/></fig><p>&#x02022; Age group (<italic>P</italic>=0.471);</p><p>&#x02022; Diagnosis (<italic>P</italic>=0.960),</p><p>&#x02022; mPAP in the preoperative period (<italic>P</italic>=0.606),</p><p>&#x02022; Fenestration (<italic>P</italic>=0.477),</p><p>&#x02022; Ventricular dysfunction during preoperative period (<italic>P</italic>= 0.224)

and 24 months after surgery (<italic>P</italic>=0.409).</p><p>Among all variables analzed, the one that showed main influence on the occurrence of
thrombus in the postoperative course, was the presence of thrombus prior: thrombus
free time in children with no history of thrombosis is statistically higher when
compared to children with a history of thrombus (<italic>P</italic>=0.035) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="f07" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.2</label><caption><p>Thrombus-free survival curve comparing patients with history of prior

each group who already have these changed factors in the preoperative period, mainly
Protein C, which is an important anticoagulation factor. Serum Protein C was low in
33% of patients in the ASA group and 40% of the OAC group. However, surprisingly, the
number of patients who developed free of thrombus was significantly higher among
individuals with a deficit of this protein in the preoperative period
(<italic>P</italic>=0.047) than those with normal levels of this anticoagulant
factor, at the same moment of the evaluation.</p><p>On the other hand, serum factors VII and VIII levels had no influence on thrombus
free time in the postoperative period in patients evaluated with values of
<italic>P</italic>=0.550 and <italic>P</italic>=0.329, respectively. The
comparison of serum levels of coagulation factors evaluated in the postoperative
period can not be considered, as they were under strong influence of warfarin.</p><p>Among patients undergoing outpatient follow-up, five of them had lack of adherence to
treatment and did not use the medication properly. Clinical monitoring was possible
exclusively due to the researcher's urgent demand, with the aid of the Institution
social assistance service.</p><p>Parents justified the lack of adherence by giving some resons, including: financial
difficulty to pay for transport to attend appointments and check ups. Another reason
was the perception of good clinical condition of the child, leading them to judge
that the use of medication or any revaluations were not necessary.</p><p>Among these five patients, four were using OAC, and consequently, outside the
therapeutic range during the follow-up evaluation. Among patients on warfarin, the
INR value ranged from 1 to 6.4.</p><p>Among the 15 patients who made up this group (OAC) 14 (93.3%) had at least one INR
measure out of range during the follow-up period, and two (13.3%) had INR greater
than 4, which implies bleeding risk.</p><p>The occurrence of slow flow through the conduit, with the presence of high contrast
in varying degrees, was a relatively common finding in the immediate postoperative
period, five patients in each group (33.33%). However, the occurrence of high
contrast in extracardiac conduit, assessed by transesophageal echocardiography in the
immediate postoperative period, did not interfere in the free development of thrombus
(<italic>P</italic>=0.148).</p><p>Changes in the inner wall of the extracardiac conduit, described as a deposit of low
attenuating material visualized by chest angiotomography, has been found to be common
to both groups since the first angiotomographic evaluation, and can be visualized on

multicenter, prospective, and randomized study, with 111 patients in the postoperative
period of modified Fontan operation comparing the two primary prophylaxis strategies
commonly used: ASA (57 patients) and warfarin (54 patients), with diagnosis of thrombus
in 21% of patients using the former and 24% the latter. The patients were assessed by
transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and
24<sup>th</sup> months after surgery, confirming a high incidence of thrombosis,
regardless of the strategy used. In 2012, Manlhiot et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> studied the aspects of thromboembolic complications, and
thromboprophylaxis in the three stages of surgical staging of univentricular heart and
showed that the use of warfarin, as a prophylaxis, has a significant reduction in
thrombosis risk when compared to the use of ASA or absence of prophylaxis.</p><p>Comparison of the efficacy of the OAC and the antiplatelet agent is an old discussion,
and the choice of each drug, as well as their association, have been performed according
to the preference and experience of each group. A meta-analysis published in
2011<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> evaluated 20 studies
related to the subject, with samples ranging from 6 to 282 patients. Seven of this
researches whose prophylaxis were performed with ASA, three using only the oral
anticoagulant, and the remaining ten publications with the application of both, with
thromboembolism rate ranging from 0 to 16%, which was similar among patients regardless
of the strategy used.</p><p>The occurrence of thrombosis was more frequent in the first postoperative evaluation,
phase 2. It was when 26.7% of children using ASA and 13.3% of children using warfarin
use had the thrombus image diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography. Data
consistent with recent publications have also shown a higher incidence of thrombus in
early postoperative period of total cavopulmonary connection (no unanimity about the
technique with the extracardiac conduit)<sup>[<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>After a 2-year-follow-up period, the total occurrence of thrombosis was 46.7% of
patients using ASA and 20% of patients using OAC. Factors such as the age; the mPAP in
the preoperative period; the use of fenestration; slow flow by extracardiac conduit and
single ventricle systolic dysfunction, had no interference in the occurrence of thrombus
during the whole follow-up period.</p><p>Only the prior history of thrombus showed interference with thrombus formation in the
postoperative period. This fact is related to the hypercoagulable state of the children
with univentricular heart. Among the pre-stages of total cavopulmonary connection, the
thrombus occurs either by changing the number, as in the activity of coagulationg
factors; by hemodynamic changes and oximetry of the univentricular physiology; which is
a relevant subject of important publications over the past few years, and previously
discussed in this article<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In both instances mentioned above, the difference in the occurrence of thrombus between
the two groups was not statistically significant, probably due to the small sample size
of this study. It is difficult, however, to ignore the fact that the number of patients
who developed thrombi in the group using ASA, is greater than twice the number of
patients in the warfarin group.</p><p>Protein C is a natural anticoagulant synthesized in the liver as a vitamin K-dependent
protein. Once activated by thrombin, it inhibits the coagulation factors Va and VIIIa,
stimulating fibrinolysis. Thus, the deficiency of this protein is associated with a
thrombogenic condition. Just as the deficiency of this coagulation factor in the
preoperative period of total cavopulmonary connection, also in the postoperative period,
several studies have shown such deficiency<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and that there is a
gradual reduction in this deficiency with increasing follow-up time<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In our sample, 33.3% of patients had protein C in the preoperative evaluation. Among
these patients, about 90% were free of thrombus, showing that the Protein C was not a
protective factor against the occurrence of thrombus in the preoperative period.
However, it is not possible to evaluate the behavior of the coagulation factor in all
patients in this sample after surgery, since the patients using warfarin have
compromised results.</p><p>The safety of using warfarin in pediatric patients is a concern for all of us who deal
with this type of patient. In 1999, a comprehensive evaluation of 319 children aged 1
month to 18 years of life using warfarin for different reasons, followed up in a
anticoagulation center, found important data applicable to the population that we
studied<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>:</p><p>&#x02022; Children undergoing Fontan circuit surgery require higher dose of warfarin to
achieve an expected INR value;</p><p>&#x02022; There is difficulty in the management of anticoagulation in children younger than
6 years of age, requiring higher doses of warfarin;</p><p>&#x02022; The long time of warfarin necessity overlapping with heparin, thus the INR is
within the desired range; need for prolonged periods; more frequent dosing and need for
more frequent dose adjustments.</p><p>In our sample, five patients (16.6%) had lack of adherence during the follow-up period,
and its maintenance was possible only due to the researchers' insistence and with the
aid of the support staff, with four (80%) using warfarin, and consequently, the INR
oscillated out of range, with values between 1 and 6.4. Furthermore, in general, in the
group using warfarin, 93.3% had at least an INR value below the desired range, which
significantly increases the risk of thrombosis, as shown in a multicenter prospective
study already mentioned, in which, the group taking warfarin during the INR evaluation,
had less than 30% with INR greater than 2<sup>[<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Changes in the inner wall of the extracardiac conduit used in total cavopulmonary
connection is still being poorly studied, with sparse data in this regard. In our study,
during the 2-year-follow-up period, both the number of children with material deposited
in the conduit wall was higher in the ASA group (83.3%) and the thickness of the
material (which varied throughout the evaluation from 0.9 to 3.5 mm) was higher (more
than 2 mm). Images larger than 2 mm were not seen in children using warfarin at this
time, with <italic>P</italic>=0.082; thus, showing a tendency to affirm that the deposit
of materials, with increasing follow-up time, is higher in the ASA group. The material
described as material accumulation in a recently published study<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> was called large thrombus base, adhered
to the inner wall of the extracardiac conduit in 3 of 10 patients. The approach and
interpretation of the found material, brings up inmportant aspects for discussion, both
as regards the size and appearance, thus, tomography may be an important tool in the
early diagnosis of the thrombus preventing pulmonary thromboembolism.</p><p>The occurrence of subclinical PTE, releasing small emboli to the pulmonary circulation,
is a major problem in Fontan physiology, due to the decrease in oxygen saturation and
increased pulmonary vascular resistance.</p><p>The pulmonary scintigraphy is not routinely performed in patients undergoing total
cavopulmonary connection, which makes it difficult to compare. However, PTE was
diagnosed in two patients, both using ASA, after one and two years after surgery. Due to
the importance of hemodynamic compromise of the Fontan circuit in the presence of
pulmonary thromboembolism, strategies must be drawn in search of a practical and
reliable diagnosis of this alteration, and tomography would be a possible
option<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The low incidence of heart with univentricular physiology among congenital heart
diseases, coupled with mortality in the interstage period, significantly limits the
number of patients to be added to a prospective and randomized study in the
postoperative period of total cavopulmonary connection. The thromboembolic phenomenon in
the postoperative period of this procedure is very important, both with regard to a high
incidence and mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>1 - The occurrence of thrombosis was significantly higher in the ASA group, however,
this difference was not statistically different.</p><p>a - when we evaluated all the factors studied in the thrombosis-free-survival, we noted
that the only factors that really affect are the previous occurrence of thrombus
(<italic>P</italic>=0.035) and deficiency of Protein C in the preoperative period
(<italic>P</italic>=0.047).</p><p>2 - Hepatic function and coagulation factors:</p><p>A - with the exception of Protein C, coagulation factors and liver enzymes showed no
interference in the free development of thrombus.</p><p>3 - Regarding the viability of the usual prophylaxis for thromboembolism, neither drug
led to significant side effects and bleeding. None of the children had the drug
suspended due to intolerance.</p><p>4 - The flow rate is reduced by the extracardiac conduit and the occurrence of thrombus
was more frequent in patients with slow flow, without statistical significance.</p><p>5 - In the group using ASA, we found a tendency to a higher incidence of thicker
material accumulation (greater than 2 mm) compared to the group using OAC
(<italic>P</italic>=0.082).</p><p>6 - Subclinical pulmonary thromboembolism occurred in two patients, without any
statistically significance.</p><p>Patients with history of thrombosis, which will be submitted to total cavopulmonary
connection (Fontan type), should be maintained in the postoperative period, with the use
of warfarin. It is necessary to expand the sample numbers of this study to give
statistical power to the fact that twice as many children using ASA evolves with
thromboembolic phenomena, patients using ASA has more material adhered to the wall of
the conduit, reaching a thickness exceeding 2 mm, and are more likely to pulmonary
thromboembolism compromising the Fontan circuit, therefore, we suggest that these
patients, when they can afford this treatment, should be anticoagulated with the use of
warfarin in the postoperative period of total cavopulmonary connection. </p><table-wrap id="t14" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="box" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilites</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CFXP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study design, data collection, reference search</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MBJ</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study design</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">BJ</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study design</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PMO</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data collection</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">FMPS</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data collection</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">VMM</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data collection</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">RWL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data collection</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SRFFP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data collection</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was carried out at Instituto do Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o do Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas da
