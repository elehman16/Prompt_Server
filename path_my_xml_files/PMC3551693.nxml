The clinical efficacy and tolerability of LI10903F were evaluated in an eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in 50 human subjects with body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (clinical trial registration number: ISRCTN37381706). Participants were randomly assigned to either a placebo or LI10903F group. Subjects in the LI10903F group received 300 mg of herbal formulation thrice daily, while subjects in the placebo group received 300 mg of placebo capsules thrice daily. All subjects were provided a standard diet (2,000 kcal daily) and participated in a moderate exercise of 30 min walk for five days a week. Additionally, the safety of this herbal formulation was evaluated by a series of acute, sub-acute toxicity and genotoxicity studies in animals and cellular models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After eight weeks of supplementation, statistically significant net reductions in body weight (2.49 kg; p=0.00005) and BMI (0.96 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; p=0.00004) were observed in the LI10903F group versus placebo group. Additionally, significant increase in serum adiponectin concentration (p=0.0076) and significant decrease in serum ghrelin concentration (p=0.0066) were found in LI10903F group compared to placebo group. Adverse events were mild and were equally distributed between the two groups. Interestingly, LI10903F showed broad spectrum safety in a series of acute, sub-acute toxicity and genotoxicity studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results from the current research suggest that LI10903F or LOWAT is well-tolerated, safe and effective for weight management.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Adiponectin</kwd><kwd><italic>Dolichos biflorus</italic></kwd><kwd>Ghrelin</kwd><kwd>Human clinical study</kwd><kwd>LOWAT</kwd><kwd><italic>Piper betle</italic></kwd><kwd>Weight loss</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies indicate that obesity-related risk factors are preventable and even ameliorable through weight loss and long-term weight management programs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There are three major weight management strategies: 1) life style intervention such as diet and exercise as well as dietary supplements, 2) pharmacotherapy, and 3) bariatric surgery for morbidly obese subjects. While pharmacotherapy may be effective, it also has significant adverse effects and limitations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since obesity is associated with an imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure, a long-term lifestyle change including healthy diet and exercise in conjunction with effective weight management supplements may present a cost-effective intervention for obesity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In fact, informed consumers are increasingly seeking dietary supplements which have been shown to be efficacious and safe in promoting weight loss
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In order to develop an effective and safe weight loss ingredient, we screened extracts of more than four hundred medicinal plants for their ability to inhibit adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes. Among the candidate plant extracts tested, <italic>Piper betle</italic> leaf extract and <italic>Dolichos biflorus</italic> seed extract showed potent anti-adipogenic efficacy. These two extracts were selected for further studies by combining individual extracts at different ratios. A combination of <italic>P. betle</italic> leaf extract and <italic>D. biflorus</italic> seed extract in a ratio of 2:3, LI10903F also known as LOWAT demonstrated greater anti-adipogenic as well as lipolytic activities compared to the individual extracts.</p><p>Here we report the <italic>in vitro</italic> development of LI10903F or LOWAT and the results of its safety studies. In addition, we present the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrating the tolerability and short term efficacy of LI10903F on body weight management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><sec><title><italic>Piper Betle</italic></title><p>The dried plant material (1kg) of <italic>Piper Betle</italic> leaves was pulverized to course powder and extracted with 60% alcohol at 70&#x000b0;C for 2h.

A standard diet (2,000 kcal daily) was provided (breakfast, lunch and dinner) deriving 61% kcal from carbohydrate, 14% from protein and 25% from fat. The subjects were required to walk 30 min, five days a week under the supervision of a physical trainer. The subjects were instructed to take 3 capsules a day, one each 30 min before breakfast, lunch and dinner. All subjects completed a medical history questionnaire at baseline and compliance reports during follow-up evaluations at 14, 28 and 56 days. Subjects were assessed for body weight, height, waist plus hip circumference and vital signs at baseline and subsequent follow-up visits. At all study visits, blood samples were collected for hematological and biochemical evaluations, and urine samples for urinalysis. Reduction in body weight and BMI were considered as the primary study outcome parameters of the study. Sample size calculations were done using power analysis based on previous obesity study report

In all doses including the highest dose of 5000 &#x003bc;g/ml, the mutant frequency was below 1.5. According to the OECD guidelines, these observations indicate that LI110903 is non-mutagenic. This herbal formulation did not affect mitotic index at up to the dose of 5000 &#x003bc;g/ml, and also failed to induce structural chromosomal damage in the immature erythrocytes. In addition, micronucleus test conducted in mammalian erythrocytes demonstrates that LI10903F is not cytotoxic at the highest dose level at 2000 mg/kg.

We found that extracts from <italic>P. bettle</italic> leaves and <italic>D. biflorus</italic> seeds blended in a ratio of 2:3, and exhibited potent <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-adipogenic and lipolysis promoting activities. We then conducted a series of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> safety studies that demonstrated this herbal formulation LI10903F or LOWAT is safe, non-mutagenic and non-genotoxic with an acute oral LD<sub>50</sub> of &#x0003e; 5,000 mg/kg and NOAEL &#x0003e; 2,500 mg/kg body weight. Interestingly, LI10903F also passed through other safety studies conducted for acute dermal toxicity, primary dermal irritation, and primary eye irritation in various animal models (unpublished observation). These findings encouraged and led us to conclude that the herbal formulation was safe, and can be evaluated for its weight management efficacy in human clinical trials.</p><p>The efficacy and tolerability of this herbal blend was evaluated in a randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical study in overweight and obese subjects (clinical trial registration number: ISRCTN37381706). Our observations from this study are that the herbal blend, when supplemented together with a standard diet and moderate daily exercise, promotes a significantly higher reduction of body weight and BMI than food management and exercise alone. In the clinical study, subjects received a 900mg daily dose of either LI10903F or placebo for 8 weeks. At the end of the study, the herbal formulation supplemented subjects experienced a greater reduction in body weight (2.4-fold) and BMI (2.37-fold) than placebo. This higher net loss of body weight can be attributed to the herbal blend supplementation rather than to dietary alteration or moderate exercise. This is because all the subjects followed a standard calorie diet of 2,000 kcal per day as opposed to being placed on a hypocaloric diet
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. By taking this approach, we wanted to mitigate the failure of individuals to comply with their dietary restrictions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that the results derived from this study are generally applicable to situations in which individuals adapt a more healthy living style that includes moderate exercise and diet control.</p><p>We also observed a significant reduction in body weight and BMI as early as four weeks in herbal supplemented group. A significantly higher 3.0-fold reduction of triglycerides was also observed in the herbal group versus the placebo at 8 weeks. In addition, it is interesting to observe that the other lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, LDL and HDL were noticeably improved in the herbal formulation supplemented group in comparison with the placebo. These improvements are not statistically significant. We have noticed high standard error values in placebo and treatment groups; this might be a possible reason for failure to achieve the statistically better improvements in such parameters. We believe that further clinical study with larger group sizes can definitely address this issue. However, this improvement in blood lipid profile may be a secondary beneficial effect of weight loss
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies report that adiponectin, an adipokine hormone predominantly secreted by white adipose tissue (WAT) plays an important role in pathogenesis of obesity and type II diabetes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Circulating adiponectin levels are lower in subjects with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases than those of healthy control subjects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. At the end of the present study, we found that the serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher in subjects supplemented with LI10903F than with placebo. This result provides a mechanistic basis for the effects of the herbal formulation on body fat metabolism. Interestingly, at the end of the study we also observed that the serum levels of ghrelin was significantly lower in LI10903F supplemented group than in placebo. Ghrelin is predominantly produced by the stomach in humans
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], it promotes glucose oxidation and lipogenesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Ghrelin is a key hormone involved in controlling hunger
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] by exerting its appetite stimulating effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Higher level of circulating ghrelin level is correlated with increased food intake and adiposity in both animals and humans
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In agreement with the previous findings our observation suggests that LI10903F or LOWAT might exert its weight reducing effects via regulation of food intake. In addition, our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments also suggest that LI10903F might reduce body fat by inhibiting the differentiation process from pre-adipocytes to mature adipocytes and enhancing fat mobilization from the mature adipocytes.</p><p>Overall, we did not observe any major adverse events from the use of the herbal blend. Only a few minor adverse events were reported and they were evenly distributed between the placebo and the herbal groups. There was no change in blood markers related to liver, kidney and heart function, nor did we note any changes in subject vital signs.</p><p>In conclusion, supplementation with the herbal blend at 900 mg per day resulted in statistically significant reductions in body weight and BMI that exceeded those achieved via diet management and moderate exercise alone. Its significant effect on body weight reduction was seen starting at week 4. Further, serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher in herbal group than in placebo, whereas, serum ghrelin levels were significantly lower in herbal group than in placebo. Analyses of various safety parameters indicate that the herbal blend appears to be well-tolerated for human consumption. We conclude that this herbal blend appears to be an effective ingredient for weight management.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study is funded by Laila Impex R&#x00026;D Center, India.
