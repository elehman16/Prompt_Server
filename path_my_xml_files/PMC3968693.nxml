Raised cholesterol is estimated to be responsible for 18% of cerebrovascular disease and 56% of ischemic heart disease. Overall, these diseases account for about 4.4 million deaths (7.9% of the total). Based upon the etiological factors and symptom complexes, hyperlipidemia can be considered as a part of <italic>Medoroga</italic>. Being a <italic>Tikshna</italic> formulation, the treatment modality of <italic>Lekhana Basti</italic> is aimed basically for <italic>Apatarpana</italic> (emaciation) of the body, as <italic>Basti</italic> is the fastest <italic>Apatarpana</italic>. In the present clinical trial, a total of 22 patients were registered of whom 19 patients completed the course of the therapy. Under randomization, the registered patients were divided into two groups of which group A was treated with <italic>Lekhana Basti</italic> and group B was administered standard control drug, i.e., <italic>Triphala Guggulu</italic>, for 21 days. The results of the study revealed that in patients treated with <italic>Lekhana Basti</italic>, there was a decrease of about 4.99% in S. cholesterol, 9.13% in S. low density lipoprotein (LDL), and 0.36% in S. apolipoprotein B. <italic>Lekhana Basti</italic> was found to have significant effect in reducing the symptoms of <italic>Medodushti</italic> and in reduction of objective parameters like weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, body circumferences such as chest, abdomen, hip, pelvis, mid-thigh circumference, etc., and skin fold thickness as biceps, triceps, mid-arm, and abdominal skinfold thickness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hyperlipidemia</kwd><kwd><italic>Lekhana Basti</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Triphala Guggulu</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyperlipidemia is one of a number of modifiable risk factors for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Raised cholesterol (&#x0003e;220 mg/dl) is prevalent in 60% population of 50-59 years age group and 55% population of 60-100 years age group in females in India, whereas in males it is prevalent in 45% individuals of 40-49 years age group.
