Its rheological properties influence the smooth operation of that function called mucociliary clearance.</p><p id="Par16">This clearance particularly takes advantage of the mucociliary transport (MCT) system which allows all secretions to be pushed by the ciliated cells towards the back of the nasal passages to then descend into the pharynx.</p><p id="Par17">The absence or deficiency of this self-clearing system of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses can constitute evidence or be the consequence of many diseases.</p><p id="Par18">The present study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of nasal inhalation of a medical device (nasal spray) in selected patients with chronic vasomotor rhinitis, a nasal pathology which is characterised by an increased mucociliary transport time.</p><p id="Par19">Narivent&#x000ae; is a natural compound with antioedema and anti-inflammatory osmotic properties mainly consisting of Mannitol, Glycerol and Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate.</p><p id="Par20">The treatment effectiveness was evaluated following objective methods, with the measurement of nasal MCT speed before, during and after treatment.</p><p id="Par21">During the recruitment and follow up visits, samples of nasal mucosa cells were taken by scraping, subsequently examined by optical microscope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par22">The study involved 79 subjects suffering from chronic vasomotor rhinitis with increased mucociliary clearance time from a minimum of 24&#x000a0;min to over 30&#x000a0;min, between the ages of 16 and 61&#x000a0;years, of both genders. The subjects were randomised into two groups of 49 (first group) and 30 (second group) subjects.</p><p id="Par23">The main recruitment criterion was the presence of chronic vasomotor rhinitis not associated with nasal polyposis but associated with a deficiency of mucociliary clearance.

The conclusions highlighted that the use of hypertonic saline solution promotes mucociliary clearance, but there is no evidence of a greater effectiveness compared with the isotonic solution or with other agents in relieving rhinosinusitis symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">In this regard, a trial on human nasal mucosa models carried out by Kim and colleagues shows that given the lack of a direct correlation between ciliary movement frequency in vitro and mucociliary clearance in vivo and the presence of contradictory results in the literature on the effects of irrigation with various concentrations of saline solutions on ciliary activity, the most important factors which determine mucociliary clearance are the quantity and the rheological properties of the secreted mucus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">This study also states that "the isotonic saline solution is the most physiologic irrigation solution in terms of cell morphology and mucin secretion from airway epithelial cells". Washes of distilled water or hypotonic solutions, in fact, harm the integrity of the cell junctions creating disruptions in the mucosal barrier, promoting the secretion of large amounts of mucus and decreasing the total number of ciliated cells, while the action in vitro of hypertonic saline solutions promotes the secretion of mucins, albeit without damaging the nasal mucosa significantly from a morphological point of view.</p><p id="Par66">The optical microscope analysis of the nasal mucosa samples obtained from 12 subject by scraping highlights the normalization of the after treatment nasal cytology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>-<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>-<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>
