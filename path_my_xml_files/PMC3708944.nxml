Communities were matched in pairs; communities in the intervention arm received enhanced community-based voluntary counseling and testing services; control communities received standard clinic-based volunteer counseling and testing services <xref rid="pone.0068349-KhumaloSakutukwa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These strategies were designed to change community norms and reduce risk of HIV acquisition among all community members, whether or not they participated directly in the intervention. The intervention was delivered in each community over three years (January 2006&#x02013;May 2011). The primary endpoint of the study was HIV incidence, assessed in a single, cross-sectional, post-intervention survey of &#x0003e;50,000 individuals in the study communities (September 2009&#x02013; July 2011).</p><p>To our knowledge, Project Accept is the first randomized clinical trial with a primary cross-sectional HIV incidence endpoint, and is one of the largest randomized clinical trials performed to date. There were several reasons why a single, cross-sectional survey was used to evaluate HIV incidence in Project Accept. First, the study intervention included HIV testing; follow-up of an HIV-uninfected cohort for HIV acquisition would have required HIV testing in both control and intervention communities which would have confounded the ability to detect the effect of the intervention. Second, use of a cross-sectional survey allowed HIV incidence to be assessed in a larger, more representative portion of the study population. Third, this approach avoided the bias that may be associated with enrolling HIV-uninfected participants and following them over time (e.g., from the Hawthorne effect <xref rid="pone.0068349-Brookmeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> or differential participant retention in different study arms).</p><p>While there were inherent advantages to using a cross-sectional approach to determine HIV incidence in Project Accept, this also presented significant challenges. When the trial was originally designed, the study plan was to assess HIV incidence using a single HIV incidence assay, the BED capture immunoassay (BED-CEIA) <xref rid="pone.0068349-Dobbs1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, as the trial was being implemented in the field, it became increasingly clear that the BED-CEIA significantly overestimated HIV incidence in some settings. In 2006, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS issued a statement recommending against use of the BED-CEIA for HIV incidence assessments <xref rid="pone.0068349-UNAIDS1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Since there were no available methods that could provide accurate cross-sectional HIV incidence estimates, the HPTN Network Laboratory and the Project Accept statisticians took on the challenge of developing alternate methods for cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation (see below). The Project Accept trial also presented significant challenges related to the size of the study. New methods were developed to manage the large number of study samples and to confirm the accuracy of HIV testing performed at local in-country laboratories. A pilot study that included approximately 2,500 participants was conducted at additional, non-study communities across the five study sites to develop, test, and optimize these procedures before they were implemented for the primary study endpoint assessment <xref rid="pone.0068349-PiwowarManning1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The methods developed for cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation in Project Accept are based on use of a multi-assay algorithm (MAA) to identify infections that are potentially recent (i.e., MAA positive) <xref rid="pone.0068349-Brookmeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A MAA developed for cross-sectional HIV incidence in subtype B epidemics has been shown to provide accurate incidence estimates in clinical cohort studies performed in the United States <xref rid="pone.0068349-Brookmeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. That MAA uses four biomarkers for HIV incidence estimation: two serologic biomarkers (the BED-CEIA and an avidity assay <xref rid="pone.0068349-Masciotra1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>) and two non-serologic biomarkers (CD4 cell count and HIV viral load). These assays can be performed using in a hierarchical approach to reduce the cost and effort required for the analysis <xref rid="pone.0068349-Brookmeyer2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>This report describes the methods used to determine HIV prevalence and HIV incidence in Project Accept. It includes a description of in-country testing of study samples, and quality control testing performed at the HPTN Network Laboratory to confirm the accuracy of in-country test results and determine/confirm the HIV status of study participants. Laboratory data were used to determine HIV prevalence and incidence. Because HIV prevalence was lower than expected at the site in Thailand, HIV incidence was estimated only for the four African sites. HIV incidence was estimated using a MAA that included the same four biomarkers as the MAA developed for subtype B (BED-CEIA, avidity assay, CD4 cell count, and HIV viral load), but used assay cutoffs that were optimized for analysis of HIV incidence in populations with HIV subtypes that are prevalent in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0068349-Hemelaar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The overwhelming majority of HIV infections in South Africa and Zimbabwe are subtype C; in Tanzania, while most infections are subtype C, subtype A and D infections are also observed <xref rid="pone.0068349-Hemelaar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The BED-CEIA and the avidity assay used in the MAA frequently misclassify individuals with long-standing subtype D HIV infection as potentially recently infected <xref rid="pone.0068349-Mullis1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. To address this, a subset of the Project Accept samples from Tanzania was subtyped to determine the prevalence of subtype D in those communities and assess its potential impact on incidence estimates. This report presents incidence estimates for the Project Accept sites in Africa. The primary result of the Project Accept trial (comparison of HIV incidence in control vs. intervention communities) is presented in a separate report <xref rid="pone.0068349-Coates1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants for participation in Project Accept.

A high proportion of the reactive samples (59% of the 110 samples) were from Soweto (2.24% of the HIV NEG samples from Soweto were reactive, compared to 0.35&#x02013;0.79% at the other three African study sites). The high frequency of reactive test results from this site prompted an investigation that revealed that a technologist working at site did not change pipette tips while preparing plasma aliquots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068349-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Based on these findings, HIV Combo testing was performed for all HIV NEG samples from Soweto that were processed during the period when the technologist was employed in the laboratory. The following approach was used to exclude samples that may have been contaminated: (1) the technologist was on duty that day and at least one HIV NEG sample had a reactive HIV Combo test, or (2) the technologist was not on duty that day (or it could not be determined whether the technologist was on duty), and at least two HIV NEG samples had reactive HIV Combo tests. Note that all samples meeting these criteria were excluded, regardless of their original designation (HIV POS, HIV DISC, or HIV NEG). Overall, this process resulted in excluding 1,710 HIV NEG samples and 292 samples that were either HIV POS or HIV DISC. After excluding for contamination, 58 (0.62%) of 9,314 HIV NEG samples were HIV Combo reactive, including 0.43% of the HIV NEG samples from Soweto.

Results from various laboratory tests are shown above the Western blot strips. HIV rapid tests were performed at a laboratory at the study site in Soweto, South Africa using whole blood; N indicates that both rapid tests were non-reactive, R indicates that both rapid tests were reactive. Samples were subsequently processed to produce plasma aliquots for storage which were later shipped to a central laboratory in the United States for analysis. Results from the ARCHITECT Combo HIV Ag/Ab test are shown (COMBO); N indicates that the Combo test was non-reactive, R indicates the Combo test was reactive. Samples were also tested using the Vitros EIA Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 and/or 2 (HIV-1/2) Antibody Detection in Human Serum and Plasma (EIA); N indicates that the EIA test was non-reactive, R indicates the EIA test was reactive. Western blots were interpreted as negative (N) or positive (P) based on the pattern of bands observed. The banding pattern typically varies among different HIV-positive samples. The panel on the left shows that samples 11&#x02013;15 were likely to have been cross-contaminated by transfer of plasma from sample 10 into those samples during aliquot preparation (sequential unintended transfer of plasma from tube to tube). Similar findings are shown in the panel on the right; samples 17&#x02013;19 were likely to have been cross-contaminated by transfer of plasma from sample 16 into those samples. Further investigation at the study site confirmed that a technologist working at the study site prepared sample aliquots without changing pipette tips.

As a first step, samples were tested in-country using two HIV rapid tests performed in parallel. Quality assurance testing was performed at a central laboratory. In general, quality assurance testing confirmed the results of in-country HIV rapid testing. Notably, quality assurance testing identified a problem with sample processing at one study site that resulted in cross-contamination of numerous sample aliquots. As a result, a significant portion of the samples from the site in Soweto, South Africa was excluded from the endpoint analysis. This finding emphasizes the importance of rigorous quality assurance testing.</p><p>Samples that were confirmed to be from participants with HIV infection were further characterized based on the stage of HIV infection (acute, early, or established infection). Acute and early HIV infections were considered to be incident infections. Very few acute HIV infections were identified in this study (among 9,269 samples with non-reactive HIV rapid tests, only 7 acute infections were identified using a 4<sup>th</sup> generation screening assay). This emphasizes the limitation of using acute HIV infection for incidence determination <xref rid="pone.0068349-Brookmeyer3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Samples from individuals with established infection were analyzed further using a MAA that was optimized for incidence estimation in Project Accept; development and validation of this MAA is described in two previous reports <xref rid="pone.0068349-Kulich1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This MAA has a mean window period of 259 days and was shown in validation studies to provide sufficient power to detect a 35% decrease in HIV incidence in the intervention communities of Project Accept <xref rid="pone.0068349-Kulich1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our previous reports also demonstrate that this MAA has an overall precision that is comparable or better than incidence estimates based on a simulated cohort follow-up study of 6-months duration <xref rid="pone.0068349-Kulich1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. One consideration in the development of this MAA was HIV subtype. Previous studies have shown that individuals with long-standing HIV subtype D infection are frequently misclassified by serologic assays as potentially recently infected <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068349-Mullis1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The MAA used in this study was optimized for analysis of HIV incidence in subtypes A and C <xref rid="pone.0068349-Kulich1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Because subtype D HIV is known to circulate in Tanzania, we determined the prevalence of subtype D HIV at the Project Accept site in Tanzania. Fortunately, the prevalence of subtype D at that site was low (9.7%) and was unlikely to impact the incidence assessment in the trial.</p><p>Another potential confounder in cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation is antiretroviral treatment (ART). Prolonged ART is associated with down-regulation of the anti-HIV antibody response, which can affect the performance of serologic incidence assays <xref rid="pone.0068349-Laeyendecker5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068349-Wendel1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The MAA used in this study characterizes individuals who are virally suppressed as MAA negative. However, even in the absence of viral suppression, ART may serve as a useful surrogate for non-recent HIV infection, since individuals are unlikely to initiate ART in the first few months after infection. For this reason, we tested samples that were classified as MAA positive for the presence of antiretroviral drugs; 29 (6.7%) of the 467 MAA positive samples had one or more antiretroviral drugs detected and were excluded from the incidence analysis. The infrequent detection of antiretroviral drugs in the MAA positive samples provides further support for use of the MAA to identify recent HIV infection; notably, 64.8% of the samples that met three of the four criteria of the MAA but had undetectable HIV RNA (&#x0003c;400 copies/mL) contained antiretroviral drugs. It is notable that a significant proportion (35.2%) of those did not contain antiretroviral drugs; those samples, which represented 0.42% of the 7,354 samples analyzed with the MAA, were most likely from elite controllers. Note that the MAA classifies all samples with low viral load as MAA negative (regardless of whether antiretroviral drugs are present), which is important, since elite controllers can be misclassified as recently infected using serologic incidence assays <xref rid="pone.0068349-Wendel1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>This study provides a model for cross-sectional estimation of HIV incidence in a large, randomized clinical study. This approach is likely to become more widely used, as HIV prevention trials move from longitudinal studies of HIV-uninfected cohorts to larger, community-randomized trials of combination prevention interventions delivered to entire populations. Strict attention to the quality of laboratory test results, and rigorous validation of testing algorithms for cross-sectional incidence estimation using large validation sample sets from relevant study populations are critical elements for this type of analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0068349.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>Table S1, Antiretroviral drugs detected by drug class among samples that were classified as MAA positive using the multi-assay algorithm.
