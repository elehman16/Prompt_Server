To determine the long-term economic value of HIMRT, including the costs of managing long-term radiation toxicities, a cost minimization analysis compared CIMRT with dose-escalated HIMRT using patient-level data from a randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and materials</title><p>Men with localized prostate cancer were randomized to CIMRT (75.6&#x02009;Gy in 42 fractions over 8.4 weeks) or HIMRT (72&#x02009;Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks). A decision tree modeled trial probabilities of maximum late bowel and urinary toxicities using patient-level data with a median follow-up of 6 years. Costs were estimated from the healthcare perspective using the 2014 national reimbursement rates for services received. Patient-level institutional costs, adjusted to 2014 dollars, verified reimbursements. A sensitivity analysis assessed model uncertainty.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cost for HIMRT and toxicity management was $22,957, saving $7,000 compared with CIMRT ($30,241). CIMRT was the common factor among the 5 most influential scenarios that contributed to total costs. Toxicity represented a small part (&#x0003c;10%) of the average total cost for patients with either grade 2-3 bowel toxicity or grade 2-3 urinary toxicity. However, toxicity management reached up to 26% of the total cost for patients with both high-grade bowel and urinary toxicities. There was no threshold at which CIMRT became the less costly regimen. Institutional costs confirmed the economic value of HIMRT ($6,000 in savings).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>HIMRT is more cost-efficient than CIMRT for treating prostate cancer, even when taking into account the costs related to late radiation toxicities.

The cost of toxicity management was minor compared with that of radiation. For patients with either grade 2-3 bowel or urinary toxicity, the average cost of toxicity management was less than 10% of the total cost (average cost, 5%-8%; Range, 0%-44%). Four of the 203 patients (all HIMRT) developed both grade 2-3 urinary and grade 2-3 bowel toxicities, and their average toxicity management cost was 26% (Range, 1%-63%) of the total cost. The average cost of treatment and toxicity management for HIMRT patients who had both grade 2-3 bowel and grade 2-3 urinary toxicities was still lower than the average cost for CIMRT patients with low grade 0-1 bowel and urinary side effects (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig&#x000a0;3</xref>). For patients who were treated with CIMRT and who had low grade 0-1 bowel and urinary side effects, the average cost of toxicity management was 2% to 3% (Range, 0%-51%) of the average total costs.

Radiation was the dominant component of total cost. Long-term use of medications also highly affected cost.</p><p>Generally, toxicity costs accounted for &#x0003c;10% of the total therapy cost. This increased to 26% of the total cost in men with both high-grade bowel and urinary toxicities. The development of such dual toxicities was uncommon (4 of 102 HIMRT patients). Men treated with HIMRT had a nonsignificant numeric increase in bowel toxicity compared with men treated with CIMRT (11% vs 5%) but not in urinary toxicity. Considering that HIMRT delivers an increased biologic equivalent dose of 85&#x02009;Gy at 1.8&#x02009;Gy per fraction (assuming an alpha-beta of 1.5), such toxicities were relatively rare and remained a fraction of the total cost. Furthermore, there was no cutoff toxicity probability that would make HIMRT more expensive than CIMRT in our sensitivity analyses.</p><p>Long-term symptom-management medication use can substantially increase the total cost of prostate cancer care. In men who were treated with CIMRT or HIMRT and who had grade 0-1 urinary and bowel symptoms, daily medication use comprised 25% to 51% of the average total costs. The majority of these medications were used to manage urinary symptoms. Notably, this subset of patients included men with baseline urinary or bowel symptoms that were unrelated to late radiation toxicities. Interestingly, although cystoscopies for urinary toxicities were less common than gastrointestinal endoscopies for bowel toxicities in this trial, urinary procedures cost more. Thus, maintaining low urinary toxicity rates also may be important in reducing healthcare expenditures.</p><p>Our study suggests that reducing the total radiation treatments and minimizing late radiation toxicities, particularly urinary toxicities, could reduce the healthcare resources that are used in prostate radiation. This is important when U.S. healthcare policy changes are directed at increasing the value of cancer treatments by reducing healthcare expenditures.</p><p>Several points deserve further consideration. Our dataset was limited to a single institution during a limited time period. Economic analyses typically use evidence from systematic literature reviews and reflect a lifetime interval to include all outcome and cost effects between interventions.<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> However, trials evaluating long-term prostate cancer outcomes and toxicities with similar hypofractionation regimens (70&#x02009;Gy at 2.5&#x02009;Gy per day over 5.6 weeks; 70.2&#x02009;Gy at 2.7&#x02009;Gy per day over 5.2 weeks) have only recently been published, with median follow-up ranging from 3.5 to 6 years.

However, patient preferences with regard to treatment duration, prostate cancer control, and toxicity to determine health-related quality-of-life data were not included in this trial, which was designed in the late 1990s before the emphasis on understanding patient utilities. An analysis from the patient's perspective would also provide data on the costs of hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiation that directly affecting the patient and would be the next step in evaluating the long-term economic value of hypofractionated prostate radiation.</p><p>Additionally, this cost minimization analysis was based on cancer control outcome, which was the primary trial endpoint, rather than on overall survival. However, this trial demonstrated similar early cancer control and survival outcomes between men who were treated with HIMRT and those treated with CIMRT, but this will need to be confirmed with additional follow-up.<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Given the longer natural history of prostate cancer, longer-term total costs associated with HIMRT versus CIMRT in this trial will be available with additional follow-up. One study estimated an 820 Euro cost savings benefit, without a quality-adjusted life year benefit, when comparing HIMRT with CIMRT using data from limited published studies in a Markov model.<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Our study is unique in that it captures true patient-level healthcare resources utilized in the management of late toxicity rather than an estimation of the resources utilized.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our study clearly demonstrates the cost-minimizing value of HIMRT in treating prostate cancer when compared with CIMRT. Furthermore, the robustness of these cost estimates, which used national payment rates, was confirmed with actual patient-level institutional costs. Our analysis shows that HIMRT was more cost efficient than CIMRT when considering similar prostate cancer outcomes. Provided that longer-term cancer outcomes are similar and that low toxicity rates hold as data accrue, HIMRT may be the preferred regimen for men who elect for definitive external beam radiation for localized prostate cancer in both the current fee-for-service health payment system as well as possible future bundled payment systems.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Cost analysis results indicate that moderately hypofractionated prostate radiation was more cost efficient than conventional radiation, even after accounting for costs of evaluating and managing late radiation toxicity. Moderate hypofractionation enhances the value of prostate radiation therapy when compared with conventionally fractionated prostate radiation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
