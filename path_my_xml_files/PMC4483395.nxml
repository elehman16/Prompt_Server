bilateral arm training and repetitive bilateral arm training on upper limb function and
activities of daily living in stroke patients. [Subjects] Forty patients with hemiplegia
resulting from stroke were divided into a task orientied bilateral arm training group
(n=20) and a repetitive bilateral arm training group (n=20). [Methods] The task-oriented
group underwent bilateral arm training with 5 functional tasks, and the repetitive group
underwent bilateral arm training with rhythmin auditory cueing for 30 minutes/day, 5
times/week, for 12 weeks. [Results] The upper limb function and the ability to perform
activities of daily living improved significantly in both groups. Although there were
significant differences between the groups, the task-oriented group showed greater
improvement in upper limb function and activities of daily living. [Conclusion] We
recommend bilateral arm training as well as adding functional task training as a clinical
intervention to improve upper limb function activities of daily living in patients with
hemiplegia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Upper limb</kwd><kwd>Bilateral training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke commonly causes loss of motor function due to weakening of upper/lower extremity
muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Ryerson<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, use the affected upper extremity decreases
because of the patient&#x02019;s dependency on the unaffected upper extremity for normal functions,
which results in problems such as learned disuse, asymmetric postural patterns,
contractures, and aggravated functional restrictions involving the affected upper extremity.
Therefore, to improve functions of the affected upper extremity in stroke patients, measures
that maximize opportunities to use the affectedupper extremity are necessary. Bilateral
activities have been discussed as measures to improve the body symmetry and to reduce
abnormal muscle tone<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, thereby promoting
voluntary movement of the affected upper extremity<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus far, bilateral upper extremity coordination movements have
been applied in the form of bilateral single exercises utilizing tasks such as figure
imitation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, robot arm upper extremity
mechanisms<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and functional
stretching<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and bilateral complex
exercises combined with the principle of motor learning, such as rhythmic acoustic<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, unaffected extremity weight addition<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and active neuromuscular electrical
stimulation in stroke patients<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most
previous studies have reported the positive effects of these exercises on motor function
recovery in stroke patients. Whitall et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when chronic hemiplegia patients underwent bilateral
training to push and pull upper extremity apparatuses, including acoustic signals, their
upper extremity functions were improved. In a study conducted by Summer et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> with 12 chronic stroke patients, the
movement time of the patients&#x02019; affected side upper extremity decreased and upper extremity
functions showed more improvement when they performed tasks to hold objects by stretching
both hands simultaneously then when they performed tasks to hold objects by stretching only
one hand. However, Lee Su-Jin<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> advised
that the tasks in those studies involved mostly gross motor exercises of the upper extremity
and simple repetitive training tasks, and that they were not sufficient to improve patients&#x02019;
grasping ability to hold objects with various sizes, shapes, and weights using the shoulder,
elbow, wrist, and fingers.</p><p>Although studies that applied diverse functional training tasks including activities of
daily living to symmetric bilateral upper extremity exercises have been conducted
recently<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, these studies are still quite insufficient, and the effects of
these new functional tasks on the recovery of upper extremity functions should be compared
with those of existing bilateral upper extremity exercises.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of symmetric bilateral
upper extremity exercises using diverse functional training tasks with the effects of
repetitive bilateral upper extremity exercises including acoustic signals on the recovery of
upper extremity function and daily living activities in stroke paitents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty patients diagnosed with hemiplegia resulting from stroke by a rehabilitation doctor
in the N Hospital located in Daegu, South Korea participated in the study. They were
randomly and equally assigned to a task-oriented bilateral arm training group (TBG: 11
males, 9 females) and a repetitive bilateral arm training group (RBG: 13 males, 7 females).
The mean&#x000b1;SD age, height, and weight of the patients in the TBG were 51.15&#x000b1;14.81&#x02005;years,
163.45&#x000b1;8.53&#x02005;cm, and 62.07&#x000b1;9.79&#x02005;kg, respectively. Eleven of the 20 patients in the TBG group
had right hemiplegia, and 9 had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 14.10&#x000b1;11.40 months.
The mean&#x000b1;SD age, height, and weight of the patients in the RBG were 48.65&#x000b1;12.81&#x02005;years,
164.10&#x000b1;8.11&#x02005;cm, and 63.80&#x000b1;9.26&#x02005;kg, respectively. Eight of the 20 patients had right
hemiplegia, and 12 had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 12.75&#x000b1;9.60 months.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: no visual field defect, no abnormality in the
vestibular organs, no orthopedic disease, an unrestricted range of motion, ability to
understand and perform the exercises as instructed by the researcher, a score of 24 or
higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean version, and upper extremity paresis with
ability to extend the affected wrist and fingers to at least 15 degrees. This study was
approved by the University Institutional Review Board and all the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to their
participation in the study, in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The TBG bilateral training with 5 functional tasks such as towel sweep on the table,
staking cups, positioning the cup upright, carrying a wooded block, and drinking water. The
RBG underwent bilateral training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC). Both groups trained
for 5 minutes and had a rest break of 1 minute. Both groups performed their exercises for 30
minutes each day, 5 times per week. Measurements were collected twice, before and after the
intervention, which lasted for 12 weeks. The main outcome measurements were Box and Block
test (BBT), Jebsen-Taylor test (JBT), and Modified Barthel Index (MBI) to determine upper
limb function and ADL ability.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20.0 KO (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, the
paired t-test was used to compare the variations in BBT, JTT, and MBI between pre- and
post-intervention within each group. The significance of the difference between the two
groups was investigated using the independent t-test. Statistical significance was set at
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both groups demonstrated significant improvement on the BBT, JTT, and MBI after the

exercises applied with diverse functional training in comparison with repetitive bilateral
upper extremity exercises including acoustic signals on the recovery of upper extremity
functions and daily living activities in stroke patients. According to the results of this
study, both the TBG and RBG showed significant effects on the recovery of upper extremity
motor functions and daily living activities. After implementing the exercise programs, both
groups showed significant improvement in the BBT, JTT, and MBI scores.</p><p>In a study conducted by Lin et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> on
chronic stroke patients who had had the disease for at least 6 months, the group that
performed bilateral upper extremity exercises showed further improvement in spatial-temporal
control of the affected upper extremity and Fugel-Meyer assessment scores than the control
group. In a study conducted by Cauraugh et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, 2 complex bilateral upper extremity exercise groups were able to
move more blocks than the control group in the BBT. In a study conducted by Brunner et
al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> with sub-acute stroke patients
that compared the effects of modified constraint induced movement therapy (mCIMT) with those
of bilateral upper extremity training, results indicated that bilateral upper extremity
training was as effective as mCIMT in the improvement of upper extremity motor functions.
According to researchers most sub-acute stroke patients were not required to wear a
restraining band during training of the affected upper extremity.</p><p>Similar to the above-mentioned previous studies, the results of this study indicated that
upper extremity functions and daily living activity functions were improved after performing
bilateral upper extremity exercises, which supports the opinion that when both hands move
simultaneously, instead of acting as separate units, they act as a unit, which is perceived
as a coordinated unit by the brain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
study also found that when homologous muscle groups on the left and right sides are
activated simultaneously by symmetrical bilateral exercises, the neural networks in the 2
cerebral hemispheres that are involved in upper extremity movement on both sides are
similarly activated<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, in comparison with the group that performed repetitive bilateral upper
extremity exercises, the group that underwent task-oriented bilateral upper extremity
exercise showed significant improvement in the BBT, JTT, and MBI scores. Given this result,
functional task training related to movement frequently used in daily life is considered to
have more positive effects on the recovery of upper extremity motor functions in stroke
patients than repetitive training using simple movement.</p><p>In a study conducted by Wu et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> on
the performance of stretching motions in chronic stroke patients, kinematically better
performance was shown when actual objects used in daily life were used when no such objects
were available. In a study conducted by Thielman et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, in the case of subjects with low functional levels, coordination
between the shoulder and elbow joints was improved when they underwent task-related training
than when they performed gradual resistive exercises.</p><p>Senesac et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study on
whether bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC) helped the recovery of
motor functions the affected upper extremity and whether the effects of the recovery of
motor functions would be transmitted to the performance of new tasks. The subjects underwent
BATRAC for a total of 8 times in 2 weeks, and the effects of the training were evaluated
using similar tasks and new tasks. Although the maximum speed increased in both tasks, the
training did not affect exercise time, speed up areas, or acceleration. With regard to such
results, the researchers presented a stated opinion that if the repetitive bilateral
training was composed of significant movement related to the patients&#x02019; daily living
activities, the training should have shown positive effects on the recovery of the patients&#x02019;
motor functions.</p><p>In this study, only the functional aspect of upper extremity exercises was evaluated, and
the performance of the exercises was not evaluated kinematically. In future studies, the
functional aspect of upper extremity exercises and the kinematic and qualitative aspects of
the exercises as well as the recovery in terms of neurophysiology should be evaluated.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, it can be seen that bilateral upper extremity exercises
applied with functional tasks are more effective in improving upper extremity functions and
daily living activities in stroke patients compared to simple, repetitive bilateral upper
extremity exercises. Therefore, performing symmetrical bilateral upper extremity exercises
which utilize treatment tools of different sizes and weights and movements involved in daily
living activities, can be used as an effective therapeutic intervention method in the
recovery of upper extremity functions and daily living in stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name><name><surname>al Lee</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of training on balance of hemiplegic stroke
