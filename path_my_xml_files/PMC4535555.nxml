Randomization was performed based on the procedural admission day. Robotic-assisted catheter ablation was performed on all PAF patients admitted on the second day of the week while patients attending on the first day and fourth day of the week underwent a standard catheter ablation. All scans used for the purposes of data analysis were deemed of adequate quality for analysis by an experienced CMR operator. Therapeutic anti-coagulation with an INR &#x0003e;2 for at least 4 weeks prior to the procedure was mandated. The study was approved by the local research ethics committee.</p><p>Acute procedural success was defined as isolation of all PVs, confirmed using a circumferential mapping catheter. Patients were followed in clinic to assess symptoms. Twenty-four hour Holter monitors were performed at 6 months from the index procedure. Every effort was made to obtain electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of symptomatic recurrences. Recurrences were defined on the basis of (i) symptoms with ECG evidence of the presence of any sustained atrial arrhythmia or (ii) the presence of symptomatic or asymptomatic episodes of atrial arrhythmia lasting for &#x0003e;30 s on ambulatory cardiac monitoring. All patients with recurrences were offered re-do procedures. The use of subsequent anti-arrhythmics following ablation was determined on clinical needs. The total number of re-do ablations and subsequent outcomes over 3 years are presented.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Magnetic resonance image acquisition</title><p>The CMR sequences used in a 1.5 Tesla Philips Achieva MR system (Philips Healthcare) to acquire the images have been described previously.<sup><xref rid="EUU364C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In brief, T2-weighted images were acquired via a multi-slice turbo spin echo technique with a double inversion recovery pre-pulse for black-blood imaging.

Images were acquired at three time points: (1) prior to ablation, (2) within 24 h of ablation; and (3) 3&#x02013;6 months following ablation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ablation settings</title><p>A three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of the LA was created using either NavX<sup>&#x02122;</sup> (St. Jude Medical Inc.) or CARTO XP (Biosense Webster Inc.). Wide area circumferential ablation was performed in all the patients. In the robotically navigated group, 30 s energy delivery with power settings of 25 W on the anterior wall and 20 W on the posterior wall with target temperatures of 40&#x02013;42&#x000b0;C were delivered. If LA-PV conduction persisted despite wide area circumferential ablation, additional lesions were delivered at the sites of earliest activation on the circular mapping catheter until entry block in all four veins was confirmed by observing the elimination or dissociation of PV potentials. For standard ablation, power was 30 W on the anterior wall and 25 W on the posterior wall, limited to up to at 60 s energy delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Image processing and analysis</title><p>T2W and LGE signal circumferential quantification were performed by reconstructing all CMR scans into individual left atrial shells using a semi-automated 3-D visualization method.<sup><xref rid="EUU364C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Areas of LGE or high T2W signal intensity were defined as being more than three standard deviations above the mean signal intensity of the simultaneously imaged ventricular myocardium as previously valated.<sup><xref rid="EUU364C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="EUU364C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The LA surface was colour coded according to the maximum-intensity projection values, ranging from green (minimum) to red (maximum).</p><p>For each PV pair, T2W and LGE were quantified as occupying a percentage of the antral circumference.

The main findings of this study are (1) robotic-assisted ablation results in greater percentages of permanent PV encirclement quantified on CMR; (2) there was significantly less LGE signal regression from acute to late scan in the robotic recurrences group, suggesting that acute energy delivery with this approach produces more durable lesions; (3)at a set range of energy delivery, more robotic points with higher LGE was observed in the scatter plot, suggesting increased catheter contact and stability; (4) and significantly lower number of re-do procedures were observed over the mean 3 years clinical follow-up period. These data represent the first CMR evidence in man that robotic-assisted ablations create more efficacious ablation lesions than a standard manual approach.</p><p>Recently, improved electrogram signal attenuation during catheter ablation has been demonstrated in robotic navigated procedures.<sup><xref rid="EUU364C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="EUU364C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Both catheter stability and constant energy delivery were deemed key in achieving bipolar electrogram attenuation. This CMR study demonstrating increased LGE in robotic-assisted procedures provides a mechanistic explanation suggesting greater tissue injury as a result of greater catheter&#x02013;tissue contact, leading to better electrogram attenuation. An approximate 50% electrogram attenuation achieved within 30 s of ablation in the standard group in comparison to 15 s in the robotic group was reported.</p><p>The findings of the Efficas studies strongly suggest that initial catheter contact force at the onset of RF delivery is a critical determinant of lesion quality, as assessed by the force time integral and lesion continuity index, with clinical outcome being predicted by the poorest quality lesion delivery and greater catheter instability.<sup><xref rid="EUU364C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This study supports this hypothesis by demonstrating a 10% higher percentage encirclement observed on the robotic navigation system (RNS) late scans in comparison with the standard group. A lower regression of the LGE signal between the acute and late scans in the robotic recurrences group suggests the creation of a more durable lesion. The narrower range in % encirclements in the robotic group infers less variability in lesion delivery, suggesting better tissue contact. While this did not translate into improved clinical outcome after a single procedure, a reduction in the number of re-do procedures and anti-arrhythmic agent use is observed. It is important to note that acute LGE imaging is less likely to represent true scar as there is an overlap of injured tissue as well as inflammation. Late gadolinium enhancement quantified on late scans represents a better marker for true scar as the inflammation settles and injured tissue become more defined.</p><p>The association between energy delivered and scar formation analysed on the 6-month LGE CMR scans was examined. At a set range of energy delivery, more points with higher DE were observed on the robotic scatter plot. We hypothesise that this is attributable to better catheter control and stability conferred by the RNS. The better consistency and higher reproducibility inferred from both the smaller standard deviation and the more closely placed points on the scatter plot imply a relatively a higher precision in lesion delivery in the robotic group in comparison to the standard.</p><p>The 3 years clinical outcome findings suggest that the overall higher LGE observed in the robotically assisted group translates into a significantly less number of re-do procedures. These findings corroborate a similar mid-term study outcome previously reported.<sup><xref rid="EUU364C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Durable tissue injury created by both better catheter&#x02013;tissue contact and catheter stability reduces the need for multiple re-do ablation procedures. The implications here on overall patient wellbeing and health cost-efficiency warrant a further larger study. The overall greater reduction in the number of anti-arrhythmics pre-and post-ablation in the robotically assisted group suggests a better modification of the atrial tissue, resulting in better symptom control even in patients with recurrences.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This is a small mechanistic study aimed at assessing the correlations between catheter stability, tissue injury, and clinical outcome. The true clinical impact of RNS-assisted catheter ablation on mid- to long-term clinical outcome would require a larger randomized study for validation of the findings. However, this was not the primary objective of this hypothesis-driven CMR assessment of atrial injury. Failure to detect asymptomatic recurrences of AF means that the incidence of asymptomatic AF is likely to be underreported in this study.</p><p>The correlation between contact-force and LGE lesion characteristics is not assessed here.
