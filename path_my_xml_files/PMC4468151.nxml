The aim of this study is to determine the influence of the inter-training interval on the magnitude of the intermanual transfer effects. This was done using a mechanistic, randomized, single-blinded pretest-posttest design. Sixty-four able-bodied, right-handed participants were randomly assigned to the Short and Long Interval Training Groups and the Short and Long Interval Control Groups. The Short and Long Interval Training Groups used a prosthesis simulator in their training program. The Short and Long Interval Control Groups executed a sham training program, that is, a dummy training program in which the same muscles were trained as with the prosthesis simulator. The Short Interval Training Group and the Short Interval Control Groups trained on consecutive days, while the Long Interval Training Group and Long Interval Control Group trained twice a week. To determine the improvement in skills, a test was administered before, immediately after, and at two points in time after the training. Training was performed with the &#x0201c;unaffected&#x0201d; arm; tests were performed with the &#x0201c;affected&#x0201d; arm. The outcome measurements were: the movement time (the time from the beginning of the movement until completion of the task); the duration of maximum hand opening, (the opening of the prosthetic hand while grasping an object); and the grip-force control (the error from the required grip-force during a tracking task). Intermanual transfer was found in movement times, but not in hand opening or grip-force control. The length of the inter-training interval did not affect the magnitude of intermanual transfer effects. No difference in the intermanual transfer effect in upper-limb prosthesis training was found for training on a daily basis as compared to training twice a week.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Nederlands Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3888">NTR3888</ext-link>

When applying intermanual transfer after an upper-limb amputation, the unaffected arm can be trained in prosthetic skills by using a prosthesis simulator, which is operated in the same way as an actual prosthesis. As a result, prosthetic training can start even before the wounds are healed and the prosthesis is obtained. Starting to train within the first four weeks after amputation is important, because it leads to better prosthetic handling and acceptance [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Intermanual transfer effects, after training with an upper-limb prosthesis simulator, have been demonstrated previously [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our earlier studies training sessions took place on five consecutive days [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which differs from most other articles on intermanual transfer where training took place within one session [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interestingly, in literature on training not only did the number of sessions but also the duration between sessions, that is, inter-training intervals, affect training [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In between training sessions, the motor skill becomes consolidated, which would seem to be taking place especially during sleep [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The time necessary for the consolidation, and thus the length of the inter-training interval, depends on diverse aspects of the task, such as its complexity [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although such an effect from the inter-training interval has been demonstrated only once in intermanual transfer [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it has been shown that learning improves with inter-training intervals lengthened up to 24 hours [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Studies concerning inter-training intervals only occasionally measure intervals longer than 24 hours [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the scant studies focusing on inter-training intervals in motor learning, intervals that are lengthened from days to months do not seem to further improve learning [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. More to the point, a decrease in learning is actually seen for longer intervals, which is also observed in verbal-recall tasks [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This suggests that there is an optimal inter-training interval, in which the consolidation of learning is highest [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of two inter-training intervals on intermanual transfer in upper-limb prosthetic training. Therefore, the presence of intermanual transfer and whether this effect differs between inter-training intervals has been tested by comparing the Short and Long Interval Training Groups with the Short and Long Interval Control Groups receiving a sham training program. The sham training program consisted of a dummy training (playing Nintendo Wii and playing darts) without using the simulator where the coordination of comparable wrist muscles was trained. We hypothesize that the inter-training interval of 24 hours will have a larger transfer effect than the longer inter-training interval.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0128747.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0128747.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty-four right-handed, non-amputated volunteers (<xref rid="pone.0128747.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) were recruited from among university students, and were assessed between September and December 2013.

The movement times for each of the tasks at pretest (mug, jar-lid, and pen-case) were used as covariates.</p><p>The <italic>duration of the maximum hand opening</italic> was calculated using Matlab R2007a. The angle of the hand opening was first filtered with a 20 Hz cut-off frequency using a recursive second-order Butterworth filter. To obtain the velocity of the hand aperture, the opening profile was differentiated using a three-point difference algorithm. The peak values of this velocity profile were used to determine the hand opening and closing. By searching backward and forward for the first value that was below a threshold of 2.5 cm/s and that stayed there for 50 ms, the end of the first hand opening and start of the hand closing were defined. The period between these points was taken as the duration of the maximum hand opening.</p><p>A mixed-design ANCOVA on the means of the duration of the maximum hand opening was performed to examine whether the groups differed, with test (posttest, retention test 1, and retention test 2) as a within-subject factor, training (Training Groups and Control Groups) and interval (Short Interval Groups and Long Interval Groups) as between-subject factors, and the pretest as covariate.</p><p>A mixed-design ANCOVA was performed on the <italic>error of the grip-force control</italic> with test (posttest, retention test 1, and retention test 2) as a within-subject factor, training (Training Groups and Control Groups) and interval (Short Interval Groups and Long Interval Groups) as between-subject factors, and the pretest as covariate.</p><p>When sphericity was violated, the degrees of freedom were adjusted with the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. A significance criterion of 0.05 was used during the analysis. Post-hoc tests on main effects tested all pair-wise comparisons. All post-hoc tests used a Bonferroni correction and the corrected values are described. Only significant findings are reported.</p><p>Two additional analyses were performed.

After training the &#x0201c;unaffected&#x0201d; hand, the movement times of the &#x0201c;affected&#x0201d; hand improved, which is consistent with the literature [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This intermanual transfer effect was not influenced by the length of the inter-training interval. Intermanual transfer was not demonstrated in the duration of the maximum hand opening or in the grip-force control. Effects of the covariate (pretest) showed influence on all dependent variables. The implications of these findings in terms of rehabilitation practice are that persons with an upper-limb amputation, who train prosthetic skills using intermanual transfer, can train at their own preferred pace; no additional benefit is to be expected from training on a daily basis.</p><p>Inter-training intervals which were lengthened to 24 hours positively influenced the learning of several tasks [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], including one that used intermanual transfer [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To better imitate rehabilitation practice, we applied inter-training intervals of at least 24 hours. The literature regarding these longer intervals is less consistent. It seems that with longer inter-training intervals the learning effect stabilizes and, at a certain point, even decreases [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This stabilization indicates that the optimal learning effect remains consistent over a range of inter-training interval durations. Thus, if our two inter-training intervals were within this stabilization period, differences could not be found. For persons with an upper-limb amputation, these findings suggest that training sessions on consecutive days or twice a week might give comparable results. Based on the literature, it might be that transfer effects decrease if inter-training intervals that are shorter (&#x0003c;24 hours) or longer than the ones in this study are used.</p><p>It should be mentioned that the Short and Long Interval Control Groups also improved over time in terms of prosthesis skills on the &#x0201c;affected&#x0201d; side, even though they did not train with the prosthesis simulator. These improvements are probably caused by having performed the test tasks repeatedly with the prosthetic simulator on the test side. From our findings, it is clear that the intermanual transfer effect does contribute to some degree to any improvement. In our earlier studies we found the intermanual transfer effect to be small [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The small effect is to be expected because the actual side that needs to improve is not trained directly, and, of course, direct training of an arm results in the largest effect. Therefore, the effects of intermanual transfer are expected to be small. Nevertheless, we assume the size of the effect to be clinically important, because, as a result of the training, a patient will start using the prosthesis at a higher level, and this may encourage motivation.</p><p>The first retention test of the Long Interval Groups and the second retention test of the Short Interval Groups took place on the same day. However, when comparing both tests on day 17, it might be expected that the Short Interval Groups will perform better, because they have performed the tests twice, where the Long Interval Groups performed the tests once. Therefore, we compared results of both first retention tests of the Long Interval Group and the Short Interval Group with each other.</p><p>What needs to be mentioned when focusing on the retention tests is that the optimal spacing of training intervals is also related to the retention interval. A meta-analysis study showed that in recall tasks with longer retention intervals, the inter-training interval leading to better training results appeared to be longer [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the current study, the length of the retention interval was about the same as the inter-training interval. We therefore suppose that the length of the retention interval influenced both inter-training intervals (short and long) in a comparable way. For persons with an amputation, who are training prosthesis skills using intermanual transfer, the retention test resembles the moment when the person receives his/her prosthesis. It may be possible to lengthen the inter-training interval (while avoiding reaching the point at which the effects decrease), depending on how long it takes before the patient obtains the prosthesis.</p><p>The intermanual transfer effect found on the movement times was not replicated in the duration of the maximum hand opening. We expected the duration to diminish over trials, as the performance of the participant improved [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our results might be explained by the occurrence of bumpy trials [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], where the hand is opened partly and then, before closing, opened further. More training sessions might be necessary to overcome the sub-opening of the hand and to find possible intermanual transfer effects. Thus, although the hand opening did not transfer, the improvement in movement time does reflect improvement in skill, and this might be relevant for how participants experience performing the prosthetic task.</p><p>The intermanual transfer effect and the influence of the inter-training interval on grip-force control were not present. In our previous studies on prosthetic handling, we did not find intermanual transfer effects on grip-force control tasks either [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Contrary to the previous studies, the current study contained specific grip-force control training. It is known that grip-force control with a prosthesis is hard to learn and takes more than five sessions, which may explain this finding [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It might be that more training sessions or longer training sessions are necessary to measure improvement.</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is the use of Control Groups executing a sham training program, instead of the crossover design applied in most studies on intermanual transfer [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The sham training program consisted of a functional part executed with the same wrist muscles as used during prosthetic simulator training. This made it possible to exclude the factor that training the coordination of the involved muscles in itself might be responsible for intermanual transfer effects. The results imply that training with the prosthetic simulator leads to the revealed intermanual transfer effect.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that the experiments were performed using able-bodied persons; measuring over 60 patients obtaining a myo-electric prosthesis for the first time was unfeasible. However, using able-bodied participants instead of amputee patients may have affected the results. After an upper-limb amputation, neural plasticity causes changes in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These changes not only take place in the cortex but occur also in other parts of the brain, like the corpus callosum [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The corpus callosum, which connects the two brain hemispheres, is considered to play a major role in intermanual transfer effects [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As such, the extent to which intermanual transfer is possible may differ in able-bodied individuals as compared to persons with an amputation. Unfortunately, as far as is known by the researchers, no literature on this topic is available. Nevertheless, we expect the learning effects in patients to be, to a large degree, comparable to those in able-bodied participants, because learning to handle a myo-electric prosthesis simulator has been found to be similar to learning to handle an actual myo-electric prosthesis [<xref rid="pone.0128747.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intermanual transfer effects were present only in the movement time after prosthesis training; we did not find differences in inter-training intervals.
