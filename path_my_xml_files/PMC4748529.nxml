Long-acting ART agents, capable of being administered on a weekly or less frequent basis, have the potential to improve adherence to therapy and allow a more forgiving time window of drug administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Albuvirtide (ABT) is a chemically modified peptide derived from the N-terminal sequence of HIV-1 gp41, and contains a 3-maleimimidopropionic acid (MPA) group in its 13th lysine side chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that upon intravenous injection ABT could rapidly conjugate with serum albumin and dramatically extend the peptide in vivo half-life from 1.7 to 25.8&#x000a0;h in rats and from 10.9 to 102.4&#x000a0;h in monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent study using pseudoviruses showed potent inhibitory activity of ABT against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains, including those commonly observed in China and some variants resistant to T20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A phase 1 single agent study in HIV-1 infected patients showed excellent safety profile of single and multiple dose of ABT, a half-life of 11&#x02013;12&#x000a0;days, and a clear dose related antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In this study in naive HIV-1 patients, a novel two-drug regimen combining ABT and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) was tested, their drug&#x02013;drug interaction investigated, and short-term safety and efficacy profiles characterized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>Antiretroviral treatment-na&#x000ef;ve HIV-1-infected patients aged 18&#x02013;50&#x000a0;years were eligible for this study if they had HIV RNA levels between 5000 and 1,000,000 copies/ml, CD4 cell counts more than 350 cells/&#x003bc;l, body weight more than 40&#x000a0;kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 27.0&#x000a0;kg/m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

All adverse events were mild, mainly triglycerides level elevation, diarrhea, nausea and skin rash. No injection site reactions were found during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p>In chronic management of HIV infection with ART, one of the most challenges is poor patient adherence to treatment, which often results in treatment failure and emergence of drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ABT is an experimental anti-HIV peptide targeting the HIV-1 envelop protein gp-41 at an area that&#x02019;s different from that of T20. The 13th residue of ABT contains a MPA modification that allows ABT to react with serum albumin. This extends its half-life to 11&#x02013;12&#x000a0;days in human while retaining anti-HIV activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although long-acting AIDS drugs are much sought after, how to administer such molecules with current oral drugs remain to be studied.</p><p>In this phase 2 trial, we designed a two-drug regimen that includes a weekly given ABT and twice daily given LPV/r. It represents the first attempt to combine an approved, orally taken ART with a long-acting, injectable anti-HIV agent to treat HIV infected patients. For 47&#x000a0;days, the novel regimen was safe and exhibited potent anti-HIV activity. All treated patients, including one whose baseline viral load was&#x000a0;&#x0003e;5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml, showed&#x000a0;&#x0003e;1 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml reduction of viral load. Importantly, data of the 320&#x000a0;mg group showed a trend of superior anti-HIV activity to that of the 160&#x000a0;mg group. This demonstrates clear contribution of ABT to the plasma HIV RNA reduction in the two-drug regimen.</p><p>ABT is the first long-acting antiretroviral drug developing in China. With the limitation of no long-acting drugs combined with ABT, we also chose LPV/r for the ART regimen in the phase III clinical trial, a 48-week, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study to investigate the safety and efficacy of ABT, which may have potential as next-generation HIV fusion inhibitors targeting gp41 for clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this 7-week study shows that ABT combined with LPV/r is safe and effective. Compared with regimens of 3&#x02013;4 drugs, the two-drug regimen could offer a simplified therapy with better safety and less drug&#x02013;drug interaction. The long half-life of ABT potentially allows a 3-day window for weekly administration and is more forgiving in adherence than daily taken drugs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Hongwei Zhang and Ronghua Jin contributed equally to this work</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Designed the study: DX and HW; conducted the study: RJ, TZ, MW, HZ, WX, R L, CW, CY, HP and XW; analyzed the data: DX, HW, CY and R J; wrote the manuscript: HZ, CY, HW and DX.
