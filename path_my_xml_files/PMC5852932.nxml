The independent variable was the file type (reciprocal vs. rotary), and the primary outcome variable was the centering ratio of distance change after canal preparation. Secondary outcomes were canal transportation in extension and direction and the preparation time.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Forty mesial root canals from extracted permanent molars with curvatures ranging between 25&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0; were randomly divided into 4 groups. Canals were prepared with two types of reciprocal rotary files (WaveOne and Reciproc) and two types of rotational rotary files (ProTaper and Mtwo), ten canals in each group. The root canals were scanned before and after preparation using CBCT. Group differences in outcome variables were tested using ANOVA and 5% type I error probability.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>At the middle third of canals, reciprocal rotary files yielded the least amount of deviation from the center in inner&#x02013;outer furcal direction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Nickel&#x02013;titanium (NiTi) rotary files have shape memory and superelasticity and are useful in preparing curved root canals while maintaining the canal curvature.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Recently introduced NiTi rotary files WaveOne (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and Reciproc files (VDW, Munich, Germany) are claimed to be able to completely clean and prepare root canals with only one instrument with minimal damage. These files are used in a reciprocal motion and made of M-wire using thermal-treatment process, resulting in increased flexibility and improved resistance to cyclic fatigue.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Radiography is essential to successful diagnosis treatment of root canals. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an imaging modality that provides high-quality, accurate, and three-dimensional representations of the osseous elements of the maxillofacial skeleton. CBCT images with sufficient spatial resolution is useful in endodontic diagnosis, treatment guidance, and posttreatment evaluation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although reciprocal NiTi rotary files and CBCT have become valuable tools in reducing complications, very few studies have addressed the shaping ability of these reciprocal NiTi rotary files in comparison with rotational NiTi rotary files using CBCT. Our aim was to compare the centering ratio, extension and direction of canal transportation, and working time of preparation of curved root canals between reciprocal rotary files (WaveOne and Reciproc) and rotational rotary files made by the same manufacturers (ProTaper and Mtwo) in extracted teeth using CBCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>A total of 40 extracted human molar teeth with at least one curved mesial root and intact root apex were selected.

Straight-line access was prepared using diamond burs. Only teeth with a K-file size 15 to the root apex were included in the study. Radiographs were taken with K-file size 15 inserted into the canals for working length determination at the apical foramen minus 1 mm. Teeth were embedded in self-cure acrylic resin which had underside grooves to prevent movement of the tooth within the model base [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>].

The CBCT images were scanned and recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Root canal preparation</title><p>Teeth were divided into four groups of ten canals that were balanced in regard to canal curvature, radius of curvature, and length of the root canal.

The instrument was used to the full length of the canals (a single-length technique) with a gentle in-and-out motion.

After each instrument was removed, the root canal was flushed with 2 ml of a 2.5% NaOCl solution, and the apical patency of the canal was obtained using a size 10 K-file. All root canal preparations were completed by one operator. The total working time of each group was recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Postoperative cone-beam computed tomography evaluation</title><p>After root canal preparations, CBCT images were taken for postoperative assessment. Teeth were then scanned under the same conditions as the initial scans. The software WhiteFox Imaging 3.0 and Adobe Photoshop CS6 were used to equalize and superimpose the images before and after root canal preparation. Three sections of coronal, middle, and apical thirds were divided for sectional CBCT assessment from the floor of the pulp chamber to 1 mm over the radiographic root apex. All axial plane images of three different sections were recorded and printed with a line of 1 mm length marked for the real scale. The lengths of dentin thickness before and after root canal preparation were measured by a digital Vernier caliper.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Evaluation of centering ratio</title><p>The centering ratio indicates the ability of the instrument to stay centered in the canal. It was determined by the shortest distance from the edge of uninstrumented canal to the periphery of the root compared with the distance measurements obtained from the instrumented images [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Each section was calculated by the following ratio: (a1&#x02212;a2)/(b1&#x02212;b2) or (b1&#x02212;b2)/(a1&#x02212;a2) for inner&#x02013;outer furcal direction and (c1&#x02212;c2)/(d1&#x02212;d2) or (d1&#x02212;d2)/(c1&#x02212;c2) for buccolingual direction. If these numbers are not equal, the lower figure is considered as the numerator of the ratio. According to this formula, a result of 1 indicates perfect centering. If a result produces a number other than 1, it indicates a deviation of the center of the original canal [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The measurements were repeated 5 times by the same evaluator and averaged before data analysis.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cone-beam computed tomography representation drawing of root section images was showed how transportation and centering ratios in inner&#x02013;outer furcal direction (a) and in buccolingual direction (b) were derived.

New NiTi rotary instruments are claimed to help in this regard. Our comparison between rotational rotary files and reciprocal rotary files from the same two manufactures showed that the reciprocal rotary files had a superior centering ratio than the rotational rotary files (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) at the middle third of root canals in inner&#x02013;outer furcal direction.</p><p>As there are variations in tooth morphology, four groups were balanced with respect to the canal curvature, radius of curvature, and length of the root canal. Our results are not due to operator differences either as all preparations were completed by one operator who underwent training in NiTi rotary instrumentation techniques that lead to higher inter- and intra-rater reliability.</p><p>Although CBCT provides high-quality three-dimensional images in a nondestructive manner,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] the sample positions for image capture are technique sensitive. We used a model which consisted of a tooth embedded in resin, which had underside grooves for preventing the movement of sample within the model and fixed with a tripod for replication. Moreover, the four metal balls sized 1 mm<sup>3</sup> were fixed on the model for usage and in order to refer to the position of the image analysis. This setup of samples brought a consistent position for each CBCT scan to produce reliable results.</p><p>The reciprocal rotary files maintained original canal curvature better. This finding is in agreement with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This superiority may be explained by the reciprocating movement of the file. A large rotating angle in the counterclockwise motion determines how the instrument advances in the canal and engages dentin to cut it, whereas a smaller angle in the clockwise motion allows the file to be immediately disengaged and safely progress along the canal path to maintain the canal curvature. The advantages of the reciprocating movement are based on the laws of physics applied to root canal preparation, which results in a balanced force technique.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Using this method, curved canals may be prepared to the full working length without producing apical transportation.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In addition, the reciprocating movement is designed to reduce the screwing effect that can aid the instrument safely progress along the canal path.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, we only saw differences at the middle third of canals. This may be due to the fact that most curved root canals reached the peak in the middle part. Since morphology of natural mesial root canals is curved in the inner furcal direction, canals prepared with alloy instruments that have elastic force tend to transport to the outer furcal direction.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Our study also showed the transportation at the middle third of root canals in outer furcal direction.</p><p>Preparation time is dependent on the numbers of instruments used, the preparation technique, the operator's experience, and the study design.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The preparation time in this study included the time for changing instruments, cleaning the flutes, and irrigation. The results showed that reciprocal rotary files were significantly faster than rotational rotary files (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and were in agreement with a previous study.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The ProTaper system as used in this study consisted of five instruments and the Mtwo system consisted of six instruments for one canal preparation, compared to WaveOne and Reciproc system which used only one instrument. However, the use of reciprocal rotary files decreased the preparation time by &#x0003c;50% compared with rotational rotary files. This might be because of the less time taken for cleaning the flutes and irrigation of the canal.</p><p>Among the limitations of our study are the small sample size and the limited range of canal curvatures we selected. We only included canals with severe curvature (between 25&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0;). Analysis of images before and after preparation of the root canal using CBCT is clinically applicable compared to micro-CT that is limited to extracted teeth. With the CBCT, the complexity of root canal can be seen and evaluated before the treatment to obtain more information in order to get better outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The reciprocal rotary files are better for curved root canals as they maintain the original canal curvature better compared to rotational rotary files, which tend to transport toward the outer furcal canal wall of the curved canal. These files also require less working time. Our findings will be useful to the clinicians. Future studies can evaluate the clinical outcomes of root canal treatments on curved roots prepared using different types of files, using both retrospective and prospective designs.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are grateful for Professor Ananda Dasanayake of New York University for his valuable comments.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weine</surname><given-names>FS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name><name><surname>Lio</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of preparation procedures on original canal shape and on apical foramen shape</article-title><source>J Endod</source><year>1975</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>255</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10697472</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weine</surname><given-names>FS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of preparation with endodontic handpieces on original canal shape</article-title><source>J Endod</source><year>1976</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>298</fpage><lpage>303</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1068206</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bergmans</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Cleynenbreugel</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wevers</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lambrechts</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mechanical root canal preparation with NiTi rotary instruments: Rationale, performance and safety.
