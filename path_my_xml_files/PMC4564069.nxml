DSJIs are designed to be rugged and easy for health care workers to learn to use; they may contribute to more consistent vaccine administration in the field as compared to conventional administration by needle and syringe (NS) <xref rid="bib0110 bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. These factors may be particularly useful for intradermal vaccines, such as bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG), for which the intradermal administration by the Mantoux delivery method with NS (termed Mantoux) is technically challenging to successfully perform <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>BCG, the only licensed vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), is the most widely administered intradermal vaccine in the world. It is given shortly after birth in many TB-endemic countries. Global BCG coverage is high (80% to 90%) and is part of the routine immunization program in more than 169 countries <xref rid="bib0125 bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. BCG is known to induce a robust T helper type 1 (Th1) immune response against a number of TB antigens present in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. TB remains a huge global health problem. In 2012, more than 8.6 million people developed the disease and 1.3 million died of it <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. BCG and future novel TB vaccines represent an important strategy in combating this major disease <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>BCG vaccine administration must be optimal to achieve maximum effectiveness. The conventional technique for BCG administration is intradermal vaccination with NS by the Mantoux technique. This technique requires exact placement and the correct angle of insertion and orientation of the needle point into the intradermal layer of the skin; otherwise, the deposition of vaccine fluid is either too deep (subcutaneous) or too superficial (potentially leaking fluid on the skin surface). The Mantoux technique is technically complex and requires training, experience, and optimal physical conditions to perform correctly <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Intradermal vaccine administration via DSJI may be simpler and more consistent than Mantoux NS techniques. DSJI devices employ needle-free technology to deliver injectable fluid into the intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular layers of tissue under high pressure through a small nozzle. Although the DSJI hand piece is designed to be reusable and robust for use in the field, the component that comes into contact with the patient (designated the needle-free syringe or cartridge) is single-use and disposable. The advantages of this technology include a simplified administration technique that may be less dependent on user skill and requires simpler user training and experience. It eliminates the risk of needle reuse or needlestick injuries and potentially offers a less variable deposition of vaccine fluid into the intended layer of skin <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Much of the work with DSJIs has focused on the potential for dose-sparing by intradermal administration of vaccines traditionally administered intramuscularly, such as influenza and inactivated poliovirus vaccines <xref rid="bib0150 bib0155 bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[9&#x02013;11]</xref>. Although previous generations of multi-use nozzle jet injectors were widely used for BCG administration, the new generation of improved DSJI devices has not yet been evaluated for BCG vaccination <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Given the potential advantages of DSJI, our objective was to test whether BCG vaccination via DSJI was safe and immunogenic when compared to BCG vaccination via the conventional Mantoux NS method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and setting</title><p>We employed a partially blinded, randomized clinical trial design to compare BCG vaccination via the experimental DSJI to standard-of-care NS. The trial was conducted in two stages: an adult stage, to exclude a major safety signal, before proceeding to an infant stage, during which newborns were vaccinated. BCG vaccination shortly after birth is routine in this TB-endemic study population, which represents the target population for the intervention. In both stages, a random 1:1 allocation was performed into standard-dose, intradermal BCG vaccination via DSJI or via NS. The DSJI device used in this study was the Bioject ID Pen (<italic>Bioject</italic>, USA). The ID Pen is a small, compact spring-powered device that uses an autodisable, single-use disposable syringe with a spacer to limit fluid deposition to the intradermal tissue. The BCG Danish strain 1331 (<italic>Staten Serum Institut</italic>, Denmark) was administered at a standard dose of 0.1&#x000a0;mL or 2&#x02013;8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (CFU) in adults and 0.05&#x000a0;mL or 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>5</sup>&#x000a0;CFU in infants.

A local medical monitor and a data safety monitoring board oversaw participant safety, which was required per protocol to approve progression from the adult stage to the infant stage and the continuation of enrollment after the first 20 vaccinated infants. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01742364" id="intr0005">NCT01742364</ext-link>) and South African National Clinical Trials Register (DOH-27-1112-4239) <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Screening, randomization, and vaccination</title><p>For the adult stage, 30 healthy adults from 18 to 50 years of age were enrolled after undergoing screening, which occurred after signed informed consent. Participants were excluded if they had major concomitant medical conditions; were HIV positive; or had a household TB contact, a history of TB disease, a chest X-ray suggestive of previous TB disease, or a positive test for TB infection (Quantiferon TB-Gold test; <italic>Cellestis</italic>, Australia).</p><p>For the newborn vaccination stage, 66 infants were enrolled. Informed consent was obtained from the mothers of potential infant participants during the later stages of pregnancy. Study inclusion required mothers to have a documented negative HIV test and an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Caesarian sections for maternal indications were allowed. Newborns needed to have an Apgar score &#x02265;7 at 5&#x000a0;min, birth weight &#x02265;2500&#x000a0;g, estimated gestation &#x02265;38 weeks, and be in good general health to be eligible for enrollment. Gestation age was determined using the best estimate combination of last menstrual period, clinical assessment, and pregnancy ultrasound where available.</p><p>The vaccinating nurse was unblinded, but did not take part in follow-up assessments. The remainder of the study team remained blinded to study group allocation until database lock. Parents were not present during infant vaccination, and were therefore blinded. However, adult participants could not be blinded. Vaccinations were performed by three research nurses who received hands-on training for the DSJI device and Mantoux NS technique, including proficiency testing. Vaccination of adults occurred at the clinical trial site. Vaccination of infants occurred at community birthing units within a maximum of 48&#x000a0;h after birth. In the adults and infants, random study group allocation by participant study number was pre-determined by a randomization list prepared by the blinded data manager using a random number generator. After enrollment and study number assignment, and immediately before vaccination, the vaccinator opened sequential sealed individual envelopes labeled with the participant number and marked inside with the pre-assigned group allocation. The envelopes were then immediately destroyed to prevent inadvertent unblinding.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Post-vaccination follow-up</title><p>Adults were seen 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after vaccination.

Phlebotomy for immunogenicity was performed at 10 and 14 weeks in infants only.</p></sec><sec id="sec0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Clinical endpoint data collection</title><p>Three groups of clinical data were collected: injection performance data, including wheal diameter (measured in millimeters) and skin fluid deposition at the site of injection (SOI) immediately post-vaccination; safety data (adverse events [AEs], including systemic reactions); and specific characteristics of the BCG SOI lesion (ulcer and scar formation).</p><p>Wheal diameter was measured with a transparent ruler immediately after vaccination. Skin fluid deposition at the injection site was estimated in adults using an observational scale immediately after vaccination (skin damp, flow of fluid on skin, fluid spray in air, fluid runs out of injection site, &#x0201c;wet shot&#x0201d;). A vaccination was considered a &#x0201c;wet shot&#x0201d; when all the administered fluid was observed to be located on the skin surface and not properly injected at the desired intradermal depth. Skin fluid deposition at the injection site was measured in infants using an objective filter paper technique (PATH, unpublished data). The filter paper was applied to the skin immediately after vaccination. Fluid absorbed by the paper caused a demarcated patch, the diameter of which was measured. Patch diameters had been correlated pre-trial with standardized fluid volumes and reported in six categories (&#x02264;2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L, &#x02264;5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L, &#x02264;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L, &#x02264;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L, &#x02264;40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L, &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L).</p><p>Adverse events were collected 30&#x000a0;min following vaccination and during follow-up visits through history and examination and participant diaries. The AEs were graded for severity and causality by an investigator. All AEs were recorded, including characteristic BCG site of injection reactions such as erythema, induration, ulcer, and scar formation. AEs were classified as &#x0201c;injection site reactions&#x0201d; if they occurred at the site of vaccine administration; all other AEs were classified as &#x0201c;systemic.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Immunogenicity endpoint data collection</title><p>BCG-specific immunogenicity was tested in infants only, since they are the target study population and BCG immunogenicity in adults is known to be different from that in infants.

No differences in injection performance were detected in adults. In infants, we observed an increased rate of small-volume skin fluid deposition by DSJI. A number of infant vaccinations with NS did not form a wheal, whereas all DSJI vaccinations formed a visible wheal. To our knowledge, these are the first published data comparing DSJI and NS intradermal injection performance parameters and BCG immunogenicity.</p><p>All 12 of the BCG vaccinations that did not form a visible site of injection wheal in infants were performed using NS (36%) whereas all those with DSJI did form wheals. In the vaccinations that formed a wheal, however, the median wheal diameter was similar between administration methods. This suggests a greater variability in successful deposition of vaccine fluid intradermally with NS (observed wheal versus no observed wheal), but equal performance once the fluid is deposited in the correct layer. The difference in wheal formation between DSJI and NS may have been magnified in infants, as compared to adults, by age-specific skin characteristics. The non-formation of a wheal with NS may be associated with Mantoux technique failure. The research nurses in our study were experienced vaccinators with as much or more field experience than nurses doing routine BCG vaccinations in the clinics. Even in those optimal research conditions, it appeared that these nurses were prone to inconsistent Mantoux technique performance. However, any differences in injection performance in infants were not associated with differences in BCG reactogenicity or immunogenicity, which suggests that the BCG dosage deposited by NS was not markedly different in infants with or without wheals.</p><p>Vaccinations with the DSJI were &#x0201c;wetter&#x0201d; immediately post-vaccination, with all injections in the adults noted as being &#x0201c;damp&#x0201d; and more vaccinations in the infant DSJI group measuring more than 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of fluid on the skin surface (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L represents 10% of the injected volume in infants). The implication of small volumes of injected fluid remaining on the skin surface is unclear. We surmise that small-volume skin fluid deposition is characteristic of the DSJI administration technique, but not necessarily indicative of sub-optimal intradermal deposition of BCG vaccine. This suggestion is supported by our findings regarding site of injection wheal diameter, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. However, we acknowledge that wheal diameter and estimation of skin fluid deposition are proxy measures of clinical injection performance and their validity in determining a successful intradermal vaccination is uncertain. This issue was highlighted by poor correlation between post-vaccination wheal diameter and skin fluid deposition and between immunogenicity readouts and wheal diameter.</p><p>In the infants vaccinated with NS in whom no wheal formed and in whom little or no fluid leakage was observed, it is possible that intradermal technique failure resulted in vaccine fluid deposition into the subcutaneous or intramuscular skin layer. The relative &#x0201c;wetness&#x0201d; of wheal-forming DSJI vaccinations may imply some deposition of fluid across more than one layer of the skin. Subcutaneous BCG administration may be a risk factor for BCG complications such as lymphadenopathy and abscess formation <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Although we did not observe these complications, it is possible that an association between complications and injections that do not form a wheal may be more evident in a larger sample size. BCG leaked onto the skin during administration may carry a very small risk of environmental exposure to the community, particularly to immunodeficient individuals at greater risk of disseminated BCG.</p><p>Although BCG has been in use for decades, there is a paucity of data to inform the expected &#x0201c;benchmark&#x0201d; post-vaccination wheal diameter; the estimation of skin fluid deposition by the Mantoux NS method; or the diameter of characteristic BCG lesion parameters such as erythema, induration, ulceration, and scar formation in infants. The median wheal diameter of 3&#x000a0;mm, in infants receiving the standard 0.05-mL dose of BCG, may serve as a useful reference for future studies.</p><p>Although adequate for the analysis of safety and immunogenicity, our trial design was limited by a relatively wide time interval between visits that precluded a detailed analysis of the evolution of the BCG lesion over time. The proportion of BCG lesions that formed characteristic scars at 14 weeks in infants (62%) was lower than expected <xref rid="bib0195 bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>. However, at the 12-week follow-up, 10 infants (2 DSJI, 8 NS) still had active lesions with erythema, induration, or ulceration, which may have developed scarring with longer follow-up. Therefore, ideally, the length of follow-up should have been longer.</p><p>As markers of BCG &#x0201c;vaccine take&#x0201d; in infants, we measured BCG-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses. We chose post-vaccination time points at 10 and 14 weeks, as previous experience had identified these as the indicators of peak response and durability of response, respectively <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Frequencies and cytokine co-expression patterns of BCG-specific T-cell responses did not differ between the DSJI and NS groups. While these responses do not predict clinical efficacy of the vaccine, they were considered adequate for the study objectives to distinguish a potential difference in immune response between the two vaccination methods <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Notably, in a previous study of Japanese BCG administration, in which intradermal NS administration was compared with percutaneous administration, different levels of soluble IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 after BCG stimulation were observed <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, frequencies of IFN-&#x003b3;-expressing CD4 and CD8 T-cells, measured by whole blood ICS assay, were not different. This may suggest that the short-term ICS assay may not be ideal for detecting administration route-dependent differences in BCG-induced immunity.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that BCG administration by DSJI is as safe and immunogenic as conventional Mantoux NS administration. It appears that BCG vaccination of newborn infants via DSJI is more likely to deliver an appropriate intradermal wheal, compared to NS, despite leaving more fluid on the skin surface. The significance of this finding, in terms of injection performance, needs further exploration. Follow-up research is also required to investigate the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of such devices for national vaccination programs considering multiple factors, such as reduced risk of needlestick injuries, reduced waste-management costs, and the potential for fewer staff resources due to a simplified vaccination technique. The potential application for this technology for BCG vaccination is large, given the global coverage of BCG vaccination, and further investigation is justified.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib0110"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0110"><person-group

BCG-induced T-cells expressing cytokines in infants. Representative pseudo-color plots depict the gating strategy in which SSC-A<sup>low</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> were selected first, followed by gating on singlets, small lymphocytes, and events with consistent fluorescence levels over sample acquisition time (time gate). These CD3<sup>+</sup> lymohocytes were then separated into either CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Representative cytokine expression by CD4 (upper plots) and CD8 (lower plots) are shown. Specific expression of cytokines by CD45RA<sup>high</sup> T-cells could not be reliably discerned in antigen-stimulated cells because of non-specific background IFN-&#x003b3; signal in the unstimulated control. As a consequence, only cytokine expression by CD45RA<sup>low</sup> memory T-cells is reported. This issue also precluded analysis of memory phenotypes of BCG-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Frequencies of BCG-specific CD4 or CD8 T-cells were calculated by subtracting frequencies of CD45RA<sup>low</sup> cells in the unstimulated control from frequencies of CD45RA<sup>low</sup> cells in BCG stimulated samples.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data to this article:<fig id="fig0005" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="mmc1"/></fig></p></sec><ack id="ack0005"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Bioject for their collaboration and provision of the devices used in this study; the <funding-source id="gs1">World Health Organization</funding-source> for providing supplementary funding (grant number 2014/412467-1); the study staff from the SATVI field site for all their work; and the participants as well as parents and guardians for their contribution and patience.
