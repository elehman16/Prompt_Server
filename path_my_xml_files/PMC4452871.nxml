The aim of this study was to compare the behavioral and physiologic effects of &#x0201c;commercially midazolam syrup&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;orally administered IV midazolam dosage form (extemporaneous midazolam (EF))&#x0201d; in uncooperative pediatric dental patients. Eighty-eight children between 4 to 7 years of age received 0.2&#x02013;0.5&#x02009;mg/kg midazolam in this parallel trial. Physiologic parameters were recorded at baseline and every 15 minutes. Behavior assessment was conducted objectively by Houpt scale throughout the sedation and North Carolina at baseline and during injection and cavity preparation. No significant difference in behavior was noted by Houpt or North Carolina scale. Acceptable behavior (excellent, very good, and good) was observed in 90.9% of syrup and 79.5% of EF subjects, respectively. Physiological parameters remained in normal range without significant difference between groups and no adverse effect was observed. It is concluded that EF midazolam preparation can be used as an acceptable alternative to midazolam syrup. </p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Dental fear/anxiety and behavior management problems in pediatric patients are two major aspects of uncooperativeness in pediatric dentistry. Whilst Psychological techniques are the cornerstone of behavior management in pediatric dentistry, a number of children cannot cope with dental treatment using these techniques alone. Pharmacological methods have been used as an adjunct to enhance child cooperativeness and facilitate dental treatment [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The primary aim of mild and moderate pharmacological sedation in pediatric dentistry is to modify the patient's behavior to an extent that allows applying behavior management techniques [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Evidence for best choice of sedative agents in children is still incomplete [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; however, midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, has been extensively used due to its therapeutic index and wide margin of safety [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since oral dosage form of midazolam is not commercially available in many countries, therefore injectable midazolam in mixture with a flavoring agent, to mask the undesirable taste and adjust the pH, briefly known as extemporaneous form (EF) has been used as an alternative [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Despite extensive administration of EF preparation, there is no consensus on its effectiveness [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore the aim of this study was to<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of two midazolam oral preparations: &#x0201c;EF midazolam&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;commercially prepared midazolam syrup&#x0201d; in pediatric dental patients by measuring physiological parameters and behavioral scales including<italic> North Carolina</italic> and<italic> Houpt behavioral scales</italic>. The latter ones evaluate the level of consciousness and cooperativeness in sedated patients.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Subjects and Methods</title><p>The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran (Grant number 3910354611). The investigation was a randomized, double-blind study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians prior to enrollment of subjects in the study.</p><p>The study was conducted in 88 children (41 males and 47 females) aged 4 to 7 years and ASA class I (ASA: American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status Classification System) that means a normal healthy subject. The patients were referred to Pediatric Clinic of Guilan Dental School due to uncooperativeness and difficulties in behavior management. Prior to sedation appointment, it was attempted to treat these children using behavior management methods including Tell-Show-Do and positive reinforcement. Eligible participants were rated as negative on the Frankl behavioral rating scale [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Children were required to have an adequate degree of understanding to communicate during the course of treatment. With regard to dental treatment, participants must have at least one primary molar with pulp treatment needs. Patients were excluded from the study if they had physical or mental disabilities, history of respiratory diseases in the past two weeks, and tonsil/adenoid hypertrophy that occupied more than 50% of pharyngeal space. Other exclusion criteria included anatomical deformities in face and neck such as micrognathia and macroglossia and any known allergy to midazolam.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of two parallel treatment groups. Forty- four patients were randomly allocated to each group using 6 quadric blocks. Patients received 0.2 or 0.5&#x02009;mg/kg midazolam syrup or EF midazolam according to their age up to a maximum dose of 12&#x02009;mg. A dose of 0.5&#x02009;mg/kg was administered to children less than five years of age (48 to 59 months) and 0.2&#x02009;mg/kg for over the age of five years (60 to 84 months) (Saarnivaara 1998). Demographic information of the study patients is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2"> Table 2</xref> presents the age-adjusted distribution of children.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on a previous sedation study [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] with 80% study power and 95% confidence interval (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05) and the clinical difference between groups was considered 25%.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Drug Administration</title><p>Children received either regimen A: 0.2 or 0.5&#x02009;mg/kg midazolam maleate syrup sugar free liquid (Amsed oral liquid 2.5&#x02009;mg/mL; UK) or regimen B: 0.2 or 0.5&#x02009;mg/kg midazolam EF 2.5&#x02009;mg/mL that consisted of the injectable solution of midazolam hydrochloride (Ampule 15&#x02009;mg/3&#x02009;mL Midamax, Tehran Shimi, Iran) in combination with the same volume of concentrated viscous orange syrup according to their age. The pH of final EF preparation was 3.7 and the commercial preparation's pH was equal to 4. Both pH values were determined by automated pH meter (Acorn Ion 6 Meter). Drugs were administrated by a dental nurse who was unaware of the study design, using a needleless syringe placed in the lower buccal vestibule. After administration of midazolam, the patients remained under supervision in a quiet place. Thirty minutes after administration, children were transferred to dental operatory in accompany of their parents. Parents were asked to leave the operatory during the treatment session to eliminate any potential impact of parent's presence on child's behavior. All participants received similar restorative treatments including topical anesthetic gel (Benzocaine 10%) followed by local anesthesia (Lidocaine-Epinephrine 1/100.000) and pulp therapy followed by restoration of the tooth which included either fillings or stainless steel crowns. The maximum dose of local anesthesia was limited to 4&#x02009;mg/kg. Treatment was planned to be accomplished in maximum thirty minutes and any type of physical restraints was not used.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Behavior Assessment</title><p>Behavior was videotaped and rated by a trained and calibrated examiner who was blind to the study design using two behavioral measures: North Carolina rating scale to evaluate behavior preoperatively and during critical moments of treatment including injection and cavity preparation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>) and Houpt sedation rating scale to determine the level of sedation according to degree of sleep, crying, movement, and finally an overall appraisal of behavior through the treatment course (see Definition of Houpt sedation rating scale) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The examiner was the senior dental student who was trained and calibrated via examination of five patients prior to study. The Cohen Kappa for intra-examiner reliability was 8.9.</p><p>

Discussion</title><p>The results of this study indicated that both regimens were safe with reasonable level of sedation acquired. To the best of our knowledge, there are few published studies that have investigated safety and efficacy of midazolam syrup versus orally administered IV midazolam (EF midazolam). In comparison to commercial syrup with IV midazolam in the mixture of Syrpalta (pH = 5), Brosius and Bannister reported higher plasma levels and superior sedative effects from IV midazolam-Syrpalta [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Khalil et al. reported less preanesthetic anxiety at 15 minutes and at parental separation in children who received IV midazolam-Syrpalta mixture when compared to those who received the premixed midazolam solution [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The effectiveness of EF midazolam over commercial preparations is a controversial issue [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Our results did not show a significant difference between two midazolam preparations; however, administration of the commercial syrup increased the chance of overall success when compared to EF preparation. Variability of sweeteners and juices added to IV drug resulted in diversity in pH, viscosity, and pharmacokinetics that may explain this controversy [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The pH of our oral dosage was 3.7 and the pH of commercially syrup was 4 and fruit juices usually added to midazolam had a pH about 2.8 that can justify the difference in absorption of drug [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Mucosal absorption is a pH dependent phenomenon. Increasing the pH from 2.8 (IV formulation) to 4 results in formation of more than 95% of active lipophilic drug or closed ring that is readily absorbable from oral mucosa [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since significant amount of midazolam is absorbed by mucosal membranes of the oral cavity, esophagus, and stomach, pH variability may result in divergent observed responses to midazolam [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another consideration in midazolam absorption is the drug's viscosity. Viscous preparations are retained in oral environment for longer periods of time that<italic> per se</italic> increases the local absorption of drug from permeable oral mucosa especially nonkeratinized tissue of buccal mucosa [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Relative absorption of drug from direct drainage of oral blood vessels into the jugular vein is another priority over less viscous preparations which lead to better bioavailability of drug [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In the present study a dose of 0.5 and 0.2&#x02009;mg/kg was chosen for children under and over five years of age, respectively, according to a pilot study as well as the previous works on this area [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Age effects on dosage requirements have been discussed in the anesthesiology literature [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The midazolam dose should be individualized based on patient age, degree of anxiety, and the level of sedation desired [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Younger children may need higher doses of the drug for higher hepatic blood flow and metabolism rate [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], in addition to lower expression, distribution, and coupling ability of type A GABA receptors [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It appears to be an optimal balance between anxiolytic activity and side effect liability in doses of 0.25&#x02009;mg to 0.50&#x02009;mg/kg [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We compared all aspects of sedation including sleep, movement, crying, and overall behavior by adjusting the effect of age. Similar results were achieved when the total dose was restricted to decrease the dose in older children. Although midazolam falls in a group of agents with broad margin of safety, lowering the dose may be desirable for decreasing the potential side effects [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It may be logical to preserve the higher doses for those who do not respond favorably to lower doses of drug.</p><p>Mild and moderate sedation via oral route is an effective, safe, and convenience mode of midazolam administration that may fill the gap between psychological strategies and general anesthesia in many subjects.</p><p>More research is needed either by increasing the prescribed dose of drug or by administration of alternative agents in cases of unsuccessful sedations.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>According to the results of this study EF midazolam preparations in a dose of either 0.2 or 0.5&#x02009;mg/kg provided safe and effective sedation. Hence, lower doses may be advocated to older children.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Clinical Implications</title><p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>What is already known is that midazolam is widely used as a safe and effective sedative agent in pediatric sedation. However, oral form of drug is not available in many countries and it is also expensive and not cost effective for occasional use.</p></list-item><list-item><p>What this article adds is that injection formulation can be used for oral administration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Implications for translation are as follows. This extemporaneous preparation may be effectively used by pediatric dentists and other professionals who work in pediatric area as a safe effective agent in management of uncooperative behavior. In addition, identifying the populations who benefit from this agent can help to target the responders.
