Language barriers often prevent timely access to appropriate health care, leading to chronic trajectories and abortive social integration. Tools for multilingual screening and assessment could be of great benefit for this particularly vulnerable population as well as for policy makers.

The total number of refugees reached 21.3 million by mid-2015, its highest level since World War II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. By virtue of a wide range of traumatic and post-migration stressors, refugees are at high risk for severe mental health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. High prevalence rates for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD; 30.6%) and depression (30.8%) were reported in a meta-analysis of 181 studies with a total of over 80,000 war-affected refugees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another meta-analysis reported similar findings in adult war-refugees 5&#x000a0;years or longer after displacement, pointing to the high prevalence of chronic trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Efficient and evidence-based treatment options for trauma related and other mental health problems exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and are in principle available in many hosting societies. In addition to distrust, shame, stigma, and/or the lack of knowledge about psychological disorders and treatment possibilities, however, language and communication difficulties often prevent refugees from accessing health care and treatment post-resettlement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While guidelines recommend the use of qualified interpreters when providing treatment to refugees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the coverage of costs is often not warranted and manageable neither by patients nor by service providers. As a result, the use of lay or ad hoc interpreters such as family members is commonly practiced, although the literature has evidenced manifold disadvantages regarding disclosure of sensitive information/confidentiality, communication (errors and comprehension), utilization, clinical outcomes and satisfaction with care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Ultimately, lack of proficiency in the host country&#x02019;s language represents a substantial barrier to the identification and treatment of health problems in refugees (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]).</p><p id="Par23">Whereas qualified interpreters are indispensable to the therapeutic process, computer-based tools can be effectively implemented in screening and diagnostic procedures in terms of standardized psychological assessments. In comparison to face-to-face interviews or self-administered paper-pencil questionnaires, Computer-Assisted Self-Interviews (CASI) have been demonstrated to increase the probability of clients reporting sensitive data, e.g., sexual risk behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], or injecting drug use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and to improve completion of client intake forms resulting in significantly lower rates of missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Benefits of CASI as perceived by patients include ensuring confidentiality and providing privacy, minimizing socially desirable responses, and helping to avoid perceived negative judgment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The use of Audio CASI (ACASI) allows respondents to listen to each item and response set in their own language, which facilitates the completion and evaluation of questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and is of particular benefit to illiterate patients.</p><p id="Par24">While ACASI has been used in various clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], no research with refugees has been conducted yet.

In summary, there is no study to date that examined the feasibility of ACASI in a clinical setting with a population of traumatized refugees. Moreover, the view of health professionals with regard to usability of ACASI in traumatized refugees has never been assessed.</p><p id="Par25">At the Outpatient Unit for Victims of Torture and War at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich), we developed the Multi-Adaptive Psychological Screening Software (MAPSS).

Each participant completed health related questionnaires in the respective condition, with a 30-min break interval between administrations. Between the two conditions, the question order was randomized in each group in order to mitigate potential carry over effects. After the cross-over and second administration, all participants completed the questionnaires on feasibility on the touchscreen device.

One of the participants who used the voice output all the time stated the computer voice went too slow. Twenty-four participants (80%) stated that the touchscreen mode was user-friendly and one fifth did not think so. Sixteen participants (63%) stated that the touchscreen mode made it easier for them to answer the questions, eight (27%) that the touchscreen made it rather easier and three participants (10%) that the PAPI made it easier to answer questions. Fourteen participants (47%) felt that the touchscreen mode provided more privacy, five participants (16%) felt the same for the PAPI mode, whereas 11 participants (37%) rated MAPSS and PAPI equally regarding privacy. Sixteen participants (53%) reported that the touchscreen mode encouraged more honest and truthful answers in comparison to the PAPI mode (47%). The majority (25 participants, 83%) reported thinking their personal data was safer in touchscreen mode and for five participants (17%) neither of the administration modes guaranteed higher data safety. Sixteen participants (53%) stated that it was easier to disclose personal information using the touchscreen, 11 participants (37%) found it rather easier to disclose personal information using the touchscreen and three participants (10%) thought it was easier in the PAPI mode.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par43">The aim of this study was to test the reliability, feasibility and usability of MAPSS, a newly developed Audio Computer Assisted Software administered via touchscreen device, among traumatized refugees and health care professionals in a clinical setting.</p><p id="Par44">The administration via MAPSS took significantly less time than the paper-pencil interview, was rated less stressful to use and more likely to encourage honest and truthful answers. A high degree of reliability was found between the symptom scores administered in both modes under study (MAPSS vs. paper-pencil). Symptoms scores in all measures were slightly lower when assessed via MAPSS as compared with PAPI, differences, however, were only significant with regard to depression. We interpret this finding in the sense of a self-presentation bias leading to more pronounced symptom presentation in front of therapist and interpreter as compared to a tablet. This interpretation is in line with earlier studies, which found lower social desirability bias in ACASI assessments versus face-to-face interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, interpreter-related misunderstandings leading to inaccurate results in case of PAPI cannot be ruled out, particularly in view of the different language backgrounds and interpreters included in the study. The results of the feasibility questionnaire (user interface) indicated a high acceptance of MAPSS and preference in comparison to PAPI among the study sample. The MAPSS software was shown to be highly accepted among the participants and all participants agreed to use MAPSS again during their treatment. 30% of the participants used the voice output in addition to the written items presentation. These results indicate that the voice output may be an essential feature and a strong asset of MAPSS, particularly for participants with limited literacy.</p><p id="Par45">The usability of MAPSS (administrator interface) was rated as excellent by different professionals (psychologists, psychiatrist, student, administrative staff), indicating that MAPSS is quick to learn and easy to use. Professional administrators gave the usability of the administration interface of MAPSS a high rating particularly on the pragmatic quality dimension, meaning that the software is practical in achieving the desired goal to administer and analyze questionnaires in different languages. Professionals emphasized the informative content of the software and described it as straightforward, connective and integrating, attractive and appealing. However, both the hedonic quality and attraction were rated slightly below average. This could be rooted in the targeted functional purpose of the software, which does not aim at pleasing administrators with its functions or to broaden the personal skills of the user.</p><p id="Par46">Future studies should use and evaluate CASI/ACASI in larger samples, testing it for population-level epidemiological surveys, systematic screenings and needs assessments, particularly in low resource settings. Studies should explicitly address the aspect of cost-effectiveness and explore the potential clinical and economic benefits of implementing MAPSS as a subsidiary tool within standard diagnostic procedures. Additional examinations, e.g. by qualitative methods, should provide more insight on its use and its potential value in collecting sensitive trauma exposure data where shame, stigma or the anticipation of social sanctioning may be prohibitive in a conventional interpreter-based setting.</p><p id="Par47">This study has several limitations. First, the small sample size limits the generalizability of the results. Second, we did not analyze the influence of educational level on the ability to use a touchscreen device. Yet, it has been shown, that education has no influence on the ability to use a touchscreen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. For this study, we felt that previous touchscreen experience was a sufficient measure to account for possible differences in the participants&#x02019; ability to use a tablet. Third, the interval between the two administration modes was only 30&#x000a0;min, which might have caused carry-over effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. To account for that, we changed the order of the questions between the two administration modes. A longer interval of, e.g., several days, may include a change in the patients&#x02019; condition or discourage them to participate in the second administration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">Our results suggest that MAPSS administered via touchscreen device demonstrates good reliability, is fast to implement and well accepted by both patients and professionals, underlining its potential as an advantageous alternative to paper-pencil or interpreter-based interviews in multi-lingual settings. In addition, the automatic data export saves resources, reduces missing data and possible errors in data input. Accordingly, MAPSS could also be useful for mental health screenings in refugee camps and other low-resource settings, and MAPSS could be a very helpful tool to perform health screenings very early in an asylum process or in epidemiological studies. In addition, not only specialized psychiatric institutions could benefit from MAPSS but also general practitioners or other professionals who do not have the possibility to use interpreters. Although the use of qualified interpreters remains indispensable in the therapeutic process, MAPSS may represent a meaningful tool in order to allocate limited resources to those most in need.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACASI</term><def><p id="Par5">Audio computer-assisted self-interview software</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATT</term><def><p id="Par6">Attraction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CASI</term><def><p id="Par7">Computer-assisted self-interviews</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par8">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HQ-I</term><def><p id="Par9">Hedonic quality</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HQ-S</term><def><p id="Par10">Hedonic quality &#x02013; stimulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSCL</term><def><p id="Par11">Hopkins symptom checklist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p id="Par12">Intraclass correlations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAPSS</term><def><p id="Par13">Multi-adaptive psychological screening software</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAPI</term><def><p id="Par14">Paper-pencil-interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDS</term><def><p id="Par15">Posttraumatic diagnostic scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PQ</term><def><p id="Par16">Pragmatic quality</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTSD</term><def><p id="Par17">Posttraumatic stress disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par18">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUS</term><def><p id="Par19">System usability scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UNHCR</term><def><p id="Par20">United Nation high commissioner for refugees</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We want to thank all the participating patients, assessors, therapists and interpreters.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par49">The study was partly supported by the Parrotia Foundation and the Swiss Federal Office for Migration (3a-12-0495).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par50">Data will be shared upon request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>NM was involved in the conception and design of the study, the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the data, and the drafting of the manuscript.
