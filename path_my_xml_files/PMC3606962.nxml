Spontaneous pain, pressure pain thresholds and tolerance levels for the masseter and temporalis muscles, side effects, and blood pressure were evaluated before and 15, 30, and 50&#x02009;min after MSG intake. Whole saliva samples were taken before and 30&#x02009;min after MSG intake to assess glutamate concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Headache occurred in 8/14 subjects during MSG and 2/14 during placebo (P = 0.041). Salivary glutamate concentrations on Day 5 were elevated significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Pressure pain thresholds in masseter muscle were reduced by MSG on Day 2 and 5 (P &#x0003c; 0.05).

The principal symptom of TMD that most often leads patients to seek medical treatment is pain in the temporomandibular joint and/or masticatory muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Around 70% of TMD patients report masticatory muscle pain and are described as suffering from myofascial TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the majority of myofascial TMD cases, there is little evidence of ongoing pathological change in masticatory muscles, and, consequently, a number of alternative mechanisms have been proposed to explain pathogenesis of this pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Of these potential mechanisms, life-style related factors may play an important role in development and maintenance of muscle pain in myofascial TMD. For example, chronic stress has been speculated to lead to parafunctional activities such as repetitive tooth clenching or grinding that then produces strain injury to masticatory muscles leading to pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], although the relationship between bruxism and craniofacial pain may be more complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Diet may be another important life-style related factor contributing the muscle pain in myofascial TMD, as it has been reported that TMD patients alter their diet to avoid exacerbating pain associated with mastication of certain foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, very little is currently known about the interaction between food intake and pain in TMD.</p><p>Consumption of certain foods is thought to precipitate or aggravate other chronic craniofacial pain conditions. One postulated food trigger for migraine headaches is monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is used as a taste enhancer in many snack and fast foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Indeed, total dietary consumption of glutamate ranges from 50&#x02013;200&#x02009;mg/kg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Of note, healthy young men who consumed a single dose of 150&#x02009;mg/kg MSG had a significant increase in headache and craniofacial muscle sensitivity as well as an elevated systolic blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggesting that MSG consumption may trigger more types of craniofacial pain than just headaches. A significant amount of systemically administered glutamate is known to be taken up by skeletal muscles, including the masticatory muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The resulting elevation of interstitial glutamate concentration sensitizes muscle nociceptors to mechanical stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]; an effect which could underlie reports of craniofacial muscle pain sensitivity in healthy young men given MSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Further, there is evidence that glutamate concentrations are elevated in painful regions of masticatory muscles of myofascial TMD patients compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Although a single 150&#x02009;mg/kg dose of MSG did result in a demonstrable increase in craniofacial sensitivity in young healthy men, more regular consumption of this quantity of MSG may result in tolerance to the acute sensitizing effects of MSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. On the other hand, chronic daily administration of 150&#x02009;mg/kg of MSG might lead to the accumulation of MSG in masticatory muscles, which might be manifested by enhanced craniofacial sensitivity reminiscent of symptoms reported by myofascial TMD patients. The current study was therefore conducted to assess the impact of 5&#x02009;days of consumption of 150&#x02009;mg/kg MSG on craniofacial pain sensitivity in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>This study was performed as a double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (approval No. 20060040 &#x02013; amendment No. 2 of March 2010) and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Randomization was performed by a computer and the examiners were blinded until after finishing data collection on all subjects.</p><p>Fourteen healthy adult (&#x0003e; 18&#x02009;years) subjects (9 women and 5 men, mean age 27.6 &#x000b1; 1.7&#x02009;years, mean bodyweight 64.1 &#x000b1; 2.5&#x02009;kg) were included in the study through the webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.forsoegsperson.dk">http://www.forsoegsperson.dk</ext-link>) and among staffs and students at the Department of Dentistry, Aarhus University.

In one week, the subjects received MSG, and in the other week, placebo (see below), in randomized order.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline measurements</title><p>On the first day, the bodyweight of the subject was measured with the use of a digital scale. The subjects were asked to fast for at least 3&#x02009;hours before each session. In each of the 10 sessions at baseline (BL), after a 10&#x02009;min rest, a resting whole saliva sample was collected using the draining method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The collection of saliva samples took place in a quiet room. The subjects were seated upright in a chair with the head slightly bent forward, and instructed to drool into a plastic cup for 10&#x02009;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The subjects were then asked to rate spontaneous pain (if any) on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS, 0 = no pain, 10 = most imaginable pain). Then, pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance levels (PPTol) of the left masseter and temporalis muscles were measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were also measured with the use of a digital blood pressure monitor (UA-767plus; A&#x00026;D Medical, Abingdon, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Administration of monosodium glutamate (MSG) or placebo</title><p>In each session of the MSG week, a drink was prepared of 400&#x02009;ml sugar-free lemon soda (Spirit light<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Coop) by a research assistant in a separate room. The beverage contained carbon dioxide, citric acid, sodium citrate, aromas, artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame potassium) and sodium benzoate. MSG (150&#x02009;mg MSG per kg bodyweight) was added to the soda. In the placebo week, 24&#x02009;mg per kg bodyweight of NaCl was added to the drink instead of MSG to create a similar taste. The drink was ingested over a few min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pressure pain thresholds and pressure pain tolerance thresholds</title><p>An algometer (Somedic, H&#x000f6;rby, Sweden) was use to assess PPT and PPTol in the masseter and temporalis muscles.

Subjects were instructed to press a button when the force applied by the examiner just became painful (PPT) or when they could no longer tolerate the force being applied (PPTol). PPT (triplicates) and PPTol (single measures) for left masseter and left temporalis were repeated in all sessions 15, 30, and 50&#x02009;min after drinking the beverage.

Each sample was centrifuged before measurements of glutamate (1500&#x02009;g for 5&#x02009;min). The concentration of glutamate in the whole saliva samples was determined with a commercially available kit (L-Glutamins&#x000e4;ure/L-Glutamate, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Australia) using the photometric analyzer Konelab 30i (Thermo Clinical Labsystems/ILS Laboratories Scandinavia, Denmark). The molecular weight of glutamate is 146&#x02009;g/mol. The standard (calibrator) in the kit was 0.1&#x02009;g/L corresponding to 684.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. Upper test limits for the kit was 3592.00&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. A sample volume of 10 &#x003bc;L of saliva per measurement was used.

Subjects correctly identified the substance given to them 88% of the time, suggesting that due to the increased number of side effects experienced by many subjects who received MSG, most subjects were able to guess what they were receiving.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study was conducted to probe whether, compared to a single administration, repeated intake of MSG could lead to increased complaints of untoward affects and evidence of accumulation of glutamate. MSG (150&#x02009;mg/kg) was administered daily for 5&#x02009;days and pain sensitivity and side effects monitored. Daily intake of this amount of MSG did not result in significant reports of spontaneous pain. However, it did lead to a sustained mechanical sensitization of the masseter muscle that lasted for the duration of MSG administration. This pain sensitizing effect of MSG was not observed in the temporalis muscle, suggesting that the effect was site specific. Daily intake of MSG also caused headaches and dizziness for at least one day out of five in 57% of subjects. Although tolerance to most side effects of MSG administration appeared to occur, as evidenced by a decrease in the frequency of side effect complaints, the frequency of headache reports remained relatively constant over the 5&#x02009;days of MSG ingestion. This suggests that tolerance to the headache inducing effects of MSG may not occur. There was also no apparent tolerance to the ability of MSG administration to increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the 5&#x02009;days intervention. Baseline salivary concentrations of glutamate remained constant and were not different between the MSG and placebo sessions. These concentrations are similar to a previous study that reported mean saliva concentrations of glutamate of 18&#x000b1;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M in 18 subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, administration of MSG tended to increase salivary glutamate concentration each day, which suggests the potential that accumulation might have been occurring. These findings suggest that daily consumption of elevated amounts of MSG increases craniofacial pain symptoms in otherwise healthy subjects.</p><p>There are some differences in the response properties of the masseter and temporalis muscles to glutamate that may underlie the finding of a masseter muscle selective mechanical sensitizing effect of MSG. Elevated concentrations of glutamate induce mechanical sensitization of masticatory muscle nociceptors through activation of peripheral NMDA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been found that there is a lower expression of NMDA receptors by nociceptors that innervate the temporalis muscle and that the response of temporalis nociceptors to peripheral NMDA receptor activation is less robust than masseter muscle nociceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that there is also a lower expression of peripheral NMDA receptors by nociceptors that innervate the temporalis muscle in healthy human subjects, which results in the temporalis muscle being less sensitive to orally consumed MSG than the masseter muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>There was a very consistent, albeit relatively small, increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after oral intake of MSG each day. There is recent evidence that increased dietary intake of glutamate over a 5&#x02009;year period is correlated with an increase in systolic blood pressure, which was more pronounced in women than in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is also important to consider whether MSG-induced increases in blood pressure account for the increased incidence of headaches observed in the present as well as previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although earlier work suggested that elevated blood pressure causes headaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], more recent work does not support a strong association. For example, in a large population of Icelandic men and women, it was found that elevated systolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with migraine headache in both men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. There is also no difference in mean or systolic blood pressure in women with chronic daily headache and women without this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than hypertension may explain MSG-induced headaches.</p><p>Glutamate has also been shown to dilate intracranial and extracranial blood vessels through a peripheral NMDA receptor mechanism that involves the release of nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Many therapeutically employed vasodilators appear to cause headaches as one of their side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. For example, infusion of nitroglycerin reliably induces a headache, which is thought to be due to dilation of extracerebral arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In a recent study in migraine headache patients, infusion of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), a potent neuropeptide vasodilator and migraine headache inducer, was shown to induce vasodilation of arteries only on the side of the migraine headache pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. On the other hand, vasodilation itself is not able to induce pain that occurs only when periovascular nerve endings are sensitized. This shows that a neural factor, i. e. sensitization, seems to be related to chronic MSG administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We speculate that it could be vasodilation of extracranial blood vessels through peripheral NMDA receptor activation that mediates MSG headaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Baseline salivary concentrations of glutamate did not increase over the 5&#x02009;days of MSG intake, however, post MSG glutamate concentrations increased over the 5&#x02009;day period. Glutamate has an apparent half-life of about 30&#x02009;min, which suggests that it would be completely cleared from the blood within 4&#x02009;hrs of ingestion of MSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previously, it was reported that a single oral dose of 150&#x02009;mg/kg MSG resulted in peak blood glutamate concentrations of a little over 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, which occurred 30-45&#x02009;min after ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This suggests that salivary glutamate concentrations are about 25-50% of blood concentrations. It has been suggested that as much as 40% of a 150&#x02009;mg/kg oral dose of MSG is removed by and stored in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Increased peak levels in the saliva over the 5&#x02009;days could reflect saturation of storage sites in the skeletal muscle. Animal research suggests that after systemic administration of MSG (50&#x02009;mg/kg i.v.) there is a rapid rise in glutamate concentration in the masseter muscle that is associated with significant mechanical sensitization of muscle nociceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is likely that oral MSG consumption increases glutamate concentration in the masseter muscle of human subjects and that this underlies the mechanical sensitization of the masseter muscle seen in the present study.</p><p>Although the MSG was dissolved in sugar free lemon soda, which we have previously found masks the taste of MSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the vast majority of subjects correctly identified the substance administered to them when asked at the end of each 5&#x02009;days session. Considering the significant increase in adverse effects, which occurred during MSG ingestion, this result is understandable. Nevertheless, it does mean that we cannot consider this study truly blind, and this lack of subject blinding might have influenced findings that relied on psychophysical assessments, such as PPT and PPTol, and reporting of side effects. However, it should be noted that even though PPT and PPTol were assessed in two jaw closing muscles, significant differences were only found for the masseter muscle. This suggests that even if subjects thought they knew what they were receiving their responses were not reflective of any systematic bias. Also, the administration of placebo can induce adverse effects such as headache, which complicates clarification of adverse reactions induced by MSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Though adverse effects of headache in the placebo week also could be observed in the result of the present study, it was seen to a significantly lesser extent than in the MSG week. This may imply that an accumulation of MSG by oral administration could be a factor best avoided by TMD and headache patients. Mechanical sensitization of masseter muscles is one of the typical symptoms of TMD and there is a well-known overlap between painful TMD and headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present study suggests that individuals who consume elevated amounts of MSG in their diet are more likely to suffer from headaches and have masseter muscle sensitivity, two symptoms associated with myofascial TMD. Although far from definitive, the present findings may indicate that there is a link between diet and susceptibility to the development of chronic orofacial pain conditions that include TMD and headache. If future studies can confirm a link, dietary modification could become an important part of treatment aimed at ameliorating symptoms associated with these chronic craniofacial pain conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interest</title><p>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest in the publication of this manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AS participated in collecting data and drafted the manuscript.
