We assessed the KORAn JDTic for safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial evaluating single oral doses in healthy adult males. Predose and postdose safety assessments included orthostatic vital signs; 6-lead continuous telemetry monitoring (approximately 16&#x02009;h predose to 24&#x02009;h postdose); 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs); clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis; psychomotor functioning (using the Wayne Saccadic Fixator (WSF)); and adverse events. As a potential indicator of JDTic effects on affect, the POMS Standard instrument was administered predose and daily postdose Days 1&#x02013;6. At 1&#x02009;mg, 2 of the 6 JDTic (and 0/6 placebo) subjects experienced a single, asymptomatic event of multiple beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Their events were temporally similar with respect to time postdose (and the postdose timing of an NSVT event in a monkey). These events triggered a study stopping rule. No differences were observed between the placebo and JDTic subjects with respect to clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, orthostatic vital signs, WSF, or 12-lead ECG parameters. Plasma JDTic levels were below the lower limit of quantitation (0.1&#x02009;nM) in all subjects. There were no significant differences in POMS scores between the placebo and JDTic groups. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it suggests that NSVT is a potential JDTic toxicity in humans. Given the therapeutic potential of KORAn, further investigation is needed to determine whether a significant JDTic human cardiac effect indeed exists, and if so, whether it is specific to JDTic or represents a KORAn class effect.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and its endogenous ligand dynorphin are enriched in brain regions involved in stress response, and potential clinical utility for KOR antagonists (KORAn) has been shown in depression and substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll and Carlezon, 2013</xref>). JDTic is a potent and selective KORAn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) that in preclinical models shows antidepressant and anxiolytic activity and reduces the signs of nicotine withdrawal, the stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-reinforced behavior, and manifestations of alcohol abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carroll and Dolle, 2014</xref>). KORAn are a drug class of considerable pharmaceutical interest, and RTI International intended to develop JDTic for several indications. This article reports the results of the first-in-human safety study.</p><p>Kappa-active compounds also have cardiovascular effects; however, results are mixed. In most rat studies, kappa opioid receptor agonists (KORAg) are cardioprotective (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), reduce arrhythmias (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jin-Cheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lishmanov <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peart <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xiu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), have positive inotropic effects (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pyle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and are a component of ischemic preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zatta <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Consequently, KORAn could have negative effects. One study reported that highly selective KORAn activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruchas <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In another study, lipopolysaccharide activation of JNK caused disruption of fatty acid oxidation by a human ventricular-derived cardiomyocyte cell line and caused cardiac dysfunction in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drosatos <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). However, in dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartlage <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and swine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coles <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), KORAn are cardioprotective. Also, negative inotropic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ventura <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>) and pro-arrhythmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bian <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) effects of U-50,488H and cardioprotective effects of nor-BNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) are described in rats.</p><p>Biopsied human ventricular myocytes contain dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ationu <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>), and surgical specimens of human atrial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lendeckel <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and pooled human heart extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) contain KOR mRNA. In human hearts, there are KOR immunoreactive fine nerve fibers, cardiomyocytes, and cells resembling intrinsic cardiac adrenergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sobanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), consistent with rabbit cardiomyocyte immunoprecipitation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Surendra <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). The KORAg U-50,488H has negative inotropic effects on isolated human right atrial strips not antagonized by the selective KORAn nor-BNI or the broader-acting naloxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Llobell and Laorden, 1995</xref>). Similarly, U-50,488H has effects on transient outward K<sup>+</sup> and ultrarapid delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> currents in human pediatric atrial myocytes that are not antagonized by nor-BNI or naloxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, in human subjects undergoing angioplasty, the acute ischemic preconditioning effect of the first of a pair of balloon occlusions was abolished by naloxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tomai <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Ventricular tachycardia is listed under &#x02018;Precautions&#x02019; and &#x02018;Adverse Reactions&#x02019; in the product insert for naloxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hospira, 2007</xref>) and is described in case reports (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunter, 2005</xref>). In the first-in-human study of the KORAn LY2456302 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lowe <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>, p. 6), &#x02018;a 5-beat ventricular tachycardia occurring approximately 8&#x02009;h after receiving a single 25-mg dose&#x02019; was observed in 1 of the 21 subjects (5%) receiving the drug, which does not activate JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melief <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Nonclinical studies (data on file, RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC) identified potential JDTic electrocardiogram (ECG) toxicities but at a human equivalent dose (HED) of &#x0003e;6000&#x02009;mg and plasma concentrations &#x0003e;920&#x02009;nM. Review of the first 24&#x02009;h of ECG following a 200&#x02009;mg/kg intragastric dose of JDTic (HED of 4500&#x02009;mg) revealed one of the six cynomolgus monkeys (17%) had three ventricular premature complexes in a row (by definition, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)), at 11&#x02009;h 51&#x02009;min postdose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). NSVT in cynomolgus monkeys can be an incidental finding; 16- to 24-h Holter monitoring of a colony of 62 monkeys revealed ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 8 (13%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Macallum and Houston, 1993</xref>). Asymptomatic NSVT can be observed in humans (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Min <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). NSVT prevalence in normal, healthy males is described in four publications using qualitatively different populations (eg, inclusion of females, significantly higher median age), with estimates in the range of 2&#x02013;3.2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjerregaard, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodsky <italic>et al</italic>, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke <italic>et al</italic>, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinkle <italic>et al</italic>, 1969</xref>).</p><p>Following the human trial, a preliminary analysis of JDTic effects in human iPSC cardiomyocyte cultures (approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) estimated that the concentration at which &#x0003e;20% of the spontaneous beats were arrhythmic was between 2 and 20&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). These concentrations are well below the IC<sub>50</sub> values observed for hERG channel, human cardiac sodium channel, and guinea pig L-type calcium channel (5000&#x02009;nM) (data on file, RTI).</p></sec><sec><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The JDTic-001 study was a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single, escalating oral doses of JDTic (1, 3, and 10&#x02009;mg) in healthy male subjects, in three separate cohorts using a semiadaptive dosing plan (cohorts 1 and 2 comprised four subjects and cohort 3 comprised eight subjects, in each case randomized 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 JDTic:placebo). Prior to dosing a subsequent cohort, all safety and PK data were reviewed by a Safety Review Team (SRT) as guided by a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). If adverse events (AEs) considered to be at least possibly related to study medication occurred during the first two cohorts, an additional four subjects were dosed at that same dose level, unless otherwise determined by the SRT. A final amendment put in place after the initial eight subjects were dosed stipulated that if AEs requiring study termination occurred during an eight-subject cohort, an additional four blinded subjects would be dosed with placebo; consequently, this portion is single blind.</p><p>DSMP stopping rules included typical criteria for serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of specific interest (AESI) (eg, terminating the study if &#x02a7e;25% of a dosing cohort experienced a possibly or definitely drug-related AESI, such as NSVT), as well as limitations on JDTic plasma maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve from zero to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>). The starting dose in the trial, 1&#x02009;mg, was predicted to result in a maximum plasma concentration of 0.04&#x02009;nM (below the lower level of quantitation, 0.1&#x02009;nM); this was reduced from a proposed 3&#x02009;mg starting dose, in response to a Food and Drug Administration clinical hold. Also in response, protocol ECG exclusion criteria were made even more restrictive than normal (eg, PR interval &#x0003e;180&#x02009;ms, QTcB interval &#x0003e;420&#x02009;ms), and telemetry was expanded to begin the night before dosing and to continue for 24&#x02009;h postdose.</p><p>Potential subjects presented to the clinic within 14 days of their intended dose date to undergo a battery of screening assessments. Eligible subjects came to the clinic the day before dosing for eligibility reconfirmation. Subjects remained in the clinic that night and for 6 days postdose for safety assessments and timed blood and urine collections. If there were no ongoing safety issues on Day 6, subjects were sent home from the clinic and they returned 14 days later for a follow-up safety assessment. Subjects were then discharged from the study.</p><p>This study was approved by the clinical site&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 Consolidated Guidance for Good Clinical Practice (1996), the US Code of Federal Regulations 21 parts 50 and 56, and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (as amended in 1996). It was performed at Celerion in Tempe, AZ, and is reported at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01431586).</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Subjects were healthy males, 18&#x02013;50 years, &#x02a7e;50&#x02009;kg in weight, body mass index (BMI) 18&#x02013;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with normal vital signs (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, oral temperature), a negative prestudy drug screen (alcohol, cannabinoids, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opioids, phencyclidine, barbiturates, cotinine), no history of use of illicit drugs or other substances of abuse within 12 months of the screening visit, no tobacco use for &#x02a7e;90 days prior to screening, and no history of cardiovascular disease.

However, two JDTic subjects (33%) had asymptomatic single instances of NSVT on telemetry, triggering a study stopping rule.</p><p>We were surprised by the surfacing of a potential NSVT safety signal at the initial 1&#x02009;mg dose. Applying the published 2&#x02013;3.2% prevalence range of NSVT to the study population, the project statistician calculated the probability range of having exactly two otherwise healthy people with NSVT in a random sample of six people to be 0.006&#x02013;0.013. In terms of study site experience with NSVT prevalence during the previous 9 years, it is estimated that approximately one in 3000 subjects showed an episode of NSVT. This is based on numerous studies which had cardiac rhythm monitoring either as a function of safety telemetry or as a function of thorough QT analysis. However, the full ECG/telemetry/Holter record was not reviewed by a cardiologist in all of these studies. Nevertheless, these site-specific data imply a very low prevalence.</p><p>Although the evidence is circumstantial, based on the temporal similarity of the 2 individual occurrences of NSVT out of 6 subjects (33%) who received JDTic, the statistical unlikelihood that the 2 observed occurrences of NSVT were preexisting conditions in the affected subjects, the temporal similarity to the episode of NSVT observed in 1 of the 6 (17%) monitored monkeys dosed with JDTic, and the existence of a possible causal mechanism, NSVT could be a JDTic toxicity in humans. Certainly, there is no longer any commercial interest in the clinical development of JDTic.</p><p>Given the preclinical and clinical data presented in the Introduction, it is plausible that JDTic could have a direct cardiac interaction in human beings, although perhaps not through the classic KOR, which itself has myriad potential cellular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruchas and Chavkin, 2010</xref>). Although plasma JDTic levels were unquantifiable (&#x0003c;0.1&#x02009;nM) in this human study, there is preclinical data to suggest that 1&#x02009;mg could be an efficacious human dose for KOR antagonism. The intragastric JDTic AD<sub>50</sub> for inhibition of the effects of exogenous enadoline-induced behaviors (15&#x02009;min postdose) in cynomolgus monkeys was 0.025&#x02009;mg/kg, which would equate to an HED of 0.5&#x02009;mg (with a predicted human <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of 0.02&#x02009;nM) (data on file, RTI). Once again, these concentrations are much less than the lowest observed to cause prolongation of QTc in cynomolgus monkeys (&#x0003e;920&#x02009;nM).</p><p>JDTic activates JNK, which can in turn cause disruption of fatty acid oxidation in a human ventricular-derived cardiomyocyte cell line and cardiac dysfunction in mice, a potential mechanism through which JDTic could cause cardiac dysfunction in humans. However, LY2456302 does not activate JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melief <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>); nevertheless, a single episode of NSVT was observed among 21 subjects (5%) who received at least one dose of LY2456302 in the first-in-human study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lowe <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). The &#x02018;5-beat ventricular tachycardia (occurred) approximately 8&#x02009;h after a single 25-mg dose&#x02019; in one of the eight subjects receiving that dose, but NSVT was not observed in any of the seven subjects receiving a 60-mg dose. The numbers are few, but here NSVT is not dose-related, so again the single episode might be unrelated to the KORAn activity of LY2456302. Still, given its occurrence and the NSVT that have been associated with naloxone, there remains the possibility that a human cardiac response to these agents could be associated more directly with the KOR itself and be a class effect of KORAn rather than specific toxicities associated with the molecules. It simply is impossible to know from the currently available data.</p><p>Given the therapeutic potential of the KORAn agents, it is imperative that further preclinical studies using human materials (eg, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with human cardiomyocytes) be conducted to clarify whether there is in fact a human cardiac effect of JDTic or its metabolites; and, if so, the mechanism by which it occurs (ie, class effect or specific JDTic-related toxicity). Depending on these <italic>in vitro</italic> data, further human trials of JDTic might be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING AND DISCLOSURE</title><p>RTI International is a registered trademark and a trade name of Research Triangle Institute.
