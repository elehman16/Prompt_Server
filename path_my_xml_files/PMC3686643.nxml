It is derived from patients&#x02019; own blood and mixed with an agent to activate platelet formation. PRP works by increasing the number of platelets, which release growth factors to help healing of a particular area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Oral surgeons have used PRP for many years and it is now being widely used in orthopedic interventions. Studies have included comparisons of PRP injections with a steroid or analgesic injection or comparing PRP application during surgery with no PRP application.</p><p>Current clinical evidence suggests PRP could have beneficial effects on hard and soft tissue healing due to the presence of growth factors stored in the platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The evidence also shows that PRP applications can be used to accelerate bone and soft tissue regeneration following tendon injuries and arthroplasty. Outcomes include decreased inflammation, reduced blood loss and post-treatment pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Previous studies assessing the use of PRP in orthopedics have involved plantar fasciitis, lateral epicondylitis, Achilles tendonitis and arthroplasty. However, there is little evidence regarding the use of PRP in shoulder pathologies.</p><p>Shoulder tendinopathies, such as rotator cuff impingement and tears, are an increasing problem in orthopedic practice and reportedly account for up to 70% of shoulder pain problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Impingement is the most frequent cause of shoulder pain in the general population. The term &#x02018;rotator cuff tear&#x02019; refers to structural failure and tissue disruption in at least one of the four muscles and tendons that form the rotator cuff. Any tear that involves rotator cuff disruption that does not extend all the way through the tendon is termed a partial-thickness tear (PTT). PTTs are more prevalent than full-thickness tears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Information is also lacking regarding the risk of progression of PTTs to full-thickness tears.</p><p>Impingement and rotator cuff tears are associated with progressive change in the shape of the acromion, with spurs forming at its anteroinferior margin. These spurs are thought to narrow the subacromial space, thereby making physical contact more likely, particularly in certain positions of the arm (for example, the painful arc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and resulting in inflammation, pain and potentially some loss of function.</p><p>A high proportion of patients with impingement and partial-thickness tears will respond to conservative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The most common surgical intervention for impingement and partial-thickness tears is arthroscopic subacromial decompression (SAD). Indications for surgery include persistent and severe pain combined with functional restrictions that are resistant to conservative measures. Despite surgery being considered at this point, some reports show that surgery is no more effective than physiotherapy in the relief of pain when used in patients at this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recent studies indicate the poor vascularization present in the area around tendinopathies possibly prevents full healing capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The application of PRP may help to revascularize the area and consequently promote tendon healing. Such evidence highlights an opportunity to explore the efficacy of PRP use in subacromial decompression surgery for rotator cuff pathologies.</p><p>The objective is to assess the effectiveness of treating subacromial impingement syndrome and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears with autologous platelet-rich plasma. We plan to compare the outcome of standard arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery with the outcome of the same surgery plus the administration of autologous platelet-rich plasma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>PARot is a parallel blinded superiority-type randomized controlled trial. The two groups are: arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery and arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery with application of PRP.</p><p>The study will run for 3&#x000a0;years. Recruitment will be for 24&#x000a0;months with final follow-up at 1&#x000a0;year post surgery. The final year will involve collation and analysis of the data. Only patients will be blinded as to whether they received PRP or not.</p><p>Patients identified for the study will have failed conservative treatment for their shoulder impingement or partial-thickness tear and will be listed for subacromial decompression surgery. Conservative treatment may include physiotherapy and injections of steroid and or local anesthetic. The routine step following failed conservative treatment would usually involve being put on the waiting list for surgery (SAD).</p><p>Patients will be identified in, and recruited from, the shoulder outpatient clinics at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS Trust, Oxford. Diagnosis of shoulder impingement or partial-thickness tear will be confirmed with ultrasound in the clinic and the patient will be put on the waiting list for surgery. A surgical member of the research team will introduce the trial to the patient and refer them to a research nurse for recruitment.</p><p>Informed consent procedures, baseline assessments (including the Oxford shoulder score) and randomization are performed up to 3&#x000a0;days prior to surgery due to organizational requirements in relation to operating schedules and required equipment. Randomization is undertaken using sealed envelopes based on a simple computer-generated randomization list.</p><p>Routine perioperative care will proceed and the patient will have their operation as planned.</p><p>As randomization occurs very close to the point of treatment, patients will be followed up in clinic at 6&#x000a0;weeks and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months post treatment. Patients will be blinded to the treatment they are allocated to. Assessors and surgeons are unable to be blinded in this instance. All patients will remain on the waiting list for surgery as per standard care and may have their surgery at the planned date.

Evaluation of routine basic blood tests will also be included in the PARot assessments. A full blood count (taken as part of routine preoperative assessment and not a study intervention) will indicate the presence of clotting substances and any PRP contraindications the patient may have.</p><p>Patients will be required to attend a clinic appointment for assessments at 6&#x000a0;weeks and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months post treatment.

The range of available scores is 0 (worst) to 48 (best) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The score is reliable and valid.

The procedure involves insertion of an arthroscope into the glenohumeral joint where the joint surface is inspected along with the intra-articular portion of the long head of the biceps and the joint surface of the rotator cuff tendons. Once this has been performed the arthroscope is removed and inserted into the subacromial bursa, which lies outside the rotator cuff tendons and beneath the acromion process of the scapula. In the bursa, the acromion and superior surface of the rotator cuff are assessed to ensure the coracoacromial ligament and the Acromioclavicular (AC) joint remains intact. The projecting under surface of the distal part of the acromion is resected. The intervention is considered to be a well-established and well-documented procedure. Patients with full cuff tears noted at the time of surgery will not be eligible and will be excluded from the trial at operation.</p></sec><sec><title>Subacromial decompression surgery with autologous platelet-rich plasma</title><p>This group will receive the same operation as described above plus an autologous platelet-rich plasma concentrate injection into the rotator cuff tendon during surgery. PRP can be applied by a variety of methods: as a gel, as an injection, as a sutured film during surgery, sprayed directly onto repaired tissue or injected subcutaneously. This study proposes the use of a gel sprayed directly onto the decompression area.</p><p>Specific preparation techniques will be stipulated by the company providing the PRP device. Described below is a guideline for the preparation involved in administering PRP, which was taken from the protocol of the PATH study (REC Reference: 09/H0605/78), also run in this department.</p><p>PRP is prepared using a sterile technique in the theatre. First, 50&#x000a0;ml of venous blood will be withdrawn from the patient into a syringe. The syringe will be attached to the selective platelet separator device and the blood is transferred into the device. The device will separate platelets and remove red blood cells and white blood cells. The result is 5&#x000a0;ml to 6&#x000a0;ml of platelet-rich concentrate (PRC), which will be collected in an attached syringe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The 5-ml syringe containing the concentrate is attached via a dual injection kit to another syringe containing bovine thrombin (200 units) and 1&#x000a0;ml of 10% calcium chloride (activator). The dual syringes are used to inject the PRC into the subacromial space.</p><p>Reviews in oral surgery recommend that the derivation of PRP must be a sterile process. Platelets must not be lysed or damaged in any way, as damaged platelets may not release their growth factors. Studies that suggest there is no benefit to PRP application may have suffered from poor preparation of the PRP solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is therefore important to send excess PRP to the laboratory for platelet analyses and quality assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Data obtained from tendon tissue samples from all patients will also provide valuable information regarding the integrity of the tendon including any effects PRP may have on this.</p></sec><sec><title>Tendon biopsies</title><p>Tendon biopsies for histological assessments will be taken during surgery for both groups of patients. This will involve a small amount of tendon tissue (the size of a small grain of rice) excised using a 14G core biopsy needle under ultrasound guidance. This will be taken in a sterile manner as part of the surgical procedure before the application of the PRP.</p><p>A further biopsy will be taken from both groups of patients during their 3-month follow-up visit. This biopsy will be taken using an ultrasound guidance technique and a biopsy needle in exactly the same manner as performed at surgery, under sterile conditions. Local anesthetic will be infiltrated around the area of the biopsy to numb the region before the tissue sample is taken. This technique has been successfully trialed and used in previous studies conducted by this research group (ethics ref: 09/H0605/111 and 09/0605/78).</p></sec><sec><title>Venous blood sampling</title><p>A sample of 18&#x000a0;ml of venous blood will be obtained from the patient for analysis and inclusion in the Oxford Musculoskeletal BioBank project (ethics ref: 09/H606/11). The sample will be taken prior to commencement of surgery once the patient is anesthetized. For those patients in the PRP group this sample will be taken using the same needle as for the blood taken for making up the PRP solution. In this way patients will be blinded to their group allocation as both groups will have a single venepuncture site and the sampling volume will be unknown to the patient as they will have been anesthetized prior to venepuncture.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Adverse events have not been reported well in previous studies involving PRP. This study will record expected adverse events and will report unexpected events that are related to the patients&#x02019; participation in the study. PARot&#x02019;s final report will include a section on adverse events even if this is just to confirm that none were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics and analysis</title><p>The planned study examines a continuous response variable (OSS) from independent control and experimental subjects. In previous studies the response within each subject group was found to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3 points. If the true difference (or the meaningful clinical difference) in the experimental and control means were 3 points on the OSS, we would need to study 17 experimental subjects and 17 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05 (&#x003b1;). To allow for losses to follow-up we aim to recruit 20 patients in each arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of endpoints</title><p>Reporting of outcomes will follow CONSORT Guidelines. Full details of the planned analysis will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan and approved by the trial team prior to any analysis being undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>The Oxford shoulder score</title><p>The OSS at 12&#x000a0;months is the primary outcome measure and the primary hypothesis is based upon this evaluation. The design is a simple two-group cross-sectional comparison. The data will be first checked for normality using histograms and Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk tests. Independent <italic>t</italic>-tests (assuming normal distribution and equal variance) will then be performed to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean OSS between the two groups.
