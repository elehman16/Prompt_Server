There are major consequences for families and for society; approximately 25% of affected infants will die in the neonatal unit and 40% will develop cerebral palsy. Others will have long-term neurodevelopmental deficits that result in a difficult life and lost potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Within the last decade, therapeutic hypothermia for infants with perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy has been studied in several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in industrialized countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Meta-analyses of these trials show that therapeutic hypothermia increases survival with normal neurological function (pooled risk ratio of 1.53) with a number needed to treat of 8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5 - 17) and in survivors reduces the rates of severe disability and cerebral palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therapeutic hypothermia under intensive care settings appears safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therapeutic hypothermia is now widely offered to moderately or severely asphyxiated infants in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In 2010 in the UK the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) endorsed <italic>Therapeutic Hypothermia with Intracorporeal Temperature Monitoring for Hypoxic Perinatal Brain Injury </italic>(see website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11315/48809/48809.pdf">http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11315/48809/48809.pdf</ext-link>)</p><p>The global burden of disease estimates indicate that perinatal asphyxia is a very significant problem in low and mid-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; for example in sub-Saharan Africa, neonatal encephalopathy related to perinatal asphyxia is ~10-20 times more common than in the developed world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Globally, perinatal asphyxia is responsible for 42 million disability life adjusted years, double that due to diabetes and three quarters of that due to HIV/AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Almost one quarter of the world's 4 million annual neonatal deaths are caused by perinatal asphyxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and 99% of these deaths occur in low and mid-resource settings. These intrapartum-related deaths account for as many deaths as does malaria but they are not addressed in any global health policy.</p><p>A safe and effective therapy for neonatal encephalopathy appropriate for low resource settings is likely to benefit millions of infants and families. There are, however, several compelling reasons why the efficacy and safety data on therapeutic hypothermia from high-income countries cannot be simply extrapolated to mid and low resource settings. For example <bold>(i) </bold>brain injury may be already established due to multiple antenatal insults (e.g. maternal malnutrition and other co-morbidities), <bold>(ii) </bold>prolonged obstructed labour, long delays in carrying out emergency caesarean sections, and lack of effective resuscitation and networks for neonatal transport may all reduce or nullify the therapeutic window for hypothermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <bold>(iii) </bold>the incidence and profile of perinatal infections in this population is different. Cooling in the presence of infection might even be deleterious as hypothermia may impair innate immune function, including neutrophil migration and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], although it is reassuring that the neonatal cooling trials from industrialized countries did not show a higher incidence of sepsis in cooled infants. It is important to note that hypothermia during sepsis in adult patients has been associated with increased mortality and higher circulating levels of TNF-a AND IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. One explanation for the higher morbidity and mortality associated with hypothermia in some clinical settings may be the prolongation of NF-KB activation and altered cytokine gene expression known to occur with moderate hypothermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, there is convincing experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and epidemiological evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] suggesting that a 'dual hit' of infection and ischaemia results in disproportionately more severe brain injury and increases in the risk of cerebral palsy. It is likely that this 'dual hit' is one of the factors responsible for the poorer neurological outcome reported from low and mid-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and it is not known if therapeutic hypothermia would be neuroprotective in such situations. <bold>(iv) </bold>cooling may be unsafe in the presence of meconium aspiration and pulmonary hypertension where facilities for advanced multi-organ support may not be available; <bold>(v) </bold>the benefits of cooling may only be achieved in units with optimal neurological monitoring which may not be possible in low income settings. <bold>(vi) </bold>cooling equipment used in high income countries is expensive, requires maintenance support and has ongoing costs. There is therefore an important need for validation of 'low tech', safe and economical cooling methods.</p><p>Uganda was chosen as an optimal site for the pilot study because of the long tradition of research at Mulago Hospital and Makerere University. In 2006 the UCL Uganda Women's Health Initiative was set up between UCL and Mulago Hospital, Makerere University and Hospice Africa. Ten projects related to women's health were set up under the Uganda Women's Health initiative. One of the neonatal projects initially focused on training midwives in neonatal resuscitation, however MN was very keen to help the large number of infants with perinatal asphyxia admitted to the special care baby unit at Mulago each week.

The nurses also recruited babies and obtained informed consent There were clear protocols and algorithms for recruitment of patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), cooling to the target temperature (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), scoring the Thompson encephalopathy score (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], performing the structured neurological examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and guidelines for the cranial ultrasound protocol for essential views (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Ten other helper neonatal nurses facilitated the study by helping with the care of the other patients on the special care baby unit. Three senior doctors (MN, NN and JM) were responsible for taking informed consent from the family and for performing the Thompson score for entry eligibility and on days 1-4, the standardized and scorable neurological examination on days 7 and 17 and the cranial ultrasounds on days 1,3 and 7.

Infants were nursed in a cot naked or lightly covered with a cotton sheet. Active cooling was by placing a mattress under the infant - the mattress comprised three commercially available water bottles filled with tepid tap water (25&#x000b0;C) and covered in a cotton sheet. The tap water temperature was fairly stable throughout the 24 hours and generally around 22-25&#x000b0;C. The sheet-covered water bottles were in contact with as much of the skin surface area of the infant as possible. The target rectal temperature was 33-34&#x000b0;C. The rectal, axillary, ambient and surface water bottle temperatures were monitored continuously and stored using the data logger. Our pre-clinical work suggested that the bottle water would need to be changed every 8-12 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. If warming was required, the infant was dressed or covered with blankets and sheets as required. Cooling was concluded 72 hours after randomization or earlier if clinical circumstances dictated. The rectal temperature was then be allowed to rise by no more than 0.5&#x000b0;C per hour to 37&#x000b0;C, by slowly reducing the contact of the baby with the water bottles.

Head circumference was measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Local health workers with experience in neurological assessment of newborn infants helped with communication in the local language. The Griffiths developmental quotient was chosen for this study as it has been standardized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and validated in a multiracial South African setting, and used for assessment of outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

The temperature data from the standard care and standard care plus therapeutic hypothermia groups were compared using t-tests. The Thompson scores, the neurological exam scores at 17 days and the cranial ultrasound scores were compared with neurodevelopmental outcome at 18-22 months using appropriate regression analysis that will allow for repeated measures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Partial data from this trial have been reported briefly elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. There were three main points reported in this correspondence: (i) Therapeutic hypothermia with whole body cooling using a low tech, low cost cooling device (water bottle filled with tepid tap water form the neonatal unit) is feasible in a low resource setting. (ii) The rectal temperature of standard care infants was hypothermic for a mean of 15.6 (standard deviation 14.6)h after birth in this setting where only swaddling and gloves filled with hot water are used to keep babies warm. Such passive cooling in term babies with perinatal asphyxia was first described some 50 years ago; babies with 'asphyxia' (defined as a failure to establish respiration within 3 min of birth) were 2&#x000b0;C cooler than non-asphyxiated infants for up to 16 h after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This phenomenon may be due to impairment in non-shivering thermogenesis in asphyxiated infants, which is controlled centrally by the hypothalamus. Larger trial sizes might be required in this setting due to dilution of the hypothermic effect in the cooled group by the standard care group. Such "passive" cooling in the standard care group in this setting where the only method of re-warming was swaddling differs to the developed world trials where at least one third of the standard care infants had an elevated core temperature during the first 3 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; (iii) Higher mortality was seen in the cooled vs the standard care group (risk ratio: 5.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-37)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], absolute difference: 0.267 (95% CI 0.029, 0.505). More infants with severe neonatal encephalopathy were randomized to the cooled group, which could explain the excess deaths; nevertheless the possibility of infection related deaths can't be excluded, as there were no facilities for infection screening at the time. Importantly, although the study was not powered to look at safety or efficacy, these findings underline the importance of exerting caution in the application of therapeutic hypothermia in low and mid resource settings where the patient risk factors and environment are very different.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Cranial ultrasound, neurological assessment and neurodevelopmental outcome</title><p>Cranial ultrasound has been used extensively in neonatal practice in the developed world, since it is a convenient technique to visualize the neonatal brain through the anterior fontanelle serially without moving or disturbing the patient. Cranial ultrasound is helpful to exclude structural abnormality suggesting metabolic and other diagnoses, detect calcification and cysts suggestive of viral infection and detect atrophy suggestive of long standing damage. It will also identify cerebral haemorrhage. Sequential observation of the evolution of injury following a hypoxic ischaemic insult at birth is helpful for defining the pattern and severity of lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], although MRI is the imaging modality of choice to accurately define the pattern and severity of injury and prognosticate outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Access to MRI is not possible in most low resource hospital settings. In this proposed study, serial cranial ultrasound studies will provide some evidence about the incidence of established injury and the evolving pattern and severity of injury in relation to the outcome. Cranial ultrasound is able to provide some very useful information on the pattern and severity of brain injury following perinatal asphyxia - for example a clear and persistent abnormality of the thalami and basal ganglia on cranial ultrasound correlates with MRI findings, which indicate a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Other patterns of brain injury such as the watershed injury are, however, more difficult to detect on cranial ultrasound.</p><p>This is the first study of therapeutic hypothermia in a low resource setting that will include detailed cranial ultrasound imaging, have a comparative control or typical population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and a neonatal neurological assessment in the 3<sup>rd </sup>week after birth and at 18-22 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Cooling in low and mid resource settings</title><p>In early 2000 when therapeutic hypothermia was being considered as a therapy in industrialized countries, initial studies consisted of pilot feasibility studies in ~40 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These pilot studies were necessary before moving onto large RCTs in industrialized countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We suggest that the same progression is needed in both low and mid-resource settings.</p><p>This small pilot study suggests that in settings such as Uganda, future studies need to focus on identifying risk factors for NE (particularly the role of perinatal infection in the aetiology and outcome of NE); we are currently engaged in such case controlled studies at Mulago Hospital. In such low resource settings with high rates of neonatal mortality it may be inappropriate to implement cooling without acceptable standards of antenatal care, delivery, resuscitation, respiratory management and infection control; effective dissemination of knowledge of best clinical practice may bring about greater reduction in asphyxia related mortality and morbidity initially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Once these practices are introduced and maintained, clinical trials may be the next stage for a more sustained long-term improvement in neonatal outcome.</p><p>In mid resource settings and especially in those with a good infrastructure for resuscitation, neonatal care and follow-up, such as in parts of Asia and South America, a measured and careful approach is needed to ensure that the highest quality trials of safety and efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia are performed. It is possible that unless a trial is performed that is relevant to mid resource settings, there will be a creeping, uncertain introduction of hypothermia, with constant worries regarding residual safety concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, given the sheer magnitude of the problem of perinatal asphyxia and NE worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the establishment of an effective and safe therapy would have a high impact on medical practice throughout the world, save lives and reduce the burden on our societies. In 2009, we performed a cooling feasibility study in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and hope that a large Indian RCT of therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy can start in 2012.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>IJ, AC and NR had the idea to do this study.
