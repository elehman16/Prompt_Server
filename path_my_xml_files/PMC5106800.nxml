Approximately one million UK children have been diagnosed with asthma, and almost all of them will have been prescribed a short-acting inhaled beta2 agonist (usually salbutamol) as a &#x02018;reliever&#x02019; medication to help control their day-to-day symptoms. Inhaled salbutamol is thus one of the most commonly prescribed medicines for children in the UK and many other countries around the world.</p><p>The dose-response relationship of any medicine must be determined prior to regulatory approval. Such research is relatively straightforward to perform in adults, but more difficult for children. As a consequence, many medicines currently prescribed for children have not undergone age-appropriate testing and so may not be effective or may even induce unnecessary side effects. EU lawmakers have voted for this to change through an emphasis on such evaluation in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The bronchodilator efficacy of inhaled salbutamol in asthma has now been established in both older children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as has the minimum effective dose in these two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, neither efficacy nor minimum effective dose has been established in younger children (defined as aged between 2&#x000a0;years 6&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;years 11&#x000a0;months), despite inhaled salbutamol frequently being prescribed within this age group.</p><p>There are a number of consequences of our lack of knowledge in this area:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>There is much uncertainty about the optimal dose of a beta agonist to use for symptom relief (for example, a variation between individual doses of 2&#x02013;10 puffs is common practice).</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is uncertainty about the optimal dose of a beta agonist for measuring bronchodilator response in the diagnosis of asthma.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is uncertainty about whether to use a beta agonist or alternatives such as ipratropium bromide or montelukast for symptom relief.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>A dose of 2&#x02013;10 puffs of inhaled salbutamol (approximately 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g per puff) is currently prescribed in both primary and secondary care as &#x02018;reliever&#x02019; medicine for young children suffering from recurrent wheeze, a common feature of asthma in this younger age range. This dose is almost always administered via a spacer device, as younger children are unable to coordinate their breathing in order to inhale the medication directly from a metered dose inhaler. Following inhalation, the dose of salbutamol biologically available in the airways depends on many factors, such as breathing technique and airway calibre.</p><p>The urinary salbutamol level 30&#x000a0;min after the administration of an inhaled dose is a reasonable surrogate measure of the biologically available dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, there are no studies where a specific effort has been made to collect a urine sample from a young child in the same manner.</p><p>The biologically available dose of salbutamol in the airway elicits the airway bronchodilator response. It is difficult to monitor side effects in young children, who are often unable to report discomfort such as palpitations or irritability. &#x02018;Hyper-activity&#x02019; is a poorly studied problem that is commonly reported by parents of young children prescribed relatively large doses of salbutamol. In adults and older children, the response of the airway to a inhaled bronchodilator can be measured as changes in airway resistance or expiratory airflow before and after the administration of the bronchodilator. Most measures of airway resistance or airflow require the active co-operation of the patient, but such co-operation is difficult to achieve in young children. Conventional pulmonary function measurements, such as forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second or peak expiratory flow rate, either are impractical or are relatively unreliable in younger children. However, a technique relying on the transient interruption of breathing (known as the interrupter technique) has been recently developed as a reliable test of airway resistance (Rint) in this age group. Recent consensus guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] support the use of Rint in this age group for the measurement of airway resistance and for determining response to bronchodilator medication.</p><p>Thus there is now the possibility of correlating inhaled salbutamol dose with clinical response (measured as change in Rint) in younger children in the age range 2&#x000a0;years 6&#x000a0;months to 6&#x000a0;years 11&#x000a0;months. It is therefore of importance to document the airway response to increasing doses of inhaled salbutamol in this age group. To do this we need to document airway response against 30-min urinary salbutamol, the best available estimate for the bioavailability of salbutamol in the lungs. With expert children&#x02019;s nurse support, we believe that most young children can be persuaded to pass a sample of urine at about 30&#x000a0;min following inhalation. However, we cannot assume that this will happen in all children and have made this a secondary outcome of the trial.</p><p>The proposed work is likely to identify a population of children who do not show a satisfactory response to salbutamol. There is evidence from studies in older children and young adults that one reason for this poor response may be a genetic change in their beta2 receptor (Arg/Gly16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The presence of this polymorphism can be identified by DNA analysis on a simple saliva sample, without the need for specialist pulmonary function equipment. As these samples can easily be obtained in primary care, we propose to investigate whether this polymorphism is an effective marker for poor salbutamol efficacy in these younger children.</p><p>Overall, the proposed research will exploit simple, non-invasive and inexpensive tests that can mostly be performed in an outpatient setting in order to help develop the evidence for the correct dose of salbutamol in younger children with recurrent wheeze who have been prescribed salbutamol by their doctor. It is possible that a small dose of salbutamol, such as 2 puffs (200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) is adequate for most of these children. If this is the case, larger doses, such as 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, should not be prescribed (as is current practice) as they may induce side effects in these children. Secondly, some younger children who are currently prescribed larger doses of salbutamol may in fact be &#x02018;poor responders&#x02019; or &#x02018;non-responders&#x02019; to salbutamol due to their genetic constitution. Such children may benefit from alternative &#x02018;reliever&#x02019; medicines, such as ipratropium or montelukast.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a phase IV, randomised, controlled, observer-blinded, single-centre trial with four parallel groups and a primary endpoint of the immediate bronchodilator response to salbutamol so that we can determine the most appropriate dose for an individual younger child.

If they are interested and are happy to meet the research nurse, this will be arranged. Where appropriate, the patient and carer are provided with a Patient Information Sheet (PIS). In some cases this material will be sent by post. An appointment is arranged at the hospital, where any further queries are addressed. Eligibility criteria are established by the doctor and consent obtained at this visit. Informed consent, where offered, will be received by the research nurse on the day the child attends the study. The research nurse will have already provided written information on the study to both carers and children so they will have had time to consider the information prior to attending their appointment with the research nurse. The nurse will also show pictures of the Rint and saliva collection equipment and demonstrate the equipment. We will ensure that the child and the carer fully understand the implications of the consent and that they understand that the consent is voluntary and will not affect their treatment rights.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria</p><p>The inclusion criteria are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Children between the ages of 2&#x000a0;years 6&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;years 11&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>History of recurrent wheeze, defined as at least three episodes of wheeze over the previous 12&#x000a0;months</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measuring dose response to inhaled salbutamol using Rint</title><p>To span the entire plausible dose-response range in each individual child would be unethical, requiring an impractical long protocol and multiple Rint measurements, at an age when cooperation is notoriously difficult to achieve and maintain. We therefore plan to map out the dose-response curve using a sparse-sampling dosage schedule in which each individual child will receive just two successive doses, with Rint measurements at baseline and after the first and second dose. For the dose-response assessment using Rint, we used the same design as the one created by two of the investigators for a recent study (DORESI study NCT 01470755). There is an assumption that the measurements made after administration of the second dose reflect the sum of the first and second doses, i.e. that the two doses are additive, with no loss of potency for the first dose during the interval between the first and second measurements. The two doses to be administered in each individual child will be randomly determined from the options below and will be concealed from the researchers measuring the response using Rint. Children will be randomised to the four dosage schedules in the ratio 1:1:1:1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Dosage schedules</title><p>The dosage schedules are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salbutamol&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;+300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;=&#x02009;400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salbutamol</p></list-item><list-item><p>100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salbutamol&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;+500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;=&#x02009;600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salbutamol</p></list-item><list-item><p>200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salbutamol&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;+600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;=&#x02009;800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salbutamol</p></list-item><list-item><p>200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salbutamol&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;+200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;=&#x02009;400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g salbutamol</p></list-item></list>

</p><p>Rint measurement will be performed at baseline and 15&#x000a0;min after each of the two doses of salbutamol. The second dose of salbutamol will be given 30&#x000a0;min after the first dose. If the participant needs to take a bronchodilator within 12&#x000a0;h of the study visit, then the research appointment should be rescheduled. Rint measurements will be made as specified in the consensus guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Briefly, the child will be seated and breathing quietly through the apparatus, via a mouthpiece, with nose occluded by noseclip or fingers and with cheeks supported. If the child is unable to tolerate or use a mouthpiece, a facemask will be used for all three measurements. At each Rint measurement, a minimum of 10 flow interruptions will be carried out, with inspection of mouth pressure transients in real time, in order to achieve a minimum of five technically acceptable interruptions. The Rint measurement will be calculated as the median value of all acceptable interruptions.</p><p>All participants will be prescribed a salbutamol inhaler from ring-fenced hospital stock, stored within the research office and dispensed by the research nurse. The inhaler will be labelled according to EU requirements. The salbutamol inhalers will not be temperature-monitored. An accountability log of the doses given, when and to whom will be kept by the research team. After administration of the protocol-defined dose, the inhaler will be returned to the research nurse, the accountability log updated and the inhaler transferred back to the clinical trial pharmacy for destruction. Salbutamol inhalers are licensed products, and for this trial they are being used in line with established practice, supported by guidelines, and the dosage schedule does not exceed what would be stated in the participant&#x02019;s GP prescription.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Collection of saliva for DNA analysis</title><p>Saliva samples will be collected in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturers of the sampling kits.

The DNA from saliva is stable in this kit for up to five years at room temperature due to proprietary reagents that inactivate bacteria and nucleases in saliva and minimize chemical hydrolysis of DNA. The DNA will be stored in the Clinical Investigation and Research Unit, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust (BSUHT).

In order to detect a worthwhile difference of this size between dosages with 90&#x000a0;% power, a minimum of 24 patients will be needed in each dosage group, giving a sample size of 96 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Justification for research question 2: Arg versus Gly beta agonist response</title><p>Can we predict the salbutamol dose that is appropriate for an individual child using simple, non-invasive and inexpensive tests that can be performed in the outpatient setting?</p><p>The hypothesis to be tested is that children with wheeze who are either homozygous or heterozygous for arginine at position 16 of the beta2 receptor (i.e. Arg/Arg or Arg/Gly status) show a diminished peak response to inhaled salbutamol in comparison to children with wheeze carrying the Gly/Gly status.</p><p>The sample size calculations are based on data published by Beydon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Mean baseline Rint in asthmatic children was 0.92, SD 0.22 kPa/L/s; levels dropped to 0.74, SD 0.18 kPa/L/s after bronchodilator administration. In children who did not have asthma, the baseline Rint dropped by a smaller proportion, decreasing 0.10 unit to 0.82 kPa/L/s. All the children in this study will have wheeze. Hence, we feel they will have a higher baseline airway resistance comparable to children with asthma, and higher than controls without asthma, as reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, we estimate that children carrying one or both copies of Arg will show a diminished response that is comparable to that of children who do not have asthma. Thus our sample size calculations are based on the prediction that the peak bronchodilator response in the children who have Arg/Arg or Arg/Gly status will show a mean fall in Rint of 0.10 unit to 0.82 kPa/L/s, whereas the wheezy children who have Gly/Gly status will show a response that is at least as substantial as that observed by Beydon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in children with asthma (i.e. a mean fall of 0.18 kPa/L/s).</p><p>The ratio of children carrying Arg/Arg and Arg/Gly status to those with Gly/Gly is 60&#x000a0;%:40&#x000a0;%. A sample size of 133 (80 Arg and 53 Gly/Gly) would allow us to detect a difference of 0.08 unit between the groups (delta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20; effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4) with 80% power for 5% significance, assuming a correlation between baseline and post-bronchodilator measurements of 0.6. To allow randomisation of equal numbers to the four groups, the sample size should be increased to 136. In order to allow a sample size sufficiently large to answer both research questions, and to allow for up to 12&#x000a0;% of children being unable to perform the measurement (based on experience in our unit in this age range), we will recruit a sample size of 156 children. We intend to recruit these children over 36&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study of the relationship between urinary salbutamol levels and Rint measurements</title><p>The concentration of salbutamol in the urine at 30&#x000a0;min following a dose of salbutamol represents the gold standard of lung bioavailability. This has been established in adults. We will try to collect as many urine samples as possible, and we will aim to study the dose that is available to the lungs, measured as the 30&#x000a0;min urine salbutamol, against bronchodilator response. Data analysis will be performed as discussed above for inhaled lung dose versus bronchodilator response. As the production of urine on request is rather uncertain in children of this age, this is intended as a distinct secondary analysis. The main project, including the principal outcomes, will not be affected in any manner if the collection of these samples is incomplete.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><p>Participants will be randomised to the various pairs of salbutamol doses by a member of the research team using a web-based system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sealedenvelope.com/">http://www.sealedenvelope.com/</ext-link>). Those delegated the role of randomising participants will be assigned a sealed.envelope.com randomisation user name and password by the trial manager. To randomise a participant, the randomiser will follow the OpSal Randomisation Guide. The randomisation system will be accessed at the following website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sealedenvelope.com/bsuh/users">https://www.sealedenvelope.com/bsuh/users</ext-link>.</p><p>At the point of consent, a participant identifier will be assigned to the patient using the Participant Number Assignment Log. To randomise a participant, the participant identifier and date of birth must be entered, and then the inclusion and exclusion criteria must be confirmed. The participant is then randomised to a dosage schedule. An email notification is then sent to the randomiser and the coordinating centre.</p><p>An allocation sequence has been generated with four possible dosage schedules on a 1:1:1:1 basis. There is no stratification. The randomisation code list was generated by the trial statistician, and it was uploaded onto the web-based system by the trial manager. The direct research team members do not have access to the randomisation code list; therefore, concealment of allocation sequence is maintained until the moment of assignment.</p><p>The researcher performing the Rint measurement on the participant will be blinded to the dosing schedule until after the assessment has been performed. Two members of the research team will be required for the study visit. Researcher 1 will perform the Rint measurements and will be blinded to the dosage schedule. This researcher must leave the room whilst the salbutamol is being administered to the participant and any associated paper work must be concealed from this researcher until the study assessments have been performed. Researcher 2 will be unblinded to the dosage schedule. Researcher 2 will randomise the participant using the web-based randomisation service (sealedenvelope.com) on the day of the visit and will then administer the salbutamol. Once the final Rint measurement has been performed, the dosage schedule can be revealed to members of the research team if necessary.</p><p>In the unlikely event that the blinded researcher needs to know the dosage schedule given to the participant and unblinded members of the research team are not available to disclose it, the dosage schedule for each participant will be documented in the Case Report Form (CRF) and filed in the site file.
