These deformities of the alveolar bone unless corrected interfere with the eradication of the periodontal pockets, which make the oral hygiene maintenance difficult, thereby leading to recurrence of the disease.</p><p>Periodontal therapy is directed towards arresting the progression of periodontal tissue destruction with the goal of achieving long-term prognosis. Conventional periodontal therapy generally comprises the techniques that repair the diseased periodontium rather than regenerating the lost tissue.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Hence, regeneration of periodontium especially the alveolar bone lost due to disease is a matter of prime concern in clinical management of periodontal disease, though predictable regeneration of the same is one of the biggest challenges in modern day dentistry.</p><p>The osseous autografting[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] being the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of bone grafting possesses inherent disadvantage in the sense of procurement of the same and patient discomfort.</p><p>Allografts[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are being used in the form of Freeze Dried Bone Allograft (FBDA) and Decalcified Freeze Dried Bone Allograft (DFBDA) with a good amount of success over the years. However, the problems of antigenic reactivity, availability and added danger of transmitting of deadly diseases like HIV make these materials less accepted in modern day periodontal use.</p><p>Xenografts[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] are the possible alternatives, but again not encouraged because of the risk of immunogenic reactions and rejection by the host tissue.</p><p>So, alloplastic materials, used as fillers or scaffolds, are biocompatible, surgically convenient, osteoconductive and predictably promote periodontal regeneration. These materials include plaster of Paris, tricalcium phosphate,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] calcium hydroxyapatite ceramics,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] bioactive glasses,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and polymers.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>An ideal bone graft material should be the one which integrates with the host tissue rapidly and attains the optimum chemical and mechanical stability within the shortest period without provoking any untoward toxicity. After its bonding, it should again get resorbed fully and should be replaced and remodeled by new regenerated bone in the area of grafting. In this endeavor of developing such an ideal bio-material, the scientists and researchers have come up with several novel materials and compositions in recent times.</p><p>A unique synthetic bone graft material based on hydroxyapatite (HAP) and bioactive glass (BG) have been developed for periodontal osseous defect reconstruction and regeneration. The product named BioGraft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-HABG Active, (IFGL Refractories Ltd, Kolkata, Knowhow from Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum), is a new-generation composite bioactive material made through a &#x02018;<italic>sol-gel</italic>&#x02019; synthesis method. The resultant product is a composite of calcium phosphate and silicate, which bonds with host bone faster than HAP ceramics and resorbs slower than pure BG products. These <italic>in vivo</italic> properties are ideal for the material to be used for periodontal regeneration.</p><p>The product is processed in the form of particle sizes of 150-700 &#x003bc; with internal pore in a size range of 100-200 &#x003bc;, specifically for periodontal applications. The material characterization has been done extensively to ensure suitable mechanical properties. The screening tests and toxicological tests are done according to international guidelines of ISO 10993. The biological activity and efficacy in bone defect healing have been tested through <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and animal experiments. The bone&#x02013;bonding and resorption abilities of the material were excellent when compared to conventional HAP-based granules in the pre-clinical studies.</p><p>In the light of the favorable pre-clinical results, the Ethical committee of Guru Nanak Institute of Dental Sciences and Research, Kolkata has approved the use of the material named BioGraft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-HABG Active, (IFGL Refractories Ltd, Kolkata) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] and BioGraft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HA, a HAP granules, (IFGL Refractories Ltd, Kolkata, technical know-how from Central Glass Ceramic Research Institute, Kolkata) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>], in human clinical trials to see the efficacy of hydroxyapatite&#x02013;bioactive glass (HA: BG) composite granules in the management of periodontal bony defects, compare the postsurgical results with those treated with HAP and open flap debridement.

Subjects who failed to maintain adequate oral hygiene (Silness and L&#x000f6;e plaque score &#x0003e;1), with any deleterious habits such as smoking and tobacco chewing were excluded. A randomized control study was conducted. Subjects with infrabony defects were divided into three groups. Test Group 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 10): Defect site was treated with HA: BG (BioGraft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>- Active), with a biodegradable membrane (PerioCol&#x02122;&#x02013;GTR). Test Group 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 10): Defect site was treated with HAP (BioGraft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HA), with biodegradable membrane. Control group (<italic>n</italic> = 10): Defect site was treated with open flap debridement with biodegradable membrane. Prior to the commencement of the study, the subjects were informed of the purpose and the design of this clinical study. Informed consents were signed by the subjects as a requirement for the study. A thorough medical and dental history was obtained. Blood investigations, which included TC, DC, BT, CT, Hb, HbsAg and HIV, were carried out for each subject. Each subject received phase&#x02013;I therapy, which comprised of ultrasonic scaling and root planning by hand instruments. Selective coronoplasty was done to remove any traumatic occlusion wherever required. All subjects were instructed proper oral hygiene methods and plaque score was brought &#x0003c;1 (Silness and L&#x000f6;e 1964). To record the clinical parameters, a customized acrylic occlusal stent with a guide groove was fabricated for each site to fit over the selected tooth and two adjacent teeth, one mesial and one distal to the concerned tooth. This provided a fixed reference point (RP) and fixed angulation of measurements at each site over the entire duration of the study. The clinical parameters which included probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and gingival recession (GR) were recorded to the nearest millimeter with the help of a Williams graduated periodontal probe at baseline and 6 months post surgically. Radiographic evaluations of the study were carried out on IOPA radiographs taken using the long-cone paralleling technique, using film holder (XCP, RINN Denstply) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>] and were measured using 1 sq mm gridlines. Four weeks after the phase&#x02013;1 therapy just prior to the surgical procedure, each subject received a re-evaluation examination and baseline data were recorded.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>XCP RINN film holder for parallel cone technique</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-593-g004"/></fig><p>All the probing measurements were recorded for the test and control teeth by a single investigator using a Williams graduated periodontal probe. The site representing the deepest point of the PPD [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>] was included in the study. The cemento-enamel junction served as the fixed RP. PPD was calculated by subtracting the distance from the Gingival Margin (GM) to the base of the pocket (BOP). CAL was calculated by measuring the distance between the RP to the BOP.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Pre-operative probing with stent in place</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-593-g005"/></fig><p>An IOPA radiograph was taken for each selected site to measure the radiographic depth of the defect (DD) and to calculate the percentage of bone defect fill.

The measurements of the radiographic images were done from: CEJ to base of the bone defect, CEJ to crest of the bone. The radiographic DD was calculated as the linear distance (in mm) from the most coronal extension of the radiopaque crest to the most apical extension of the defect. Radiographic defect fill percentage was calculated as follows:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-593-g006.jpg"/></p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6a</label><caption><p>Pre-operative IOPA radiograph showing the defect in 1-mm sq grid</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-593-g007"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 6b</label><caption><p>Post-operative IOPA radiograph showing the filled defect in 1-mm sq grid</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-593-g008"/></fig><p>All the instruments used in the surgery were sterilized by autoclaving (temperature 121&#x000b0;C at 15 psi pressure for 15 minutes).

The incision was extended one tooth mesially and one tooth distally from the involved tooth. Mucoperiosteal flap was raised using Howarth periosteal elevator on both facial and palatal/lingual sides until the bony defect was exposed. Care was taken to preserve as much as inter proximal soft tissue as possible. Papilla preservation flap was done where diastema was present. This was to ensure adequate coverage of the graft and the membrane after suturing. Vertical releasing incisions were performed when needed for better access.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Flap reflected showing the osseous defect</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-593-g009"/></fig><p>In all the sites after raising the flap, the osseous defect was debribed of granulation tissue using surgical curettes to expose the root surface and alveolar bone [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 8</xref>].

In this clinical study, it has been found that, the usage of alloplastic regenerative materials such as HA:BG; is well accepted by the patients, in various types of intraosseous defects in slowly progressive type of periodontal diseases.</p><p>The selection of bone defects were not made on the basis of qualitative assessment of bony walls in this study. The cortical plate with a thin cancellous bone would render a better result than only the cortical plate in a defect. The bony defects in this study were assumed to have only the cortical part. Hence, the osteogenic potential of the cancellous bone could not take part in the new bone formation.</p><p>Zybutz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] compared clinical and radiographic measurements of interproximal vertical defects before and 1 year after surgical treatments to assess the association between clinical and radiographic measurements. They concluded that the standardized radiographs reliably and permanently describe the hard tissue changes and thus can serve as substitute for probing to bone or re-entry measurements of bone changes. Though in this study the bony defects were not clinically measured three dimensionally and the vertical depths taken into account as evidenced in the radiograph, statistical significant results were obtained in TG1 and TG2 in terms of stated parameters.</p><p>The physical characteristics of alloplastic bone replacement grafts are of paramount importance. The particle size and the pore size play an important role in osteoconductivity of bone replacement graft material. The size of particles of the test material ranged from 150 to 700 microns. In a re-entry study it was seen that smaller particles &#x0003c;300 microns undergo completely ionic dissolution and disappear by 1 year.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] These particles were completely devoid of any cations. The larger sized particles were present for longer periods of time, but by 3 years the particles were found completely replaced by bone.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Along with graft materials, new therapeutic approaches for periodontal regeneration have brought different biologic mediators into practice. The recognition and appreciation that new tissues are formed by cell populations have resulted in efforts to stimulate the cells that are located in the periodontal defect. One way to stimulate these cells is to use proteins (growth factors) that can bind to surface receptors on the cell membranes, which in turn trigger a series of events to occur that alter the genetic activity of the cell with the result that cell behavior is stimulated. These growth factors, primarily secreted by macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and platelets, include platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bfGF), BMP, and transforming growth factor (TGF). These biologic mediators have been used to stimulate periodontal wound healing (e.g., promoting migration and proliferation of fibroblasts for periodontal ligament formation) or to promote the differentiation of cells to become osteoblasts, thereby favoring bone formation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In both the test groups and in the control group no growth factors were added.</p><p>Bony status can be evaluated by histological, clinical and radiographic methods. Camargo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] stated that the improvement in clinical parameter can result in gain in attachment; however, it should be remembered that the placement of the graft material into the defect may modify gingival tissue consistency and therefore interfere with the penetration of the periodontal probe without necessarily having induced any gain in CAL. Hence, surgical re-entry is important to substantiate the post-operative data for evaluating regeneration. However, it has certain inherent disadvantages like inducing further resorption at the treated site and inability to ascertain the exact histological nature of the hard tissue. The second surgical procedure is also time consuming and may interrupt the regenerative process if the healing is still going on.</p><p>Here in this study the different clinic-physiological factors are being observed, like physical characteristics of the material, chemical composition of the material, patient selection, defect selection, pre-operative preparation, flap design, defect or root debridement, graft management, flap closure, post-operative management and periodontal maintenance influence the treatment outcome after the use of bone replacement grafts. Some of these factors are beyond the control of the operator.</p><p>The soft tissue variables evaluated were position of the GM, PPD and CAL. These variables by themselves, following regenerative therapy, do not provide the direct proof of formation of new bone or new attachment. Nonetheless, such clinical measurements are routinely used as they assess the volume of subgingival area, which harbors the pathogenic microbiota and favor disease activity.</p><p>The results of this study show that the mean PPD in TG1 at baseline was 7.2 &#x000b1; 1.4 and at 6 months reduced to 3.7 &#x000b1; 0.9, in TG2 at baseline 6.8 &#x000b1; 1.66 and at 6 months reduced to 3.5 &#x000b1; 0.8. At the control sites mean PPD at baseline was 5.4 &#x000b1; 0.8, and at 6 months reduced to 3.4 &#x000b1; 0.8. These data indicates that there is a marked reduction in the PPD in both control and experimental sites from baseline to 6 months. And there was statistically significant difference in PPD reduction between the control group and TG1 and TG2. The clinical trials with various alloplastic bone grafts also have shown a significant reduction in PPD when compared to open flap debridement.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] So the changes in PPD reflect the effect of the response of the gingival tissue to the surgical treatment, may not always denote the periodontal regeneration.</p><p>CAL gain following regenerative therapy is another commonly used soft tissue measurement to evaluate treatment outcome. The results of our study indicate that the mean CAL in TG1 was 6.3 &#x000b1; 1.26 at baseline and 3.4 &#x000b1; 1.11 at 6 months; in TG2 was 4.9 &#x000b1; 1.64 at baseline and 3.2 &#x000b1; 1.4. In the control group, the mean CAL at baseline was 3.4 &#x000b1; 0.66 and 2.2 &#x000b1; 0.6 at 6 months. This suggests that there is statistically significant attachment gain from baseline to 6 months in both test groups than in the control group. And among TG1 and TG2, TG1 shows more significant results than TG2. This confirms that both TG1 and TG2 have added advantage over open flap debridement and again TG1 shows significant results than TG2. The previous studies with other alloplastic bone grafts also have shown significant gain in CAL when compared to open flap debridement.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>To find out the defect fill after treatment surgical re-entry and histological evaluation can effectively measure the outcome. However, due to ethical reasons and patients concern, it is not possible in routine clinical trials. Hence, radiographic evaluation is most commonly used outcome measure for bone regeneration.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Radiographic assessment was done at 6 months post-operatively. The results of this study indicate that the defect fill at 6 months in TG1 and TG2 2.6 &#x000b1; 0.66 and 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.66, respectively, where as in the control group sites it was 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.7. Both TG1 and TG2 show significant difference from the control group in terms of defect fill after 6 months. Previous studies using various autografts, allografts and xenografts also have shown a significant bone fill in human intrabony defects when compared to open flap debridement.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, it has been identified that good bone defect fill, evidenced radiographically, occurs with the use of &#x02018;BioGraft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HABG Active&#x02019; in the treatment of periodontal infrabony defects. The results show that &#x02018;BioGraft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HABG Active&#x02019; improves the healing outcome when PPD reduction and gain in CAL are used as clinical parameters. Though the clinical advantages are obvious, it is not possible to give conclusive description on the biological process of healing. The literature to date considers alloplastic graft materials to have functioned primarily as biocompatible defect fillers. In order to establish the biological mechanism to support the observed efficacy of BG-based materials, long-term, controlled studies and histological evidences of regeneration are essential. The results of this study corroborate well with the reported clinical trials. However, a direct comparison of clinical results and <italic>in vivo</italic> material properties to draw a definite conclusion may not be appropriate. It seems evident by comparing the existing clinical works with this study that, attachment gain of such nature of periodontal defect cannot be made 100%. A narrow range of gain has been observed in all clinical works and the variation in success largely depends upon the type of the defects chosen for surgical intervention. The present study also experiences a gain in bone height using HA: BG, a new material system. Thus, it can be concluded that the biologic environment of the periodontal defect has a great influence in achieving the goal; probably the skill of the operator does not play an important role although the autograft is a gold standard and allogenic being next, the alloplast used in this study poses a significant and successful role.</p><p>There are certain limitations in this clinical study like the periodontal status of soft tissue is complex and probing force may result in inaccurate or inconsistent probing measurements. Surgical re-entry evaluation was excluded from the study. The population included in the study is relatively small and extrapolation of these results to a larger population would be inappropriate. The combination of Bioglass and calcium hydroxyapatite is relatively new material and the trial of which has not been done widely. So further study, using this material, is sought for.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The following conclusions were made from the study:</p><p>

</p><p>Both test groups (TG1, TG2) showed significant improvement over the control in both the clinical and radiological parameters. Histological evaluation and long-term clinical trials are required for further study. Applying the philosophy of tissue engineering to the healing of bone, it is recommended that future studies employ a greater number of patients as well as experimental studies be conducted to analyze the maximum potential of Bioceramics and Bioactive Glass in regenerative periodontal therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pihlstromn</surname><given-names>BL</given-names></name><name><surname>Michalowicz</surname><given-names>BS</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>NW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal diseases</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>66</volume><fpage>1809</fpage><lpage>20</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bartold</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>McCulloch</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Naryanan</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitaru</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tissue engineering: A new paradigm for periodontal regeneration based on molecular and cell biology</article-title><source>Periodontol 2000</source><year>2000</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>253</fpage><lpage>69</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11276871</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nabers</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Leary</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Autogenous bone transplant in the treatment of osseous defects</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1965</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>5</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14258507</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schallhorn</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Hiatt</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human allografts of iliac cancellous bone and marrow in periodontal osseous defects.
