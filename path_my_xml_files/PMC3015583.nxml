Even the small amount that is subsidized by the federal government often cannot be deferred for 5 years (the minimum time a resident will spend to become a general surgeon). One study demonstrated that general surgeons have about half the return on investment compared with that in other specialties including urology and orthopedics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref></sup></p><p>Depending on the surgical specialty, malpractice insurance and similar issues may affect residency choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> Although the length of the clinical residency is 5 years, many programs or residents, or both, have chosen to extend this for various reasons. In addition, if students desire to go into a highly competitive surgical subspecialty, such as surgical oncology or pediatric surgery, they may be looking at close to a decade before earning significant salary to pay off their student loans. During surgery residency, the hours and call schedule are often extreme. The mandated 80-hour work week limit requirement may be &#x0201c;evening the field,&#x0201d; but that has yet to be determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup></p><p>Even so, general surgery is not felt to be one of the technologically advanced fields in medicine by many students. For obvious reasons, the field of general surgery is slow to adopt new procedures without appropriately testing them with the current gold standards. Many other disciplines are much quicker (for better or for worse) in adopting new technologies or procedures. This seemingly slower adoption may be perceived negatively by students.</p><p>It has been thought that the introduction of the general surgery discipline early in preclinical medical school years may stimulate early interest in surgical residency in medical students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref></sup> Thus, we tested the hypothesis that a laparoscopic skills course introduced in preclinical years will stimulate student interest in entering surgical residency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study used preclinical medical students (year 1 and year 2). Our Institutional Review Board exempted this study for formal review. All of the students went through a laparoscopic training course. All medical students volunteered for this course. This course included 2 animate laboratory sessions with porcine models as well as 10 training sessions in an inanimate laboratory. In the animate porcine sessions, the students were asked to perform 4 tasks including placing a piece of bowel into a laparoscopic retrieval bag, deploying a stapler on a piece of bowel, performing a liver biopsy, and measuring a piece of bowel with an umbilical tape.</p><p>The inanimate training actually varied by group: Group A&#x02014;virtual reality training, Group B&#x02014;inanimate box training, Group C&#x02014; both trainers, and Group D&#x02014; control. The virtual reality training was performed on the Minimally Invasive Surgery Trainer - Virtual Reality (MIST-VR), and the inanimate box training was performed on the Laparoscopy Training Simulator (LTS 2000). The course was taught by a laparoscopic faculty member and a fellow. All students were asked their residency choice before and after the course using a fill-in-the-blank questionnaire. All choices were divided into general surgery, surgical subspecialty, and nonsurgical. Undecided, OB/GYN results were categorized as nonsurgical choices. Surgical subspecialties included neurosurgery, orthopedics, surgical oncology, ENT (ear, nose, and throat), urology, and vascular surgery. Chi-squared tests were used for statistical analysis (GraphPad InStat Version 3.05)</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study included 59 students. The average age was 24 years, with 30 males and 29 females, and 39 first year medical students and 20 second year medical students.</p><p>Before the sessions, 33 students wished to go into a surgical residency (56%).

Of course, other possible reasons exist as to why no obvious effect on residency choice occurred. Our sample size may have been too small. The course may have been too brief. It may be that our student interest was too high before the course because students who volunteered were more likely to choose a surgical residency.</p><p>We did see a slight trend in a shift from students desiring to go into general surgery over surgical subspecialty after the course. Although it has been suggested that the field of general surgery be introduced into preclinical years, our data suggest that a laparoscopic skills course may not be an effective method for increasing interest in surgery. Kozar et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref></sup> suggest that a brief intervention can help influence students toward general surgery; although their data only showed a trend towards an increase in general surgery choice and no change in surgical specialty choice.</p><p>Our results do suggest that preclinical exposure to general surgery may influence students who are interested in other surgical subspecialties to consider general surgery. One study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref></sup> showed that while many of the strongest students chose surgical residencies, they selected surgical subspecialties. Our thought is that certain students are inclined to go into a surgical field. It may be possible to entice these students to consider general surgery instead of a surgical subspecialty by courses such as the one described in this study.</p><p>Surgical educators need to investigate methods to encourage preclinical student interest in surgical residency. These methods should be tested and demonstrated to be effective before investing time and resources in them. It may be that active participation in the medical school admission process would lead to greater interest in general surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the technical assistance of Mrs. Courtney Bishop in the preparation of this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage">
