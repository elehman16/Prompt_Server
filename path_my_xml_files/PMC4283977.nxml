This patient safety role of pharmacists in UK hospital settings is well established with pharmacists' interventions being widely accepted as improving patient care.[<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, the role of pharmacists in improving patient safety in general practice is in contrast far less well established with conflicting evidence from studies. Our systematic review and meta-analysis found weak evidence that pharmacist interventions in primary care could reduce hospital admissions.[<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Subsequent studies, however, found that pharmacist-led medication reviews have either no effect on hospital admissions[<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or increase hospital admissions.[<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The PINCER trial was a cluster randomised controlled trial which demonstrated that pharmacists working in general (family) practices substantially reduced the frequency of clinically important medication errors; this reduction is highly likely to translate into fewer preventable adverse drug events in primary care. Therefore the PINCER trial shows that pharmacists working in a primary care setting can provide a cost-effective intervention that should reduce patient harm.[<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The detailed trial methods and main findings have been reported elsewhere.[<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In summary, the intervention involved identifying patients potentially at risk of harm from hazardous medicines management using Quest Browser software (The Computer Room, Nottingham, UK) to search general practice electronic patient records. The Quest Browser searches were based on 10 outcome measures relating to contraindicated prescribing, inadequate monitoring and inappropriate dosing of medication (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box&#x000a0;1</xref>). Seventy-two general practices were recruited from an 80&#x000a0;km radius around Manchester and Nottingham in the UK and were randomised to receive either simple feedback (36 practices) or pharmacist intervention (36 practices).</p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><caption><title>Box 1 Outcome measures (OM) used to identify patients at risk from hazardous medicines management</title></caption><p>Contraindicated prescribing

</p></boxed-text><p>Practices receiving simple feedback were given paper copies of the Quest Browser search results and evidence-based summaries to support each outcome measure. These practices did not receive support from a pharmacist as part of the trial. In the pharmacist-intervention arm, six pharmacists with varied backgrounds[<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] worked for 2 days per week for up to 12 weeks (i.e. one pharmacist per practice). At the start of their work in each practice the pharmacists met with members of the practice team to discuss the Quest Browser-generated feedback on patients with potentially hazardous medicines management. Where possible this meeting included all general practitioners (GPs) from the practice, at least one nurse, one receptionist and the practice manager. Before the meeting, practice staff were given a summary of the Quest Browser-generated feedback and copies of evidence-based summaries which supported each outcome measure. During the meeting, pharmacists used the principles of educational outreach[<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] to communicate important messages about why the medicines management was hazardous while also taking account of human error theory[<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and using root-cause analysis techniques, as appropriate.[<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Following this meeting the pharmacists worked closely with a designated liaison person in each practice to help improve systems of work to prevent future medicines management problems. After 6&#x02013;8 weeks pharmacists held follow-up meetings with practice staff to review progress. To resolve existing medicines management problems pharmacists also reviewed each case of potentially hazardous medicines management identified by the Quest Browser searches. Pharmacists used their clinical expertise to determine whether the patients identified were at clinical risk of harm, and recommended interventions to reduce the risk of harm to patients. Interventions were communicated to GPs using a handwritten form (the case-specific record; see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box&#x000a0;2</xref>). Where interventions were accepted by GPs, pharmacists and other members of the practice staff implemented the changes. Where interventions were not accepted GPs either continued current care or recommended their own changes to patients' treatments.</p><boxed-text id="box2" position="float"><caption><title>Box 2 Forms completed by pharmacists when reviewing individual patient cases</title></caption><p>Form 1: the &#x02018;summary record recorded the following data:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>patient ID (numerical code)</p></list-item><list-item><p>patient age and gender</p></list-item><list-item><p>GP's initials</p></list-item><list-item><p>outcome measure (numerical code) (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>numerical code describing pharmacist's judgement of why a patient was identified by the Quest Browser search (patient at risk of harm, coding error, information available in medical records but not coded, other reason)</p></list-item><list-item><p>numerical code describing pharmacist's interventions and actions completed</p></list-item><list-item><p>pharmacist's estimate of the time they spent reviewing each case and implementing actions</p></list-item><list-item><p>pharmacist's initials and date record completed.</p></list-item></list>

In addition to the interventions recommended by pharmacists, GPs took additional or alternative actions. Also, some interventions were accepted by GPs, but the pharmacists documented that they had not been completed when the pharmacist finished working in the practice. For example, a GP agreed that a patient's &#x003b2;-blocker prescription should be reviewed, but this review had not happened when the pharmacist left the practice. In other cases it was unknown whether the intervention had been accepted because the pharmacist had not documented on the summary record that the intervention was completed or rejected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Number of interventions recommended by PINCER pharmacists, and subsequent actions taken in response</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Number of interventions (% of interventions recommended)</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">All cases</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cases considered to be at clinical risk</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Interventions recommended by pharmacists</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2105</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1782</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Actions taken by pharmacists and practice staff</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1685</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1420</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Outcome of interventions recommended by pharmacists</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Completed</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1383 (66)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1165 (65)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rejected by GP or patient</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">441 (21)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">357 (20)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown whether completed or rejected</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">177 (8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160 (9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Accepted by GP, but not completed at end of placement</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">104 (5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">99 (6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">GP took an alternative action to that recommended by the pharmacist (% of actions taken)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">201 (12)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159 (11)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Interventions recommended for contraindicated prescribing problems</title><p>Pharmacists recommended 804 interventions in 515/629 cases (82%; 95% CI 79, 85) of contraindicated prescribing associated with &#x003b2;-blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and combined oral contraceptives.

Additional or alternative actions to improve the safety of medicines management were taken by GPs, meaning that actions were completed in 61% of cases identified by the Quest Browser searches. Pharmacists estimated that they spent a median of 20&#x000a0;min reviewing each case, recommending interventions and completing actions.

Many of these recommendations would have implications for the future management of these patients and, in some cases, other patients within the practices.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The PINCER trial was a large cluster randomised controlled trial which clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led IT-enabled intervention in reducing the risk to patients from hazardous medicines management. The strengths and limitations of the trial have been discussed in detail elsewhere.[<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>During their work on the PINCER trial, pharmacists recorded data on individual cases of potentially hazardous medicines management. As part of this data recording, pharmacists judged whether patients identified by the Quest Browser searches were at risk of clinical harm. These judgements were based on the clinical expertise of one pharmacist in each case and other healthcare professionals may not agree with their judgements. Pharmacists did not keep detailed records of the basis for their judgements; therefore, it is not possible to further identify their &#x02018;unspecified reasons&#x02019; for not judging patients to be at clinical risk.</p><p>Additionally, pharmacists' recommendations to improve medicines management were not peer reviewed for appropriateness or missed opportunities to intervene. Therefore, it is possible that some interventions were rejected by GPs because they were inappropriate or that opportunities to improve medicines management were missed.</p><p>The data recorded by the pharmacists help us understand how they approach individual cases of hazardous medicines management in order to help protect patients from harm. These data also help us predict which interventions are most likely to be accepted by general practice staff. These data do not, however, help us understand why some recommendations were not accepted.</p><p>Pharmacists estimated the time they spent reviewing, recommending interventions and completing actions for individual cases of hazardous medicines management. These times may under- or over-estimate the actual time spent by the pharmacists on individual patient cases and do not indicate how long was spent on each specific task. Pharmacists' estimates of time spent reviewing individual cases indicate that most time was spent on other duties such as meeting with practice staff and implementing new systems of working in the practices; however, pharmacists did not record the time they spent on these activities. Additionally, these roles are not detailed in the pharmacist-recorded data and this limits the usefulness of these data in terms of understanding the role of the pharmacist in the PINCER trial. However, additional qualitative data collected as part of the PINCER trial[<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] does provide better understanding of this extended role.</p></sec><sec><title>Usefulness of outcome measures for identifying patients at clinical risk of harm</title><p>Pharmacists judged that three-quarters of cases identified by Quest Browser searches were at clinical risk of harm, suggesting that such outcome measures are a useful way of targeting pharmacists' activity. However, the proportion of patients considered at clinical risk of harm varied greatly between outcome measures. Ninety to ninety-five per cent of patients identified by outcome measures 1, 3 and 8 (relating to contraindicated prescribing of NSAIDs and inadequate monitoring with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and amiodarone) were judged to be at clinical risk. In contrast, one-quarter of patients identified by outcome measure 6 (related to inadequate monitoring of warfarin) were judged to be at clinical risk. However, 54% (114/213) of these were registered in one practice that had a separate recording system for patients' International Normalised Ratios (INRs), which was not identified by the Quest Browser searches. By excluding these data, half of patients were considered to be at clinical risk by the pharmacists. In outcome measure 9 (related to the inappropriate dosing of methotrexate) the IT-enabled searches were unable to reliably identify patients without a weekly instruction. This meant that only 32% of patients identified as having no instruction to take their methotrexate once weekly were judged to be at clinical risk. This is an important problem which needs to be resolved before IT-enabled searches can be used to identify patients at risk from inappropriate dosing of medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacists' interventions</title><p>Pharmacists made recommendations to improve medicines management in 74% of the cases identified and in 88% of cases where they considered patients to be at clinical risk. This is consistent with Zermansky <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. where pharmacists recommended interventions for 75% of general practice patients.[<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In the PINCER trial, 66% of interventions recommended by a pharmacist were completed, compared to 56% of pharmacists' interventions recommended in the Zermansky <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. study of medication reviews in a nursing home setting.[<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This suggests that pharmacists' interventions were broadly acceptable to the GPs.

However, even when pharmacists' interventions were not acted on (around 12% of cases) GPs took additional or alternative actions to those recommended by the pharmacists. This suggests that, by highlighting potential problems with patients' medication, pharmacists stimulated GPs to make changes to their management of these patients. This effect was also seen in the nursing home study by Zermansky <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. where GPs took additional or alternative actions to those recommended by pharmacists in 5% of cases.[<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In the PINCER trial the number of interventions recommended per case varied, with half of cases having only one intervention.

This would be recorded as two separate interventions but it would not be possible for a GP to accept both interventions. This may in part explain why only one-third of pharmacists' interventions were accepted in outcome measure 2; pharmacists recommended two or more interventions in 45% of the cases where they made recommendations. However it is not possible to state with certainty that all of these recommendations were mutually exclusive. Future studies of pharmacists' interventions should assess the form in which recommendations are made when calculating levels of acceptance.</p><p>PINCER trial pharmacists' interventions were targeted to the outcome measure being addressed. These interventions were broadly applicable across the outcome measures in the three groups, however: contraindicated prescribing, inadequate monitoring and dosing problems. This suggests that these interventions could be broadly applicable to a wider range of clinical situations related to these groups of outcome measures. Many of these interventions were not predicted before the start of the study. Instead, they developed from pharmacists' experience of working with the GPs and learning from each other. This highlights the importance of providing a forum where pharmacists can learn from each other when engaging in new roles. This forum was created in the PINCER trial through monthly group meetings between the pharmacists and the trial manager.</p><p>As might be predicted from the broad range of different recommendations made, the time spent resolving problems in each case varied widely (from 0 to 180&#x000a0;min). However, pharmacists reported spending a median of 20&#x000a0;min on each case. This included the time needed to assess each case, make recommendations and implement any agreed changes. This is consistent with the average time taken to conduct medication reviews in a previous study in primary care,[<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but is likely to be lower in terms of overall time spent because there was little face-to-face contact between patients and pharmacists in the PINCER trial. Instead, medication reviews were largely restricted to medical records because this was how the practices preferred to work (instead, GPs had face-to-face meetings with patients).</p><p>The median time pharmacists spent on each case varied depending on the outcome measure and practice list size. Although outcome measure 2 (&#x003b2;-blockers in asthma) had the lowest percentage of completed actions it was the most time-consuming of the outcome measures. Before the study began we predicted that outcome measure 2 would be the most difficult for pharmacists to address because of the complexity of assessing the cases and lack of clear guidelines on how to manage patients. This is reflected in the time taken to review the cases and percentage of cases where actions were completed.</p><p>Pharmacists required less time to review cases and recommend interventions than anticipated at the start of the trial. This suggests that, with adequate training, it may be possible to &#x02018;roll out&#x02019; the pharmacist intervention using existing pharmacist staff within general practices.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Analysis of pharmacist-recorded data from the PINCER trial suggests that the outcome measures usefully targeted pharmacists' activities towards patients who may have been at risk of hazardous medicines management and that GPs were largely supportive of the approach taken in the trial.</p><p>This analysis has also highlighted areas which were challenging for pharmacists to influence, such as the prescription of &#x003b2;-blockers to patients with asthma and cardiovascular disease. The analysis has also identified some useful interventions which could be applied to a wide range of clinical scenarios. In addition, it would seem that the activities undertaken by the pharmacists were largely appropriate to their level of training, although it may be possible to identify some activities that could be undertaken by less qualified staff, such as pharmacy technicians, once pharmacists have performed a clinical review of individual cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Declarations</title><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The Author(s) declare(s) that they have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Patient Safety Research Portfolio UK (grant number PS024; current controlled trials number ISRCTN21785299).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the PINCER trialists, the PINCER Trial pharmacists and other participants in this trial, Sadaf Quereshi for entering the summary data into SPSS, Caroline Mulvaney and Sherie Smith for double-checking data entry and Richard Lilford and colleagues at the Patient Safety Research Portfolio.
