After a 1 week placebo (PL) run in, they randomly received either FF (21) or identical appearing PL (19) for 2 weeks. They recorded nasal sympton score (NSS) and Eppworth daytime sleepiness score (EDDS) for the 21 days, performed a TOVA test (Computerized test of cognitive performance) at day 7 and 21, and completed a nocturnal rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (NRQLQ) at days 7, 14 and 21. Average daily weekly scores, comparing week 1 baseline to week 3 were used for evaluation of NSS, and EDSS/TOVA omissions, commissions and reaction times were compared, as was NRQLQ (day 7 and day 21).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean total NSS (TNSS) instantaneous decreased from BL 12.88 to 10.84 in the FF group, and increased in PL group from 12.64 to 13.74 (<italic>P</italic> diff = .04). TNSS reflective decreased from 12.99 to 11.20 (FF group) and increased from 13.53 to 14.02 in PL. (<italic>P</italic> diff = NS). The mean EDSS decreased from 13.83 to 10.76 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) in FF group, and from 13.29 to 12.80 with PL (<italic>P</italic> dif = NS). TOVA commissin errors decreased by 7.13 (FF) vs 1.4 (PL) (<italic>P</italic> dif = 0.05). Omission increased in PL from 2.33 to 5.75, and 1.54 to 1.58 (FF) (P diff = NS). Reaction time increased in both groups 363 to 391 milliseconds (FF), 387 to 412 milliseconds (<italic>P</italic> = NS). The FF reported a minimally clinical importance difference of 0.5 or greater on all 16 questions of NRQLQ, the PL group only in 10. (Mean change 1.01 (FF) vs .63 (PL) <italic>P</italic> = 0.004).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment of symptomatic SAR with intranasal FF decrease daytime sleepiness, less noturnal sleep disturbance, and improved cognitive performance.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
