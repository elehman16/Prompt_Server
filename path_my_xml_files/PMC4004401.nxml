FF monotherapy is also being developed as inhaled treatment for asthma. The pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and safety profiles of FF/VI when delivered simultaneously from the dry powder inhaler (DPI) have been described in healthy subjects as well as in patients with asthma and COPD [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. FF/VI has shown favourable safety and tolerability profiles in these subjects [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with little evidence of effects of clinical concern that have previously been reported for ICSs (decreased serum cortisol) [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists (hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia and tachycardia) [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, once daily administration of FF/VI was effective at improving lung function in patients with COPD [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or asthma [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] at doses of FF/VI 100/25 &#x003bc;g and 200/25 &#x003bc;g.</p><p>Cross-study evaluation of early PK data suggested that FF systemic exposure might be higher in Japanese subjects than in Caucasians (data on file: GlaxoSmithKline R&#x00026;D, Stevenage, SG1 2NY, UK, [<email>ann.allen@gsk.com</email>]). FF is metabolized primarily by ester hydrolysis via CYP3A4, leading to formation of the 17-carboxylic acid a pharmacologically inactive metabolite [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], The activity of CYP3A4 <italic>in vivo</italic> is essentially similar in subjects of Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Caucasian ancestry [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and therefore is unlikely to contribute to the apparent differences seen across studies. This study was conducted to evaluate formally this potential difference in FF PK between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Chinese and Korean subjects were included to determine whether any differences in Japanese subjects, if seen, were applicable to other East Asian ethnic groups. This study evaluated the PK of FF (200 &#x003bc;g and 800 &#x003bc;g repeat dose for 7 days) administered from a two-strip dry powder device and when given as a single intravenous (i.v.) dose (FF 250 &#x003bc;g) in healthy Japanese, Korean and Chinese subjects and Caucasian subjects. Pharmacodynamics (PD) (serum cortisol, pharyngometry), P450 CYP3A4 activity and safety were also assessed.</p><p>FF PK were evaluated after repeat administration of FF 200 &#x003bc;g, since this was likely to be the upper clinical dose. In addition, evaluation of the potential for systemic PD effects (serum cortisol) associated with higher FF systemic exposure in East Asian subjects were also conducted at this dose. The relationship between cortisol suppression and FF AUC is well characterized and therefore, the objective of the serum cortisol assessment in this study was to assess potential for effect at the clinical dose rather than at the supra-therapeutic dose. At the 800 &#x003bc;g supra-therapeutic dose cortisol suppression would have been anticipated for all ethnic groups. Based on previous data, it was anticipated that the PK data following FF 200 &#x003bc;g would be censored due to concentrations falling below the lower limit of quantification and possibly lead to inconclusive data for the ethnic group comparisons. Therefore a supra-therapeutic dose of FF 800 &#x003bc;g (single and repeat dose) was also studied to ensure robust PK data were obtained for the ethnic group comparisons. The study included i.v. administration of FF 250 &#x003bc;g to determine total plasma clearance (CL) and steady-state volume of distribution (<italic>V</italic><sub>ss</sub>) of FF, the absorption time from the lung and absolute bioavailability of inhaled FF. Plasma 4-&#x003b2;-hydroxy-cholesterol and the cortisol : 6-&#x003b2;-hydroxy cortisol ratio were used to assess and compare CYP3A4 activity in these ethnic groups. A further (exploratory) objective to the study was an evaluation of dose emission attributes of FF to gain an understanding of the relationship between dose (in terms of mass) and its particle size distribution and PK parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>The trial was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Chinese, 19 Japanese and 20 Korean subjects provided complete datasets for PK evaluation. One Caucasian subject had unusually low FF plasma concentrations following i.v. FF 250 &#x003bc;g compared with all other subjects who received i.v. FF 250 &#x003bc;g in this study. This resulted in an estimate of AUC(0,&#x0221e;) that was 78% lower than the geometric mean and 76% lower than the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for Caucasian subjects (following exclusion). The results presented exclude data for this subject.</p><sec><title>Intravenous fluticasone furoate 250 &#x003bc;g</title><p>The mean plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles following i.v. FF 250 &#x003bc;g were essentially superimposable for all ethnic groups over the entire 48 h post-dose period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Maximum plasma concentrations were generally observed at the end of the 20 min infusion followed by a poly-exponential decline with an average terminal phase elimination half-life of 14&#x02013;18 h (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). There was some evidence of greater systemic exposure to FF, based on <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC(0,&#x0221e;) for Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects, when compared with Caucasian subjects (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). However, where differences in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC(0,&#x0221e;) were observed these were less than 44% and 25%, respectively. These differences were consistent with the lower body weights in the Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations compared with Caucasians and are supported by lack of difference in weight-normalized <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>) and statistical analysis showed there was no evidence for a difference in body weight normalized <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC(0,&#x0221e;) between any Asian ethnic group and Caucasians, apart from <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for Korean subjects. The PK parameters describing the inherent PK characteristics of FF (CL, <italic>V</italic><sub>ss</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) following i.v. administration indicated that there were no differences in <italic>V</italic><sub>ss</sub> between Caucasian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects. Only the Chinese and Korean subjects showed lower CL (on average &#x0003c;20%) than Caucasian subjects, and the Chinese subjects had a longer <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (on average 34% greater)

FF 250 &#x003bc;g, there was no evidence for differences for <italic>V</italic><sub>ss</sub> in Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. There was no evidence for a difference between Japanese and Caucasian subjects whilst there was some evidence for slightly lower (&#x0003c;20%) plasma CL in the Chinese and Korean subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. However, these modest differences could be accounted for by the lower body weights in the East Asian populations, compared with the Caucasian subjects. FF is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and the similar i.v. PK for FF are consistent with the similar CYP3A4 activity seen across the four populations, as measured by both the urine cortisol : 6-&#x003b2;-hydroxy cortisol ratios and the plasma 4-&#x003b2;-hydroxy-cholesterol concentrations. The relatively small differences in the urine cortisol : 6-&#x003b2;-hydroxy cortisol ratio were considered to be unlikely to have any clinically meaningful effect given the high capacity of the CYP3A4 system and the low clinical doses of FF. All ethnic groups had large values of <italic>V</italic><sub>ss</sub>, indicating extensive distribution of FF into tissues and high plasma CL which was consistent with previous PK data following i.v. administration [<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>There was evidence for higher systemic FF exposure following inhaled dosing with both 200 &#x003bc;g and 800 &#x003bc;g once daily in Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects compared with Caucasian subjects that was not explained by body weight differences. At the 800 &#x003bc;g inhaled dose, where the PK data were more robust due to higher systemic exposure in all populations, the higher exposure in East Asian populations was reflected in higher overall inhaled bioavailability in the Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. Pharyngometry and inhalation profiling data indicated that there was no evidence for marked differences between the ethnic groups in mouth and throat size or the peak inspiratory flow rate achieved. Any slight differences could be attributed to the difference in demographic attributes. Modelled and predicted total emitted dose, ETD and mass &#x0003c;2 &#x003bc;m as determined by the <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation method showed no marked differences between the ethnic groups, indicating that any difference in parameters of inhalation for the subjects in the study did not result in a difference in the predicted attributes of FF dose emission. Consequently, the higher systemic exposure to FF in the East Asian ethnic groups following inhaled dosing could not be attributed to differences in the modelled and predicted amount of FF delivered to the lung. The estimated ETD, when calculated as a percentage of the nominal dose (200 &#x003bc;g or 800 &#x003bc;g) was higher than the estimated values of absolute bioavailability in all ethnic groups and for both inhaled treatments. Since the oral bioavailability of the swallowed portion is negligible [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] this may be indicative that some of the dry powder dose delivered to the lung may be removed from the lung by mucociliary clearance prior to dissolution since FF is a poorly soluble molecule. Therefore, the higher bioavailability in East Asian subjects could indicate that a greater proportion of the dry powder ETD (estimated from the electronic lung prediction) reaches the systemic circulation, compared with Caucasian subjects.</p><p>In all four ethnic groups the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> following inhaled administration of FF was notably longer than that seen following i.v. dosing. As previously reported (predominantly in Caucasian subjects) the elimination of FF is absorption rate limited following inhaled administration [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and since oral bioavailability is in the region of 1% [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the majority of exposure from inhaled dosing is due to absorption from the lung. The low oral bioavailability of FF is due to high first pass metabolism of absorbed drug by CYP3A4 and since this study has shown no notable difference in the activity of this enzyme in the East Asian and Caucasian subjects, similarly low oral bioavailability would be expected in East Asian subjects. To investigate the ethnic differences in FF PK further the inhaled time&#x02013;concentration data were subjected to deconvolution analysis. Results from this analysis suggest that following inhaled administration FF resides in the lung of Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects longer than for Caucasian subjects, and hence provides more opportunity for absorption and therefore greater bioavailability. FF absorption was essentially complete for all populations by the end of a dosing interval (24 h) and hence, significantly greater pulmonary accumulation of FF would not be anticipated in East Asian subjects compared with Caucasian subjects.</p><p>The reason for the longer residence time for FF in the lungs of subjects of East Asian ancestry is currently unknown. Although the reasons for the higher systemic FF exposure seen in East Asian subjects compared with Caucasians following inhaled dosing are not known this may be a consequence of differences in mucociliary clearance and/or differences in dissolution of FF in lung fluid (smaller lungs in East Asians). FF is not anticipated to be a substrate of anion or cation transporters and although FF is a substrate of the transporter P-glycoprotein, inter-ethnic differences in activity are not anticipated.</p><p>There were no major differences in the 24 h cortisol profiles between Caucasians and Japanese, Chinese or Koreans following 7 days of once daily inhaled FF 200 &#x003bc;g. The circadian rhythm for serum cortisol is well established. The healthy subjects in this study were domiciled within the clinical unit, with the time zero for serum cortisol sampling and time of dosing being the same for all subjects. Therefore, differential circadian rhythm would not be anticipated between the groups. This is reflected in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref> and hence more sophisticated modelling of the serum cortisol data was not considered necessary to conduct the ethnic group comparisons. For all groups, trough serum cortisol concentrations were observed at 16 h (<italic>circa</italic> 00.00 h) whilst maximum serum cortisol concentrations were observed at 24 h (<italic>circa</italic> 08.00 h). There was no evidence for a difference in serum cortisol weighted mean between Caucasians and Chinese or Korean healthy subjects (average 8&#x02013;10% difference) following 7 days of once-daily inhaled FF 200 &#x003bc;g. However, there was an average 22% (90% CI 12, 30%) lower serum cortisol weighted mean in Japanese subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. Despite this difference there was considerable overlap in the individual 24 h weighted mean serum cortisol values on day 7 (17/20 Japanese individual values were in the range for Caucasian subjects). In addition, there were no major differences between Japanese and Caucasian subjects in the trough serum cortisol concentration observed at 16 h, and although there was some difference in serum cortisol concentrations at 24 h between Japanese and Caucasian subjects on day 7, similar differences were seen on day &#x02212;1 (i.e. pre-treatment). The relationship between cortisol suppression and FF AUC is well characterized and weighted mean AUC serum cortisol is a well-established endpoint for evaluation of hypothalamic-pituitary axis effects. The objective of the cortisol assessment in this study was to assess potential effects at the clinical dose rather than at the supra-therapeutic dose. At the 800 &#x003bc;g supra-therapeutic dose cortisol suppression would have been anticipated for all ethnic groups and there was not considered to be value in estimating this.</p><p>Although the FF systemic exposure was higher in the Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects, the FF AUC(0,24 h) observed at FF 200 &#x003bc;g once daily was still considerably below levels of 1000 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> h which is considered to be the threshold for significant cortisol suppression (a 20% reduction) in placebo controlled studies [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. FF 200 &#x003bc;g was not associated with any effects on cortisol in a number of clinical studies [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A limitation of this study in assessing effect on cortisol is that it was a secondary endpoint in this study and the design was not optimized for measuring this parameter (e.g. it did not include a placebo crossover arm) and it is clear that there was a time effect in the study with a decline in cortisol concentrations between day &#x02212;1 and day 7 in all ethnic groups, including Caucasians. For example, comparing geometric mean values on day 7 with day &#x02212;1 there was a 17% drop from baseline in 24 h serum cortisol weighted mean for Caucasian subjects, a 21% drop from baseline in both Chinese and Korean subjects and a 32% drop from baseline in Japanese subjects. However, overall, if it is accepted that FF 200 &#x003bc;g does not reduce serum cortisol in Caucasian subjects, these data do suggest that there may be a slightly greater effect on cortisol in Japanese subjects at FF 200 &#x003bc;g, but data in the target patient population will be required to determine the clinical significance.</p><p>All FF treatments were safe and well tolerated with no marked quantitative or qualitative differences in safety endpoints, including incidence of EA reporting between the ethnic groups.</p><p>In conclusion, there were no marked differences in the inherent PK of FF following i.v. FF 250 &#x003bc;g between the ethnic groups other than those accounted for by body weight differences. FF systemic exposure was higher following inhaled dosing with both 200 &#x003bc;g and 800 &#x003bc;g once daily in Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. Results from deconvolution analysis suggested that following inhaled administration FF resided in the lung of Chinese, Japanese and Korean subjects longer (average MAT approximately double) than for Caucasian subjects and hence provided opportunity for the greater bioavailability. Overall, the modestly higher (&#x0003c;50%) FF systemic exposure seen in East Asian subjects was not associated with a clinically significant effect on serum cortisol suggesting that a clinical dose adjustment in East Asian subjects is not required.</p><p>The study (protocol number HZA113477 [clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01000597]) presented in this manuscript was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.
