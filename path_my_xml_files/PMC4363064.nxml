However, there is little evidence in the literature regarding the use of laparoscopic surgery in patients with rectal cancer, and the application of the technique in this setting remains controversial. The technical feasibility of performing laparoscopic surgery in patients with rectal cancer has been demonstrated by experienced laparoscopic surgeons; however, even experts report technical difficulties due to the confined space in the pelvis and the limitations of existing laparoscopic instruments, which have a restricted range of movement compared with that of the surgeon&#x02019;s hands. Moreover, previous reports have shown higher rates of conversion to open surgery, positive circumferential margins, and increased anastomotic leakage in patients treated with laparoscopic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The technical difficulties encountered when performing laparoscopic surgery for lower rectal cancer are primarily due to the anatomy of the pelvis, which lacks a wide space to use long, straight, and rigid laparoscopic instruments.</p><p>Robotic surgery is a new technique with the benefits of a three-dimensional view, the ability to use multi-degree-of-freedom forceps, the elimination of physiological tremors, and a stable camera view. It has been successfully applied in urologic surgery, and the anatomy of the pelvis suggests that performing robotic surgery in this setting is feasible, especially in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery. To date, several studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility, as well as acceptable short-term outcomes, of robotic colorectal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, evidence supporting the use of robotic surgery in patients with colorectal cancer is limited, particularly with respect to randomized controlled studies.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of robotic surgery compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. We conducted a matched case-control study using the propensity score matching method to assess the short-term outcomes of robotic surgery for colorectal cancer compared with those of conventional laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was performed with permission of the Ethics Committee of the Hiroshima University.</p><p>We have maintained a prospective database of all operations for colorectal cancer performed since April 1994. Although this study was a retrospective review of data prospectively collected from our database, the propensity score matching method was employed. The inclusion criterion was the presence of left-sided colon and rectal cancer. The robotic surgery group included selected patients who completed treatment between July 2010 and June 2013 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10). Patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon and rectal cancer between July 2010 and June 2013 were selected for enrollment in the control group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;121).</p><p>This was a matched case-control study using the propensity score matching method to compare the outcomes of robotic surgery and conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. The patients were matched with regard to age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, body mass index (BMI), history of prior abdominal surgery, tumor location, clinical stage, and the preoperative serum CEA level. No analyses of surgical parameters or outcomes were conducted until the groups were definitively selected as the best comparison cohort based on preoperative variables only. The perioperative results included the operative time, amount of estimated blood loss, the need for open conversion or further surgery, complications, flatus passage, the length of postoperative hospital stay, and the number of retrieved lymph nodes.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Robotic surgical technique</title><p>After obtaining informed consent, each patient with left-sided colon and rectal cancer was placed in the lithotomy position.

This model yielded a c-statistics of 0.673 (95% CI, 0.515 to 0.830), indicating an appropriate ability to differentiate between patients who underwent robotic surgery and those who underwent conventional laparoscopic surgery.

One-to-two pair matching was performed between the two treatment groups, pairing the patients with the closest propensity scores (within 0.03 on a scale of 0 to 1). This matching was successful, as the c-statistics was well balanced (0.560, 95% CI, 0.340 to 0.780).

In the field of colorectal surgery, the first robotic surgery was reported in 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since then, robotic surgery has been gradually introduced into the setting of rectal surgery as a result of its superior movement and camera control in the narrow pelvic space. However, there is inadequate evidence in the literature regarding the feasibility and safety of this technique. Although we experienced only a small number of cases (ten cases) of robotic surgery for colorectal cancer, we compared the outcomes of conventional laparoscopic surgery (121 cases) using the propensity score matching method in order to approximate a randomized controlled study. To the best of our knowledge, our case-matched study is the first study to use the propensity score matching method to compare the outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic surgery in patients with colorectal cancer.</p><p>In this study, we compared various parameters between the robotic surgery group and the conventional laparoscopic surgery group. In order to evaluate the invasiveness of the procedures, we compared the operative length, amount of estimated blood loss, timing of flatus passage, and length of postoperative hospital stay. In our series, there were no significant differences in the amount of estimated blood loss, timing of flatus passage, or length of postoperative hospital stay between the robotic surgery group and the conventional laparoscopic surgery group. In terms of the operative length, the median 417 min observed in the robotic surgery group (range: 295 to 629 min) was significantly longer than the 290 min noted in the conventional laparoscopic surgery group (range: 210 to 452 min; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001). A longer operative time is one disadvantage of robotic surgery, in addition to the high cost, lack of tactile sensation, and narrow visual field, as compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery. However, we believe that the technique of robotic surgery will improve with experience after a learning curve. Indeed, previous studies have reported comparable operative times between robotic surgery and conventional laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>With regard to the pathological findings, including tumor differentiation, tumor depth, node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, and vascular invasion, there were no significant differences between the groups (data not shown).

Our series of robotic surgery for colorectal cancer (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) included no case of conversion, and only two cases of surgical complications due to ileus and wound healing issues were observed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>); there were no severe complications. Moreover, the postoperative recovery results, including the timing of flatus passage and the length of postoperative hospital stay, were similar between the two groups.</p><p>Our results demonstrated the feasibility and safety of performing robotic surgery for colorectal cancer with respect to perioperative outcomes.</p><p>This study was limited by its small sample size in the robotic surgery group. However, in order to improve objectivity and approximate a randomized controlled study, we used the propensity score matching method. The matching was successful, as the c-statistics revealed a well-balanced curve (0.535), indicating reliable results with respect to the finding that robotic surgery is equivalent to conventional laparoscopic surgery in patients with colorectal cancer regarding short-term outcomes, including perioperative and pathological results.</p><p>Moreover, this study provides an initial comparison between robotic surgery and conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer which offers a foundation for larger randomized controlled studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our early experience indicates that robotic surgery is a feasible and safe procedure in patients with colorectal cancer. Although there were no significant benefits regarding the perioperative and oncological results, robotic surgery provides better outcomes, especially in patients undergoing rectal surgery. However, before extending the indications for this procedure, it is necessary to evaluate the perioperative and long-term oncological safety in large randomized controlled trials.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>American Society of Anesthesiologists</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HS participated in the treatment of these patients, literature search, and draft the manuscript.
