maintaining a stable posture. The influence factors of dynamic balance include sensory
information obtained through the somatosensory, visual, and vestibular systems and motor
responses that affect coordination joint range of motion (ROM) and muscle strength. All
sports likely require the sensorimotor processes to perform skills and protect the
neuromuscular joint system from injuries. Proprioceptive training programs have been used to
prevent lower limb injuries in many sports. Quantification of dynamic balance is often
necessary to properly evaluate athletes&#x02019; current level of motor ability. Dynamic balance of
the lower limb is often best assessed by using the squatting-rising test on an unstable
surface. Squatting activities may be used within exercise programs to preserve physical
function<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the reciprocal
influence of balance and sport performance has been recently investigated, especially
concerning unilateral stance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Researches
on theories of sport training showed that increased dynamic balance of the lower limbs may
effectively enhance athletic trainer performance. Intense balance training can improve some
aspects of soccer performance, especially at early ages<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF) is a new therapeutic exercise based on the knowledge
of kinesiology. It integrates the element of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation to
joint composition movement, and improves the joint movement by passive, active, and
resistance exercises. It is used to increase muscle strength, flexibility, and ROM<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical fitness is a general state of health and well-being, especially the ability to
perform aspects of sports or occupations. Physical fitness is generally achieved through
moderate vigorous physical activities and exercises. It is a set of attributes or
characteristics observed in people that relate to the ability to perform a given set of
physical activities. Fitness is the capacity to perform activities of daily living. Physical
fitness is now considered a person&#x02019;s capacity to function effectively in work and leisure
activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, and to respond to emergency
situations.</p><p>NJF as a new physical fitness exercise may be composed of medical, health, and athletic
NJF. Specific-oriented fitness is a person&#x02019;s ability to perform specific activities with
reasonable efficiency. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in sports.
Athletic NJF as a new specific-oriented fitness intervention has been applied in specific
athletes. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in the dynamic balance
performance (measured by taking seconds of 6 repetitions of split squats on a JOINFIT
balance dome) of junior soccer players after NJF progressive exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>SUJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 14 healthy males who were divided into two groups, namely a NJF group and
a control group. The NJF group consisted of 8 subjects, and the control group consisted of 6
subjects. The subjects were students of the Huaiyin Soccer School of Huaian City. To be
included in the study, each participant was required to have been trained at the soccer
school for at least 2&#x02005;years.

to step over a banana hurdle.</p><p>The subjects were excluded if they had a lower limb injury, visual problems, or vestibular
problems. The exclusion criteria were assessed by using a questionnaire and through physical
tests. The subjects signed an informed document approved by the ethics committee of Jangsu
Province Huaian Sports School, which also approved the study. Before each testing session,
all of the subjects were supervised to perform a 15-minute conventional routine warm-up. The
subjects were asked to refrain from any exercise for 2 hours before testing.</p><p>We measured the dynamic balance performance by performing seconds of 6 repetitions of split
squat on a JOINFIT balance dome (diameter 59&#x02005;cm, peak of the dome 21&#x02005;cm, Jiangsu, China)
before and after the intervention. The subjects placed one foot on a weight bench, ensuring
that both legs were far apart. Front-leg standing on the JOINFIT balance dome should be
about 3 feet away from the bench. The hands were placed on the hips. Subjects then squat
down until the knee was bent to about 90&#x000b0;. The upper body was kept straight during
squatting. Then, the subjects return to the starting post. This procedure was performed in 6
repetitions. The performing seconds for 6 repetitions of split squat was measured by using
an electronic stopwatch. Meanwhile, 3 performing seconds of 6 repetitions of split squat was
used to determine dynamic balance performance.</p><p>Four knee patterns of NJF were used, namely the knee extension-tibia external rotation
(E-ER), knee flexion-tibia internal rotation (F-IR), knee extension-tibia internal rotation
(E-IR), and knee flexion-tibia external rotation (F-ER) patterns. The patterns were
performed three times at random as a resistance exercise. An NJF intervention and a control
intervention were performed. The subjects start sitting on an adjustable bench with one end
of a Thera-Band wrapped around the ankle and the other end attached to something sturdy
close to the floor behind the subjects. The knee was straightened against the resistance and
then smoothly returned back to the starting position, maintaining full control throughout.
In the NJF group, both the proximal resistance controlled with a standard volleyball, which
is squeezed between the knees, and distal resistance controlled by a Thera-Band was
performed. In the control group, only distal resistance controlled by a Thera-Band was
performed. The subjects in both groups received the intervention three times a week for 3
weeks. The distal resistance was progressive, that is, by 6 lb in the first week, 9 lb in
the second week, and 11 lb in the third week, both in the NJF and control groups. The
intervention was performed by the same physical therapist to avoid individual variations in
exercise. The subjects refrained from any strength and balance exercises during the
intervention period in order to avoid confounding variables.</p><p>To determine whether the NJF and control groups had significant differences, the
independent t<italic>-</italic>test was performed on the subjects&#x02019; characteristics. Two-way
analysis of variance and multiple comparisons (Bonferroni) were used to test for
statistically significant differences, and the factors were the interventions and groups. If
a significant interaction was found, the paired t<italic>-</italic>test was performed to
compare between before and after the intervention. The independent t<italic>-</italic>test
was performed to compare between the NJF and control groups after the intervention. Data
were analyzed by using SPSS 18 for Windows. The level of statistical significant was set as
p = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences were observed between the subject characteristics of the NJF

dynamic balance performance of unilateral lower limbs. The results imply that NJF
progressive resistance exercise increases muscle strength, balance, and proprioception in
junior soccer players. The former research studies suggested immediate effects of NJF
intervention on knee muscle force and standing balance<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dynamic balance of the
lower limbs, especially on the unilateral side, is essential in sports training to improve
sensorimotor performance and postural control and perhaps to reduce the risk of injury.
Although strong dynamic balance (stability) of the lower limbs are believed to help athletic
performance, few scientific studies have been conducted to identify the effectiveness of
dynamic balance (stability) training of the lower limbs in terms of improving athletic
performance. In athletic training and events, dynamic balance (stability) plays an important
role in maintaining balance by appropriately shifting the center of pressure. Increasing
evidence indicates that insufficient or abnormal neuromuscular control of the lower limbs
during athletic movements, particularly of the knee joints, is a primary contributor to
non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The knee is not an isolated joint but is part of the body&#x02019;s kinetic
chain in which the body, as a linked system of interdependent segments, often engages in
interactions to achieve efficiently the desired movement. The present study showed the
effect of NJF exercises on balance control of unilateral lower limbs and thus gives the
implication that the NJF intervention may improve joint dynamic alignment and the balance
between muscles and soft tissues by effectively activating local stabilizing muscles of the
lower limbs. Further studies are needed to investigate the change in dynamic balance of the
body&#x02019;s kinetic chain after a long period of NJF intervention. Furthermore, the performance
of athletes from different sports in balance tests has not been clarified. When prescribing
balance exercises to athletes in different sports such as sprint, soccer, and gymnastics, it
is important to understand performance variations. Similarly, performing different athletic
NJF exercises in different sports events and training may be important.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Flanagan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Salem</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>MY</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Squatting exercises in older adults: kinematic and kinetic
