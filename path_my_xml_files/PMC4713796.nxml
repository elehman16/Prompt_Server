exercise on stroke patients with improvement in weight bearing on the affected side in
standing and static balancing ability. [Subjects] Thirty patients who had a stroke were
randomly allocated into a supine bridge exercise group (SBG, n=10), a supine bridge
exercise on a TOGU balance pad group (SBTG, n=10), and a unilateral bridge exercise group
(UBG, n=10). [Methods] The SBG patients underwent supine bridge exercise, the SBTG
patients underwent supine bridge exercise with a TOGU balance pad, and the UBG patients
underwent unilateral bridge exercise. All groups received 20 minutes of training per day,
five times per week, for four weeks. [Results] All groups showed significant changes in
weight bearing in a standing position after the intervention. The SBTG and UBG groups
showed significant changes in balance ability. [Conclusion] According to the results of
this study, bridge exercise was effective in improving weight bearing in a standing
position and improving balance on stroke patients. The bridge exercise with a TOGU balance
pad and the unilateral bridge exercise were especially more effective in anterior,
posterior length in limit of stability following on standing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bridge exercise</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke is a very serious disease and is accompanied by motor disturbance, sensory
disturbance, perceptual disturbance, language disturbance, cognitive disorder, and urinary
incontinence depending on the area of the brain lesion<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegia is commonly associated with a decrease in balance
ability. Stroke patients&#x02019; balance acts as an important factor in impeding their ability to
stand or their gait, and their postural sway is twice as high as that of healthy people in
their age range<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients&#x02019; limit
of stability is defined as the maximal distance to move the center of gravity while
maintaining balance without detaching their feet from the ground<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is diminished in people with hemiplegia<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and hemiplegia can cause a reduction in
patients&#x02019; limits of stability, which is defined as the maximal distance that an individual
can shift his or her weight in any direction without loss of balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. For improving balance ability, the patients have to
increase their trunk stabilization. The stabilization of the trunk is necessary for the
stability of the spine and the pelvis when they are in a functional position, to increase
stability during movement, to enhance muscle strength, and to adjust muscle movements and
balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The principal trunk
stabilization exercises are pelvic tilt exercises, quadruped exercises, abdominal hollowing
exercises, and bridging exercises<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It can
be used as a low intensity weight bearing exercise, as it is an important posture to
perform, loading weight on the knee and at the same time it develops coordination from a
sitting to a standing position<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Bridging exercises (BE) are commonly used therapeutically for lumbopelvic
stabilization<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Doing BE on a plinth
lowers the patient&#x02019;s center of gravity, which reduces fear and the instability of weight
bearing during gait, and allows exercise in a secure posture<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. BE helps to coordinate global and local muscle development<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although a number of studies on the effects
of BE with various postures on the activation of trunk muscles and changes in the activity
ratio between global and local muscles have been conducted<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, no studies have been done to prove the effects of weight shifting
abilities on the paretic side while on the static state.</p><p>Bridging exercise is a method that is often used clinically, and much research has been
conducted using diverse methods and modifications. Recently, attention has focused on
changes in the activities of the trunk muscles during bridging exercises, and many studies
have attempted to identify an efficient method for enhancing the activities of the trunk
muscles. The conventional bridging exercise is conducted in a supine position, and most
other exercises are modifications of this exercise. To the best of our knowledge, very
little research on prone bridging exercises has taken place.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to verify the effects of a modified bridging exercise on the
static balance of a stroke patient with improvement in weight bearing on the affected side
in standing and static balancing ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 patients diagnosed with hemiplegia resulting from stroke
by a rehabilitation doctor practicing in N Hospital located in Daegu, South Korea. They were
randomly and equally assigned to a supine bridge exercise group (SBG: 4 males, 6 females), a
supine bridge exercise on a TOGU balance pad group (SBTG: 6 males, 4 females), and a
unilateral bridge exercise group (UBG: 7 males, 3 females). The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and
weight of the SBG group was 52.4&#x000b1;40.6&#x02005;years, 165.0&#x000b1;9.5&#x02005;cm, and 66.1&#x000b1;13.1&#x02005;kg, respectively.
Eight of the patients had right hemiplegia and two had left hemiplegia. The onset period was
10.8&#x000b1;6.1 months. The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of the SBTG group was 50.8&#x000b1;5.5&#x02005;years,
165.9&#x000b1;8.6&#x02005;cm, and 63.9&#x000b1;5.2&#x02005;kg, respectively. Six of the patients had right hemiplegia and
four had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 13.4&#x000b1;8.2 months. The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height,
and weight of the UBG group was 50.8&#x000b1;5.5&#x02005;years, 165.9&#x000b1;8.6&#x02005;cm, and 63.9&#x000b1;5.2&#x02005;kg, respectively.
Seven of the patients had right hemiplegia and three had left hemiplegia. The onset period
was 13.4&#x000b1;8.2 months.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: no visual field defect, no abnormality in the
vestibular organs, no orthopedic disease, an unrestricted range of motion, the ability to
understand and perform the exercise as instructed by the researcher, and a score of 24 or
higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean version. Prior to participation, all
participants were required to read and sign an informed consent form, in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol for this study was approved
by the local ethics committee.</p><p>The subjects in the SBG group did the supine bridge exercise. In the starting position of
the bridging exercise in the subjects bent their knee joints at 90 degrees and spread both
arms at about 30 degrees position with both hands on the ground. They kept their head and
neck in a straight position, with their eyes looking at the ceiling. The SBTG group did the
supine bridging exercise on TOGU balance pads. The subjects adopted the same position as
that of the SBG group, but they placed their feet on TOGU balance pads. The UBG group did
the unilateral bridging exercise. Again, adopting the same position as that of the SBG
group, the subjects raised their hemiplegic-side leg.</p><p>The exercises were done for 20 minutes each time, five times per week, for a total of four
weeks.</p><p>For the measurement of balance ability, a biofeedback analysis system (AP1153 Biorescue,
France) was used to determine weight bearing, anterior length in limit of stability, and
posterior length in limit of stability on the affected side in a static standing
position.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (IBM, IL, USA).
After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, a one-way ANOVA was used
to compare the variation in the weight bearing on the affected side in standing, the
anterior length in limit of stability following standing, and the posterior length in limit
of stability following standing. Tests were conducted between the pre- and post-
intervention within each group. The significance of the differences between the three groups
was investigated using the independent t-test. Statistical significance was accepted for
values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The analysis results of each group&#x02019;s weight bearing rate on the paretic side are as

in daily living<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance can be defined
as the ability to maintain the body&#x02019;s center of mass over its base of support and maintain
equilibrium constantly during body movements<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients, who are at a relatively early stage post-onset, show a marked deficit in
weight shifting to the affected leg<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Shin et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that stroke patients&#x02019;
weight support ability was correlated with functional performance ability, and moving the
weight left or right in a standing position was related to motor function, an independent
life, and the amount of time it took to go back home from the hospital. The reason was that
stroke patients&#x02019; ability to move their weight left or right was directly related to gait. In
the current study, weight bearing on the affected side in standing and the forward and
backward movement range in limit of stability in a standing position were compared, and the
results showed a significant effect in the unilateral bridge exercise group and
statistically significant differences between the three groups. Latash et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> used the center of pressure (COP) as a
measure of postural control, and measuring the variables of COP represented changes in the
locations where the ground reaction forces were composite, which referred to the weight
average of all the pressure points that contacted the ground. Kim et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the characteristics of
COP-based variables were utilized widely as a tool to diagnose a patient&#x02019;s prognosis related
to balance disabilities and to assess treatment effects.</p><p>Bridging exercises with the feet on an unstable surface are effective for increasing
dynamic balance, especially for the prevention of spinal damage<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kavcic et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a bridging exercise with the right leg lifted was
very closely associated with the activity of the rectus abdominis in the side bridging
exercise when healthy adults performed lumbar stabilization exercise. Park et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a bridge exercise using
vibration training under an unstable support that used sling equipment significantly
increased the muscle activities of the internal and external oblique muscles of healthy
subjects.</p><p>The results of the current study suggest that the position adopted in the UBG group is
useful for weight bearing on the feet and increasing balance ability. In this study, three
groups performed modified bridging exercises, thereby determining the weight bearing ability
on the affected side, changes in forward weight shifting, and changes in backward weight
shifting. With regard to weight bearing, all three groups (SBG, SBTG, and UBG) increased
weight bearing to 46.2&#x000b1;1.4, 47.0&#x000b1;1.2, and 47.0&#x000b1;1.3. With regard to the COM shifting effect,
not only the AL direction but also the PL direction showed that SBTG 895.9&#x000b1;678.5 and UBG
689.5&#x000b1;269.7 had more significant results than SBG 1020.6&#x000b1;210.1. In particular, the UBG group
experienced the highest body weight bearing ability and COM shifting of PL and AL. That is,
the UBG group&#x02019;s exercise was concluded to be the most suitable balance control ability.
Bridging exercise has been applied in many previous studies already, and it has been
modified variously. Hong et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that changes in muscle activity and muscle endurance can be obtained over unstable
ground surfaces more than on stable ground surfaces, based on their studies on the
application of bridging exercises over various support surfaces. This result is consistent
with those of the current study in which bridge exercise on the unstable base significantly
increased (p&#x0003c;0.05) dynamic and static lumbar stability relative to bridge exercise on the
unstable base<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many patients have difficulty bearing weight on the hemiplegic side and in forward and
backward body movement. Because patients with hemiplegia after stroke normally use a hip
strategy instead of an ankle strategy due to changes in the ground reaction force and the
increased muscle tone of the hip flexors, they feel they will fall down when moving a little
bit forward or backward. Therefore, regaining the ability to move forward and backward is
very important for maintaining posture in standing as well as in walking. In the final
assessment, the increases in the subjects&#x02019; anterior and posterior stability limits were
meaningful, indicating that they had gained more efficient postural control. The subjects
especially needed more strength and proprioceptive senses in the ankle joints when they did
the bridge exercise with the balance pad and the unilateral bridge exercise.</p><p>This study has some limitations. There were only 30 participants, making it difficult to
generalize the results to the general population. Moreover, not only anterior and posterior
COG adjustments, but internal and external adjustments were also important for balance
abilities. Thus, future studies will be conducted to determine how the correlation of
internal and external shifting and anterior and posterior shifting as well as weight bearing
increases on the affected side and postural control improvement are functionally related to
one another.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mahabir</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bickram</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gulliford</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke in Trinidad and Tobago: burden of illness and risk
