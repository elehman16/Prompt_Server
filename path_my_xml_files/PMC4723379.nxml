Three hundred and three postmenopausal women with early breast cancer (EBC) were enrolled (osteoporotic, <italic>n</italic>=25; osteopaenic, <italic>n</italic>=146; normal bone mineral density (BMD), <italic>n</italic>=126). Weekly alendronate (70&#x000a0;mg) treatment efficacy as triggered by the algorithm in preventing bone loss was evaluated. All patients received anastrozole (1&#x000a0;mg daily), calcium and vitamin D.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All osteoporotic patients received alendronate at baseline.

Extended survival exposes the majority of patients to the late effects of breast cancer therapies. Osteoporosis and the increased risk of associated skeletal related events are recognised as undesirable outcomes of various adjuvant therapies for early breast cancer <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Surveillance strategies for breast cancer need to incorporate monitoring for recurrence of disease as well as strategies to prevent and manage the bone related complications of adjuvant therapies.</p><p>Aromatase inhibitors in early breast cancer have demonstrated greater efficacy compared to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with improved disease free survival, time to recurrence and time to distant recurrence <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The suppression of oestrogen levels with AIs results in accelerated bone mineral loss and increased fracture risk. AIBL almost doubles the rate of loss seen in healthy postmenopausal women <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Results from the ATAC sub-study demonstrated that progressive AIBL occurs throughout the duration of AI treatment. This is greater in the lumbar spine in the first two years of therapy commencement and the decline appears to be less marked in years two to five of treatment but does not slow down in the hip <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In 2005, Osteoporosis Australia proposed an algorithm <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> to manage AIBL (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The algorithm assesses changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and N-telopeptide (NTx, a bone resorption marker) to determine timing of bisphosphonate therapy commencement. The Bisphosphonate and Anastrozole Trial &#x02013; Bone Maintenance Algorithm Assessment (BATMAN) was designed to test the utility of this algorithm in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive early breast cancer receiving adjuvant anastrozole, and the efficacy of intervention with alendronate, given in an osteoporosis schedule. Most studies in this area have excluded patients with osteoporosis due to the concern of worsening BMD. This study specifically addresses the issues of women with osteopaenia and osteoporosis in this setting.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Patients and method</title><p>Eligible participants were postmenopausal women with Stage I&#x02013;IIIa hormone receptor positive breast cancer assessed as suitable for treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, specifically anastrozole. Postmenopausal status was defined as age &#x0003e;55 years with cessation of menstruation; &#x0003c;55 years of age and no menses for 12 months;&#x0003e; 50 but &#x0003c;55 and amenorrhoeic (spontaneous, hysterectomy) and with postmenopausal gonadotrophin or oestradiol levels (luteinising hormone &#x0003e;14&#x000a0;IU/L, follicle stimulating hormone levels &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;IU/L, oestradiol &#x0003c;110&#x000a0;pmol/L or according to the reference range for the laboratory involved); or bilateral oophorectomy. Following the observation of resumption of menses and reversal of menopause in a number of patients all of whom were under 50 years of age, we amended the entry criterion to exclude women under 50 years. Hormone replacement therapy must have been discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to registration. Other eligibility requirements were WHO performance status &#x02264;2, with adequate renal and liver function.</p><p>Patients receiving prior treatments with bisphosphonates and continuous systemic corticosteroids within the past 12 months were excluded. Any prior use of parathyroid hormone (PTH) for more than 1 week; systemic sodium fluoride for &#x0003e;3 months during the past 2 years; any drugs known to affect the skeleton (eg. calcitonin, mithramycin, or gallium nitrate) were not allowed prior to and during the study. Patients with history of diseases with influence on bone metabolism (e.g. Paget&#x02032;s disease, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, and primary or secondary hyperthyroidism), lactose intolerance, delayed oesophageal emptying; previous or concomitant malignancy within the past 5 years, were also excluded. Patients with a fracture due to minimal trauma that was detected on baseline radiology were excluded from the study.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before inclusion. The study was approved by the Barwon Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC), Eastern Health HREC, St Vincent&#x02032;s HREC, North Coast Area Health Service HREC, and Sydney South West Area Health Service HREC. Eight Australian oncology centres participated. These centres included Barwon Health, St John of God Healthcare Geelong, South West Healthcare (Warrnambool), Box Hill Hospital, Maroondah Hospital, St. Vincent&#x02032;s Hospital Melbourne, Tweed Hospital and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council&#x02032;s National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving Humans (June 1999) and the CPMP/ICH Notes for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95).</p><p>Osteoporosis was defined as BMD 2.5 standard deviations or more below the reference range mean for young adults. Osteopaenia being those with a BMD between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below the young adult mean <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck BMD was quantified with Lunar DPX-L (Lunar, Madison, WI, USA), GE-Lunar Prodigy (Prodigy; GE Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) or Norland Excell&#x02122; machines. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, 1, 2 and 3 years assessed using Norland machines were converted to Lunar equivalents using the Genant conversion equations <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. N-telopeptide (NTx) is a marker of bone resorption. Urine samples for urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) were collected at baseline, and at 6 months after registration. Participants requiring alendronate were retested 6 months after commencing alendronate.</p><p>All patients were commenced on oral anastrozole 1&#x000a0;mg daily, calcium (&#x02265; 500&#x000a0;mg per day) and Vitamin D (&#x02265; 400 IU daily) supplements. No dose modifications were permitted for the duration of the study for those receiving either anastrozole or alendronate.</p><p>In accordance with the OAA, patients with a BMD T-Score below &#x02212;2.5 S.D. at either the lumbar vertebra or femoral neck at any time-point, were commenced on alendronate 70&#x000a0;mg oral weekly. Patients with a T-score between &#x02212;2.0 S.D. and &#x02212;2.5 S.D. commenced alendronate if the index of bone mineral turnover was elevated &#x0003e;20% at the 6-month time-point. If the BMD T-Score fell below &#x02212;2.0 S.D. at either the lumbar vertebra or femoral neck at any time during the five-year treatment period, bone mineral turnover studies were instituted. If the bone mineral turnover studies indicated that the biochemical marker (uNTx) was elevated more than 20% over baseline, then bisphosphonate therapy was instituted.</p><p>Patients were reviewed at 3 monthly intervals in years one and two, and 6 monthly until year 5 with clinical examination and a yearly mammogram.</p><p>In this 3-year analysis, we assessed the change in both lumbar vertebra (L2 to L4) and femoral neck BMD at 12 monthly intervals. We also assessed the benefit of alendronate with respect to uNTx and BMD in protecting bone health. The clinical fracture incidence cumulative over 3 years was evaluated.</p><p>Different influences on lipid profiles have been observed in trials comparing aromatase inhibitors to tamoxifen <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. For safety reasons, a fasting lipid assessment (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides) was measured at baseline and repeated at the 6-month trial visit for all participants. Vitamin D level was measured at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>BMD was analysed using a repeated measures model that implicitly allowed for missing data and assessed dependent samples over time with the multiple comparison Tukeys test applied.

At baseline, 25 (8.4%) were classified as having osteoporosis, 146 (49.2%) were osteopaenic and 126 (42.1%) patients had normal BMD. All of the 25 osteoporotic patients commenced alendronate at baseline. Twenty-two osteopaenic patients were determined by the algorithm to be eligible for alendronate during the trial period but 1 patient refused. One osteopaenic patient received alendronate off trial after a non-traumatic fracture. One hundred and twenty four osteopaenic patients did not require alendronate. Only 2 of the patients with normal BMD were treated with alendronate, after a clinical fracture event, without triggering the algorithm and were excluded from this time point.</p><p><xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the baseline characteristics of the study population. Patients in the normal baseline BMD subgroup tended to be younger. The mean age was higher for the patients in the early intervention (&#x0003c;18 months from commencing alendronate) osteopaenic group in comparison to the late intervention (&#x02265;18 months) group. BMD was higher in the osteopaenic group that received late and no intervention. In the osteopaenic subgroup, there were 2 patients that had previous axillary clearance for a prior breast cancer and hence lymph node stage was not determined for the current breast cancer.

Only 5 patients withdrew due to bisphosphonate-related AEs, which were largely due to gastrointestinal side effects. There were no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

Nine (3%) patients experienced return of ovarian function while on anastrozole, necessitating discontinuation of their trial participation. They were all aged &#x02264;50 years and most of these had experienced chemotherapy-induced menopause.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>5</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on the results of this three-year analysis, alendronate effectively increases BMD in osteoporotic, postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant therapy with anastrozole. This subgroup of women would have the greatest risk of bone loss and fracture. The benefit seen with bisphosphonate therapy was greater at the spine than at the hip but did significantly improve both spine and hip BMD (15.6%, p&#x0003c;0.01 and 5.6%, p&#x0003c;0.01 at 3 years respectively). Prior studies, such as Z-FAST <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, have mostly reported the impact of bisphosphonates on BMD in women with osteopaenia. Our findings are consistent with the results from the ARIBON trial that included 13 osteoporotic women who received anastrozole and ibandronate contributing to an increased BMD of 3.52% and 2.49% for the lumbar spine and hip at 2 years <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Subsequent results of this study continue to show an increase in lumbar BMD (9.65%) and at the hip (2.72%) for the 9/13 patients in the osteoporotic group when assessed at their 5 year follow-up, demonstrating the ability to use AI therapy currently with a bisphosphonate in these women <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our study also confirms the safety of commencing aromatase inhibitors in this frequently excluded sub-group.</p><p>BMD of the spine, but not at the hip, demonstrated a significant increase of 6.3%, <italic>p</italic>=0.02 at 3 years in the osteopaenic group receiving early intervention with alendronate. However, we did not demonstrate an improvement in BMD for the osteopaenic group receiving late intervention with alendronate. Patient numbers were small and larger benefit might be expected with longer follow 'up' of these patients. These late intervention patients triggered the algorithm and started on alendronate at different time points (&#x0003c;18 months; 18&#x02013;24 months; 24&#x02013;36 months; &#x0003e;36 months). This results in a confounding proportion of patients within this group with ongoing BMD loss prior to starting bisphosphonate therapy.</p><p>The mean time to the introduction of alendronate was 21.5 months in the osteopaenic group. With this delay in institution of alendronate there has been limited observation time post intervention. An additional reason for the small or lack of demonstrable benefit from early and late alendronate in the osteopaenic group respectively, is our use of the baseline BMD as the comparator. This introduces a bias against the therapy BMD end point, as the BMD further reduced prior to the intervention. Perhaps with a longer follow-up period of 5 years this may allow better demonstration of the protective effect of bisphosphonate therapy.</p><p>In the normal BMD subgroup, there was progressive bone loss over 3 years at the spine and hip (5.4% and 4.5%, respectively). This finding is consistent with the ATAC data <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Two patients required alendronate triggered by clinical events but there were no algorithm triggered events. There were no non-traumatic fractures reported in the osteopaenic group receiving alendronate compared with 8% in the group without alendronate. The osteoporotic patients would be presumed to have a higher fracture rate than the osteopaenic group associated with lower baseline BMD. The non-traumatic fracture rate in the osteoporotic group receiving alendronate was lower in comparison to the osteopaenic group without alendronate. Overall this suggests a protective effect of alendronate. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in fracture rates.</p><p>Eleven osteopaenic patients progressed to osteoporosis with T scores &#x02264;&#x02212;2.5 but this was not observed for patients with a normal baseline BMD. The intervention rate, with the Osteoporosis Australia Algorithm, for introducing alendronate to the patients with osteopaenia (15.1%) was lower than we had expected. Given that 27% of Australian women aged 60 and over are considered osteoporotic and 51% <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> are osteopaenic, it was expected that approximately 75% of women accrued would require bisphosphonate therapy. The high rate, 8%, of low trauma fractures we observed in osteopaenic patients without alendronate suggests that the algorithm threshold may be set too high in this group. In the ATAC study, fracture rates were constant during the period of treatment <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. More fractures were reported in the anastrozole than tamoxifen group but then were similar after the completion of treatment. There was no protocol for bone health maintenance in this study and bisphosphonate use was low at 10% and 7% in these groups respectively <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Our patients in the osteopaenic group receiving early intervention had a mean BMD of 1.009&#x000a0;g/cm<sup>2</sup>, equivalent to a T score of &#x02212;1.7. The ATAC sub-study found that 5 women with osteopaenia at baseline (4 in the anastrozole group and 1 receiving tamoxifen) developed osteoporosis. They evaluated the T-scores from baseline to 5 years with linear regression, and found that a T-score of &#x02212;1.5 may define risk for the development of osteoporosis as no patients with a higher T-score dropped to &#x02212;&#x0003c;2.5 on treatment <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The UK expert group have suggested an alternative algorithm. In postmenopausal women with a T-score that falls below &#x02212;2.0 or if the rate of bone loss is more than 4% per year with pre-existing osteopenia, a bisphosphonate is recommended <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This pragmatic recommendation avoids the need to measure uNTx which is expensive and unwieldy. A simplified algorithm, omitting uNTx but taking into account major risk factors for osteoporotic fracture may have more clinical utility.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is common in our community and contributes adversely to bone health, and to breast cancer outcomes. It is associated with reduced BMD and osteoporosis. Although most studies focused on the elderly population, appropriate vitamin D supplementation is an important modifiable risk factor for reducing falls and fractures <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. All the participants in our trial received 400&#x02013;500&#x000a0;IU of oral vitamin D daily regardless of their baseline vitamin D levels. One third of our patients had vitamin D deficiency. We did not see a gradient in mean vitamin D levels between patients from more northerly states and Southern Victoria. This high level of vitamin D deficiency in our patients is comparable to that found in our community regardless of season and latitude. The reported prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (&#x02264;50&#x000a0;nmol/L) in women during winter/spring was 40.5%, and 37.4% in southeast Queensland (latitude 28.2&#x000b0;S), and Geelong (38&#x000b0;S) <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. According to the Working Group of the Australian and New Zealand Bone and Mineral Society, Endocrine Society of Australia and Osteoporosis Australia, higher doses of vitamin D up to 3000&#x02013;5000&#x000a0;IU daily for 6&#x02013;12 weeks are required to replete body stores, followed by 1000&#x000a0;IU daily as maintenance <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Treatment of vitamin D deficiency was a decision of the investigator clinician.</p><p>Our analysis also showed that there were no meaningful lipid changes with anastrozle, as a surrogate for cardiovascular health. This is in keeping with the TEAM Japan <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, TEAM Greek <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> sub-studies and the SABRE trial <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which showed that AIs have no detrimental effects on lipid parameters. This is reassuring when using AIs in women with favourable prognosis breast cancer.</p><p>Three percent of the participants reported return of ovarian function while receiving adjuvant anastrozole. This raises concern that these patients were exposed to a period of inadequate adjuvant therapy as the anticancer effects from AIs would be abrogated due to return of ovarian production of oestradiol. AI&#x02032;s may in fact induce ovulation <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Smith et al. suggested guidelines for patients with chemotherapy induced amenorrhoea recommending that women &#x0003c;40 years old should not receive an AI alone as adjuvant treatment <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These guidelines were not published prior to the commencement of the trial. For women older than 40 years, it was suggested that serial monitoring of sexual hormone levels should be performed and requires a sensitive assay. We have observed reversal of chemotherapy-induced menopause in patients up to age 49 years. An alternative is to use tamoxifen alone, with the option of a later switch or an AI with concurrent ovarian function suppression. Women in this age group should be informed of the possibility of return of ovarian function and to report menstrual bleeding or the cessation of hot flushes to their treating oncologists <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The reversals of ovarian function were all in women under 50, and we amended the entry criterion to exclude this age group.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>6</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Aromatase inhibitor induced bone loss is less dramatic than expected, can be managed and does not contraindicate AI use.
