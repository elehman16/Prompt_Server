Educational outreach is garnering attention as a supplemental method to enhance health care worker capacity, yet there is little information about the timing and duration required to improve facility performance. We sought to evaluate the effects of an infectious disease training program followed by either immediate or delayed on-site support (OSS), an educational outreach approach, on nine facility performance indicators for emergency triage, assessment, and treatment; malaria; and pneumonia. We also compared the effects of nine monthly OSS visits to extended OSS, with three additional visits over six months.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted at 36 health facilities in Uganda, covering 1,275,960 outpatient visits over 23 months. From April 2010 to December 2010, 36 sites received infectious disease training; 18 randomly selected sites in arm A received nine monthly OSS visits (immediate OSS) and 18 sites in arm B did not. From March 2011 to September 2011, arm A sites received three additional visits every two months (extended OSS), while the arm B sites received eight monthly OSS visits (delayed OSS). We compared the combined effect of training and delayed OSS to training followed by immediate OSS to determine the effect of delaying OSS implementation by nine months. We also compared facility performance in arm A during the extended OSS to immediate OSS to examine the effect of additional, less frequent OSS.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Delayed OSS, when combined with training, was associated with significant pre/post improvements in four indicators: outpatients triaged (44% vs. 87%, aRR = 1.54, 99% CI = 1.11, 2.15); emergency and priority patients admitted, detained, or referred (16% vs. 31%, aRR = 1.74, 99% CI = 1.10, 2.75); patients with a negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial (53% vs. 34%, aRR = 0.67, 99% CI = 0.55, 0.82); and pneumonia suspects assessed for pneumonia (6% vs. 27%, aRR = 2.97, 99% CI = 1.44, 6.17). Differences between the delayed OSS and immediate OSS arms were not statistically significant for any of the nine indicators (all adjusted relative RR (aRRR) between 0.76&#x02013;1.44, all p&#x0003e;0.06). Extended OSS was associated with significant improvement in two indicators (outpatients triaged: aRR = 1.09, 99% CI = 1.01; emergency and priority patients admitted, detained, or referred: aRR = 1.22, 99% CI = 1.01, 1.38) and decline in one (pneumonia suspects assessed for pneumonia: aRR: 0.93; 99% CI = 0.88, 0.98).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Educational outreach held up to nine months after training had similar effects on facility performance as educational outreach started within one month post-training.

At the same time, these existing HCWs require on-going capacity development to continuously update their knowledge and skills to align with changes in national health policies and treatment guidelines.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that didactic, classroom-based, in-service trainings, a common form of capacity development throughout the world, are not sufficient to ensure adherence to clinical guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These trainings also take HCWs away from busy health facilities, leaving these facilities even further understaffed. A recent study in Uganda found that 15% of HCWs were absent from their facility due to trainings [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Capacity building methods that allow HCWs to remain on-site in understaffed health facilities may be particularly suited for low-resource settings.</p><p>Donors and organizations implementing capacity development programs have shown increasing interest in educational outreach and continuous quality improvement as key methods for building HCWs&#x02019; capacity and improving the quality of care [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Educational outreach is described as &#x0201c;a personal visit by a trained person to health professionals in their own settings&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Continuous quality improvement is made up of three essential features: systematic data guided activities, designing with local conditions in mind, and iterative development and testing [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition to reduced time away from health facilities, these interventions offer staff development activities that are directly relevant to HCWs&#x02019; work environment and provide increased opportunities for team-based interaction [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Recent randomized control trials and reviews reveal that educational outreach, which sometimes include continuous quality improvement activities, can improve the quality of patient care [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, less is known about the required timing, duration and frequency of such interventions [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a cluster randomized control trial of the World Health Organization&#x02019;s Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) program in Benin, HCWs and those who received on-going supervisory visits (with two visits every three months as the recommended frequency) maintained a higher level of performance, even though only 29% of planned visits occurred [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared to those who received one supervisory visit one month after IMCI training. Both groups maintained their performance on three quality of care indicators three years after the initial training [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Our study adds new information about the effect of timing, duration, and frequency of educational outreach activities on facility performance. This article presents the results from Phase 2 of the Integrated Infectious Disease Capacity Building Evaluation (IDCAP) [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In Phase 1, IDCAP conducted a cluster randomized control trial to test the effect of the Integrated Management of Infectious Disease (IMID) training program based at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala and on-site support (OSS), an educational outreach intervention with continuous quality improvement activities, on individual clinician competence [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and practice, facility performance [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and population-based mortality of children less than five years [(Naikoba, etal., 2012)]. The two objectives of this Phase 2 analysis were to: a) test the combined effect of training and OSS when they are given sequentially compared with a nine month delay and b) test the effect of extended OSS on facility performance. We examined indicators in three program areas with pre/post improvements in Phase 1. Results from the arm with delayed implementation provide an opportunity to examine the effects of timing of the interventions. When reporting the phase 1 trial results for the performance indicators [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we recommended continuing OSS over longer time period and concentrating effort on specific indicators. The results from phase 2 are an opportunity to examine the effects of continued OSS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was conducted at 36 health centers IV or comparable facilities in Uganda.

The four hospitals in arm B had a lower attendance rate (55%), whereas the one hospital in arm A had a 90% attendance rate.

While the magnitude of change tended to be smaller with delayed than with immediate on-site support, this difference was not significant for any of the nine indicators. Thus, educational outreach, in this case coupled with continuous quality improvement activities, held up to nine months after an initial training can still lead to improvement in health facility indicators.</p><p>The on-site support extension period showed significant improvement for two indicators (outpatients triaged and emergency and priority patients who were admitted, detained, or referred), a significant decrease in one indicator (patients aged under five years who received appropriate antibiotic treatment) and no significant change for the remaining six indicators. A reduced level of effort for on-site support, conducting visits every other month rather than every month, had heterogeneous effects during six months after the trial, but was effective in maintaining improvements made during the more intensive time period. This corroborates data from a pre/post study on malaria case management, in which on-going monthly or bi-monthly site visits led to sustained improvements in clinical performance up to one year after training [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Facility performance indicators at these sites continued to improve after the first year, reaching nearly perfect performance for malaria diagnostic testing and appropriate treatment after four years of implementation[<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>This study adds new information about the effect of timing, duration, and frequency of educational outreach activities on facility performance. The delayed on-site support arm provided a rare opportunity to rigorously assess the timing of on-site support in relation to training. In most studies published on training and on-site support interventions, the on-site support immediately follows training. However, on a larger scale such well-timed interventions are not always possible, as program managers face competing priorities when scheduling interventions. Based on the findings presented, training program managers should be encouraged that they can implement an educational outreach intervention up to nine months after training with statistically significant improvements in performance. These findings may also be useful for designing and implementing inter-professional and community-based education programs for pre-service health professionals, such as the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>While the majority of indicators showed large improvements over time, five out of the nine indicators were still below 60% and one reverse coded indicator, patients with a positive malaria test who were prescribed an antibiotic remained above 40% at time 3, after several months of OSS visits. This is consistent with findings from other studies, in which post-intervention practice was often less than 50% of desired performance [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The median level of improvement in our study was 16% (range -1% to 59%), consistent with the review of educational outreach visits, which reported a median relative improvement in performance indicators of 21.0% (interquartile range 11% to 41%) [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The majority of studies in this review were conducted in high resource settings and these results were achieved after one or two visits. Given the lower level of pre-service training and lack of infrastructure, staffing and support in limited resource settings, a longer duration and more concentrated effort may be required to achieve an effect similar to those found in high resource settings [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We may have had unrealistic expectations for improvements in the nine facility performance indicators presented here and 23 indicators in Weaver et al [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], even after including the additional six months of intervention in the extended OSS. Rather than trying to address a multitude of indicators at the same time, facilities could instead focus on one to four indicators until the desired level of performance is achieved before shifting the program&#x02019;s focus to other performance indicators.</p><p>A program review by the HealthCare Improvement Project assessed 27 collaborative quality improvement projects across 12 countries [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In pre/post analyses, these projects demonstrated an average of 50% improvement after one year and projects focused on one to seven quality of care indicators (an average of 3.75), usually within one focus area (i.e. maternal health, HIV, TB, malaria). The Joint Uganda Malaria Program (JUMP) program, on which the IDCAP program was modeled, combined training with a malaria surveillance program that included on-site visits every one to two months. Selected sites improved two key malaria indicators to above 90% after four years of implementation [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>A longer intervention duration, which slowly integrates multiple diseases, may be a more effective method for improving quality of care. Yet, even the modest facility performance improvements observed during the IDCAP intervention may translate into significant changes in health outcomes at the population level. An epidemiological model of the combined effects of IMID training and on-site support in Phase 1 showed reduced malaria prevalence by over 16% (Ssebuliba et al., unpublished manuscript).</p><p>In Uganda, donor-funded NGOs are supporting the Ugandan Ministry of Health to conduct supervision, with the majority of these programs focusing on vertical programs, such as HIV, TB or malaria. Integrating OSS to cover multiple diseases and sequencing the focus of visits could reduce redundancies in disease-specific support visits, such as assessing infrastructure and stock issues, and reducing the additional staff time and transport expenses related with supporting multiple single-disease interventions. Currently, the Ugandan Ministry of Health is encouraging this type of integrated supervision across disease areas (Mbonye, personal communication). The design of IDCAP was based on the JUMP model, which has been successfully scaled in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0136966.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on the large effects of IMID and OSS on several indicators found in this study, further operational research is needed to determine whether a phased approach focused on improving a small set of related indicators and building in additional disease areas over a longer period of time would produce effect on an integrated set of facility performance indicators.</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitations</title><p>Uptake of the intervention in the delayed OSS was lower than in the immediate on-site support, primarily due to the inclusion of a greater number of hospitals. This may have led to the smaller magnitude of change observed in the delayed OSS arm compared to the immediate on-site support. The sample size for this study was designed to detect a difference between arms at a five percent level of significance and may not be sufficient to detect a difference-in-difference at the one percent level of significance comparing two arms before and during the training and on-site support interventions. The accuracy of the data were not validated. It is possible that patients meeting the denominator definitions (i.e. emergency patients, malaria suspects, pneumonia suspects) were present but were not recorded, which would lead to an under reporting of cases for these indicators. The &#x0201c;post&#x0201d; analysis period was the period during the implementation of on-site support, rather than after, which may have led to an underestimation of the effect of the intervention. The pre/post analysis components, to measure the effect of delayed on-site support on arm B and the effect of the on-site support extension period on arm A, did not control for other changes at the sites over the course of the intervention. Also, in this study we did not test maintenance of facility performance after discontinuation of OSS. Given that indicators in arm A showed no significant decline during January to February 2011, the two months when no OSS took place, it is possible that the facility performance at these sites would have been maintained without the additional bi-monthly OSS. Further research is needed to determine whether facility performance can be maintained in the absence of on-going educational outreach.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Generalizability</title><p>Eligibility criteria for IDCAP focused on health centers IV and comparable small hospitals in Uganda that met the inclusion criteria, thus these results would only be generalizable to these health facilities in Uganda. However, to the extent that these health facilities are similar to other primary care facilities throughout sub-Saharan Africa these results may inform the design and implementation educational outreach in other settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Educational outreach held up to nine months after training had statistically significant effects on facility performance.
