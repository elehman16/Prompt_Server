Adjusting asthma treatment based on airway inflammation rather than symptoms reduces the exacerbation rate by 50&#x000a0;%. The Breathing for Life Trial (BLT) will test whether this approach also improves perinatal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>BLT is a multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial of asthma management guided by fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO, a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation) compared to usual care, with prospective infant follow-up. Women with physician-diagnosed asthma, asthma symptoms and/or medication use in the previous 12&#x000a0;months, who are 12&#x02013;22 weeks gestation, will be eligible for inclusion. Women randomised to the control group will have one clinical assessment of their asthma, including self-management education. Any treatment changes will be made by their general practitioner. Women randomised to the intervention group will have clinical assessments every 3&#x02013;6 weeks during pregnancy, and asthma treatments will be adjusted every second visit based on an algorithm which uses FENO to adjust inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose (increase in dose when FENO &#x0003e;29 parts per billion (ppb), decrease in dose when FENO &#x0003c;19&#x000a0;ppb, and no change when FENO is between 19 and 29&#x000a0;ppb). A long acting beta agonist (LABA) will be added when symptoms remain uncontrolled. Both the control and intervention groups will report on exacerbations at a postpartum phone interview. The primary outcome is adverse perinatal outcome (a composite measure including preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, neonatal hospitalisation at birth or perinatal mortality), assessed from hospital records. Secondary outcomes will be each component of the primary outcome, maternal exacerbations requiring medical intervention during pregnancy (both smokers and non-smokers), and hospitalisation and emergency department presentation for wheeze, bronchiolitis or croup in the first 12&#x000a0;months of infancy. Outcome assessment and statistical analysis of the primary outcome will be blinded. To detect a reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes from 35&#x000a0;% to 26&#x000a0;%, 600 pregnant women with asthma per group are required.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide evidence for the effectiveness of a FENO-based management strategy in improving perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with asthma.

Up to 45&#x000a0;% of women with asthma have exacerbations during pregnancy, requiring medical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; with the 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% of women with asthma who continue to smoke during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], at an even greater risk of a severe exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Asthma itself, as well as exacerbations, moderate to severe asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] are significant risk factors for poor perinatal outcomes, including pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, low birth weight, small for gestational age, neonatal hospitalisation and perinatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, oral corticosteroid use, a common treatment for exacerbations, has been associated with preterm delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, an intervention which reduces the rate of exacerbations during pregnancy, may also improve perinatal outcomes, in both smokers and non-smokers. Notably, in a meta-analysis of prospective and retrospective cohort studies, the risk for preterm delivery, preterm labour and neonatal hospitalisation among women with asthma was increased in those without active asthma management, while there was no increased risk in women with active asthma management during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This suggests that the effect of maternal asthma on some perinatal outcomes may be modifiable with &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; asthma management, and that asthma management during pregnancy, in both smokers and non-smokers, is important and necessary for the health of the mother and her child.</p><p>Regular monitoring of asthma during pregnancy is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for two main reasons: (i) typically, one third of women experience an improvement, one third have no change, and one third have a subjective worsening of their asthma while pregnant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; and (ii) these changes are not easily predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which can complicate management. Current practice is to adjust asthma therapy following an assessment of symptoms and lung function; however, these measures are not always reflective of airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which is the target of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, suggesting that treatment decisions may be inappropriate when based on clinical assessment alone. Inflammation-guided therapy, known as &#x02018;inflammometry&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], is a novel alternative. This strategy has resulted in a significant reduction in exacerbations in non-pregnant adults with asthma, where the adjustment of ICS doses was informed by a marker (or a surrogate marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) of inflammation, such as sputum eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although FENO measurement is supported by the American Thoracic Society for clinical use to identify the need for ICS treatment, predict the response to ICS, and to adjust ICS doses in non-pregnant asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], data is lacking to support its use in pregnancy, with only one &#x02018;inflammometry&#x02019; trial in pregnancy published to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Our Managing Asthma in Pregnancy (MAP) Study was the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the use of FENO-guided management during pregnancy and was conducted in 220 non-smoking women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the intervention group, ICS dose was adjusted monthly based on the result of the FENO test, which measures steroid sensitive inflammation, while symptoms and lung function (assessed by the Asthma Control Questionnaire, ACQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) were used to add long acting beta agonist (LABA) when uncontrolled symptoms remained. In the control group, monthly treatment changes were made based on symptoms and lung function (assessed by the ACQ) alone. There was a significant 50&#x000a0;% reduction in the primary outcome, exacerbations requiring medical intervention, in the FENO group, compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, this trial found that exposure to oral and inhaled corticosteroids was significantly reduced in the FENO intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While the trial was not powered for neonatal or infant outcomes, the results also indicated a reduction in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions (7.6&#x000a0;% vs 16.5&#x000a0;%) and a reduced odds of recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis (OR 0.08, 95&#x000a0;% CI [0.01, 0.62]) and recurrent croup (OR 0.12, 95&#x000a0;% CI [0.01, 0.99]) in the first 12&#x000a0;months of life (parent reported), in the intervention versus control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These promising results suggest that improving asthma management in pregnancy may have long term benefits to childhood health; however, these outcomes need to be further investigated in an adequately powered trial. The MAP study &#x02018;control&#x02019; group also received substantially enhanced care, in comparison to the management typically provided by current practice, including monthly asthma assessments and telephone follow-ups with a trained asthma educator, provision of free asthma medications, and monthly dose adjustments; thus, the efficacy of FENO-based management is yet to be compared against usual asthma care during pregnancy.</p><p>The effects of FENO-based asthma management during pregnancy on perinatal and infant outcomes are yet to be investigated in an adequately powered trial. In addition, whether the intervention is effective in reducing exacerbations in pregnant women who smoke is unknown. Examining the cost-effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention in the clinical setting is warranted, in order to support the future implementation of FENO-based management into clinical practice.</p><p>Therefore, the primary aim of the Breathing for Life Trial (BLT) is to assess whether FENO-guided management of asthma during pregnancy reduces the rate of adverse perinatal outcomes among non-smokers and smokers, compared with usual best care. Secondary aims of the trial are to assess whether, compared to usual best care, FENO-guided management of asthma during pregnancy: (i) reduces exacerbations requiring medical intervention among women who smoke; (ii) reduces the rate of bronchiolitis, croup and wheeze leading to emergency department presentation or hospitalisation in the first year of infancy; (iv) is cost effective; and (iv) is acceptable to pregnant women, midwives and care-givers in the antenatal clinic setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>BLT is a multicentre, parallel-group, RCT of FENO-guided management in pregnant women with asthma compared to usual care, with prospective infant follow-up for 12&#x000a0;months (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

At this visit, patient demographics and characteristics (including maternal height, weight and ethnicity), asthma history and current medications will be collected. Asthma symptoms, triggers and self-management skills will be assessed; brief asthma education, correction of inhaler technique (as required), and written information (a pamphlet on asthma and pregnancy, available from Asthma Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]) will be provided. Lung function will be assessed by spirometry, using the EasyOne Spirometer (Niche Medical, Sydney, Australia). Maternal smoking will be self-reported and confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide (ECO) measurement (piCO Smokerlyzer Breath CO Monitor, Bedfont, UK; &#x02265;10 parts per million (ppm) will be considered current smokers) and advice on smoking cessation provided as appropriate, with a referral to the Quitline for further assistance. Health care providers (general practitioner (GP), midwife and respiratory physician as applicable) will be informed of the woman&#x02019;s participation in the trial. No medications will be provided by the trial for the control group; the woman&#x02019;s asthma therapy will continue to be managed by their physician. All women will continue with standard antenatal care visits, and will receive a phone call within six weeks post-partum to enquire about any asthma-related health events (exacerbations) and adverse health events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Treatment</title><p>Women randomised to the FENO-based management intervention will receive usual best care (as described above) plus monthly follow-up (three to six weekly) with the research nurse or midwife coinciding with their regular antenatal appointments, until delivery. Women without a written asthma action plan will be provided with one. At each visit, FENO will be measured using the portable NIOX MINO or NIOX VERO analyser (Aerocrine, Solna, Sweden), along with ECO measurement and spirometry. Asthma assessments will be conducted, including completion of the ACQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a 7-item validated questionnaire which covers symptoms (6 items) and lung function (1 item), with scores &#x0003e;1.5 indicating uncontrolled asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Results from the ACQ and FENO measurement will be entered into a predetermined algorithm (using an excel spreadsheet and/or specially-designed application for personal mobile devices), which will be used to assign any pharmaceutical treatment changes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Starting at the first visit and every second visit thereafter, maintenance treatment changes will be made based on the results of this algorithm. When women are taking additional treatment for an exacerbation, no alterations will be made until they return to their maintenance dose. Women who self-report cigarette smoking in the previous week, or have ECO &#x02265;10&#x000a0;ppm, will be considered current smokers for the purposes of applying the treatment algorithm. Required medication will be supplied by the hospital pharmacy at no cost to the participant. Asthma medications will be altered in a two-stage process: (i) assess FENO (eosinophilic inflammation) and adjust anti-inflammatory ICS; and (ii) assess symptoms and lung function (using the ACQ) and adjust long acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABA) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). When FENO is elevated (&#x0003e;29&#x000a0;ppb in non-smokers), the ICS dose will be increased by one dose step. When FENO is low (&#x0003c;19&#x000a0;ppb in non-smokers), the ICS dose will be decreased by one dose step. When FENO is in the mid-range (19&#x02013;29&#x000a0;ppb for non-smokers), the ICS dose will not be changed. If the ACQ score is &#x0003e;1.5, that is, uncontrolled asthma, LABA will be added. Women using ICS or ICS/LABA combinations will have a treatment recommendation provided as an equivalent dose of budesonide (Pulmicort) or budesonide/e-formoterol (Symbicort).

We propose that providing improved antenatal care, which incorporates optimum asthma management using a FENO-based approach, will be effective in reducing these risks among this population of women, with positive consequences for infant health both in the short term and long term. This trial will provide the first evidence as to whether the provision of FENO-based management, as opposed to current best care, can significantly reduce the rate of adverse perinatal outcomes, that is, preterm delivery, IUGR, perinatal mortality or neonatal hospitalisation. If proven successful, this intervention would have profound implications for the health of pregnant women with asthma and their offspring. Specifically, if severe respiratory illnesses such as bronchiolitis were reduced in infancy, then FENO-based asthma management in pregnancy has potential as a primary prevention strategy for childhood asthma, representing a significant breakthrough in asthma research. Furthermore, if successful and cost-effective, this intervention could be implemented into primary care settings such as the antenatal clinic and potentially reduce the burden on the health care system.</p><p>The trial will be powered to detect a significant difference in the proportion of smoking mothers who have exacerbations requiring medical intervention. This is an important objective for the following reasons: (i) pregnant women with asthma are more likely to smoke than pregnant women without asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; (ii) compared with non-smokers, asthmatic women who smoke are at an increased risk of poor perinatal outcomes from the combined effects of smoking, asthma and severe asthma exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; and (iii) the quit rate for smoking in pregnancy is surprisingly low (6&#x02013;10&#x000a0;%) in Australia, despite best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, an intervention that could reduce the rate of asthma exacerbations in women who smoke during pregnancy would have a significant impact on the management of a group of high-risk women.</p><p>The Breathing for Life Trial builds upon our previous trial, which successfully demonstrated a significant reduction in maternal exacerbations using FENO-based management. BLT simplifies the FENO-based management approach used in the previous trial in several ways: (i) the number of drug formulations available will be reduced; (ii) the FENO algorithm results will be generated electronically; (iii) asthma assessments will be aligned with antenatal clinic appointments; and (iv) fewer treatment changes will be made (every two months instead of monthly). In addition, we will measure FENO using the NIOX MINO (or NIOX VERO) electrochemical analyser, an instrument which is practical for use in the antenatal clinic setting, where space and time are limited. It is small and portable, relatively inexpensive and easy to use (no calibration required) and obtains a measurement in less than two minutes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>The implementation of the approach in a public hospital antenatal clinic was not previously investigated, nor was the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. In this trial, we have chosen centres across NSW, ACT and Queensland which differ in location (capital city, regional, tertiary/non-tertiary hospital), the proportion of smoking and obese women, maternal age and education attainment, severity of asthma, ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic status. Therefore, it is anticipated that the intervention will be applicable to the general population.</p><p>As part of this trial, we have included a cost-effectiveness analysis of the primary outcome, that is, adverse perinatal outcomes. This will provide policy relevant information that can be used to determine the resources required for wider implementation of the intervention. In addition, a qualitative assessment of the acceptability of the intervention to both mothers and the antenatal clinic staff will be performed. Therefore, this novel trial will address potential obstacles to implementation in standard practice, including issues of cost and feasibility, generalisability, and effectiveness, compared to usual care.</p><p>We acknowledge that our control group may not be reflective of typical usual care; however, it was deemed unethical to deny a certain level of care to women with asthma during pregnancy. Therefore, the control group will be provided with minimal assessment and education with a trained nurse/asthma educator at the first visit only, that is, self-management skills, knowledge and medication use will be assessed, with brief asthma education, correction of inhaler technique (as required), and written information provided. Of note, this is a reduction in the level of care given to the &#x02018;control&#x02019; group compared to the MAP trial; thus, this minimal level of care is unlikely to affect group differences in our chosen outcomes.</p><p>In conclusion, the Breathing for Life Trial is designed to test an approach which is simple, effective in improving maternal asthma during pregnancy (both for smokers and non-smokers), whilst also being beneficial to the infant, cost-effective, accessible and acceptable to women attending antenatal clinics.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>Ethics approval was obtained for the Breathing for Life Trial at all centres through the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference Number 12/10/17/3.04, NSW HREC Reference No: HREC/12/HNE/357).
