The majority of critical care patients are sedated with opioids to facilitate tolerance of endotracheal tubes and mechanical ventilation, which inhibit gastrointestinal motility and lead to adverse outcomes. Methylnaltrexone is a peripheral opioid antagonist that does not cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and can reverse the peripheral side effects of opioids without affecting the desired central properties. This trial will investigate whether methylnaltrexone can reverse opioid-induced constipation and gastrointestinal dysmotility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a single-centre, multisite, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. 84 patients will be recruited from 4 intensive care units (ICUs) within Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Patients will receive intravenous methylnaltrexone or placebo on a daily basis if they are receiving opioid infusion to facilitate mechanical ventilation and have not opened their bowels for 48&#x02005;hours. All patients will receive standard laxatives as per the clinical ICU bowel protocol prior to randomisation. The primary outcome of the trial will be time to significant rescue-free laxation following randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include tolerance of enteral feed, gastric residual volumes, incidence of pneumonia, blood stream and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection, and any reversal of central opioid effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial protocol, the patient/legal representative information sheets and consent forms have been reviewed and approved by the Harrow Research Ethics Committee (REC Reference 14/LO/2004). An independent Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee are in place, with patient representation. On completion, the trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific meetings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>2014-004687-37; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PB-PG-0613-31073</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Testing methylnaltrexone to treat an important patient-focused outcome (constipation and gastrointestinal stasis) in critical care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Limited sample size to answer other clinical outcomes.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Background and rationale</title><p>Bowel dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU) represents an important problem in critical care, with up to 70% of patients suffering from constipation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> There is increasing evidence that opioids contribute to perioperative and ICU bowel dysfunction.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Other studies demonstrate that bowel dysfunction in the critically ill is associated with adverse outcomes including delay in gastric emptying leading to increased gastro-oesophageal reflux and aspiration, decreased enteral feeding, delayed ICU discharge and increased mortality.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> While bowel dysfunction in critically ill patients is multifactorial and some component is due to the general effects of complex critical illness, exogenous and endogenous opioids contribute to this bowel dysmotility.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Restoration of normal gastrointestinal (GI) function is essential for establishing enteral feeding; it also protects against the bacterial translocation, alleviates GI discomfort due to constipation and shortens ICU stay.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Potential therapeutic inroads have been made in addressing this problem. Naloxone, a competitive opioid antagonist, is most commonly administered systemically to counteract the central and peripheral effects of opioids. When administered enterally in high doses, naloxone has been found to have benefit in the critical care setting, with improved gastric emptying and reduced ventilator-associated pneumonia rates.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Unfortunately in clinical practice, the use of naloxone is limited with large doses required when administered enterally, and the fact that a large proportion of those with gastric stasis are unable to tolerate the nasogastric naloxone itself. Of course, administering the drug via any other route would antagonise the desired central therapeutic effects (analgesia and sedation) in critical care patients.</p><p>Methylnaltrexone is a recently approved peripheral &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist. It is a quaternary ammonium compound with a positive charge, which limits its ability to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. Unlike tertiary opioid antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone, methylnaltrexone does not reverse centrally mediated analgesia or precipitate withdrawal. It is commercially available in prefilled syringes as a sterile, clear and colourless to pale yellow aqueous solution (Salix Pharmaceuticals, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA). The chemical name for methylnaltrexone bromide is (<italic>R</italic>)-<italic>N</italic>-(cyclopropylmethyl) noroxymorphone methobromide. The molecular formula is C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>26</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>Br, and the molecular weight is 436.36.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of methylnaltrexone in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) have been evaluated in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials involving adults with advanced illness (life expectancy of 1&#x02013;6&#x02005;months) who were receiving palliative care.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The majority of patients had incurable cancer, but other diagnoses included cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema and Alzheimer's disease or dementia.</p><p>Trial inclusion criteria included patients taking stable doses of opioids and laxatives for &#x02265;3&#x02005;days and subsequent OIC. Throughout all study periods, patients maintained their usual laxative regimen. The primary end points were rescue-free laxation, defined as a bowel movement within 4&#x02005;hours of the first dose of methylnaltrexone. Secondary end points included time to laxation, pain scores, opioid withdrawal symptoms and adverse events.</p><p>The landmark published trial,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> compared methylnaltrexone 0.15&#x02005;mg/kg (n=62) with placebo (n=71), administered on alternate days for 2&#x02005;weeks. In the second week, the dose was increased to 0.3&#x02005;mg/kg if the patient had fewer than three bowel openings by day 8. Methylnaltrexone improved the laxation rate within 4&#x02005;hours of the first dose compared with placebo (48% vs 15% (p &#x0003c;0.001)). Of the patients who did respond within 4&#x02005;hours of the first dose, half responded within 30&#x02005;min. The study also showed that 52% of all patients taking methylnaltrexone had rescue-free laxation within 4&#x02005;hours, when compared with 8% in the placebo group (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>The efficacy of methylnaltrexone in the palliative care setting has been further confirmed, with a study that compared single subcutaneous doses of methylnaltrexone 0.15&#x02005;mg/kg (n=47) or 0.30&#x02005;mg/kg (n=55) with placebo (n=52).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Methylnaltrexone significantly improved the laxation rate within 4&#x02005;hours of dosing (62% for 0.15&#x02005;mg/kg and 58% for 0.30&#x02005;mg/kg vs 14% for placebo (p&#x0003c;0.0001 for each dose vs placebo)). The median time to laxation was shorter in the group administered methylnaltrexone (70 and 45&#x02005;min for the 0.15 and 0.30&#x02005;mg/kg groups, respectively, compared with placebo (&#x0003e;24&#x02005;hours) (p&#x0003c;0.0001 for each dose vs placebo)).</p><p>While methylnaltrexone is approved for the treatment of OIC in advanced illness in palliative care patients, its use in the medical ICU has been limited and largely anecdotal. Case reports have reported an immediate effect of methylnaltrexone administration on bowel motility. In one report, methylnaltrexone was given intravenously to a critically ill patient with significant burns.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The purpose of that use was to facilitate feeding, although bowel motility was also restored. After 4&#x02005;days of no appreciable bowel function, there was instantaneous improvement in bowel sounds, flatus, gastric residuals and subsequently feeding. In another case, a patient with a palliative stoma and a long history of heroin abuse demonstrated no bowel function and significant distension 7&#x02005;days after stoma formation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Within 15&#x02005;min of methylnaltrexone (subcutaneous injection), there was a brisk output of over 1&#x02005;L from the stoma. Both of these patients were receiving high doses of opioids. Additionally, a recent case report in a critically ill neonate with complex congenital heart disease complicated by 8&#x02005;days of bowel dysmotility following ileosigmoid anastomosis demonstrated that methylnaltrexone (0.15&#x02005;mg/kg subcutaneously) restored bowel function within 15&#x02005;min of injection.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The child was receiving a fentanyl infusion of 2&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/kg/hour. A further case series was presented as an abstract, with patients from burns, cardiac and surgical ICUs being successfully treated with methylnaltrexone subcutaneous injections.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These cases suggest that methylnaltrexone may significantly alleviate bowel dysfunction associated with the use of high doses of opioids in ICU patients.</p><p>In addition, we carried out a retrospective chart review of 88 non-surgical critical care patients receiving fentanyl infusions at the Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust over a 10-week period (1 September&#x02014;15 November 2009).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Fifteen patients met the criteria of failure to laxate within 72&#x02005;hours despite treatment with senna and sodium docusate. Eight of these patients subsequently received conventional rescue therapy (combination of sodium picosulfate (5&#x02005;mg) and two glycerin suppositories (4&#x02005;g)), while seven patients received methylnaltrexone (subcutaneous injection, 0.15&#x02005;mg/kg). Six of seven methylnaltrexone patients responded to one or two doses with laxation within 24&#x02005;hours versus 0/8 for conventional rescue therapy (p=0.001). All methylnaltrexone patients, but only 4/8 of patients administered conventional rescue therapy, progressed to full target enteral feeding (p=0.076) within 24&#x02005;hours. ICU mortality was 2/7 for methylnaltrexone vs 4/8 for standard therapy (p=0.61). There were no adverse effects from either rescue laxative therapies. These encouraging results further support the use of methylnaltrexone in critical care patients.</p><p>The use of opioids can also have an impact on infection. Exogenous opioids are known to have inhibitory effects on immune responses including T-lymphocyte function,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> B-lymphocyte function,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> natural killer cell activity<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> as well as mononuclear cell proliferation, differentiation<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and phagocytosis.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Thus, opioids may modulate the immune response through interaction with their receptors. As well as being present centrally, these receptors have been identified in peripheral nerves, and their endogenous peptide ligand is expressed on granulocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> While yet to be established, the general effect of opioids is thought to be immunosuppressive.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Infection is a major problem in critically ill patients with up to 37.4% of patients demonstrating sepsis in ICU. Common organisms include <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (30%, including 14% methicillin resistance), Pseudomonas spp (14%) and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (13%). Pseudomonas spp have been shown to be independently associated with increased mortality rates.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Patients with sepsis have more severe organ dysfunction, longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and higher mortality rate than patients without sepsis. In animal studies, direct exposure of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> to morphine in vitro showed that morphine transforms the bacteria to a more virulent phenotype that is attenuated in part by methylnaltrexone.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> If the peripheral effects of opioids are reversed in critical care patients, there could be an even more dramatic improvement in infection and patient outcome compared to simply reversing the GI side effects.</p><p>There are considerable safety data available on the use of methylnaltrexone. In phase III trials,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> subcutaneous methylnaltrexone was well tolerated in patents with OIC and an advanced illness. The most common adverse effects reported for all doses of methylnaltrexone are abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, flatulence, dizziness, injection site reactions and hyperhidrosis. None of the reported serious adverse events (SAEs) were attributed to the study drug.</p><p>Rare cases of GI perforation have been reported in patients with advanced illness and conditions that may be associated with localised or diffuse reduction of structural integrity in the wall of the GI tract (ie, cancer, peptic ulcer&#x000a0;and Ogilvie's syndrome). Perforations have involved varying regions of the GI tract, for example, stomach, duodenum&#x000a0;and colon.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that methylnaltrexone is used with caution in patients with known or suspected lesions of the GI tract and is contraindicated in bowel obstruction and acute abdominal illness. Therapy should be discontinued if patients develop severe, persistent and/or worsening abdominal symptoms.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>There was no evidence of systemic opioid withdrawal or significant changes in pain scores throughout the phase III studies in palliative care or the retrospective pilot study in critical care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Methylnaltrexone is licensed for subcutaneous administration in palliative care patients as these groups of patients do not routinely have intravenous access and it can be self-administered subcutaneously. Many trials and case reports have demonstrated that intravenous administration is safe and efficacious.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The pharmacokinetics of intravenous administration are well understood and predictable. In healthy volunteers, repeated administration of intravenous methylnaltrexone is well tolerated, with no significant adverse events or changes in opioid subjective ratings and no clinically noteworthy alterations in pharmacokinetics.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In the ICU, all patients have intravenous catheter in place with 1:1 nursing, and furthermore, many are oedematous due to their underlying critical illness, justifying the use of the intravenous route as more appropriate.</p><p>Therefore, the rationale for the current study is that constipation and gut dysfunction are a major concern in intensive care patients. Reversal of this would lead to patient benefit.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Methylnaltrexone has been shown to be beneficial in treating OIC in patients with advanced illness who are receiving palliative care when response to laxatives has not been sufficient.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> We hope to replicate the beneficial effects of methylnaltrexone in ICU patients. There may also be additional benefits in reducing infection and immunosuppression, and hence an overall improvement in patient outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of methylnaltrexone in inducing laxation in ICU patients sedated with opioid infusions.</p><p>The secondary objectives include observing whether the use of methylnaltrexone leads to increased opioid requirements through central nervous system penetration and antagonism, and assessing whether there are additional benefits such as reduced gastric stasis, improved enteral feeding and a reduction in infection; and finally to assess the safety and side effect profile of intravenous methylnaltrexone in ICU patients.</p><p>Plasma and serum will also be stored and further analysed for cytokine levels, metabolic profiles and leucocyte function assays performed to further investigate the mechanism of the immune effects of opiates and subsequent reversal.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is an interventional, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011750F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011750F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow chart.

The primary end point is time to rescue-free laxation. In a phase III trial in palliative care patients, 48% of participants receiving methylnaltrexone had rescue-free laxation within 4&#x02005;hours compared to 15% in the placebo arm, p&#x0003c;0.001.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Pilot data in ICU patients suggest that a difference in efficacy of this magnitude would be reasonable in the ICU setting (71% vs 0% opened bowels within 12&#x02005;hours).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Allowing for a drop-out rate of 5% (patients who withdraw consent after regaining consciousness), with 42 participants in each arm (26 events in total), this study will have 85% power to detect a difference of 33% (15% vs 48%) in the proportion of patients with rescue-free laxation within 12&#x02005;hours at the 5% level (using a two-tailed log-rank test). This calculation assumes that at the time of analysis, 65% of observations will be censored (either due to withdrawal or rescue), which is likely to be a considerable overestimate since those with rescue-free laxation occurring after 12&#x02005;hours will also be events. We have nevertheless maintained the sample size at 42 per group, in order to ensure the generalisability of results. The recruitment target will therefore be 84 patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Patients will be reviewed on a daily basis by the unit research nurse. All patients who are clinically constipated and on opioid infusion will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria for eligibility of the study. The initial screening will take place following 24&#x02005;hours of constipation following admission and opioid infusion.

The trial outline and information sheet will be given to the patient's next of kin. Provisional written informed consent from the next of kin will be taken for the patient to enter the trial following 48&#x02005;hours of constipation. Ideally patients will be enrolled immediately after 48&#x02005;hours, but the enrolment period will remain open following this to account for delays in screening and gaining consent. If consent has not been obtained between 24 and 48&#x02005;hours of constipation, it will be sought at 48&#x02005;hours or later and before the patient is randomised into the trial or has any blood samples or data taken for the trial.</p><p>Eligible participants will be allocated online to the next available treatment code in the appropriate randomisation list.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Blinding</title><p>When a patient is randomised to the trial, the research nurse will draw up the study drug or placebo into a syringe and the syringe will be labelled to meet the standard hospital requirements before being administered to the patient by the research nurse.

The bedside nurse, clinical medical team, investigators and the data collection team will be blinded throughout the study.</p><p>A randomisation list will be supplied to each hospital pharmacy to allow emergency non-blinding if needed and requested by the local investigators. The local investigators should aim to discuss the need for non-blinding with the trial coordinator or Chief Investigator beforehand if possible, but will have access to a mechanism that permits rapid non-blinding should they feel this is necessary and be unable to contact the study team. Local standard operating procedures (SOPs) describing the emergency non-blinding procedure will be in place.
