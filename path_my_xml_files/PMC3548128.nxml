We excluded potential subjects aged less than 20 years, those who did not consent to participate, and those who had previously completed either the QUEST or the FSSG, or were unable to complete the questionnaires by themselves. On hospitalization, 25 subjects were taking acid-suppressive medications for some reason, of whom 12 were taking histamine type 2 receptor antagonists and the others proton pump inhibitors. During the study period, 39 subjects underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, of whom 6 were found to have erosive esophagitis.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

GERD occurs when the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus leads to troublesome symptoms, with or without mucosal damage and/or complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> Symptom assessment, endoscopy, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, and the proton pump inhibitor test are used for the diagnosis of GERD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> However, there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of this condition. Symptom assessment using a questionnaire is a simple, readily available, noninvasive, and inexpensive method to diagnose GERD. When a questionnaire is to be used as a self-assessed instrument, it requires usability, comprehensibility, and a short completion time, apart from accurate identification as a matter of course. Accordingly, we investigated the convenience of the QUEST and FSSG questionnaires, both major diagnostic instruments for GERD in Japan, focusing on the time required to complete the questionnaire, whether subjects asked any questions as they filled in the questionnaire, and any correlations with questionnaire scores.</p><p>The QUEST questionnaire was developed by Carlsson et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> in 1998 as a self-administered questionnaire for the diagnosis of GERD. The QUEST questionnaire has 7 items that focus on the nature of symptoms and precipitating, exacerbating, and relieving factors. Each response is assigned a score of positive, neutral or negative, and the score for each item is weighted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The QUEST questionnaire has a reported sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 46% for reflux esophagitis when the cut-off score is set at 4 points. In this connection, it was reported that the sensitivity decreased to 54% and specificity increased to 60% when the cut-off score was set at 6 points.</p><p>The FSSG is another self-administered questionnaire developed by Kusano M et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> in 2004, based on Japanese studies of the clinical signs and symptoms of GERD. The FSSG comprises 12 items to which patients with GERD most often answered "yes". Each response is assigned a score for the frequency of each symptom, as follows: 0, never; 1, occasionally; 2, sometimes; 3, often; and 4, always (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). With a cut-off score of 8 points, the FSSG showed a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 59% for reflux esophagitis based on endoscopic examination. It was also reported that raising the cut-off score to 10 points yielded 55% sensitivity and 69% specificity.</p><p>In a comparative study of the QUEST and the FSSG focusing on sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, no differences in these parameters were shown.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> However, no attempt to compare questionnaires in terms of their convenience in clinical use has ever been tried. Previously, we conducted a comparative study of the QUEST and the FSSG questionnaires with healthy volunteers, focusing on their convenience.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref> We concluded that the FSSG was easier to complete and more suitable for clinical use than the QUEST. The results of this study with patients with gastrointestinal disorders are consistent with our previous results with healthy volunteers.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the completion time for the FSSG was shorter than for the QUEST. The shorter completion time for the former is potentially attractive in the clinical setting. The QUEST questionnaire is comprised of 795 Japanese characters, whereas the FSSG of 381 Japanese characters. The difference in the number of characters to be read may affect the completion time. The QUEST questionnaire used in this study is a form translated into Japanese sentence, which might account for large number of Japanese characters and difficulty of understanding for Japanese patients. Furthermore, the FSSG is comprised of 12 questions concerning acid reflux-related symptoms and dyspepsia/dysmotility symptoms, and the response to each question is chosen from the frequency scale in a similar manner, such as never, occasionally, sometimes or always. On the other hand, the QUEST contains 7 questions related to the characteristics of GERD, and the response to each question is chosen from three or four alternatives, so the patient has to read a total of 26 possible responses, contributing to a longer completion time.</p><p>The proportion of subjects asking questions while they filled in the questionnaire was lower for the FSSG than for the QUEST. This consequence implies that the FSSG is easier to understand for patients than the QUEST. The majority of questions the subjects asked in the QUEST is related to the first question, "Which 1 of these 4 statements BEST DESCRIBES the main discomfort you get in your stomach or chest?" A limitation of this study is that it included a variety of subjects irrespective of the coexistence of GERD. Therefore, subjects without discomfort in their stomach or chest may hesitate over which response to choose for this first question.</p><p>Interestingly, the completion time was significantly shorter for subjects with QUEST scores of &#x02265; 4 than those with a score of &#x0003c; 4. The majority of QUEST scores of &#x02265; 4 include subjects with reflux esophagitis, from the viewpoint of sensitivity of the QUEST questionnaire. Furthermore, QUEST scores were significantly higher for subjects not asking questions during completion than in those asking questions. In other words, the QUEST is an easy questionnaire to complete for a patient with reflux esophagitis. For the FSSG questionnaire, no correlations were seen between FSSG scores, completion times and questions during completion. This suggests that the FSSG is easy to complete for anyone, whether the reflux esophagitis is present or not.</p><p>We concluded that the FSSG is more convenient for clinical use than the QUEST. The clinical implications of our results remain unclear, however, we showed in this study that the completion time for the FSSG was shorter for the QUEST. In fact, at present no questionnaire is widely used in daily clinical practice. We anticipate the development of a more suitable questionnaire that combines convenience and accurate identification in the near feature.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial support: None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflicts of interest: None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="participating-researchers"><p>Author contributions: Takashi Nonaka, Takaomi Kessoku, Yuji Ogawa and Shogo Yanagisawa performed the research.
