A body of evidence suggests that the resource is glucose and consuming glucose reduces this effect. This study examined the effect of glucose on performance in the antisaccade task - which requires self-control through generating a voluntary eye movement away from a target - following self-control exertion in the Stroop task. The effects of motivation and individual differences in self-control were also explored. In a double-blind design, 67 young healthy adults received a 25g glucose or inert placebo drink. Glucose did not enhance antisaccade performance following self-control exertion in the Stroop task. Motivation however, predicted performance on the antisaccade task; more specifically high motivation ameliorated performance decrements observed after initial self-control exertion. In addition, individuals with high levels of self-control performed better on certain aspects of the antisaccade task after administration of a glucose drink. The results of this study suggest that the antisaccade task might be a powerful paradigm, which could be used as a more objective measure of self-control. Moreover, the results indicate that level of motivation and individual differences in self-control should be taken into account when investigating deficiencies in self-control following prior exertion.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ESRC NWDTC 13.14].

When exercised daily, this important psychological process [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is associated with positive life outcomes, whilst poor self-control is linked to increased social adversity [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Self-control requires the conscious and effortful control of actions, and contrasts with more unconscious/automatic forms of cognition [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Self-control is also an executive function (EF); a higher-order cognitive process associated with the dorso-lateral-prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The activation of the dlPFC during self-control has been well documented using functional-magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI) [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], with reduced activation during weakened self-control [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown that individuals have difficulty completing two consecutive self-control tasks; the first is completed normally, but there is usually a temporary impairment in performance on the second [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The resource depletion theory [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] suggests that this impairment stems from a depletion of resources with self-control drawing on a limited supply [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The effects are specific to self-control tasks and not found in relatively automatic and effortless tasks [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These observations have been strongly supported across over approximately 80 studies using various measures of self-control [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>One influential line of research suggests that self-control is glucose dependent [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Glucose is essential for brain function, and is distributed and metabolized according to areas of activation. It has been suggested that the amount of cognitive effort needed to complete a task moderates the susceptibility to changes in glucose availability, i.e. one factor that appears to be of particular relevance is whether tasks are cognitively demanding [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The energy cost for effortful, controlled or executive processes appears to be significantly higher than that for automatic or reflexive processes [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Indeed, lowered peripheral glucose levels following performance of a cognitively demanding task have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These results indicate that cognitively demanding tasks and in particular those relying on executive functions are sensitive to changes in glucose availability.</p><p>A series of experiments explored that relationship with evidence showing that acts of self-control use relatively large amounts of glucose and that glucose administration can improve self-control (see [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] for review). More specifically, it has been shown that blood glucose levels declined following self-control exertion in an incongruent, but not congruent, Stroop task [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Weak self-control was reported following a reduction in glucose levels, induced by a previous task, but administration of a glucose load counteracted this [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similarly, selfish desires were more frequently suppressed and there was an increase in offers of support to others, following glucose ingestion [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This supports the idea that self-control is weakened when blood glucose levels are low.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Challenges to the resource depletion theory</title><p>Research suggests that the role of motivation in moderating one&#x02019;s temporary deficiency in self-control following prior exertion needs to be considered. This idea is captured by the resource allocation account [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which proposes that high levels of motivation will modulate acts of self-control irrespective of whether or not the individual has been exposed to a previous self-control task. This account acknowledges that engaging in self-control requires glucose, but argues against the strong claims of the resource depletion theory that self-control per se is sufficient to produce a significant diminishment or depletion [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The account posits that while engaging in a self-control task, glucose will be assigned based on one&#x02019;s intrinsic level of motivation to complete that task. Thus resources will be allocated if one deems the task to be important [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore impaired performance that has typically been documented in a second task of self-control might be associated with how willing or motivated one is to engage in a task rather than&#x02014;as the resource depletion theory claims&#x02014;solely dependent on whether or not there is a sufficient resource to complete the task. Self-report measurements have been recommended to determine whether task importance and interest (i.e. intrinsic motivation) can offset the temporary deficiency one observes in the second of two self-control tasks [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Recent findings support the resource allocation account and challenge claims made by the resource depletion theory that glucose is significantly depleted during self-control exertion. Molden and colleagues, for example reported no decline in blood glucose after a self-control task was completed [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Further, a re-analysis of Gailliot and colleagues research disputes the observation that blood glucose levels significantly are reduced following the application of self-control [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, Sanders and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] recently reported that a glucose facilitation effect on self-control was detected after gurgling with (not ingesting) a glucose drink. This evidence suggests that replenishing glucose resources through glucose ingestion may not be necessary to improve self-control and that glucose might exert its beneficial effects on self-control performance in a more indirect way. For example, glucose itself may be motivational and indeed its presence in the mouth stimulates brain areas associated with reward [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Framing Sanders and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] findings within the resource allocation account, glucose may provide one of several pathways to increase one&#x02019;s level of motivation&#x02014;alongside the offering of monetary incentives [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and one having feelings of autonomy towards task engagement [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]&#x02014;which could then ameliorate the temporary deficiency in performance observed in a second task following the completion of an initial self-control task [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Baumeister and colleagues e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have recently proposed a revision of their original resource depletion theory by incorporating the resource allocation account [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. They now propose that motivation would only moderate the level of engagement in a subsequent task of self-control in situations where there is an insufficient level of resources&#x02014;due to prior self-control engagement&#x02014;available for further self-control acts.</p><p>The aim of this study was to further investigate the role of glucose in self-control and to examine the potential moderating role of motivation. In particular, by monitoring blood glucose levels over time the current study attempted to explore whether any decline in self-control was indeed linked with a significant reduction in peripheral blood glucose availability. A glucose drink was also administered to examine whether relative to placebo, glucose would improve the powers of self-control following exertion in the Stroop task.</p><p>Previous research has predominately used behavioural measures of self-control and there is a lack of investigations that have used more objective measures of self-control. One well-established objective measure is the antisaccade task (AST) [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], in which an automatic saccadic eye-movement to the onset of a visual stimulus is suppressed, and a voluntary saccadic eye-movement is elicited away from the stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The AST correlates well with other self-control measures (e.g. the Stroop) [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and involves the activation of the dlPFC and subcortical networks [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, it serves as an implicit indicator of self-control and error awareness, which is measured in terms of the frequency of spontaneous corrections that are generated following an incorrect saccade towards the target. The AST also yields temporal and spatial information, and has been directly linked to inhibitory networks in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which could provide a reliable and objective &#x0201c;biomarker&#x0201d; for self-control [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In the prosaccade task (PST) the goal is to look directly towards the target, which requires no inhibitory control [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The AST, together with this control task, would determine whether glucose administration influenced the general properties of saccadic eye-movements or more specifically, only those under self-control. Prosaccade (PS) responses are 100ms faster and produce less errors than antisaccade (AS) responses [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We predicted a task that demanded strong self-control would impair subsequent AS (but not PS) performance and that supplementary glucose and/or level of motivation would attenuate this.</p><p>The study also examined the potential moderating effects of individual differences in self-control on saccade performance. We predicted&#x02014;based on previous research&#x02014;that poor levels of self-control would be linked with a larger decline in AS (but not PS) performance following self-control exertion [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Overall, evidence has shown that consecutive self-control tasks lead to weakened performance levels in these tasks, and that supplementary glucose helps to restore control [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, recent evidence is beginning to challenge the role of glucose in self-control. Consequently, this study employed a frequently used initial &#x02018;depletion&#x02019; task (the incongruent Stroop) [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] to determine whether a temporary resource deficiency was responsible for the decline in subsequent performance of a novel more objective measure of self-control (the AST) and whether a glucose drink would restore performance. Both measures of self-control that were employed&#x02014;the Stroop task and AST&#x02014;required one to exert self-control by responding to an external prompt, for example a signal or instruction rather than relying on self-control, generated based on one&#x02019;s personal intentions or decisions [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The research also addressed whether levels of motivation and individual differences in self control moderate the effects of depletion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Research design</title><p>To examine the effects of glucose (vs. placebo) administration on self-control performance, the experiment used a double-blind placebo controlled, 2 (drink condition: glucose, placebo) x 2 (saccade task: PS, AS) mixed-factorial design with repeated measures on the second factor.

Participants evaluated the overall likeness for the drink using the sensory-evaluation form [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and then completed the self-control questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Participants were then seated in front of the eye-tracking computer and the headset and saccade tasks were prepared. Fifteen minutes following drink administration (allowing for glucose absorption), the saccade tasks were conducted over an approximate 6 minute period. During this time participants were instructed to remain as still and as relaxed as possible to ensure that accurate readings were taken. The PST was administered first, followed by the AST, due to evidence of carry over effects from the AST [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A final blood glucose reading was recorded (time 3) after completing the saccade tasks. The IMI [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] was then administered before participants were fully debriefed.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Saccade latencies (saccade reaction times; RTs) were computed as the delay between target onset and the start of the first saccade, with an amplitude of greater than 2&#x000b0;. Responses of less than 80 ms or over 500 ms were regarded as anticipatory or late saccades, respectively, and were excluded from analysis. For directional errors, the total number of errors (incorrect saccades made towards rather than away from the target) in the AST was obtained and then converted to a percentage error rate based on the number of trials completed for each participant.</p><p>Initially, a correlational analysis on the overall data was conducted. Following this, using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20, saccade performance was analysed using mixed-effects modelling. Specifically, we ran through a series of separate models for the two measures of performance in the saccade tasks; reaction times (RTs) and AST directional error rate (with F values drawn from &#x02018;<italic>Type III Tests of Fixed Effects&#x02019;</italic>). In the models, participants were included as random effects and task type for saccade RTs as well as drink condition were included as fixed effects. Self-reported levels of both motivation and self-control were added as covariates to the models to assess whether differences in motivation and self-control moderated drink effects on saccade performance (reaction times and/or directional errors) or whether they were significant predictors of performance irrespective of drink condition. Similarly, glycaemic response was analysed using mixed effects modelling, again treating participants as random effects and both drink condition and time (T1: baseline, T2: post Stroop task completion and T3: post drink and saccade task performance) as fixed effects. Self-reported levels of motivation were also added as a covariate to the model to assess whether differences in motivation was a significant predictor of glycaemic response.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec016"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec017"><title>Correlations</title><p>As demonstrated in <xref rid="pone.0122218.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the correlational analyses revealed a significant negative relationship between motivation and directional error rate in the antisaccade task; those high in motivation produced fewer errors in the AST.

It has been suggested that glucose is the major resource for self-control and that administration of a glucose load can reduce the temporary deficiency in performance in a second task of self-control [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the current study administration of a glucose drink was expected to enhance performance in the AST in comparison to placebo following self-control exertion in the Stroop task. This prediction was not supported, and therefore failed to replicate previous research e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>However, our findings revealed a strong effect of motivation on self-control. Level of motivation was a significant predictor of directional errors in the AST, suggesting that higher levels of self-reported motivation were related to the production of fewer errors in the task. However, low levels of self-reported motivation resulted in a greater number of directional errors in the AST, which is indicative of self-control failure. These observations provide support for the resource allocation account [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as low levels of self-reported motivation to complete the AST produced the expected deficiency in self-control performance&#x02014;greater errors&#x02014;following prior engagement of self-control in the Stroop task. Further, although there was a trend to suggest that level of motivation was a predictor of AST response speed, which is supportive of the resource allocation account that motivation has an ameliorating effect on the temporary deficiency in subsequent self-control performance [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], this observation was not significant.</p><p>Previous work [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] has shown, faster saccadic reaction times are associated with a higher AST error rate. In the current study, the weak correlation between AS reaction times and motivation suggests that the relationship between motivation and directional error rate is not mediated by effects on reaction time. These data would therefore imply that motivation is not exerting its effect on error rate via this route, but that motivation might be having a more direct effect on AS error rates. This provides stronger supportive evidence for the role of motivation in alleviating the temporary deficiency in AST performance following prior self-control exertion.</p><p>No effect of motivation levels were observed in the PST, which required no inhibitory control, suggesting that prior self-control exertion did not influence the general properties of saccades. It is worth noting that previous research has found that the effects a self-control task has on subsequent exertion are quite specific. Tasks pertaining to self-control, not general cognitive measures, are diminished following self-control exertion [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here, motivation level did not significantly predict performance outcome in the PST, this finding was thus unique to the AST, which required effortful cognitive control.</p><p>In line with previous research e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] no significant decline in peripheral glucose levels was observed after the Stroop task. It has previously been argued that the failure to observe a drop in peripheral glucose levels after performing a self-control task challenges the resource component of the resource depletion theory, specifically the notion that an energy substrate like glucose is depleted during self-control exertion [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, it is important to note that the failure to observe a decline in peripheral blood glucose levels does not necessarily mean that there is no temporary shortage in energy supply centrally. For one, it has been argued that the glucose measuring devices used in this study and previous research (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) may lack sensitivity to detect such subtle reductions in glucose levels [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, changes in peripheral levels do not necessarily equate to changes in the level of glucose in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Although evidence suggests that brain glucose levels are approximately 15&#x02013;20% of blood levels [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], glucose metabolism varies throughout tissue and cell type in the brain. Both the rate of blood to brain glucose transport [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and glucose metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] are stimulated in different areas in the brain during cognitive tasks relevant to that area. There is disagreement about the additional energy costs associated with task performance, ranging from as little as 0.5% to 1.0% of the total energy budget [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] to evidence suggesting that performing cognitively demanding tasks increases total brain consumption by as much as 12% [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, regardless of the actual level of additional cost, it takes approximately four to six seconds following neural activation for blood flow to increase, which suggests a temporary energy shortage in neurons may occur [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This (temporary) insufficiency has been suggested to underlie the improvement effect of glucose ingestion upon cognition [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Microdialysis measurements of brain glucose have shown a large decrease in hippocampal extra cellular fluid (ECF; 32 &#x000b1; 2%) in rats tested for spontaneous alternation on a four-arm maze (a difficult memory task), while a smaller decrease (11 &#x000b1; 2%) was seen in rats tested on a simpler three arm- maze, suggesting that the changes observed in ECF glucose are related to task difficulty. Moreover, there is some evidence that the concentration of ECF glucose in the brain after its transfer across the blood-brain barrier from plasma glucose varies with brain region (for review, see [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). The cerebral cortex has comparatively low stores of glycogen (5&#x02013;6 mmol/l compared to for example 13 mmol/l in the hippocampus [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]) suggesting that it might be particularly sensitive to those temporary deficits. Consequently, the failure to observe a significant decline in peripheral blood glucose levels after the initial self-control task [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], does not necessarily imply that there are no slight alterations in glucose levels following completion [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and thus that exerting self-control does not rely on the availability of glucose.</p><p>Although we observed a powerful effect of motivation and reported no effect of glucose on self-control performance this also does not mean that the limited resource view of self-control should be dismissed. What these observations do reinforce however, are trends that have recently emerged in the self-control literature, i.e., that a reconsideration of the resource model is perhaps needed [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with additional factors taken into account. As mentioned earlier, Baumeister and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have suggested possible amendments to the resource depletion theory, which acknowledges the resource allocation account [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the moderating effects of motivation. In particular it has been argued that motivation can counteract the temporary deficiency in self-control following prior exertion when glucose resource levels are low [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The current findings together with previous evidence therefore suggest that motivation might be an important factor in the temporary deficiency in self-control one observes in a subsequent task following exertion. More broadly, self-control performance and more specifically the degree to which it is affected by glucose availability, appears to be influenced by individuals&#x02019; motivation to exert self-control.</p><p>According to one interpretation, glucose might be motivational, thus stimulating reward areas in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example self-control performance improved for participants that simply gurgled with glucose (not placebo) before a second task of self-control was completed [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The current study did not detect such an effect on motivation with the glucose drink and supports more recent evidence which reported no effect of glucose whether swilled or digested on self-control ability after prior exertion [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed moderating effects of motivation need to be explored. However, it is feasible to speculate that the motivation reported by participants may result or indicate a brief acute stress response mediated by sympatho-adrenomedullary axis (SAM axis) activation. Indeed, it has been argued that the importance of a task determines the initial preparedness via activation of one or both major endocrine systems, the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) and the SAM axis [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A major physiological role of activation of both endocrine systems is considered to be a temporary increase in energy production and more specifically provision of additional metabolic fuel through increase in glucose availability [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Consequently, in physiological terms motivation to perform a task, could lead to an intrinsic rise in glucose availability which in turn ameliorates any potential energy shortage. In the current study, motivation did not appear to change blood glucose levels. However, as these changes would arguably be very small, these might not have been detected due to lack of sensitivity of the measuring device. Alternatively, differences in motivation might affect performance through selective allocation of available resources; i.e. resources are channelled to areas of the brain pertaining to tasks that are seen as sufficiently important.</p><p>Another interesting finding emerged from analysis of the moderating effects of individual differences in self-control on subsequent performance. Individuals higher in self-reported levels of self-control performed the AST with greater accuracy following glucose consumption than those lower in self-control. This is interesting and requires further exploration, as it is somewhat incongruent with the resource depletion account. In particular one would expect that those low in self-control to be more susceptible to consumption of glucose than those high in self-control due to a greater vulnerability to resource depletion [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the current study the opposite was observed.</p><p>This is the first study to investigate the effect of completing an initial self-control task on performance in the AST. The results of our study suggest the AST as a promising objective task of self-control, which can be simply administered [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and compared to previous measures, assesses self-regulation on an implicit level by recording saccades that correct directional errors. It also uses the single modality of vision for both processing the stimulus and the behavioural response, in contrast to previous methodologies, where the stimulus was encoded for example visually, but an auditory or motor response was required. This modality task switching limited the extent to which self-control could previously be directly assessed [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, the findings have helped to address a particular problem inherent in the existing research field on self-control, which is the current difficulty in finding congruency in the measurement of self-control [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A wide range of tasks have been used to study the effects of a temporary deficiency in self-control ability [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Moreover, evidence linking glucose administration as well as the moderating effects of motivation and self-control to cognitive functions associated with restraint and willpower have not been validated using &#x0201c;biomarkers&#x0201d; of self-control. The results of this study demonstrated that implementation of the more objective AST as a measure of self-control within a self-control depletion paradigm is feasible.</p><p>Although our observations are reflective of more recent studies, it is important to note that in comparison to previous studies on self-control, the dose of glucose administered in the current study was lower (25g) compared to studies which showed beneficial effects with larger (35-40g) doses (e.g. in [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). The effect of glucose administration on cognitive tasks, including memory follows an inverted U-shaped dose response curve [<xref rid="pone.0122218.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0122218.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Although, the dose we used has previously shown to be optimal for facilitation of memory performance, it might be the case that a higher dose is needed to facilitate tasks pertaining to frontal lobe functions. Thus, further investigations are clearly required to determine the dose-response relationship between glucose, self-control performance and levels of motivation.</p><p>A further limitation of the current study that needs to be addressed by future research would be the more specific assessment of the ameliorating effects of motivation on self-control performance. This could be done by manipulating levels of task motivation rather than recording overall task motivation.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the results of the current study suggest the AST could be a potential &#x02018;biomarker&#x02019; of self-control and thus a powerful paradigm to use in future studies on self-control. Moreover, the study did provide further support for the resource allocation model, as motivation&#x02014;specifically, how personally relevant it was to participants to complete the task&#x02014;influenced self-control performance more powerfully than glucose administration. More specifically, higher motivation appeared to ameliorate the temporary deficiency in a self-control task, as participants with low motivation produced a weaker AS performance following self-control exertion. More research is needed to explore the role of factors (including motivation and self-control) that can act as response modifiers and neuroendocrine mechanisms should also be evaluated as a potential source for variability.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Dr. Felicity Wolohan for her support with the extraction of data for both of the eye movement tasks.
