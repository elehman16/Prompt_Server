Unfortunately, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications is common and associated with increased morbidity, adverse drug events, and hospitalizations. Multifaceted interventions can achieve a 12&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% reduction in antipsychotic prescribing levels in nursing homes. Effective interventions have featured educational outreach and ongoing performance feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">This pragmatic, cluster-randomized control trial and embedded process evaluation seeks to determine the effect of adding academic detailing to audit and feedback on prescribing of antipsychotic medications in nursing homes, compared with audit and feedback alone. Nursing homes within pre-determined regions of Ontario, Canada, are eligible if they express an interest in the intervention. The academic detailing intervention will be delivered by registered health professionals following an intensive training program including relevant clinical issues and techniques to support health professional behavior change. Physicians in both groups will have the opportunity to access confidential reports summarizing their prescribing patterns for antipsychotics in comparison to the local and provincial average. Participating homes will be allocated to one of the two arms of the study (active/full intervention versus standard audit and feedback) in two waves, with a 2:1 allocation ratio. Homes will be randomized after stratifying for geography, baseline antipsychotic prescription rates, and size, to ensure a balance of characteristics. The primary outcome is antipsychotic dispensing in nursing homes, measured 6&#x000a0;months after allocation; secondary outcomes include clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Policy-makers and the public have taken note that antipsychotics are used in nursing homes in Ontario far more than other jurisdictions. Academic detailing can be an effective technique to address challenges in appropriate prescribing in nursing homes, but effect sizes vary widely. This opportunistic, policy-driven evaluation, embedded within a government-initiated demonstration project, was designed to ensure policy-makers receive the best evidence possible regarding whether and how to scale up the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov NLM Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02604056">NCT02604056</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Academic detailing</kwd><kwd>Antipsychotic medication</kwd><kwd>Inappropriate prescribing</kwd><kwd>Nursing home</kwd><kwd>Randomized trials</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000226</institution-id><institution>Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>06683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desveaux</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par25">Nursing home residents are at a greater risk for inappropriate prescribing as they are more fragile, receive interventions from multiple point-of-care staff, and are unable to detect errors in their medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Inappropriate prescribing is often linked to polypharmacy and to subsequent adverse outcomes such as increased hospital admissions, increased morbidity, and impaired functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In particular, antipsychotic medications (APMs) are known to be associated with cardiovascular events, parkinsonism, falls, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, APMs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality among elderly residents with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], signaling the pressing need for solutions to mitigate inappropriate use and encourage appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of symptoms. In Ontario, Canada, APM prescription rates in nursing homes range from 0 to 67&#x000a0;%, with an average of 33&#x000a0;% of nursing home residents using an APM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nursing home administration and government officials are facing increasing public and media scrutiny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] as rates are more than double those in the USA.</p><p id="Par26">Interventions to reduce inappropriate prescribing of APMs among people with dementia in nursing homes have achieved reductions in APM prescribing levels between 12 and 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a systematic review of interventions to optimize prescribing in nursing homes, academic detailing had the strongest evidence for improvements in prescribing, whereas audit and feedback (AF) interventions had a small to moderate impact on physician practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For educational interventions to be effective at improving inappropriate prescribing, recommendations suggest they must be implemented through techniques that engage health professionals to consider behavior change, such as academic detailing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. AF can act as a complementary strategy by drawing attention to gaps between actual and desired performance, priming the recipients to respond to educational interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One prior randomized controlled trial combining quarterly AF plus education around quality improvement demonstrated an overall decrease in resident falls, behavioral symptoms, and pressure ulcers, including among low-risk residents, compared to a control group receiving neither intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">In Ontario, Canada, policy-makers, including the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) and Ontario Medical Association (OMA), established an appropriate prescribing working group which is tasked to make recommendations on opportunities to improve prescribing in Ontario. One project that has emerged from this working group is the Appropriate Prescribing Demonstration Project, which involves the evaluation of an academic detailing intervention in nursing homes. Members of the project team are accountable to the policy-makers, and the evaluation approach required policy-maker approval. This partnership and pragmatic evaluation of a policy-maker-driven initiative increases the likelihood that the embedded evaluation will achieve an impact on health service delivery and policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We designed a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial that seeks to assess the impact of the intervention with an embedded, mixed methods process evaluation to understand how and why intervention effects were observed and provide insights regarding scale-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par28">A pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial with an embedded process evaluation of the Appropriate Prescribing Demonstration Project will be undertaken and includes both summative and formative components. The protocol received ethics approval from the University of Toronto and Women&#x02019;s College Hospital Research Ethics Boards. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NLM Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02604056">NCT02604056</ext-link>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par29">In the province of Ontario, many healthcare services are covered under the Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP)&#x02014;a government-run health plan that is publicly funded. OHIP covers medically necessary services provided by physicians, including basic and emergency services, and specialist visits. Within nursing homes, all personal and nursing care is funded by the government, while residents are responsible for accommodation charges such as room and board. Accommodation costs are set by the MOHLTC and are standard across the province of Ontario. Rate reductions are available through a government subsidy for those with low income on a case-by-case basis. The Ontario Drug Benefit Program covers prescription drug costs for individuals who reside in nursing homes, including some nutritional products and diabetic testing agents, provided they are prescribed by an Ontario doctor or other authorized prescriber.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par30">The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated using a two arm, pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial, with nursing homes allocated to the full, active intervention (featuring academic detailing offered to each prescriber and team members in the home) or standard quality improvement supports with blinded outcome analysis of administrative data after 6&#x000a0;months. The standard quality improvement supports, which includes individualized AF reports administered by Health Quality Ontario (HQO), represent &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; as this initiative has been launched province-wide and therefore a concurrent control arm with no exposure to a quality improvement intervention is not feasible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Eligibility</title><p id="Par31">Nursing homes within pre-determined regions of Ontario will be eligible if they expressed an interest in the full intervention. These regions, or hubs, were chosen because they contain a wide variety of nursing home types within a reasonable travel distance (i.e., &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;km). To be eligible for participation, the medical and administrative leads of the nursing homes must agree to and support the project. Exclusion criteria include nursing homes without any prescribers caring for at least 10 residents routinely or nursing homes with fewer than 30 residents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par32">A general recruitment email will be distributed by the OMA and MOHLTC to eligible home administrative leads and from other stakeholders (i.e., local physician leads) to medical directors of eligible nursing homes. Identification of additional homes will be done in collaboration with the Local Health Integration Networks and other stakeholders.</p><p id="Par33">The entire nursing home is considered a research participant and so explicit, written consent will be obtained from the medical director and administrative leads from each home. Individual providers and staff members in the home can decide whether and when to engage with the academic detailing intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Allocation</title><p id="Par34">Participating nursing homes will be allocated to one of the two arms of the study (active/full intervention versus standard AF), with an intended 2:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will be administered in two waves to optimize resource use (i.e., gradual training and phasing-in of program delivery staff) (refer to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); therefore, homes will be allocated to the intervention in two waves. Nursing homes that share prescribers will be grouped together and allocated as a unit to avoid contamination. Homes (or groups of homes) will be randomized in two waves after stratifying for geography, as well as baseline APM prescription rates and size (categorized as above or below the median), to promote a balance of characteristics between the two arms. A 2:1 allocation ratio will be used to promote recruitment and to satisfy the requirements of the trial sponsor without drastically affecting sample size requirements. Allocation will be conducted by an independent statistician blinded to home identity using computer-generated random numbers.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2016_410_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Standard quality improvement supports/usual care</title><p id="Par35">Policy-makers previously determined that all nursing home physicians in the province would be provided with the opportunity to access online practice reports (serving as AF) that would confidentially describe their prescribing practices for APMs, compared to regional and provincial data representing their (de-identified) peers. Starting in autumn 2015, in concert with the initiative outlined in this proposal, HQO will be producing confidential practice reports using data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), a not-for-profit research institute with a secure and accessible array of Ontario&#x02019;s health-related data, to describe selected quality indicators for physicians working in nursing homes. This will initially focus on appropriate prescribing of APM for older men and women and provides data on how their APM use compares to others in the province. The report also includes additional information regarding the clinical and demographic features of their nursing home resident roster. Receipt of the reports is voluntary. To receive the reports, physicians must sign up and confirm their identity. They will then receive updated reports quarterly, which they can download from HQO&#x02019;s secure website. In addition, HQO will be launching voluntary, virtual &#x0201c;communities of practice&#x0201d; to enable sharing of best practices across homes and providers throughout the province.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Academic detailing (active intervention)</title><p id="Par36">The academic detailing intervention will be delivered by registered health professionals (e.g., nurses or pharmacists) who have received intensive training to support providers in nursing homes, to address challenges and opportunities to improving prescribing practices and overall quality of care. Academic detailing is a method of service-oriented educational outreach for front-line clinicians which combines the interactive, one-on-one communication approach of industry detailers with the evidence-based, non-commercial information of academia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The intervention requires the Academic Detailers to have direct and ongoing contact with the nursing homes including administrators, providers, and staff from the time of launch through to program completion. Given the diverse target audiences that will likely be engaged within the homes, the Academic Detailer will work to understand the context, barriers, capacity, and needs of each home to ensure the service being provided by the detailer is relevant, meaningful, and appropriate. The intervention then includes the provision of the following different &#x0201c;types&#x0201d; of visits made by the Academic Detailer: meetings (likely with administrators or home leadership to describe the program and value), presentation (large group, inter-professional audience), group visit (typically 2&#x02013;6 providers), and one-on-one visits (&#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; academic detailing visits). In addition, the Academic Detailer provides important service to the nursing homes and providers between visits (i.e., by responding to questions via email or phone) to respond to the needs and build trust/credibility over time. To optimize resource allocation, the academic detailing intervention will be administered in two waves (October 2015 and February 2016), each lasting a duration of 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par37">The Centre for Effective Practice, a Toronto-based federal non-profit organization retained by the OMA/MOHLTC based on their experience with academic detailing, will manage the academic detailing intervention. Best practices in training of the Academic Detailers and in the execution of the program will be applied (refer to <xref rid="Sec24" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>). Given the nature of the program as a demonstration project for the purposes of understanding feasibility in the Ontario context, it is critical to ensure a pragmatic approach to the delivery of the intervention. Therefore, the number of visits per provider or home per topic and the length of visits will not be pre-defined or standardized. Intervention fidelity and acceptability metrics will be evaluated through the embedded process evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par38">Outcomes will be assessed using population-level administrative databases linked through unique, encrypted patient identifiers at the ICES. Data will be compiled from the following databases: (1) the Ontario Drug Benefits (ODB) database, covering all prescription medications dispensed to residents in nursing homes; (2) the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) databases covering all inpatient hospitalizations and emergency department visits; (3) the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database, covering physician billings for procedures and consultations; (4) the Registered Persons Database covering demographic information including date of death; and (5) the Continuing Care Reporting System (CCRS) database for clinical and demographic information on nursing homes residents collected using the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI). Each nursing home resident in the province receives a &#x0201c;full&#x0201d; RAI assessment within 2&#x000a0;weeks from admission date, every 12&#x000a0;months from previous full assessment or any other time when the clinical condition of a resident changed considerably. Each resident also receives a shorter &#x0201c;quarterly&#x0201d; assessment every 3&#x000a0;months. For each resident, the CCRS database holds demographic and clinical information, including data regarding clinical diagnoses (e.g., dementia, psychosis), dispensing of APMs, and occurrences of falls. In addition, a number of validated outcome scales can be derived from the CCRS data, including those related to activities of daily living (ADLs), aggressive behaviour, pain, and mood.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par39">The primary prescribing outcome is the number of days the resident was provided an APM in the previous week, as determined from the CCRS database. Secondary prescribing outcomes include mean APM dose (over the previous month) and prevalence of antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, antidepressant, and acetaminophen prescribing (defined as any prescription during the previous month), as determined from the ODB database. All primary and secondary prescribing outcomes will be assessed at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months post intervention. Baseline is defined as the week or month immediately prior to randomization, while post-intervention measurements are defined as the third and sixth months after randomization. These outcomes will be assessed on all residents who are alive at the time of the assessment and who were present in the home for the full duration of the prior week/month (i.e., repeated cross-sectional within-cluster data).</p><p id="Par40">Secondary clinical outcomes will be extracted from the RAI, including ADLs (measured by the ADL long-form scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; pain (pain scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; depression (depression rating scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; number of falls in the past month; and the extent of aggressive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These will be assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months post intervention. The most current data collected immediately prior to the implementation of the intervention, and at each post-randomization time point, will be used, regardless of mortality status at the subsequent time point.</p><p id="Par41">Health care utilization outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 6&#x000a0;months post intervention and include the number of ER visits and hospitalizations during the previous 6&#x000a0;months. A longer duration is required to allow adequate time for the intervention to have an effect on these outcomes. All residents present in the homes at any time during the study will contribute to the analysis using person-time of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par42">Outcome evaluations will use de-identified data available from the ICES and will be conducted by analysts blinded to group allocation. All evaluations will be reported at the aggregate level, and the confidentiality of nursing homes, residents, and providers will be protected.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Impact of the intervention on clinical outcomes</title><p id="Par43">Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables of interest: continuous variables with a normal distribution will be described using means and standard deviations (medians and inter-quartile ranges will be used in the case of skewed distributions), whereas categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and proportions. All analyses will be conducted under the principles of intention-to-treat analysis and will be conducted using SAS v.9.3. Statistical significance will be assessed at the 5&#x000a0;% level.</p><p id="Par44">The primary outcome (days dispensed APM in the previous week) measured at baseline, 3&#x000a0;months, and 6&#x000a0;months will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects regression with multinomial distribution and cumulative logit link. The fixed effects of time, intervention, and intervention by time will be the main variables of interest. To account for the staggered implementation of the intervention, wave will be included as a fixed effect. Random intercepts and slopes will be specified to account for intracluster and inter-period correlations. To maximize statistical efficiency, the analysis of prescribing outcomes will adjust for the stratification factors (hub, baseline APM prescription rates, and size) as well as public/private home ownership and the following resident covariates: age, sex, levels of function, and aggressive behaviour (using multiple imputation for missing covariates if necessary). The proportional odds assumption will be evaluated using the score test. The effect of the intervention at 6&#x000a0;months will be expressed as cumulative odds ratio (OR) with 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI), which expresses the odds of having fewer days with APM dispensed in the intervention arm compared to the control arm.</p><p id="Par45">The dichotomous prescribing outcomes (i.e., any APM prescription in the last month) at baseline, 3 months, and 6&#x000a0;months will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects regression with binomial distribution and logit link function. Fixed and random effects will be specified as described for the primary outcome. The fixed effects of time, intervention, and intervention by time will be the main variables of interest. Dose equivalent of APM dispensed in the past month at baseline, 3 months, and 6&#x000a0;months will be analyzed using linear mixed effects regression with normal distribution and identity link. Fixed and random effects will be specified as described for the primary outcome. The effect of the intervention will be described as difference in change from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months using adjusted least square means with 95&#x000a0;% CI.</p><p id="Par46">Secondary clinical outcomes measured as continuous variables (e.g., ADL, depression score) will be analyzed using linear mixed effects regression with normal distribution and identity link. Fixed and random effects will be specified as described for the prescribing outcomes. The effect of the intervention will be expressed as adjusted least square mean differences with 95&#x000a0;% CI. Secondary clinical outcomes measured on an ordinal scale (e.g., pain scale) at baseline, 3 months, and 6&#x000a0;months will be analyzed using generalized mixed effects regression as described for the primary outcome but using multinomial distribution and cumulative logit link. Presence of any falls in the past 30&#x000a0;days will be analyzed at baseline, 3 months, and 6&#x000a0;months using generalized linear mixed effects regression with binomial distribution and logit link, as described for the primary outcome. In the intention-to-treat analyses for the secondary clinical outcomes (e.g., ADL, falls, pain), the potential effect on inferences of residents who died will be examined using sensitivity analyses under conservative assumptions: for example, residents who died during the interval will be assigned the worst possible score. Depending on the extent of resident turnover within homes, additional analyses for primary and secondary outcomes will explore inclusion of subject-specific random effects to account for repeated measures on the same resident over time (i.e., a cohort rather than cross-sectional design).</p><p id="Par47">Health care utilization outcomes will be analyzed at 6&#x000a0;months using generalized linear mixed effects regression with Poisson or negative binomial distribution and log-link, with log person-time of follow-up as an offset term. The following fixed effects will be included: intervention, phase, and stratification variables, as well as the rate of health care utilization at the home 6&#x000a0;months prior to the intervention. Resident covariates will be adjusted for as specified for the primary outcome. Home will be included as a random effect.</p><p id="Par48">The effect of the intervention will be expressed as adjusted rate ratio (RR) with 95&#x000a0;% CI. Potential effect modification by home ownership status, size of the home (&#x0003c;65 beds, 65&#x02013;129 beds, or &#x0003e;129 beds), location (urban/rural), specialist utilization (proportion of residents with geriatrician or psychiatrist consultation within 6&#x000a0;months), plus primary physician characteristics (sex, years of experience), as well as resident characteristics (age, sex, history of psychosis, diagnosis of dementia, time at facility, levels of function, and aggressive behaviour, plus whether a geriatrician or psychiatrist provided a consult) will be explored by including interactions between these variables and treatment.
