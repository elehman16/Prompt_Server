Participants cared for 3 randomly assigned simulated patients, and care responses were scored against explicit evidence-based criteria. Scores were calculated as a percentage of criteria completed. Care varied widely, with a median overall score of 44.7% and interquartile range of 36.6% to 53.7%. Diagnostic accuracy was low: 27.4% of physicians identified the correct primary diagnosis. Physicians ordered chromosomal microarray analysis in 55.7% of cases. Specific gene sequence testing was used in 1.4% to 30.3% of cases. This study demonstrates that genetic testing is underutilized, even for widely available tests. Further efforts to educate physicians on the clinical utility of genetic testing may improve diagnosis and care in these patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>medical education</kwd><kwd>patient vignettes</kwd><kwd>genetic testing</kwd><kwd>CPV</kwd><kwd>evidence-based medicine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2333794X15623717"><title>Introduction</title><p>Children with intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have historically been grouped by phenotypical characteristics and their associated cognitive impairments.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Until recently, physicians who treat these patients have had limited understanding of the genetic basis for these syndromes.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> By one estimate, a quarter of all patients had a delay of 5 to 30 years between the onset of symptoms and receiving a definitive diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Early diagnoses and treatments are, thus, often problematic because telltale manifestations were difficult to identify or only appeared later in the syndrome.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Newer genetic testing platforms have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, timing, and treatment of children with DDs.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr8-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> One of these tests, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), is a microchip-based test that automates simultaneous analysis of many pieces of DNA across multiple chromosomal regions. CMA provides higher resolution and detects many more of potentially causal deletions and duplications (copy number variants [CNVs]) involved in ID, DD, and ASDs, improving diagnosis over earlier technologies such as karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an even higher resolution technique that allows detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across a patient&#x02019;s genome but currently does not have sufficient signal uniformity to allow clinical detection of CNVs. NGS has been shown to deliver an estimated 25% clinical detection rate when used across the whole exome and, as the cost of sequencing continues to fall, promises to provide additional genetic insights into the causes of DD, ID, or ASDs when used in combination with CMA.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>As a result, genetic testing is now part of the practice guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics as of 2010, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for children with DD/ID, ASDs, or multiple congenital anomalies.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr14-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In 2010, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) called for CMA as a first-tier test for all genetic diagnostic evaluations of these conditions.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Beyond improving outcomes for DD, ID, and ASD patients, a recent ACMG policy statement highlighted the need for a wider definition and understanding of clinical utility of testing.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Current definitions of clinical utility link clinical information gathered from testing to improved health outcomes of the patients. Although genetic testing for patients within DD, ID, and ASDs may not always directly affect patient outcomes, it often leads to much better information regarding causality of the health issue and also identifies medically actionable comorbidities and secondary findings.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> If used appropriately, these sophisticated genetic tests can significantly improve clinical care by positively affecting clinical decisions, enhancing diagnostic quality, and improving patient outcomes. For example, the early diagnosis of both Rett and Dravet syndromes leads to proper neuroleptic treatment, and the diagnosis of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency guides specific changes in diet, which can be life saving for patients. In addition, appropriate diagnosis of disease subtypes may be overlooked if based solely on clinical manifestations, and genetic testing may pave the way for more directed therapies and surveillance. For instance, Mosaic Turner syndrome with XY cell line, unlike the Classic Turner Syndrome, will alert the clinician to the risk for future ovarian malignancies&#x02014;most commonly gonadoblastoma&#x02014;and contemplate on gonadectomy. These risk profiles are not applicable to Turner syndrome without the XY cell line or to other types of VHL. These risk profiles are not applicable to Turner syndrome without the XY cell line or to other types of VHL.</p><p>CMA testing, however, is not consistently reimbursed, limiting its use in clinical practice and obviating the potential advantages of informative genetic results.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Reimbursement for NGS is even less consistent, with high rates of denials because of lack of coverage or classification as experimental or investigational.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Compared with broader CMA testing and whole exome sequencing, narrower genetic tests, such as targeted sequencing of the <italic>GAMT</italic> gene or <italic>FOXG1</italic> gene, that look for only a single genetic abnormality can be difficult to interpret. A negative result may be a result of the fact that the patient does not have a mutation in the specific gene syndrome being evaluated but may have other genetic causes that would surface through the broader CMA- or NGS-based testing.</p><p>Despite guidelines and the clinical utility of accurate and earlier diagnosis, genetic testing is still underused.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Whereas evidence of utility and lack of coverage by payers is one important hurdle to testing,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> there is a fundamental concern that pediatricians may not be keeping pace with the emergence and utility of these new tests.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>In this article, we explore the extent to which genetic testing is integrated into medical care and to which current genetic tests widely available on the market are routinely and effectively used for care of patients with ID/DD.

note that physicians order CMA more than half the time (55.7%), but this ranged from a low of 24.3% for X-linked early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (West Syndrome) to a high of 68% for Dravet syndrome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2333794X15623717">Table 4</xref>). Although lower diagnosis scores tended toward more CMA testing, statistical analysis yielded no significant association between the two (<italic>P</italic> = .161).</p><p>The physicians used standard platform CMAs (45.3%) rather than enhanced CMA testing (10.4%) with more probes (eg, tests that include Cytoscan HD and FirstStep<sup>Dx</sup> PLUS; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). We saw differences between the 2 groups of cases (group 1 requiring CMA for diagnosis vs group 2 requiring gene sequencing), with 58.4% of physicians ordering CMA when it was required (group 1) but only 14.6% ordering gene sequencing when it was required (group 2; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2333794X15623717">Table 4</xref>). Fewer, but still a substantial number of pediatricians, ordered CMA tests for the group 2 cases (34.4%) as a first-line test even though those cases ultimately required gene sequencing.</p><p>Specific gene sequence testing was used even less often, from a low of 1.4% for X-linked early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (West Syndrome) and 2.9% for Hunter syndrome, to a high of 30.3% for Bloom syndrome (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2333794X15623717">Table 4</xref>). Specific gene sequencing, although an option for all cases, was required to make the diagnosis for 4 cases (6-9). Even among these 4 cases, we found that physicians ordered gene sequencing infrequently; sequencing was ordered in only 12.8% of the cases where it was required for diagnosis. For Bloom syndrome, which had the highest rates of gene sequencing use of the group 2 cases and for which either 1 of 2 gene sequencing tests would return a diagnosis, only 19.3% of the physicians pursued sequencing, and 7.9% of physicians ordered both genetic sequencing and CMA. What is worthy of note is that there did not appear to be a tendency for the group 1 cases to focus on CMA testing nor the group 2 cases to focus on sequencing. For example, the first and second most common cases for gene sequencing were Rett and Dravet syndromes&#x02014;group 1 cases. Providers appeared to be ordering either test if a genetic disorder was suspected, but only 5.7% ordered both CMA and gene sequencing. In looking at rates of ordering both tests, for most cases, fewer than 10% of the physicians asked for both tests. Only for case 4&#x02014;Rett syndrome&#x02014;did we see a larger proportion of physicians ordering both tests (17.9%).</p></sec><sec id="section11-2333794X15623717"><title>Predictors of Genetic Test Ordering</title><p>Genetic testing was indicated for all 9 cases.

Studies have shown that CMA testing leads to important changes in medical management.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Among the changes in care observed, critical new actions include medical referrals, new diagnostic tests, and surveillance for complications.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>In this study of a representative sample of community-practicing general and specialist pediatricians, we sought to assess clinical practice patterns using standardized, online simulated patients. In particular, we aimed to assess determinants of care quality and gain insight into how physicians incorporated genetic testing into their practice to properly diagnose and treat patients with DD and ID.</p><p>Knowledge of and experience with genetic testing varied among the pediatricians in our sample. On average, participants reported having a middle-level understanding of genetic testing, and 65% reported using genetic testing for patients only sometimes, rarely, or never. However, the majority (85%) did have access to genetic testing expertise&#x02014;either a medical geneticist, a genetic counselor, or both.</p><p>CPV quality scores averaged 45% across the 5 domains of care. Compared with other similarly structured CPV studies, this is a low to normal score.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The relatively low quality score is in part driven by low scores in the workup, diagnosis, and treatment of these clinical cases. Bivariate analysis yielded no differences in CPV score by physician age, subspecialty versus generalist, or the frequency with which the tests were ordered.</p><p>Admittedly, individual syndromes within the category of DD/ID/ASDs tend to be rare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.orpha.net">http://www.orpha.net</ext-link>), which can in part explain the low diagnosis scores. The cases presented different levels of clinical manifestations/phenotypes of these diseases. Turner and West syndromes, both of which have more recognizable clinical patterns (growth delay, horseshoe kidneys for Turner and infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia on EEG for West), were diagnosed correctly most frequently by study physicians (67% and 51%, respectively). Rarer diseases, such as Dravet syndrome and GAMT deficiency were correctly diagnosed infrequently. GAMT deficiency (diagnosed correctly 9.3% of the time) has a less notable clinical presentation (failure to thrive, seizures, autism, behavioral disorder, and ID are all possible presentations) and is a very rare disease, with less than 100 identified cases.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Extremely rare and complicated health problems, such as those that are the focus of this study, require a team approach to care. Fortunately, 85% of the participants felt that they had a genetics expert&#x02014;usually a medical geneticist&#x02014;on whom they could call, a reassuring number, given the importance of pretest and posttest counseling and physician-patient communication.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>Ultimately, however, genetic testing tools, which have become more sophisticated and more accessible in the past decade, are required for effective diagnosis and treatment of patients who present with nonspecific DD/ID/ASDs. Yet this study shows that genetic testing is underutilized, with a little more than half the cases that required CMA receiving it (CNV-based cases) and only 14.6% of the cases that required gene sequencing receiving it (SNV-based cases). We found that predictors of use of genetic testing included being a specialist, having a good understanding of genetic testing, and increased patient load.</p><p>Although part of the lack of genetic testing use has been blamed on lack of payer coverage,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2333794X15623717" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> this study demonstrates that genetic testing is still underutilized even when medical coverage is not an issue.
