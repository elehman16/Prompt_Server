Despite beneficial patient-related results of laparoscopic single port cholecystectomy compared to the multiport laparoscopic operation, surgeons do not feel comfortable with the single port technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Hereby, the Da Vinci Single-Site&#x02122; technology provides several putative advantages over standard laparoscopic single-incision approaches such as the utilization of ergonomic, curved robot-assisted devices that preserve triangulation within the operative field, the reassignment of the crossing instruments to the opposite side, motion scaling and a stable 3D view of the operating field. These interesting features are thought to reduce eye strain, improve the ergonomic outcomes for surgeons and minimize both the mental and the physical workload associated with single-incision laparoscopy. Thus they possibly improve both surgical performance and work satisfaction, as well as eventually impact beneficially on patient well-being and outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Indeed, preliminary evidence from case reports and case&#x02013;control studies suggests that the utilization of the da Vinci Single-Site&#x02122; technology for cholecystectomy is safe, feasible and results in a shorter learning curve compared to conventional single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hereby, some of the best evidence regarding robot-assisted single-site cholecystectomy comes from a study by Pietrabissa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational study, which included a total of over 100 robotic procedures. In this cohort, the authors reported no major intraoperative complications and only two of the cases were converted to an open procedure due to inflammation. All of the participating surgeons that had previous experience with single-incision laparoscopy cholecystectomy agreed that the robotic approach is easier than the single-incision laparoscopic technique.</p><p>Additional evidence for the benefits of the Da Vinci platform comes from a study by Schatte and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hereby, in a simulated experimental setup, the computer-aided technique significantly associated with cognitive and physical stress reduction. It has been therefore suggested that the utilization of the da Vinci robot system may provide several advantages to professionals who complain of fatigue and discomfort when conducting modern surgical procedures, such as single-incision laparoscopy. Indeed, surgeons are a group of health care professionals who are at risk of developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders because of many physical and psychosocial risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, increases in technological complexity and equipment that is sometimes poorly adapted to new techniques have led surgeons to increasingly complain of fatigue when conducting modern surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Importantly, it has been shown that a surgeon&#x02019;s degree of burnout resulting from such fatigue and discomfort experienced at his or her workplace is strongly correlated with major medical errors, which in turn carry a great risk of affecting the patient&#x02019;s well being and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>However, the described observations and putative advantages of the robotic technology are based solely on case series, case reports and experimental data, as high-quality clinical trials to demonstrate the benefits of the da Vinci Single-Site&#x02122; cholecystectomy have not been performed to date. The present study assesses in a randomized setting whether robot-assisted Single-Site&#x02122; cholecystectomy provides a significant benefit compared with single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of surgeon&#x02019;s stress load as a primary endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The study is designed as a single-blinded randomized clinical trial with an intention to treat analysis that compares Single-Site robot-assisted with single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It aims to to test the hypothesis that the robotic approach provides significant benefits in terms of a reduced surgeon&#x02019;s stress load compared to the conventional single-incision approach, while matching its standards with regard to peri- and postoperative outcomes. The study directly compares both surgical approaches in patients with benign gallbladder disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Endpoints and data collection</title><p>The primary endpoint of the study is the surgeon&#x02019;s physical and mental stress load at the time of surgery and is assessed by two validated visual analogue scales, specifically a modified Local Experienced Discomfort (LED, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

The principal investigator has completed a GCP course (modules 1&#x02013;3). The study has been approved by the local ethics committee (Kantonale Ethikkommission Z&#x000fc;rich, KEK-ZH-Nr. 2014&#x02013;0114) and was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (trial number: NCT02485392).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>The Single Site robot-assisted cholecystectomy using the da Vinci Si platform is performed according to the manufacturer&#x000b4;s instructions (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The patient is placed in supine position under general anaesthesia, followed by surgical disinfection and sterile draping. A 2.0&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;cm midline intra-umbilical incision down to the level of the fascia is created using standard surgical technique. The fascia is incised and the abdomen is entered under direct vision. Subsequently, the fascial incision is enlarged to 2.5&#x000a0;cm and a finger sweep to check for adhesions is performed. Next, the surgeon inserts the Single-Site port using an atraumatic clamp. The Single-Site Port has a target anatomy arrow indicator and five lumens: four to hold cannulae (one 8.5&#x000a0;mm da Vinci Endoscope Port, two 5&#x000a0;mm Single-Site Instrument Arm Ports and one 5&#x000a0;mm Accessory Port) and one lumen for the insufflation adapter. After proper alignment of the Port, the table is placed in reverse Trendelenburg anatomy (~10&#x02013;15&#x000b0;) under visual guidance (30&#x000b0; down endoscope) and docking is performed, whereby the patient cart approaches the patient from the right side in a ~45&#x000b0; angle. In contrast to the single incision conventional laparoscopic approach, the robotic technique utilizes ergonomic, curved robot-assisted laparoscopic devices that preserve triangulation within the operative field. The control of the crossing instruments is independently reassigned to the opposite side by the robotic software. The available accessories include curved scissors, hook, clip applier, needle driver, Cadiere grasper, Maryland retractor and also a suction-irrigation device. In addition, a laparoscopic grasper is inserted through the accessory cannula, which is utilized to retract the gallbladder fundus up and toward the patient&#x02019;s right shoulder by the first assistant who is positioned on the left of the patient. After completion of the docking procedure, the console surgeon first dissects the Calot&#x02019;s Triangle in a standard fashion, subsequently ligates and divides the cystic duct and artery, performs a gallbladder bed dissection and extracts the gallbladder specimen using a 10&#x000a0;mm EndoPouch Retriever&#x02122; instrument which is inserted through the accessory port after removal of the 5&#x000a0;mm assistant cannula. All instruments and the cannula are removed under visual guidance, the da Vinci Si platform is undocked and the Single Site port is removed together with the gallbladder and the specimen bag through the single incision. Lastly, the fascial defect is closed with 0 Vicryl and a subcuticular skin closure with 4/0 or 5/0 Monocryl is performed.</p><p>The single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed as previously described with slight modifications [5]. In brief, a 2.0&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;cm midline intra-umbilical skin and fascia incision is performed and a SILS&#x02122; PT12 Port (Covidien Inc., Norwalk, California, USA) is introduced. This port obtains four openings: one for gas insufflation and three that can accommodate trocars ranging from sizes 5 &#x02013; 12&#x000a0;mm. A 5-mm 45&#x000b0; long scope (HD EndoEye&#x02122;, Olympus Europa Holding GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) is introduced through one of the openings in the SILS&#x02122; Port. The patient is then placed in an anti-Trendelenburg position. The fundus of the gallbladder is grasped and the EndoGrab&#x02122; (Virtual Ports Ltd., Caesarea, Israel) internally anchored retraction system is introduced (Endograsp roticulator&#x02122;, Covidien Inc., Norwalk, California, USA). As an alternative, the TriPort Plus&#x02122; multitrocar port can be utilized (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The dissection of the Calot&#x02019;s Triangle is done using a monopolar dissection hook. The cystic artery and duct are first dissected and then separately clipped with a standard 5&#x000a0;mm clip applicator (Covidien, Norwalk, California, USA). The gallbladder bed dissection is performed and once the gallbladder is free from the adjacent tissues, the 5&#x000a0;mm trocar is exchanged for a 10&#x000a0;mm trocar. An Endocatch bag (Endocatch Gold, 10&#x000a0;mm; Covidien Inc., Norwalk, California, USA) is inserted and the gallbladder is extracted. The umbilical fascia is closed using absorbable 0 Vicryl suture and a subcuticular skin closure with 4/0 or 5/0 Monocryl is performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study is the first randomized controlled trial that compares the da Vinci Single Site&#x02122; platform to conventional laparoscopic approaches. The putative advantages of the robotic technique, such as a reduced surgeon&#x02019;s physical and mental stressload, could lead to a further optimization and facilitation of laparoscopic approaches that might ultimately result in better clinical outcomes. In this study, the trial focuses on minimally-invasive cholecystectomy, one of the most frequently performed operations in general surgery. In fact, laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains an important focus of current surgical research efforts that aim to minimize the operative trauma and improve cosmesis without compromising safety and efficacy of this procedure. This trial compares two modern cholecystectomy techniques, which are likely to be adopted by the surgical community in the future on a larger scale, in a randomized controlled fashion. It utilizes a clear-cut study design with validated techniques to assess the study endpoints and an unbiased patient selection. The authors hope that it will help the current and future generation of surgeons to make an informed decision on which approach they will adopt to treat their patients with benign gallbladder disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dimitri Raptis for his help with the power calculations and Nadia Braga for helpful discussions.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>No external funding was received.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and material</title><p>The datasets during and/or analysed during the current study available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LFG, CS and SB designed the protocol and drafted the manuscript.
