Interval Training (IT) in soccer training on aerobic fitness and physical enjoyment in youth elite soccer players during the last 8 weeks of the season. Seventeen U-16 male soccer players (age = 15.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 years, and 8.5 years of experience) of a Spanish First Division club academy were randomized to 2 different groups for 6 weeks: SSG group (n = 9) and IT group (n = 8). In addition to the usual technical and tactical sessions and competitive games, the SSG group performed 11 sessions with different SSGs, whereas the IT group performed the same number of sessions of IT. Players were tested before and after the 6-week training intervention with a continuous maximal multistage running field test and the counter movement jump test (CMJ). At the end of the study, players answered the physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES). During the study, heart rate (HR) and session perceived effort (sRPE) were assessed. SSGs were as effective as IT in maintaining the aerobic fitness in elite young soccer players during the last weeks of the season. Players in the SSG group declared a greater physical enjoyment than IT (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006; ES = 1.86 &#x000b1; 1.07). Coaches could use SSG training during the last weeks of the season as an option without fear of losing aerobic fitness while promoting high physical enjoyment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information file.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information file.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Depending on tactics, age, and playing position, young soccer players (12 to 18-year-old) can run a total distance of 6,000 to 9,000 m during a match [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Out of this total, between 350&#x02013;550 m are ran at high-intensity (i.e., 16&#x02013;19 km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and 200&#x02013;650 m are ran with sprints (i.e. &#x0003e; 19 km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Using different definitions, others have found that 759 &#x000b1; 437 m correspond to high intensity activities (i.e. &#x0003e; 13 km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, they perform an average of 2.7 sprints per repeated-sprint sequences (i.e., minimum of 2 consecutive &#x02265; 1 s sprints interspersed with a maximum of 15, 30, 45 or 60 s of recovery) with an average sprint duration of less than 3 s. [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In this context, cardiorespiratory fitness is, among other factors, key to respond to this physical demand [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and it has usually been assessed in young soccer players [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>To improve cardiorespiratory fitness, several training programmes, including aerobic conditioning and small-sided games (SSG), have been applied in young soccer training [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although previous studies have shown that interval training (IT) and anaerobic speed endurance [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as part of soccer training enhance or maintain aerobic fitness in young soccer players, physical trainers prefer SSG and conditioned games [i.e., match-play with reduced number of players [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]] because: a) they enhance work on technical and tactical parameters [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and b) they elicit high HR intensities (i.e. &#x0003e; 90%HR<sub>max</sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in the range of those reported to be functional in enhancing aerobic fitness in soccer players (i.e. 90&#x02013;95% of HR<sub>max</sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, it is thought that in comparison to physical conditioning, these types of training drills result in more enjoyment. However, studies specifically related to soccer training are needed to support this. Physical enjoyment is a critical aspect of the competitive youth sport experience [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is evidence that athletes who enjoy sports the most are the ones who report being more intrinsically motivated [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, when young soccer players perceive that their psychological needs are satisfied, they report a higher degree of self-determined motivation [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In relation to physical conditioning, it has been suggested that in young soccer players SSG may be a good alternative to classical physical conditioning to maintain or improve aerobic fitness after pre-season and during the season. Hill-Hass et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have shown that SSG and generic training are equally effective at improving pre-season YYIRTL1 (i.e., Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1) performance. Impellizeri et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] observed that SSG and aerobic IT were also equally effective on aerobic fitness after pre-season and after additional 8 weeks of training. Reilly et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that after a 6-week program during the competitive period, the effects on aerobic capacity were similar between SSG and IT. Radziminski et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that in young soccer players, SSG training was more effective in improving VO<sub>2max</sub> than an IT protocol.

This study was done over 8 weeks, including a 6-week training period (last 6 weeks of the season) and 1+1 weeks of testing (before and after the 6-week training period). Before and immediately after the 6-week training sessions, anthropometric values, aerobic fitness [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and counter movement jump (CMJ) [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] were assessed on all the players.

Prior to the initiation of the study players did not undergo any specific conditioning program. Physical fitness was maintained with the usual training sessions and the competitive matches.</p><p>Players were randomly assigned to the SSG or the IT groups. SSG and IT sessions were done twice a week. In addition to the SSG and IT programs, all players continued to participate in their usual training sessions and official games. Each usual training session was held 3 times pppper week and were designed as follows: Monday: Opposition-free ball drill (i.e., technical drill), tactical drills and SSGs for the players that did not compete during the weekend; Wednesday: Opposition-free ball drill and Small- and Large-sided games; Friday: Opposition-free ball drill, pre-match strategy. The exact program for each SSG and IT training sessions was implemented at the onset of each session and after a standardized warm-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants</title><p>Seventeen U-16 male soccer players (mean &#x000b1; SD: age = 15.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 years, stature = 177.2 &#x000b1; 5.4 cm, body mass = 68.3 &#x000b1; 5.1 kg, and body fat = 10.4 &#x000b1; 0.7), from a Spanish First Division club academy participated in the study. All players had a minimum of 8.5 years of experience in competitive soccer and competed for the same youth category at a national level. After informed consent was given, subjects were divided into two teams and matched according to their role (defender, midfielder and forward). Allocation to either the SSG or IT groups within each pair was performed by tossing a coin [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. After randomization, no differences between groups were found on the performance on the baseline endurance test. Goalkeepers were excluded from the study, although they participated in the training. The Research Ethics Committee of the Navarra University Clinic (Cl&#x000ed;nica Universidad de Navarra) granted approval for the study. All players and parents were notified of the research procedures, requirements, benefits and risks before giving written informed consent. Players and coaches were not aware of the study hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Continuous maximal multistage running field test</title><p>In order to determine the maximal aerobic speed (MAS) [i.e., the lowest velocity that elicits VO<sub>2</sub>max during a graded test [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]], and to estimate the maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max), the Universit&#x000e9; de Montr&#x000e9;al Tract Test (UM-TT) [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and variations of it have been commonly used in the evaluation of soccer players [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, the incremental peak running velocity was assessed using the UM-TT test [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The UM-TT is a continuous maximal indirect multistage running field test based on the energy cost of running. This test has been suggested as a valid and reliable way to estimate VO<sub>2</sub>max [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, the speed of the multistage is initially set at 6.00 km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>. The speed is increased subsequently by 1.20 km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup> in 2-minute intervals. Players run guided by cones placed at specific sites of the field following instructions helped by whistles. The test is stopped when the subject was at least 9 meters behind the appropriate cone at the sound signal or felt that he could not complete the stage [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The velocity of the last 1-min stage completed by the subjects was retained as the players&#x02019; MAS (km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>). If the last stage was not completed entirely, the MAS was calculated using the formula of Kuipers et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]: MAS = Sf + (t/60&#x000b7;0.5), where Sf was the last completed speed in km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup> and t in the time in seconds of the uncompleted stage.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>CMJ test</title><p>Players&#x02019; CMJ heights were tested using a switching mat (Optojump, Microgate, Spain) according to the procedures proposed by Bosco et al.

Recovery time between trials was 20s [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Vertical jump standardization was achieved by requiring a 90 degree knee bend, keeping hands on the waist throughout the jump, avoiding undue lateral and frontal movements, and landing with extended legs.

No HR was recorded during matches due to the prohibition of wearing HR monitors and belts during official competitive matches. To reduce HR recording error, all players were regularly asked to check their HR monitors during each training session. Training-HR data was expressed as percentage of HR<sub>max</sub> and classified into three intensity zones [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]: &#x0003c; 80%, 80&#x02013;90%, and &#x0003e; 90% of HR<sub>max</sub>.

The main findings of our study were: a) SSG and IT were equally effective in maintaining aerobic fitness in elite young soccer players during the last weeks of the season, and b) SSG promoted considerable higher physical enjoyment than IT.</p><p>After the 6-week training period during which SSG or IT training were added to the habitual soccer practice, no significant group effect was detected in MAS, and only possibly small practical and positive effect was found for the IT group in this physical fitness parameter (<xref rid="pone.0137224.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, in elite youth soccer players both training programs were equally effective at maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness during the last weeks of the season. These results are in concordance with previous studies performed during pre-season and at the start of the in-season period [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but to our knowledge this is the first time the comparison between SSG and IT has been during the last weeks of the season, when aerobic fitness in soccer players, at most, is maintained [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thus, technical and tactical parameters could be worked in young soccer players with SSG during the last weeks of the season without impairment in cardiorespiratory fitness. Furthermore, in relation to neuromuscular performance, no significant group effect was detected in CMJ, and only possibly small practical impairment was found for SSG group. Thus, it is not likely that SSGs have a negative effect on neuromuscular performance during the last weeks of the season. These results suggest that both cardiorespiratory fitness and jump capacity can be maintained during the latter part of the season by including soccer drills to the habitual training routine.</p><p>Taking into account that players&#x02019; practice was not limited to the designed intervention programs, we quantified TL during total practice time in both groups since this can affect changes in aerobic fitness [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. While non-significant and only possibly small differences were found between both groups regarding total respiratory and muscular perceived TL, according to HR data, players in the SSG group accumulated likely moderate greater training time (12.7 &#x000b1; 6.9 vs 7.2 &#x000b1; 3.8%; ES = 1.31 &#x000b1; 1.30) at high intensity than in the IT group. Previous studies with soccer players found linear and positive dose-response relationships between training accumulated at high intensity and changes in different aerobic fitness parameters [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. After 6 to 8 weeks of pre-season training in elite soccer players, these reports found large to very large associations between the training time spent at high intensity (i.e., &#x0003e; HR at 4 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> lactate threshold) and the changes in speed at blood lactate concentrations of 2 and 4 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], in maximal oxygen uptake [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and in Yo-Yo IR1 [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, in our study players that accumulated more training time at high intensity (i. e., SSG group) did not improve their cardiorespiratory fitness. This suggests that in young soccer players training time accumulated at high intensity may not be relevant during the last weeks of the season.</p><p>In addition to the maintenance of aerobic fitness, to our knowledge this is the first study that shows that young elite soccer players are more motivated during SSG than performing physical training (<xref rid="pone.0137224.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This may be due to the fact that the activity in SSG resembles real football, which may motivate players to strive to achieve and experience greater feelings of competence than with IT. This is relevant in training because the positive emotion of enjoyment has been shown to be an important ingredient of motivation in youth and elite sports [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In addition, athletes who enjoy sports the most are the ones who report being more intrinsically motivated [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Specifically in young soccer players, psychological need satisfaction provides the essential ingredient for self-determined motivation [<xref rid="pone.0137224.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, in adolescents the SSG training may provide an activity stimulus that has potential psychological benefits that can help football coaches at any time during the season.</p><p>This study has some strengths and limitations. The main limitation is the small number of players in each group. Most published studies have the same limitation due to the difficulty in recruiting a homogeneous large group of players training under the same conditions. Even elite Football Clubs have one team per category, precluding the recruitment of more than 20 players at most. However, in our opinion the fact that the study was performed with players from a First Division Soccer academy following rigorous training programs with close monitoring and observation of the sessions is perhaps its major strength.</p><p>In conclusion, during the last weeks of the season, SSG training in addition to the training of the technical and tactical aspects, maintains cardiorespiratory fitness and promotes a high level of enjoyment in youth elite soccer players.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Practical Applications</title><p>The technical staff can use SSGs to improve the soccer competence of the players during the last weeks of the season in young elite soccer players, without fear of losing aerobic fitness and providing a high physical enjoyment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137224.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137224.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the management of the C.A.Osasuna school academy.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0137224.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
