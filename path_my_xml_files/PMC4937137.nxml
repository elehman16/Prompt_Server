sulfanilamide (pKa 10.5), with different rates of unionization in rumen juice, were compared in Shiba goats to
clarify the relationship between drug absorption profiles after their oral administration as well as their
degree of unionization in the rumen. Sulfonamides were administered either into the left jugular vein or
orally to five male goats at doses of 10 mg/kg body weight, using a crossover design with at least a 3-week
washout period. The T<sub>max</sub> of sulfadimidine, sulfadiazine and sulfanilamide reached 2.0 &#x000b1; 1.2, 6.0 &#x000b1;
0.0, and 7.8 &#x000b1; 1.6 hr, respectively, after their oral administration, and this was followed by their slow
elimination due to a slow rate of drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The MAT and
t<sub>1/2ka</sub> of sulfadiazine (13.2 &#x000b1; 2.0 and 10.9 &#x000b1; 1.08 hr) were significantly longer than those of
sulfanilamide (9.09 &#x000b1; 1.67 and 7.46 &#x000b1; 1.70 hr) and sulfadimidine (7.52 &#x000b1; 0.85 and 5.17 &#x000b1; 0.66 hr). These
results suggest that the absorption rates of highly unionized drugs (such as sulfanilamide and sulfadimidine)
from the forestomach of goats may be markedly higher than less unionized ones (such as sulfadiazine). The mean
oral bioavailability of sulfadiazine was high (83.9 &#x000b1; 17.0%), whereas those of sulfadimidine and sulfanilamide
were low (44.9 &#x000b1; 16.4% and 49.2 &#x000b1; 2.11%, respectively).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>goat</kwd><kwd>oral pharmacokinetic</kwd><kwd>sulfadiazine</kwd><kwd>sulfadimidine</kwd><kwd>sulfanilamide</kwd><kwd>unionization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Oral dosing is generally considered to be inappropriate for ruminants due to their slow absorption of drugs.
Therefore, intramuscular and subcutaneous injections are frequently used in cattle, sheep and goats. However, we
previously reported the rapid antipyretic effect of diclofenac (DF) in dairy cows with infectious disease
following its oral administration in a preliminary trial. This finding suggested the rapid absorption of DF from
the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, an oral administration route may be applicable for some drugs in ruminants,
thereby avoiding tissue damage and the presence of local residues associated with drugs administered via IM and SC
injections.</p><p>We previously examined the oral pharmacokinetics of DF and sulfamonomethoxine (SMM), which have different
physicochemical properties, in Shiba goats, and found a marked difference in their mean absorption times (DF 6 hr
and SMM 15 hr) [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although this finding suggested that DF was mainly
absorbed from the forestomach, the unionized fraction of SMM (pKa=6) was markedly higher than that of DF (pKa=4)
in the rumen (pH=6.5). On the other hand, the partition coefficient of DF between octanol and water is
approximately 8, while that of SMM is less than 1. Therefore, DF may be mainly absorbed from the forestomach
because of its very high lipid solubility, thereby suggesting that the absorption of highly lipophilic drugs
mainly occurs in the forestomach of ruminants.</p><p>Most drugs are generally considered to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract through a process of the
passive diffusion of the unionized fraction across a lipid membrane after their oral administration [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to lipid solubility, the unionization or pKa of drugs is also an important
factor for absorption from the forestomach. The main aim of the present study was to clarify the relationship
between drug absorption profiles after their oral administration to goats as well as their degree of unionization
in the rumen. To achieve this, the oral pharmacokinetic profiles of three sulfonamides; sulfadimidine (SDD),
sulfadiazine (SDZ) and sulfanilamide (SA), were compared in Shiba goats, because they have different rates of
unionization, but similar lipophilicities in the rumen.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Animals</italic>: All animals were maintained in accordance with the recommendations of the &#x02018;Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&#x02019; approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo
University of Agriculture and Technology (approval number 76/2013). Five clinically healthy male Shiba goats
bred and maintained at Fuchu campus of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, weighing 25&#x02013;60 kg and
aged 2&#x02013;3 years, were used in this study. These goats were housed in pens at an ambient temperature and with good
ventilation. Animals were fed hay cubes (#1A Cubes, Eckenberg Farms Inc., Mattawa, WA, U.S.A.) at 0.8 kg/head
twice a day. Water and mineralized salt licks were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p><p><italic>Chemicals and reagents</italic>: SDD was obtained from MP Biomedicals, LLC (Rue Geiler de Kaysersberg
Illkirch Cedex, France). SDZ was obtained as a sodium salt from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO,
U.S.A.). SA was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Sulfadimethoxine was obtained
as a sodium salt from Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents and chemicals used in
the present study were of HPLC or analytical grade and obtained commercially.</p><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p><italic>Pharmacokinetic study</italic>: Sulfonamides solutions (100 mg/m<italic>l</italic>) were prepared in
sterilized distilled water. For SDZ, this was done by dissolving the sodium salt; the other two sulfonamides
(SMZ and SA) were dissolved in water by adding a few drops of diluted (1N) sodium hydroxide solution. They
were administered either into the left jugular vein or orally to five male goats at doses of 10 mg (0.1
m<italic>l</italic>)/kg body weight, using a crossover design with at least a 3-week washout period. The
dose (10 mg/kg) was chosen for avoid unwanted effect (anorexia, diarrhea, etc.) to goats. Oral administration
was carried out using a nasogastric catheter, which was flushed with 60 m<italic>l</italic> tap water after
dosing. The interval between each study was at least three weeks. Blood (3 m<italic>l</italic>) was collected
from the right jugular vein immediately prior to the treatments, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hr after the
intravenous injections, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 32 and 48 hr after their oral administration. Plasma was
separated by the centrifugation of blood at 1,600 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until
analyzed.</p><p><italic>Stability of sulfonamides in the rumen juice</italic>: Two male Shiba goats of five goats used for a
pharmacokinetic study were restrained, and nasal catheters were passed into the rumen. Thereafter,
approximately 50 m<italic>l</italic> of rumen juice was aspirated through the catheter from each animal. The
rumen juices (pH 6.5) of two goats were combined and processed for incubation immediately after its
collection. Fifty microliters of the SDD, SDZ or SA solution (200 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>) was
added to 950 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of the rumen fluid to give a final concentration of 10
<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> of the incubation mixture. Five samples of each drug were prepared
and incubated in a thermostatic shaking water bath at 39&#x000b0;C for 24 hr under anaerobic conditions. The
concentrations of sulfonamides were then measured by HPLC.</p><p><italic>Octanol-buffer (pH 6.5) partitioning experiments</italic>: Octanol-buffer partitioning studies were
performed using a shake flask method as recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Before partitioning, the two solvents were
mutually saturated at 25&#x000b0;C for 24 hr. Solutions of the three sulfonamides (10
<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>) were prepared in the octanol-saturated buffer. These solutions were
then equilibrated at 25&#x000b0;C with an equivalent, double and half volume of buffer-saturated octanol. Two
separating funnels were used in all three runs. Equilibration was achieved by hand shaking of the funnels (by
rotation of the funnels through 180 degrees about its transverse axis approximately one hundred times in five
min) allowing the trapped air to rise through the two phases. The funnels were then fixed vertically by
racking until complete separation of the two phases. The buffer phase was collected and centrifuged at 1,600
<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 25&#x000b0;C, and the supernatant octanol phase was discarded. The drug
concentration in the buffer phase was then determined by HPLC, while that in the octanol phase was calculated
from the difference between the initial and final concentrations in the buffer phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug assays</title><p>SDD, SDZ and SA concentrations were determined in plasma, rumen juice and buffer samples by HPLC with UV
detection. Two hundred microliters of perchloric acid (0.5 M) was added to 200 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of the
plasma sample. The mixture was vortexed for 30 sec and then centrifuged at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10
min at 5&#x000b0;C. The obtained supernatant was filtered using a 0.45-<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m HPLC filter. Fifty
microliters of the filtrate was injected into the HPLC column.</p><p>In the case of rumen juice samples, SDD, SDZ and SA concentrations were determined after extraction with
ethyl acetate. After being incubated for 24 hr, 50 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of the internal standard (200
<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>) was added to the rumen juice samples. The internal standards used
in the present study were sulfadimethoxine, SA and SDZ for SDD, SDZ and SA, respectively. Subsequently, five
milliliters of ethyl acetate was then added. The mixtures were vortexed for 30 sec and then centrifuged at
3,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 5&#x000b0;C. The obtained supernatants were transferred into pear-shaped flasks
and evaporated to dryness at 30&#x000b0;C. The residue was reconstituted in 500 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of the mobile
phase and filtered using the 0.45-<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m HPLC filter. Fifty microliters of the filtrate was
injected into the HPLC column.</p><p>The mobile phases used were a mixture of 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 5) and acetonitrile (75:25, v/v) for SDD, a
mixture of 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4) and acetonitrile (75:25, v/v) for SDZ, and a mixture of 50 mM acetate
buffer (pH 5) and acetonitrile (80:20, v/v) for SA. Analytical separation was accomplished using a
reversed-phase C<sub>8</sub> column (Mightysil RP-8 GP, 4.6 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m &#x000d7; 250 mm, Kanto Chemical Co.,
Tokyo, Japan). The flow rates were 0.8 m<italic>l</italic>/min. The wavelength of the detector was 270 nm.</p><p>The recoveries of SDD, SDZ and SA from plasma samples at 1 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> (n=5) were
109.2 &#x000b1; 2.00%, 87.9 &#x000b1; 1.52% and 95.0 &#x000b1; 1.75%, while those from rumen juice samples at 10
<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> (n=5) were 83.5 &#x000b1; 2.06%, 84.3 &#x000b1; 2.09% and 88.1 &#x000b1; 2.35%,
respectively. The inter-day CV values for plasma samples ranged from 1.67 to 2.14% for SDD, 0.63 to 3.84% for
SDZ and from 1.21 to 2.29% for SA, while those for rumen juice samples ranged from 1.86 to 2.79% for SDD, 1.96
to 5.24% for SDZ and 1.61 to 3.57% for SA (n=5, 3 times).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Pharmacokinetic parameters relating to oral drug
absorption were statistically analyzed. Differences in the mean values between groups were analyzed by
Scheff&#x000e9;&#x02019;s multiple comparison test after a one-way ANOVA single factor test. Equal variances among the groups
were confirmed by the Bartlett test. Differences were considered significant when
<italic>P&#x0003c;</italic>0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic analysis</title><p>The plasma concentration-time curves of SDD, SDZ and SA after their intravenous administration fit well with
the one compartment model. Therefore, the curves obtained after the intravenous injections
(<italic>Cp<sub>iv</sub></italic> (<italic>t</italic>)) and those after their oral administration
(<italic>Cp<sub>po</sub></italic> (<italic>t</italic>)) were described by Eqs. 1 and 2, respectively.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-1025-i001.jpg"/> (Eq.1)</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-1025-i002.jpg"/> (Eq.2)</p><p>Equations 1 and 2 were simultaneously fit to the plasma concentration-time curves after the intravenous
injections and oral administration to the same goats, respectively, in order to calculate pharmacokinetic
parameters by the nonlinear least-squares method using the curve fitting program, MULTI [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Several pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by a non-compartmental analysis. The area under the
concentration versus time curve (AUC) was calculated by the trapezoidal method (from time zero to the last
sampling time) and integration (from the last sampling time to infinity). Total body clearance
(CL<sub>tot</sub>), bioavailability (F), mean residence time (MRT), mean absorption time (MAT), elimination
half-life (t<sub>1/2kel</sub>) and distribution volume at a steady state (V<sub>dss</sub>) were calculated by
conventional methods.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The plasma concentrations against time curves obtained after a single intravenous or oral dosing of SDD, SDZ or

suggesting that SDD and SA were exposed to the extensive &#x02018;first-pass&#x02019; effect of the liver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Oral drug absorption is generally more complex and unpredictable in ruminants and may exhibit markedly
different kinetics from those in monogastric species, and these differences have been attributed to the unique
anatomical and physiological features of the gastrointestinal tract in ruminants. The forestomach (rumen,
reticulum and omasum) is a large volume compartment (100&#x02013;225 <italic>l</italic> in cattle and 10&#x02013;24
<italic>l</italic> in sheep and goats), which may result in the dilution and long residence time of drugs in
the forestomach [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the inner structure of the forestomach
is lined by a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which may also contribute to the slow absorption of
drugs. We previously reported the marked absorption of diclofenac from the forestomach of Shiba goats after its
oral administration and suggested that this may have been due to the high lipid solubility of the drug [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, we herein examined the absorption profiles of SDD, SDZ and SA,
which have different pKa, but similar lipophilicities (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>)
after their oral administration to Shiba goats.</p><p>Marked differences were observed in the oral absorption profiles of the three sulfonamides. The absorption rate
of SDZ from the forestomach of goats may have been markedly slower, because of its longer MAT and
t<sub>1/2ka</sub> than those of SDD and SA. The pKa values of SDZ, SDD and SA were previously reported to be
6.5, 7.5 and 10.5, respectively [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], suggesting that 50% of SDZ molecules are unionized, SDD molecules mainly exist in an unionized
form (90%), and SA molecules are mainly unionized (more than 99.9%) in the rumen juice because its pH value was
6.5 in this study, as has been reported previously [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, the slow absorption rate of SDZ from the forestomach may have
been due to its lower degree of unionization than SDD and SA in the rumen juice.</p><p>A comparison of the MAT of SDD in the present study with that of SMM in our previous study on Shiba goats
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] revealed that the MAT of SDD (7.52 &#x000b1; 0.85 hr) was less than half
that of SMM (15.1 &#x000b1; 4.7 hr), whereas the partition coefficients of octanol and the buffer (pH=6.5) were nearly
similar; that of SDD was 1.96 &#x000b1; 0.16 (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and that of SMM was
1.72 &#x000b1; 0.17 (determined by the method used in the present study). However, the percentage of the unionized
fraction in the rumen juice (pH 6.5) was different (approximately 90% for SDD and 30% for SMM). Therefore, SDD
may have been absorbed more from the forestomach than SMM, because of its markedly higher unionization in the
rumen juice, suggesting that drugs with high unionization are largely absorbed from the forestomach of
ruminants.</p><p>No significant differences were observed in the MAT between SDD and SA (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and may have been because of the nearly similar degree of unionization of both drugs in the
forestomach (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, the degree of unionization may be
an important factor for the absorption of drugs from the forestomach after their oral administration.</p><p>The plasma concentration curves of three sulfonamides shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.1</xref>
revealed at the flip-flop phenomena. These flip-flop kinetics occur when the absorption rate constant (ka) is
smaller than the elimination rate constant (k<sub>el</sub>), and therefore, the slope of the terminal log-linear
phase after oral administration of a drug reflects the absorption rate constant. As listed in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, ka values of three drugs were smaller than k<sub>el</sub>
values in the same way. When oral pharmacokinetics exhibits flip-flop phenomena, the determining factor of
T<sub>max</sub> is function of the drug elimination results in the shorter T<sub>max</sub>. The elimination
half-life (1.09 hr) of SDD was shorter than half-lives (1.56 and 3.71 hr) of other two drugs (SDZ and
SA).Therefore, the elimination of SDD in shiba goat may have been fast enough to acheve C<sub>max</sub> more
rapidly (2.00 hr of T<sub>max</sub>) than SDZ or SA after their oral administration.</p><p>The slow absorption kinetics of three sulfonamides after their oral administration to male Shiba goats were
shown in this study. The oral pharmacokinetic profiles of SDD in pigs were reported [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The absorption of SDD was shown to be fast in monogastric animal. The obtained
k<sub>a</sub> values (0.498 hr<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in pigs) were markedly higher than those obtained from the Shiba
goats in the present study (0.136 hr<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). The slow absorption rate of sulfanomaides in the Shiba goats
may be due to their long residence time in the forestomach.</p><p>We suggested that the lower bioavailability (44.9% as F*) of SDD after oral administration was mainly due to
the considerable &#x02018;first-pass&#x02019; effect in the liver because of its fast elimination rate (0.728 hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as
k<sub>el</sub>). The oral bioavailability of SDD was low (26.4%) in dwarf goats and attributed this to a
consequence of the marked hepatic &#x02018;first-pass&#x02019; effect as reported previously [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was also found that the oral bioavailability of a SDD solution was low (58.3%) in sheep [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Another study also suggested that the low bioavailability of
sulfamethoxazole after its oral administration to goats was most likely due to the hepatic &#x02018;first-pass&#x02019; effect
[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On the other hand, although the slow elimination of SA (0.188
hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) couldn&#x02019;t explain the low oral bioavailability, the low stability (76.5%) of SA in rumen juice
might explain the low bioavailavility of SA after its oral administration. These findings may support our
suggestion regarding the incomplete bioavailability of SDD and SA in the present study.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that drugs that are highly unionized in rumen juice as
well as highly lipophilic may be mainly absorbed from the forestomach of goats, indicating that an oral route is
suitable for such drugs, even in ruminants.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Baggot</surname><given-names>J.
