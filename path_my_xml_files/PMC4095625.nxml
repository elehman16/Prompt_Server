In a study comparing two pedicle grafts used to cover the CT, successful root coverage was obtained with both coronally positioned flap (CPF) as well as double pedicle graft (DPG). In addition, a larger increase in the amount of keratinized tissue was seen when the overlying pedicle was a double pedicle.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Though several studies have reported the effectiveness of DPG[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and CPF[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in combination with CT, only one study so far has compared the two techniques.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, the present randomized, controlled, clinical study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of double pedicle flap and CPF over the SCTG in the treatment of isolated gingival recession defect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 20 systemically healthy patients (14 males and 6 females) with labial or buccal recession defects &#x0003e;3 mm, with the loss of clinical attachment level (CAL) &#x0003e;4 mm and having equal amount of keratinized gingiva apical to the recession on more than one adjacent teeth were selected among those seeking care at the Periodontal Department of Sharad Pawar Dental College and Hospital, Wardha. Recession classified as either Miller's Class I or Class II with radiographic evidence of sufficient interdental bone (distance between the crestal bone and cementoenamel junction (CEJ) as &#x0003c;2 mm) were selected. The patient population ranged in age from 25 to 46 years (mean 30.4 years). Patients agreed to participate in the study and gave their written informed consent.</p><p>Patients using tobacco in any form, uncooperative patients, with unacceptable oral hygiene after Phase I therapy and with a history of periodontal surgery were excluded from the study. Information concerning dietary status, systemic background and mouth cleaning habits, gingival and periodontal status along with other routine clinical data were recorded in a specially designed chart.</p><p>Full mouth plaque score was obtained by using Turesky <italic>et al</italic>. modification of Quigley-Hein (1970) plaque index (PI),[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] which revealed the presence of plaque. Full mouth bleeding score was obtained by using papillary bleeding index (PBI),[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the two indices were recorded at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. Plaque score for the tooth was obtained by dividing the sum of the scores per tooth by two; a plaque score per person was obtained by dividing the total plaque score by the number of teeth examined. PBI was obtained by dividing the total papilla bleeding scores by the number of teeth examined.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a randomized, controlled, clinical study performed over a period of 6 months. A total of 20 Millers Class I recession defects in 20 patients (one in each) were included in this study. The selected recession defects were randomly divided by a coin flip to test (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 10) group. Power analysis indicated a statistical power of 85% for a sample of 20. The test group (Male:Female, 5:5) was treated with CT graft in combination with double pedicle graft while the control group (Male:Female, 9:1) was treated with CT graft in combination with CPF.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Initial therapy</title><p>Following selection, all patients were monitored in oral hygiene and instructed in proper tooth brushing, with roll-stroke technique being prescribed for teeth with recession-type defects. In order to achieve a regular and smooth surface, scaling and selective root planing followed by professional polishing with the use of rubber cup and a low abrasive polishing paste were performed if necessary. Coronoplasty was performed if necessary. At the end of therapy, before the surgical procedure, all patients had a plaque Score of &#x0003c;1 and bleeding Score of &#x0003c;1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>One calibrated examiner collected the following data at baseline, 3 months and 6 months post-operatively: Gingival recession (REC), probing pocket depth (PPD), CAL and width of keratinized gingiva (WKG) were measured using a computerized constant pressure probe i.e., Florida Probe (Florida Probe Corporation, Gaineswille, FL, USA) with a constant force of 15 g (pressure-154 N/cm<sup>2</sup>), tip diameter of 0.40 mm, precision of 0.2 mm and a probe length of 11 mm. The CEJ was used as a fixed reference point and where CEJ was not visible the lower border of the groove on the acrylic stent, which covered the experimental tooth was used as a reference point. One examiner performed all the surgeries Vidya Baliga (Vidya Baliga) and the clinical measurements were carried out by another examiner Manohar L Bhongade (Manohar L Bhongade). The patient was unaware of the type of treatment he would receive. The mean intra-examiner standard deviation of differences in repeated PD measurements and CAL measurements were obtained using single passes of measurements with a UNC- 15 probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) (correlation coefficients between duplicate measurements; <italic>r</italic> = 0.95).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>After local anesthesia (2% Lidocaine HCl with 1:100,000 epinephrine) the exposed root surfaces were thoroughly planed with curettes and ultrasonic instruments. An intrasulcular incision was made with a #15C (Ribbel, New Delhi, India) blade on the buccal aspect of the involved teeth and extended horizontally to adjacent interdental areas. Two oblique releasing incisions were made from the mesial and distal extremities of the horizontal incision beyond the mucogingival junction. An incision was made so that a &#x0201c;<italic>V</italic>&#x0201d; shaped wedged of marginal tissue could be removed. This would provide a fresh wound surface for approximation after removal of surrounding ulcerated crevicular epithelium. Once the incisions were given, the flap reflection was done by sharp dissection extending beyond the mucogingival junction. The exposed root surface was then planed with curettes to remove the deposits and smoothen the root surface. A CT graft in the proper dimensions was harvested from the palate (canine to first molar area) using the trap door approach[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and trimmed as necessary after removal of excess fatty and glandular tissue. The flap was then repositioned to completely cover the donor site and sutured. The CT graft was placed immediately over the exposed root(s) covering the entire defect and the adjacent recipient bed at the level of CEJ and sutured to the interproximal papilla with 5-0 resorbable sutures (Vicryl 5-0, ETHICON, Johnson and Johnson, Waluj, Aurangabad, India).</p><p>The reflected flap was positioned as a double pedicle graft over the CT graft in the area of recession with a sling suture and the pedicles were sutured together in this position with 5-0 resorbable interrupted sutures [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. In the control group, the reflected flap was coronally advanced to completely cover the CT graft, placing it slightly coronal to the CEJ and stabilized with simple interrupted 5-0 Vicryl sutures laterally and with continuous sling sutures coronally [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Intraoral photograph, showing pre-operative and 6 months post-operative photo of single recession defect treated with sub-epithelial connective tissue graft combined with a double pedicle graft</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-326-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Intraoral photograph, showing pre-operative and 6 months post-operative photo of single recession defect treated with sub-epithelial connective tissue graft combined with a coronally positioned flap</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-326-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Post-surgical care</title><p>Post-surgery periodontal dressings (COE-PAK&#x02122;, GC America Inc., ALSIP, IL, USA) were placed at the recipient sites of both the test and control groups. All patients were advised to discontinue all mechanical oral hygiene measures for 4 weeks and avoid any trauma to the surgical sites. Analgesics (Ibugesic- Ibuprofen and Paracetamol) were prescribed as required. A 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash was prescribed twice a daily for 4 weeks. 1 week post-surgery, periodontal pack was removed. The areas were professionally cleaned as a supragingival prophylaxis with a rubber cup at low speed and by using a prophylaxis paste was performed. At 3 weeks, brushing was reinstituted with a soft toothbrush utilizing charter's method of brushing. Professional plaque control was performed at 1 month; 3 month and 6 month recall visits.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The means and standard deviations of REC, PPD, CAL, and WKG at baseline and 6 months post-surgery were calculated for both the test and control groups.

The clinical outcomes of various forms of surgical interventions are influenced by general level of oral hygiene. In the present study, means of both PI and PBI scores were low at the baseline and remained significantly low (&#x0003c;1) throughout the study.</p><p>In the present study, both groups showed significant increase in the studied clinical parameters with respect to baseline. At 6 months, statistical significant improvement was found in recession depth in both CTDPG (3.80 mm) and CTCPF (3.34 mm) groups. The mean root coverage obtained in the present study was 88% for CTDPG and 84.72% for CTCPF. The results obtained are similar to that reported by Harris,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] utilizing a larger sample size, however, the study was not a controlled one. In addition, the study did not exclude smokers, whereas the present study excluded smokers or subjects using tobacco in any form, since it has been shown that smoking negatively affects the clinical outcome, specifically the residual recession, percent root coverage and frequency of complete root coverage.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In addition, the clinical measurements had been made using a manual probe and hence are subjected to error, whereas, in our study all the measurements were made utilizing a computerized constant pressure and force probe, the Florida Probe. More importantly, the study was evaluated only for a period of 3 months, whereas, the evaluation period used in this study was 6 months from the last surgical treatment because this period is considered adequate to provide soft-tissue maturity and stability.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In addition, a 36 month follow-up study reported that no significant clinical changes were seen from the period of surgical reentry at 6 months upto 3 years of follow-up.</p><p>A clinical attachment gain was observed at 6 months in both CTDPG (3.80 mm) and CTCPF (3.34 mm) groups, which was statistically significant from baseline and the differences between the groups was statistically significant. The results of the present study show that a statistically significant increase in WKG was observed at 6 months surgery in both CTDPG (3.80 mm) and CTCPF (3.30 mm) groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the above study it can be concluded that the CT grafts and its variations are extremely effective techniques in obtaining coverage. In this study, very high percentage of root coverage (88% and 84%) was obtained with CT grafts and both types of pedicles to cover the graft were effective in obtaining comparable coverage. Based on this study, it can be said that whenever an increase in keratinised tissue is required the CT graft can be obtained with either a double pedicle graft or an overlying CPF.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Albandar</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kingman</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gingival recession, gingival bleeding, and dental calculus in adults 30 years of age and older in the United States, 1988-1994</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1999</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>30</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10052768</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Susin</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Haas</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name><name><surname>Oppermann</surname><given-names>RV</given-names></name><name><surname>Haugejorden</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Albandar</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gingival recession: Epidemiology and risk indicators in a representative urban Brazilian population</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2004</year><volume>75</volume><fpage>1377</fpage><lpage>86</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15562916</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van Palenstein Helderman</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lembariti</surname><given-names>BS</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Weijden</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>van &#x02019;t Hof</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gingival recession and its association with calculus in subjects deprived of prophylactic dental care</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1998</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>106</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9495609</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>HP</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Beck</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Three-year root caries incidence and risk modeling in older adults in North Carolina</article-title><source>J Public Health Dent</source><year>1995</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>69</fpage><lpage>78</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7643330</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Wahadni</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Linden</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dentine hypersensitivity in Jordanian dental attenders.
