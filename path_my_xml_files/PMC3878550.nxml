Inpatient rehabilitation is a costly rehabilitation option after total knee arthroplasty and, in Australia, is utilized most frequently for privately insured patients. With the exception of comparisons with domiciliary services, no randomized trial has compared inpatient rehabilitation to any outpatient based program. The Hospital Inpatient versus HOme (HIHO) study primarily aims to determine whether 10&#x000a0;days of post-acute inpatient rehabilitation followed by a hybrid home program provides superior recovery of functional mobility on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) compared to a hybrid home program alone following total knee arthroplasty. Secondarily, the trial aims to determine whether inpatient rehabilitation yields superior recovery in patient-reported function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT), with a third, non-randomized, observational group. One hundred and forty eligible, consenting participants who have undergone a primary total knee arthroplasty at a high-volume joint replacement center will be randomly allocated when cleared for discharge from acute care to either 10&#x000a0;days of inpatient rehabilitation followed by usual care (a 6-week hybrid home program) or to usual care. Seventy participants in each group (140 in total) will provide 80% power at a significance level of 5% to detect an increase in walking capacity from 400&#x000a0;m to 460&#x000a0;m between the Home and Inpatient groups, respectively, in the 6MWT at 6&#x000a0;months post-surgery, assuming a SD of 120&#x000a0;m and a drop-out rate of &#x0003c;10%.</p><p>The outcome assessor will assess participants at 10, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks post-operatively, and will remain blind to group allocation for the duration of the study, as will the statistician. Participant preference for rehabilitation mode stated prior to randomization will be accounted for in the analysis together with any baseline differences in potentially confounding characteristics as required.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The HIHO Trial will be the first RCT to investigate the efficacy of inpatient rehabilitation compared to any outpatient alternative following total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>) ref: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01583153?term=hiho&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01583153</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In Australia, inpatient rehabilitation is a costly and commonly utilized treatment option after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), particularly in the private sector. A 12-day inpatient stay in a private facility costs approximately AU$8,100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Based on unpublished data derived from both the Australian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre and the National Joint Replacement Registry, approximately 46% of privately insured patients undergoing knee replacement (primary, revision or unicompartmental) in New South Wales, and 32% of private patients Australia-wide, received inpatient rehabilitation in the 2011/12 financial year. As the majority of TKA procedures are performed in the private sector in Australia - some 32,105 per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] - the question of whether inpatient rehabilitation yields superior outcomes to cheaper alternatives is of considerable interest to private health insurers and governments alike. Inevitably, the cost of inpatient services is reflected in private insurance premiums and costly premiums negatively affect rates of private health insurance.</p><sec><title>Total knee arthroplasty and associated costs</title><p>Between 2003 and 2012, the number of primary TKA procedures undertaken in Australia has increased by 83.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This increasing surgical volume is consistent with international trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Demand is increasing due to advances in surgical technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the ageing population and, thus, more people with osteoarthritis (OA), and because consumers are opting for a surgical solution determined to reduce age-related disability in an effort to maintain health and standards of living as they live longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Further increases are expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; thus, there is growing concern regarding the sustainability and affordability of this type of intervention both in the public and private sectors. Increased demand in the public sector cannot be readily met because the supply of services is not driven by demand, but rather is dictated by governmental policy set within the context of a fixed proportion of gross domestic product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Whilst the private sector can adjust more readily to increases in demand, this inevitably puts upward pressure on private health insurance premiums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Whilst the TKA procedure is viewed as highly cost effective in light of the impressive gains in functional performance and health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the acute care and associated rehabilitative costs impose a significant burden on public and private hospital budgets and resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Not surprisingly, a recent retrospective study from the US concluded that the cost effectiveness of TKA is reduced if the procedure is associated with a stay in an inpatient rehabilitation facility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence in support of inpatient rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty</title><p>A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL healthcare databases - first completed in October 2011 and then again in July 2013 (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> for search strings) - revealed that there was no high level evidence to support the provision of inpatient rehabilitation after TKA over any outpatient-based alternative. Specifically, no randomized trial has compared inpatient rehabilitation to any group-based or center-based one-to-one program or a monitored or unmonitored home program. Two studies (one review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and one randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]) undertaken in the US have concluded that inpatient rehabilitation is not superior to domiciliary rehabilitation (hospital services provided at home). A non-randomized pilot study in Germany concluded that inpatient rehabilitation was not more cost effective compared to outpatient rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Longitudinal data from an Australian cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] observed that patient-reported outcomes were similar whether or not TKA patients were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. The authors concluded that randomized trials were required to explore who, if any group, benefits most (such as older or more infirm patients) from inpatient rehabilitation.</p><table-wrap

there was insufficient and inconsistent evidence to recommend any specific type, timing or setting for post-acute TKA rehabilitation, and there was low therapeutic validity among trials related to exercise intensity, dosage and adherence (Westby M, 2013, personal communication). This included the use of hydrotherapy, one-to-one or group-based therapy, and even different exercise types such as those targeting functional movements versus isolated muscle activity. Notably, most of the studies reviewed were small (n&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;160) and none has simultaneously compared group-based, one-to-one and home-based programs. Our own recently completed, comparatively large RCT (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;249) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] provides strong evidence that a one-to-one outpatient program does not provide superior patient-reported outcomes compared to less resource-intensive modes such as group-based or monitored home programs up to 1&#x000a0;year post-surgery. In addition, similar recovery patterns were observed across all three study arms in joint range, quadriceps lag, and timed mobility. The similar recovery patterns were observed despite the fact that access to center-based interventions - 12 sessions each for either the one-to-one or group-based study arm - were optimized through the use of transport and parking concessions. Thus, lack of access or poor attendance did not explain lack of superiority of the one-to-one mode.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>Based on a recent RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the lack of research evaluating the necessity of inpatient rehabilitation, we contend that a trial comparing the efficacy of the most resource-intensive form of rehabilitation delivery after TKA - inpatient rehabilitation compared to one with comparatively little resource use such as a monitored home program - is justified. The study will be a landmark study in this area, providing evidence that either supports or refutes the need for resource intensive inpatient rehabilitation after TKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to establish whether inpatient rehabilitation is beneficial after TKA for patients with OA who could otherwise be discharged directly home.</p><p>The main hypothesis to be tested by the proposed study is that TKA recipients who receive inpatient rehabilitation in addition to participating in a home program, compared to patients who participate in a home program only, will achieve a superior level of mobility at 6&#x000a0;months post-surgery as assessed by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial design and methods</title><sec><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p>We will recruit 140 participants through the Whitlam Joint Replacement Centre (WJRC) at Fairfield Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Consecutive patients presenting for primary unilateral TKA will be screened for eligibility.

The co-ordinating investigator (MAB) will identify potential participants presenting to the WJRC orthopedic clinic, screening consecutive patients against the inclusion and exclusion criteria by chart review and direct questioning. A screening log will be kept, recording the criteria eliminating all those found to be ineligible. A second log will be maintained, detailing reasons for unwillingness to consent to participation in the study by otherwise eligible patients. Those willing to participate will be asked for informed consent using an approved consent form and baseline measures will be obtained.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cohort ascertainment, randomization and study timeline.</bold> HI, hospital inpatient rehabilitation; HO, hybrid home program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-432-1"/></fig><p>This trial is a two-arm parallel RCT (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

This third group will permit the detection of a possible preference effect amongst recruited participants. If study recruitment is biased towards people with a preference for inpatient rehabilitation, there is a risk that participants randomized to the inpatient arm will, in part, report superior outcomes compared to those randomized to the home program because they received their preferred program. If no such superiority is observed when we compare those who were randomly allocated to usual care and preferred inpatient rehabilitation to those who opted to receive usual care (those in the observational arm), then it is possible that any preference effect (if present) is not strong.</p><p>The study is expected to take up to 51&#x000a0;months, consisting of 30 to 33&#x000a0;months for recruitment and randomization, 12&#x000a0;months for follow-up of the final participants, and 6&#x000a0;months for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>Randomization will take place following surgery once it has been confirmed that participants are likely to be cleared for discharge home by post-operative day 5.

Approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks post-surgery, participants allocated to the HO will attend one group-based outpatient exercise session in the physiotherapy department where the home program will be rehearsed and exercises individualized as required due to co-morbidities.

A functional outcome based on a physical test is a novel choice as a primary outcome in this field given that the convention with most TKA rehabilitation studies is to focus on patient-reported outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The decision to employ measured mobility as the primary outcome was based on multiple factors. First, functional mobility is a composite of several factors targeted in rehabilitation programs after TKA such as lower limb strength, knee range of motion, and balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Second, a functional outcome is more likely to be directly influenced by the intervention (rehabilitation), and the intervention aims to improve walking. Third, the 6MWT is highly reproducible within the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Fourth, it is likely to be less susceptible to misinterpretation and less culturally sensitive than patient-reported outcomes. Fifth, the test does not appear to suffer from the floor or ceiling effects associated with many patient-reported outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Sixth, an observer-measured outcome is less likely to be influenced by a preference effect compared to a patient-reported outcome, and this is particularly important when the intervention under examination cannot be blinded from the recipient. Together, these attributes mean the results for our primary outcome should be readily translatable to any TKA cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary</title><p>Secondary outcomes comprise both patient-reported and observer-measured outcomes including a knee pain and function survey (the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], knee range of motion (ROM) (&#x0003c;100 degrees, &#x02265;100 degrees) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], health-related quality of life (the EQ-5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the proportion achieving a gait speed of 1.2&#x000a0;m/s during a 15&#x000a0;m walk test).

Costs recorded will include visits to health professionals, pathology tests, imaging, cost of transport and cost of medication. Indirect costs including time lost from work for the patient or carer will also be explored in a secondary analysis. The extent to which a cost analysis is undertaken will depend on the availability of funds to perform a comprehensive health economic analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Baseline and other data</title><p>Demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), level of education, co-morbidities) will be collected at baseline, and complication data (such as presentation to emergency department, re-admission, re-operation, knee manipulation, wound infection, venous thrombo-embolism and death) will be collected until 12&#x000a0;months post-surgery. Preference for rehabilitation mode (home-based rehabilitation program, inpatient rehabilitation program or either) will be ascertained prior to surgery and after formal rehabilitation has ceased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>A summary of the follow-up schedule is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Seventy participants in each group (140 in total) will provide 80% power at a significance level of 5% to detect an increase in walking capacity from 400&#x000a0;m to 460&#x000a0;m between the HO and HI groups, respectively, in the 6MWT at 6&#x000a0;months post-surgery, assuming a SD of 120&#x000a0;m and a drop-out rate of &#x0003c;10%. The SD of 120 is a conservative estimate of the SD of the mean 6MWT at 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Using a 0.5SD criterion, this sample will be powered to detect a moderate effect size of 60&#x000a0;m difference in walking distance. If the actual SD of the sample collected is smaller than the assumed value, say 100 instead of 120, the study will remain powered to detect a moderate effect size of 0.5SD.</p><p>The original plan for the primary outcome was gait speed (m/s) at 6&#x000a0;months post-surgery, with an initial sample size powered to detect an absolute difference of 20% in the proportion of participants at 6&#x000a0;months who achieve the minimum gait speed considered necessary to cross safely at a pedestrian crossing (that is, 1.2&#x000a0;m/s). In the absence of other context-specific data, the data used for this calculation was based on the proportion of TKA participants (37%) who achieved this average gait speed at 6&#x000a0;months post-surgery during a 6MWT having participated in outpatient-based rehabilitation only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This calculation assumed that average gait speed during a 6MWT was representative of the average speed a TKA recipient would achieve during a shorter test, such as crossing a 4- to 6-lane road (approximately 15&#x000a0;m). Aware that the assumption may be overly optimistic, we planned to review - whilst blind to treatment allocation - the proportion in each group achieving an average gait speed of 1.2&#x000a0;m/s during the 15&#x000a0;m walk test after the first 15 randomized participants reached the 10-week follow-up. On review, approximately 70% in each group achieved the requisite gait speed; hence, to expect inpatient rehabilitation to secure this gait speed for over 90% of the participants was deemed unrealistic. The primary outcome remained based around the 6MWT as originally planned, but was converted to the distance walked during this same test. To complement the revised primary outcome, and in the absence of data describing the minimum clinically important difference for the 6MWT, we included a sub-study to evaluate the minimum clinically important difference for measured mobility in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Data management and analysis</title><sec><title>Data management</title><p>Data will be sent by blinded assessors to blinded data entry staff for collation and data entry, with range checks for data values.

For participants with a missing outcome measure at 26&#x000a0;weeks, an imputation method will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The secondary outcome variables include the 6MWT at 10 and 52&#x000a0;weeks post-surgery, the 15&#x000a0;m walk test, EQ5D, Oxford Knee Score, KOOS and knee ROM at most post-surgery time points.</p><p>Mixed model analyses will be used for the continuous variables measured repeatedly at 10, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks to estimate the treatment group by time effects. These analyses incorporate the missing data that may occur at the follow-up occasions. Baseline measurements of the outcome variables, together with factors such as weight, BMI, co-morbidities and patient preference, will be included as covariates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. For the binary outcome measured at 10, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks (knee flexion &#x02265;100 degrees or &#x02264;100 degrees), a Generalized Estimating Equation model will be used to test the treatment effect, with the adjustment of the covariates as above.</p><p>For the analyses involving the observational arm, the change score in the primary outcome will be compared between the observational group and those in the randomized home group adjusting for other covariates. A lack of significant difference in scores between the two groups will suggest there is no strong preference effect in this trial and we may not need to include preference as a covariate in the RCT analyses. To be consistent with the two RCT groups, we will aim for a minimum 64 participants in the observational group.</p><p>For the sensitivity analysis, the above analysis used for the primary and secondary outcome variables will be performed &#x02018;as-treated&#x02019;, analyzing patients according to the treatment they actually received and excluding those with missing outcome measures. It will only include patients who were compliant with the intervention protocol. Compliance for the HI group will be defined as attendance of a minimum of 7&#x000a0;days of inpatient rehabilitation, along with attendance at no less than two outpatient sessions. Compliance for the HO group will be defined as attendance at no less than two outpatient sessions. There will be procedures put in place to minimize loss to follow-up, such as obtaining multiple contact details at time of consent and reminders that assessments are due. The age, gender and height of participants will be used as stratification variables in the randomization procedure via a minimization algorithm. The mixed model analysis indicated above will include these three variables as additional covariates to incorporate the possible within-treatment group correlation associated with stratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial organization</title><sec><title>Ethical approval and trial status</title><p>Ethical approval has been granted by St. Vincent&#x02019;s Human Research Ethics Committee for this trial (ethics reference: 11/125).
