Hence, early implementation of effective preventive strategies in nulliparous continent women is essential, including pelvic floor muscle training. An initial evaluation based on the bioelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) during whole-body vibration (WBV) would help to devise the best individualized training for prevention of stress urinary incontinence in woman. We hypothesized that synchronous WBV enhances bioelectrical activity of the PFM which depends on vibration frequency and peak-to-peak vibration displacement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The sample consisted of 36 nulliparous continent women randomly allocated to three comparative groups. Group I and II subjects participated in synchronous whole-body vibrations on a vibration platform; the frequency and peak-to-peak displacement of vibration were set individually for each group. Control participants performed exercises similar to those used in the study groups but without the concurrent application of vibrations. Pelvic floor surface electromyography (sEMG) activity was recorded using a vaginal probe during three experimental trials limited to 30s, 60s and 90s. The mean amplitude and variability of the signal were normalized to the Maximal Voluntary Contraction &#x02013; MVC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Friedman&#x02019;s two-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in the mean normalized amplitudes (%MVC) of the sEMG signal from the PFM during 60s- and 90s-trials between the group exposed to high-intensity WBV and control participants (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

Exercises on a vibration platform have been used in the treatment of patients with non-specific chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], hemiplegia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and in children with cerebral palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some researchers also report on the use of mechanical vibration for neuromuscular stimulation of weakened pelvic floor muscles (PFM) in women with stress urinary incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Mechanical vibration of a human skeletal muscle induces a tonic reflex contraction which is termed a tonic vibration reflex (TVR). TVR is a result of repeated, fast and short extension of a musculotendinous unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Stimulation of the endings of myelinated Ia fibres resulting from a change in the length of neuromuscular spindles causes activation of &#x003b1;-motoneurons in the spinal cord; consequently, the muscle contracts. Additionally, mechanical oscillations mask short-latency phasic spinal reflexes by increasing presynaptic inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Muscle activity is frequently analysed using surface electromyography (sEMG). EMG records and quantifies the electrical activity generated by muscle fibers. Depolarisation and repolarisation of the surface membrane of muscle fibers is the source of the electrical potential changes detected. Auchincloss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] demonstrated between-trial reliability of EMG data recorded from the PFM using two different vaginal probes with the subjects performing two tasks (Maximal Voluntary Contraction MVC and coughing). Some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] emphasize the need for the elimination of vibration-induced motion artifacts from raw EMG data using digital band-stop filters. Ritzmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], on the other hand, argue that the effect of motion artifacts on EMG recording is insignificant; the periodic spikes in EMG signal during whole-body vibration are not motion artifacts, but rather stretch reflex.</p><p>Whole-body vibrations induce an increase in myoelectric activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Bioelectrical muscle activity depends on several factors and among these vibration frequency and peak-to-peak vibration displacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], initial position in a given exercise and related initial muscle extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], anatomical location of the investigated muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], vibration type (sinusoidal vs stochastic vibration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and additional load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The pelvic floor muscles have typical striated fibers, specific function and characteristic location; they are characterized by synchronous and harmonic contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and prolonged tension (except for micturition and defecation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Women with stress urinary incontinence frequently exhibit weakening of the pelvic floor muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The aim of therapeutic interventions in women with stress urinary incontinence and weakened pelvic floor muscles is to enhance muscular power so that they would be able to quickly and intensively contract these muscles to prevent involuntary urine loss in case intra-abdominal pressure should increase rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>More and more frequently stress urinary incontinence affects young healthy women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, early implementation of effective preventive strategies in nulliparous continent women is essential, including pelvic floor muscle training. There is scientific basis for hypothesizing about beneficial effects of mechanical vibration on the pelvic floor muscles in continent as well as incontinent subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, such hypotheses require verification.</p><p>Previous studies had demonstrated differential effect of the sinusoidal and stochastic whole-body vibration, with the superiority of stochastic vibration especially pronounced in subjects with impaired PFMs function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, Luginbuehl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found no significant change in the PFM activity during continuous or intermittent stochastic resonance whole-body vibration.</p><p>Literature review yields numerous reports on the effect of vibration on maximum strength and power enhancement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; however, the findings of these studies are not unequivocal. The discrepancies probably result from divergence in whole-body vibration training protocols. There is no evidence based on neurophysiological investigations regarding the values of vibration parameters which would produce the optimum effect in the neuromuscular system.</p><p>An increase in the activity of striated muscle during WBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] indicates that similar effects might be expected for the pelvic floor muscles.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate bioelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscles during synchronous low- and high-intensity whole-body vibration in three trials. Another aim was to assess pelvic floor muscle fatigue during 90s whole-body vibration. The study participants were young continent women. An evaluation based on the performance and bioelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscles during whole-body vibration would help to devise the best individualized training for prevention of stress urinary incontinence in woman. It would also facilitate the understanding of the effect of whole-body vibration on muscle performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>This was a randomized, controlled, 3 parallel-group study among thirty-six nulliparous continent women.

Therefore center stratification and dispersion measure were best assessed with the arithmetic mean and standard deviation. We assumed the probability of a type I error a&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, target power of 1-beta&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80 and a 25&#x000a0;% minimum significant difference between the means of parameters studied. The resultant minimum sample size was 10 patients. The target sample size was 36; 6 additional participants were to be recruited to account for dropouts (due to artifact signals of sEMG). The actual sample size was 33. The study participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups (Group I &#x02013; 12; Group II &#x02013; 10, and Group III &#x02013; 11). Simple randomization technique was used in the experiment. The main coordinator who allocated the participants to groups had opaque, sealed envelopes, each containing a piece of paper marked with either group I, II or III. The physician selected and opened an envelope in the presence of a physiotherapist to see the symbol and then directed the participant to the corresponding group.</p><p>sEMG recordings of three women (two from group II and one from group III) were excluded from analysis due to artifact signals. Group I and II subjects participated in synchronous whole-body vibrations on a vibration platform; the frequency and peak-to-peak displacement of vibration were set individually for each group, i.e. 2&#x000a0;mm/20&#x000a0;Hz for group I and 4&#x000a0;mm/40&#x000a0;Hz for group II. In order to show a wider range of possible muscle reactions, specific combinations of low and high intensity parameters, available with the used platform, were applied. Control participants (group III) performed exercises similar to those used in the study groups but without the concurrent application of vibrations. The control participants assumed the same static position, which was standing with their knees and hips joints flexed to 35&#x000b0; while their arms were stretched horizontally in front to hold the railing. Hence, their position was the same as that assumed by group I and II subjects exercising on the vibration platform. Three static exercise trials of 30s, 60s and 90s were performed in a randomized order.</p><p>The study design is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The measurements were taken in the morning hours to minimize the impact of fatigue. The subjects were asked not to take up intensive physical exercises 24&#x000a0;h before the measurement. Temperature in the examination room was 24&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The measurements were performed under standard testing conditions, the same for all subjects.</p><p>sEMG was recorded using Myo Trace 400 (Noraxon U.S.A. Inc.) with a preamplifier (band pass filter 20&#x000a0;Hz&#x02013;500&#x000a0;Hz, Common Mode Rejection Ratio of &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;dB at 60&#x000a0;Hz, input impedance &#x0003e;100 M&#x02126;, amplifier gain 500). A 16-bit analog to digital (A/D) converter with an anti-aliasing filter set to 500&#x000a0;Hz frequency was also used.</p><p>Pelvic floor sEMG activity was recorded using a small diameter vaginal probe with two metal sensors (Everyway Medical Instruments Co). The probe was inserted using a small amount of antiallergic lubricant with the sensors positioned laterally in the vagina. Vaginal electrode placement was checked during breaks between the consecutive measurement sessions. After cleansing the skin site with an alcohol swab, the reference surface electrode was placed over the right anterior superior iliac spine (round self-adhesive electrode; silver/silver chloride) in accordance with SENIAM recommendations (Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non- Invasive Assessment of Muscles) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. sEMG cables were fixed on the skin with tape in order to avoid artifacts.</p><p>Prior to the measurements, the participants were asked to urinate a full void.

Test participants were in a static position during the exercises. Briefly, each subject was asked to stand on the platform, loading their feet uniformly, with the knee and hip joints bent at 35&#x000b0; and the upper extremities stretched horizontally forwards, holding on to a railing. The ranges of flexion of the hip and knee joints were measured with a goniometer to ensure the subjects maintained the required position. The above mentioned position is quite safe as knee flexion reduces the amount of vibration that reaches the head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. No unintended effects were observed during WBV in group I and II.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Testing procedure</title><p>The experiment consisted of two phases: 1/ the maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) procedure to recruit pelvic floor muscles and 2/ three static exercise trials (30s, 60s, 90s) performed in a randomized order to determine PFM activity during (groups I, II) or without (group III) WBV.</p><p>During the first phase, each participant was instructed to perform MVC of the pelvic floor muscles as forcefully as possible for about 5&#x000a0;s. Three attempts were made with 60-s rests between each contraction to reduce the effect of muscle fatigue. During MVCs verbal encouragement was provided. MVCs were used as reference values.</p><p>The MVC procedure to recruit pelvic floor muscles: supine lying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; the hip and knee were positioned at 30&#x000b0; and 90&#x000b0; of flexion, respectively. The positions were controlled with the goniometer.</p><p>During the second phase, all group I and II participants were exposed to WBV during three exercise trials applied at random order. Vibration exposure during a single trial was limited to 30s, 60s and 90s (up to 5&#x000a0;s were allowed for the vibration platform to reach its preset peak-to-peak displacement and frequency). A 10-min rest period was used between trials in order to eliminate any potential fatigue; the subjects were blinded to WBV frequency and peak-to-peak displacement. sEMG signal from the pelvic floor muscles was recorded during static position maintained on a vibrating platform. During the 30-s, 60-s and 90-s sEMG recording the following parameters were measured: mean amplitude (% MVC) and variability of the signal (the variability of data around the mean value of the selected period of the analysis, expressed as %MVC).</p><p>The mean amplitude as well as the mean and median frequency of the sEMG signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] were additionally measured to determine the effect of fatigue during the 90-s sEMG recordings. The analysis was performed for two subperiods, ie., from the 6<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> seconds and from the 86<sup>th</sup> to the 90<sup>th</sup> seconds. The initial subperiod (5&#x000a0;s) in which the vibration platform had not reached its preset peak-to-peak displacement and frequency was excluded from analysis. Percentage changes in the mean and median frequency and mean amplitude were calculated using the formula for the difference of two subperiods. Five 1-s intervals of both subperiods yielded five values of the variables under analysis.</p><p>The raw sEMG data were full wave rectified. Root mean square values were calculated using a 100&#x000a0;ms sliding window.

The reliability of repeated surface electromyography of the pelvic floor muscles was confirmed in young continent women based on the analysis of the resting, mean and peak amplitudes, time before peak and area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Literature reports fail to provide consistent guidelines regarding whole-body vibration parameters. Torvinen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] emphasized the significance of appropriate frequency and amplitude selection. Using a variety of vibration protocols, the investigators demonstrated beneficial effects with respect to muscle strength and jump height after just one intervention type. The importance of appropriate parameter selection has been confirmed in the present experiment. The mean of the normalized sEMG activity of the pelvic floor muscles was significantly higher during high-intensity whole-body vibration (40&#x000a0;Hz, 4&#x000a0;mm) in the 60- and 90-sec tests compared to the control (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Low-intensity whole-body vibration did not result in significant changes in the mean sEMG amplitude of the pelvic floor muscles between the study and control groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). Similar results were published by Lauper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Low-intensity whole body sinusoidal vibrations (5Hz/2mm, 5Hz/4mm,15Hz/2mm) applied in standing with slightly flexed knee joint did not enhance the activity of the pelvic floor muscles compared to standing with no vibration. A significant increase in the normalized EMG signal amplitude from the pelvic floor muscles was still observed at the combination of 15Hz/4mm.</p><p>Based on literature review, Luo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] recommend that in order to activate the muscle most effectively, vibration frequency should be in the range of 30&#x02013;50&#x000a0;Hz. This is consistent with our results; vibrations of 40&#x000a0;Hz resulted in an increase in the mean activity of the pelvic floor muscles.</p><p>Increased muscle activation during whole-body vibration is mainly attributed to the tonic vibration reflex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Stretching of musculotendinous units during exercise on a vibration platform causes frequency-dependent stimulation of neuromuscular spindles and, consequently, changes in the EMG signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. An increase in muscle activity observed in EMG recordings results from the recruitment of a large number of motor units and high firing rates of thereof. According to Krol et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], increased signal of the rmsEMG obtained while higher amplitude of vibration was applied (ie., 4&#x000a0;mm vs 2&#x000a0;mm) might be associated with faster and greater stretching of the muscle. The increase in muscle activity with increasing frequency of vibration at the same amplitude may be associated with higher rates of stretching.</p><p>Neuromuscular response to mechanical vibration also depends on the anatomical location of the muscle. Exercises performed on a vibration platform in the standing position cause an increase in bioelectrical activity, and especially in the muscles that have a distal location in the lower limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the course of the transmission of mechanical vibrations in human tissues, the intensity of the vibration is reduced due to the damping properties which are defined as any effect that tends to decrease the amplitude of oscillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The damping effect has been attributed to joint kinematics (in particular, ankle and knee joints), muscle tuning mechanism, the sensitivity of skin receptors, viscoelastic elements and passive soft tissue and bony constraints, eg. bones, cartilage and synovial fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Pollock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] demonstrated that vibration of 30&#x000a0;Hz/5.5&#x000a0;mm applied during standing with knee flexion (15.1&#x000b0;+/&#x02212;4.8&#x000b0;) resulted in only 2.7&#x000a0;% of WBV acceleration being transmitted from the big toe to the head, which could be attributed to the damping effect. Above the knee at frequencies&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;Hz, acceleration decreased with distance from the platform. It may be, that the big distance between the pelvic floor muscles and the platform as well as low vibration parameters (20&#x000a0;Hz, 2&#x000a0;mm) caused the absence of changes in the mean activity of the pelvic floor muscles during low-intensity WBV in our experiment.</p><p>Stress urinary incontinence affects women during and after menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], after vaginal delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], hysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], sportswomen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], but also - more and more frequently - young healthy women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, early implementation of effective preventive strategies is essential, including pelvic floor muscle training. A significantly higher activation of the pelvic floor muscles during vibration of 40&#x000a0;Hz and peak-to-peak displacement of 4&#x000a0;mm in a group of young women seems to provide an argument for the use of some elements of high-intensity vibration training in the prevention of stress urinary incontinence.</p><p>However, the knowledge on the use of vibration training in the treatment of this condition remains unsatisfactory. S&#x000f8;nksen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] carried out a pilot study to investigate the effect of perineal transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation (frequency 100&#x000a0;Hz and amplitude 2&#x000a0;mm) on the severity of stress urinary incontinence symptoms. Perineal transcutaneous nerve stimulation performed weekly for 6&#x000a0;weeks reduced the daily number of incontinence episodes and pad use. Seventy-three per cent of the patients reported complete resolution of stress incontinence symptoms. Lauper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] examined differences in pelvic floor muscle activation depending on the type of whole-body vibrations, ie., sinusoidal vibration and stochastic resonance vibration. The latter led to a significantly higher activation than maximum voluntary contraction, especially in post partum women with weakened pelvic floor muscles. However, in the study of Luginbuehl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] there was no significant change in PFM activity over time during stochastic resonance in women with self-reported stress urinary incontinence.</p><p>Briefly, each subject was asked to stand on the platform, loading their feet uniformly, with the knee and hip joints bent at 35&#x000b0; and the upper extremities stretched horizontally forwards, holding on to a railing.</p><p>With an increase in trial duration, both the study and control groups exhibited a significant decrease in the variability of sEMG signal amplitude from the pelvic floor muscles (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Body alignment for static exercise, with the knees flexed to 35&#x000b0; and upper limbs stretched out forwards, is a rarely assumed, unnatural and uncomfortable position. Balance control during body sway from the vertical position requires precise neuromuscular coordination and the involvement of various structures of the central and peripheral nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It may be that a 30&#x000a0;s trial was not enough for the controller (nervous system) and responder (locomotor system) to coordinate and stabilize their actions in a nontypical body position. Since our findings revealed a decrease in the variability of sEMG signal amplitude with longer trials, we believe that an analysis of bioelectrical activity of muscles during whole-body vibration should be based on longer vibration times.</p><p>In order to assess measurement variability, Grape et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] calculated the standard error of measurement. The variability between two sEMG sessions carried out on the same day with 30&#x000a0;min apart was smaller compared to the third performer 26&#x02013;30 days later. However, due to the lack of normalization, a comparison between Grape et al.&#x02019;s and our results is not possible.</p><p>EMG-fatigue slopes provide a non-invasive and standardized method to estimate neuromuscular fatigability of skeletal muscles. Mean and median frequency and the amplitude of EMG signal are among the parameters of the complete power range used in the assessment of muscle fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A 450-s contraction of the biceps brachii at 25&#x000a0;% MVC resulted in a decrease of median and mean frequency and an increase in mean amplitude thus confirming the development of muscle fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In our young and continent participants, 90&#x000a0;s vibration did not cause pelvic floor muscle fatigue. A single 90&#x000a0;s vibration session in young healthy women was probably not sufficient to cause pelvic floor muscle fatigue. Nevertheless, the question requires further investigations.</p><p>An analysis of raw pelvic floor EMG data revealed significantly lower values of absolute mean amplitude and mean and median frequency in women with weakened pelvic floor muscles compared to healthy participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The authors believe that such results are due to decreased muscle fiber recruitment and synchronization and low muscle strength and power in postpartum women. Luginbuehl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] demonstrated no significant change in the value of amplitude and median frequency of the EMG during stochastic resonance whole body vibration. According to the authors, it can be due to a no more than moderate to submaximal PFM activity during stochastic resonance whole body vibration.</p><p>Pelvic floor muscle fatigue has been investigated by several other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

Also, we could not compare the results with incontinent women as no comparison group had been formed.
