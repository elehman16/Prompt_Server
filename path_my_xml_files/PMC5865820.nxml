A total of 40 hybrid piglets (Landrace &#x000d7; Large White &#x000d7; Duroc) born to 40 different sows, with similar body weight were selected for the present study. They were randomly divided into two groups (n=20 per group): Control group (suckling piglets) and experimental group (weaned piglets, reared in isolation). The experiment lasted for 10 days. At the end of the experiment, 12 piglets were randomly selected from each group and the jejunum and the ileum were collected in order to determine excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) expression levels and free amino acid content. The present study determined that early weaning significantly reduced EAAC1 gene and protein (57 and 73 kDa) expression levels and glutamate transporter associate protein 3&#x02013;18 (GTRAP3-18; 50 kDa) in the jejunum and the ileum compared with the suckling group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Weaning led to an increased content of free glutamic acid (Glu) and total amino acids in the jejunum; however, content of free Glu and total amino acids in the ileum was significantly reduced (P&#x0003c;0.05). Early weaning reduced the expression of EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18, which was possibly due to the amino acid absorption and transport disorder in the small intestine due to the Glu deficiency.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>piglet</kwd><kwd>weaning</kwd><kwd>excitatory amino acid transporter 1</kwd><kwd>small intestine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glutamic acid (Glu) is an important source of energy in the mucosa and the conditionally essential amino acid in early weaned piglets (<xref rid="b1-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Glu has an important function in the growth and repair of intestinal mucosa. The absorption of Glu in the intestine requires specific transporters. Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are Na+-dependent high-affinity Glu transporters (<xref rid="b2-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), that maintain the Glu balance of the nervous system. Excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) belongs to EAAT family and its transport rate is ~10 times of that of other transporters in the nervous system (<xref rid="b3-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). EAAC1 is also expressed in other non-nervous tissues such as the small intestine. EAAC1 expression is negatively regulated by glutamate transporter associate protein 3&#x02013;18 (GTRAP3-18). In various types of human cancer and epilepsy, GTRAP3-18 inhibits Glu transport via EAAC1 by binding to the C-terminal of EAAC1, leading to Glu poisoning in the nervous system (<xref rid="b4-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It is of note that, GTRAP3-18 may bind specifically to EAAC1 although not to other EAATs (<xref rid="b5-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). EAAC1 expression is associated with the expression of GTRAP3-18. Previous studies have focused on EAAC1 in the nervous system as opposed to the intestine (<xref rid="b6-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A previous study determined that deletion of the <italic>EAAC1</italic> gene may lead to the loss of age-dependent dopaminergic neurons and an increase in oxidative stress in mice (<xref rid="b8-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In patients with Alzheimer's disease, abnormal EAAC1 accumulation was located in the hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="b9-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Fu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b10-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) cloned the jejunal EAAC1 protein in suckling piglets and investigated the dynamic changes of EAAC1 protein expression, which was low in the ileum of piglets with low birth weight (<xref rid="b10-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These previous findings imply that EAAC1 expression may be associated with abnormal development or the stress and disease status of the piglets. Low EAAC1 expression may reduce the transport rate of Glu and impair development and absorption function of the mucosa in piglets (<xref rid="b10-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Weaning induces stress piglet stress and the uptake of maternal Glu is interrupted. The present study aimed to investigate the changes of the expression levels of EAAC1 and its regulatory protein GTRAP3-18 in the jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets. The effect of weaning on EAAC1 expression was analyzed; therefore, providing insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of intestinal mucosa repair and potential measures that may be implemented in order to improve the growth performance of weaned piglets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Grouping and feeding management</title><p>The experiment was performed at Pig Breeding Demonstration Base (Qiqihar, China) in May 2010. A total of 40 hybrid piglets (Landrace &#x000d7; Large White &#x000d7; Duroc) born to 40 different sows, with similar body weight were selected. A single-factor experiment design was adopted. The piglets were randomly divided into two groups (n=20 per group): Control group (suckling piglets) and experimental group (weaned piglets, reared in isolation). The experiment continued for 10 days once the piglets were 10 days old.</p><p>The suckling piglets were reared by sows in the piglet house for the first 10 days of life. Following this, the weaned piglets were then reared in a nursery piglet house for a further 10 days. Weaned piglets were fed with corn-soybean meal-based starter diet for 10 days, 3 times daily (morning, noon and evening), and allowed free access to water. Each weaned piglet was fed in a separate cage and the quantity of food consumed by each weaned piglet (the feed-to-gain ratio) was calculated by weighing the amount of food originally provided and the amount of food leftover each morning. The weaned piglets were weighed on the first day they were fed separately (10 days old) and on the last day when the study was complete (20 days old). The composition and the nutrition of the basal diet are presented in <xref rid="tI-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>.</p><p>The nursery piglet house provided a closed environment with good ventilation and cement flooring. Segregated early weaning (SEW) was adopted with 1 piglet per pen. An infrared heat lamp was hung 0.8 m above the ground at the corner of the pen. The ground directly under the lamp was paved with a 0.5&#x000d7;1 m heat-absorbing pad to ensure the warmth of the piglets. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Northeast Agricultural University (Harbin, China) (approval no.

Piglets were sedated and maintained under anesthesia by inhalation of 8% anesthetic isoflurane via a facial mask. The abdominal cavity was opened to harvest the jejunum and ileum, which were washed with ice-cold normal saline. Samples were collected from the middle of the intestine and preserved in liquid nitrogen, as previously described (<xref rid="b5-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The samples were ground with liquid nitrogen to powder using a mortar and subsequently preserved at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. At the end of tissue sampling, piglets were euthanized via an intra-cardiac injection of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (Schering-Plough Canada, Inc., Pointe-Claire, QC, Canada) (<xref rid="b11-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Cryopreserved homogenate small intestine sample weighing ~1.3 g was used and mixed with homogenate buffer (50 mM D-mannitol, 10 mM HEPES and 2.0 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;ml-1 each of aprotinin, leupetin, pepstatin A, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl-ketone, N-a-p-tosyl-L-lysine ketone and 0.20 mM PMSF, pH 7.4; all Sigma; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) at the proportion of 1 g/20 ml. Subsequently, the sample was thawed in the homogenate buffer containing the protease inhibitor. The sample was homogenized using a multi-layer homogenizer at 1,523 &#x000d7; g for 3 min at 4&#x000b0;C (with a ~20 sec pause every min). The homogenate was weighed and the total volume was recorded with 2 ml cryopreserved at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. The endoplasm sample was prepared by Mg2+ precipitation and differential centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C as previously described (<xref rid="b5-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The remaining endoplasm sample was used for further differential centrifugation to obtain the apical membrane of the cells. Briefly, the remaining supernatant was mixed with 1 M MgCl2 to produce 10 mM MgCl2, stirred on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C and 2,400 &#x000d7; g for 15 min. After discarding the top foam layer, the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C and 19,000 &#x000d7; g for 30 min using the Ti 55.2 rotor on a Beckman L8-55 Ultracentrifuge to generate crude apical membrane pellets. The supernatant obtained was regarded as the cytosolic fraction and sampled for protein content analyses as well as western blotting analyses of the abundance of target proteins. The crude apical membrane pellets were then suspended in 15 ml of membrane suspension buffer (300 mM D-mannitol, 25 mM HEPES and 2.0 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;ml-1 each of aprotinin, leupetin, pepstatin A, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl-ketone, N-&#x003b1;-p-tosyl-L-lysine ketone and 0.20 mM PMSF, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C and 39,000 &#x000d7; g for 30 min to generate the final apical membrane vesicle pellets.

The primers were synthesized by Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). To avoid contamination of the primers by non-specific genomic DNA, mRNA sequences from all samples were aligned against the pig genome using Spidey v0.7 software (now Splign software; <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/splign/splign.cgi">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/splign/splign.cgi</uri>). Each primer contained 2 exons. Total RNA was extracted from the samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) as previously described (<xref rid="b6-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Following digestion with DNA enzyme (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), cDNA synthesis was performed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using iQ SYBR-Green supermix (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) with total reaction volume of 25 &#x000b5;l. The procedures of reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR were as follows: RT at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 min, denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min, amplification and quantification for 45 cycles, denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 sec, annealing at 54&#x000b0;C for 15 sec, extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 15 sec; plotting of dissociation curve, 60&#x02013;99&#x000b0;C, temperature rise at 0.1&#x000b0;C/sec, with fluorescence detection. The relative expression ratio of target gene to the housekeeping gene was calculated as follows:</p><p>R=2-Cq (target gene-housekeeping gene) (<xref rid="b12-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</p><p>where R is relative expression ratio of the target gene; Cq is the quantification cycle value. Under this threshold cycle value, the target gene and the &#x003b2;-actin housekeeping gene were amplified by over 30 fluorescence units. The optimal RT-qPCR efficiency was obtained from the formula of &#x02212;1+10 (&#x02212;1/slope) with serial dilution of RNA. The efficiency was consistent for the target gene and &#x003b2;-actin. Experiments were repeated three times with three duplicates of each.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of free amino acids in the small intestine of piglets</title><p>High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed as previously described (<xref rid="b13-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Briefly, HPLC was performed using the LC-9A liquid chromatograph system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The analytical column Inertsil ODS-2 (150&#x000d7;4.6 mm ID 5lm; GL Sciences, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was fixed at 40&#x000b0;C and connected through a corresponding guard column (10&#x000d7;4.0 mm ID 5 lm; GL Sciences, Inc.) with a HPLC workstation; the flow rate of the eluate was 1.0 ml/min. All samples were injected into the column with an Auto Injector (Shimadzu Corporation). An RF-530 fluorescence spectromonitor (Shimadzu Corporation) was used with excitation and emission set at 380 and 510 nm, respectively. The signals from the detector were recorded on a Chromatopac C-R4A (Shimadzu Corporation). O-phthalaldehyde was used as an internal standard.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The protein expression levels were expressed relative to the expression levels of the EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18 genes. The protein blots were scanned and analyzed using Quantity One software v19.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The optical density was calculated. The relative expression of the target protein was characterized as the optical density ratio of the target gene to &#x003b2;-actin. One-way analysis of variance was performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data were expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

Daily weight gain following weaning is an important apparent indicator of the piglet's growth. If the daily weight gain does not change considerably after weaning as compared with the suckling piglets, this means that the daily diet had sufficient nutrients for the piglets and they have adapted to weaning with normal intestinal development. However, in practice, ~10% of the weaned piglets die from physiological stress of two major sources, the change of the external environment and abnormal intestinal mucosa development due to a novel feeding diet. Weaning may induce changes of gastrointestinal functions and affects the regulation of gut-brain axis (<xref rid="b16-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The quantity of feed consumed by the piglets frequently decreases following weaning due to changes in nutrition and environment. The gastrointestinal tract is underdeveloped in piglets and weaning may lead to a decline in their growth performance. In the present study, the piglets in SEW treatment group exhibited signs of weaning-associated stress. The daily feeding quantity was 148.5 g, which was lower compared with the standard of 240 g/day in the requirements of swine from the National Research Council (NRC). Additionally, the daily weight gain of the weaned piglets was significantly lower compared with the suckling piglets of the same age (P&#x0003c;0.001). Gu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b17-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) determined that weaning-associated stress may lead to significant structural and functional changes of the intestine, thus affecting the normal growth of piglets.</p><p>EAAC1 is a crucial Glu transporter with wide distribution in the entire cell body. A previous study (<xref rid="b6-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) focused on Glu transport by EAAC1 in the central nervous system as opposed to the intestinal mucosa of piglets. The present study detected the EAAC1 protein and mRNA expression levels were significantly reduced in the intestine of weaned piglets compared with the suckling piglets. Watabe <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b18-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) revealed that GTRAP3-18 was a negative regulator of EAAC1 and intracellular glutathione content using HEK293 cells (<xref rid="b18-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Additionally, GTRAP3-18 had a sequential impact on the susceptibility to oxidative stress. Differentiation, heat stress and oxidative stress may also lead to the separation of GTRAP3-18 protein (<xref rid="b6-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This involves the upregulation of GTRAP3-18 protein or mRNA expression in response to oxidative stress. The present study determined that early weaning reduced the protein and mRNA expression of GTRAP3-18 in piglets, which was contrary to the response to heat and oxidative stress. In order to manage the increased stress, the piglets require more Glu from their daily diet for intestinal mucosa repair. The findings of a previous study revealed that the increased efficiency of Glu uptake may led to the downregulation of GTRAP3-18 protein expression levels (<xref rid="b18-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Increased Glu content in the jejunum led to reduced GTRAP3-18 protein expression in the jejunum, which was in accordance with previous findings by Lin <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b19-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, the Glu content and GTRAP3-18 expression in the ileum was reduced in weaned piglets. The function of GTRAP3-18 in stress and disease of piglets remains to be fully elucidated (<xref rid="b5-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Glu is the excitatory amino acid transported by EAAC1. The present study determined that weaning led to a reduction in the content of free amino acids in the ileum and an increase of free amino acids in the jejunum of the weaned piglets. Previous studies revealed that EAAC1 was primarily expressed in the jejunum (<xref rid="b20-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and the efficiency of Glu transmembrane transport in the intestine was regulated by EAAC1 (<xref rid="b21-mmr-16-05-6518" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the Glu transport efficiency was increased in the jejunum of weaned piglets in order to compensate for the reduced Glu uptake. In the meantime, EAAC1 was consumed and the EAAC1 expression was reduced. Conversely, the EAAC1 expression in the ileum was reduced, leading to lower Glu transport efficiency. The content of free Glu in the ileum was reduced in the weaned piglets compared with the suckling piglets. It is of note that the Glu content is not solely determined by transport, but also by the Glu-Gln cycle.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study determined that EAAC1 expression was reduced in the jejunum of the weaned piglets and the consumed EAAC1 was associated with the increased transport of Glu in the jejunum of the weaned piglets. Therefore, the content of amino acids such as Glu was increased in the jejunum. This was accompanied by the reduced expression of GTRAP3-18, the regulator of EAAC1. As EAAC1 expression was downregulated in the ileum of the weaned piglets, the Glu transport rate was reduced, leading to reduction of amino acid content, such as Glu in the ileum.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The present study was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant no. 2013M531011) and the Heilongjiang Province Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos.
