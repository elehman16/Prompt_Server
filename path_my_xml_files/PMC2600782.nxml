Two trials have shown that a high perioperative inspiratory oxygen fraction (Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>= 0.80) significantly reduced risk of surgical site infections after elective colorectal surgery, but a third trial was stopped early because the frequency of surgical site infections was more than doubled in the group receiving Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>= 0.80. It has not been settled if a high inspiratory oxygen fraction increases the risk of pulmonary complications, such as atelectasis, pneumonia and respiratory failure. The aim of our trial is to assess the potential benefits and harms of a high perioperative oxygen fraction in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The PROXI-Trial is a randomized, patient- and assessor blinded trial of perioperative supplemental oxygen in 1400 patients undergoing acute or elective laparotomy in 14 Danish hospitals. Patients are randomized to receive either 80% oxygen (Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>= 0.80) or 30% oxygen (Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>= 0.30) during surgery and for the first 2 postoperative hours. The primary outcome is surgical site infection within 14 days. The secondary outcomes are: atelectasis, pneumonia, respiratory failure, re-operation, mortality, duration of postoperative hospitalization, and admission to intensive care unit. The sample size allows detection of a 33% relative risk reduction in the primary outcome with 80% power.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial assesses benefits and harms of a high inspiratory oxygen fraction, and the trial may be generalizable to a general surgical population undergoing laparotomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00364741.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Surgical site infection is a common and serious complication after abdominal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is essential to optimize perioperative conditions because the first hours following bacterial contamination are critical for establishing the wound infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Wound oxygen tension is often low at the end of surgery and this is unfortunate, because bacterial eradication depends on this factor <italic>via </italic>oxidative killing by neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The incidence of surgical site infections may therefore be reduced by increasing the perioperative arterial oxygen tension through increased inspiratory oxygen fraction.</p><p>Before we initiated our multicenter trial "PeRioperative OXygen Fraction &#x02013; effect on surgical site Infection and pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery" (PROXI), we undertook a meta-analysis on trials comparing the effect of perioperative inhaled oxygen fraction of 0.80 with 0.30 on the frequency of surgical site infection. This was performed using the trial sequential analysis method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and in accordance with international recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>When searching MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE (search terms, see Appendix) four clinical trials including 1003 patients were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In a random-effects model, the overall pooled effect of an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.80 was a reduction of the occurrence of surgical site infections. The relative risk reduction was 19% [95% CI: -68% to 61%], P = 0.57, but a large heterogeneity, I<sup>2 </sup>= 74%, was also found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This may primarily be explained by the findings in one trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], in which the high oxygen fraction was associated with an increase in the frequency of surgical site infection of 122% [95% CI: 8% to 458%]. In that trial, however, mixtures of oxygen and nitrous oxide were given, the surgical site infections were assessed retrospectively by chart review, and the allocation was not fully concealed.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Meta-analysis comparing perioperative inspiratory oxygen fractions of 0.80 and 0.30/0.35 on surgical site infection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-9-58-1"/></fig><p>When inspired in a high concentration, oxygen may result in pulmonary complications, but although 1003 patients have participated in the previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], this important question has been studied only in 30 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This subgroup of patients from the first trial of supplemental oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] underwent pulmonary function test together with chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans on the day after surgery. A high oxygen fraction was not found to be associated with significant changes in any test, but CT-determined atelectasis tended to be more common in patients receiving 80% oxygen (94% vs. 64%, P = 0.12). Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 5 minutes has also been associated with increased risk of atelectasis formation when compared to 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A high oxygen fraction has also been related to harms such as an increased risk of airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], poor regulation of blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], changes in the cardiac index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and to benefits such as improved healing of colorectal anastomosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and reduced frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>We designed the PROXI-Trial to assess the potential benefits and harms of a high perioperative oxygen fraction in patients undergoing laparotomy, the primary end point being surgical site infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>The PROXI-Trial is an ongoing, randomized, parallel group, multicenter, patient- and assessor blinded trial, launched on October 9, 2006. The trial is investigator initiated and controlled. The primary aim is to assess the effect of a high perioperative oxygen fraction on the frequency of surgical site infection in patients undergoing laparotomy. The secondary outcome measures are: atelectasis, pneumonia, respiratory failure, re-operation, mortality, duration of postoperative hospitalization, and admission to intensive care unit. Fourteen anaesthesia and surgical centres as well as one trial unit in Denmark participate in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients, aged 18 years or older, scheduled for acute or elective laparotomy are eligible for inclusion. When the laparotomy is indicated for a gynaecological disease, only patients with suspected malignancy (defined as risk of ovarian malignancy index &#x0003e;200 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or a specimen showing atypical or neoplastic cells) are included.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The exclusion criteria are: Surgery performed under general anaesthesia within 30 days, chemotherapy for malignancy within 3 months, inability to give informed consent, and preoperative arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation below 90% assessed by pulse oximetry without supplemental oxygen.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The patients are randomized 1:1 by a central interactive voice-response system at the Copenhagen Trial Unit to ensure adequate allocation concealment. A computer generated randomization sequence with variable block size is used with the following stratification variables: Centre, diabetes mellitus, acute or elective surgery, and body mass index (&#x0003c;30 or &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>After induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation, patients randomized into the supplemental oxygen group are given an inspiratory oxygen fraction (Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>) of 0.80 until end of surgery. Patients are administered a Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>of 0.80 during the first two hours following extubation by means of a non-rebreathing face mask with a reservoir (High Concentration Oxygen Mask, Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, UK) with a flow of 14 litres of oxygen and 2 litres of air per minute. This mixture of oxygen and air contains a slightly higher oxygen fraction (0.901), because even the manufacturer's test resulted in only 85% delivered oxygen in a situation with masks fully sealed to a flat surface and 15 litres of oxygen per minute (Intersurgical Test Report, April 2008). With an estimated flow of ambient air into the mask of approximately 3.0 litres per minute, we estimate that the chosen mask and mixture delivers a Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>close to 0.80. This was confirmed in a test before the trial was initiated.</p><p>The patients randomized into the control group are given a Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>of 0.30 after tracheal intubation and until extubation, after which they receive a flow of 2 litres of oxygen and 14 litres of air per minute through a non-rebreathing facemask with reservoir (High Concentration Oxygen Mask, Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, UK).</p><p>In both groups, it is allowed to increase Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>if hypoxia is detected or suspected in order to keep the arterial oxygen saturation above 94% and the arterial oxygen tension above 9 kPa. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used at a level chosen by the attending anaesthetist. At the end of the intervention period, oxygen is administrated only at the physician's discretion and according to usual clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Cardboard shields are placed on the side of the anaesthesia machines to keep the surgical team blinded to group allocation. In the post anaesthesia care unit, opaque bags cover the flow meters. Information about perioperative Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>, arterial oxygen partial pressure (Pa<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>) as well as flow of oxygen and air is collected on a separate paper form, placed in a sealed opaque envelope when patients are discharged from the post anaesthesia care unit. Any urgency requiring opening of the envelope will be reported. The patients are not informed of their group allocation during the trial or follow-up.</p><p>Patients are asked after follow-up which group they believe they were allocated to in order to evaluate patient blinding and the possible related bias in the reporting of adverse events. If patients answer supplemental oxygen or control group, they are asked to indicate why.</p><p>The Steering Committee is also blinded and has no access to patient allocation during the trial. An independent statistician will analyze the PROXI data under code (treatment A and B) and prepare a blinded version of the results. All sections of the manuscript, including the discussion and conclusion, will be written in two versions; one assuming treatment A is supplemental oxygen and treatment B is control treatment, and another manuscript based on the reverse assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. All authors must approve both versions before demasking the allocation groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Standard treatment</title><p>After preoxygenation, anaesthesia is induced with propofol or thiopental supplemented with remifentanil, fentanyl, sufentanil, or alfentanil and maintained with propofol, sevoflurane, or desflurane. The use of nitrous oxide is not allowed. Tracheal intubation is facilitated with succinylcholine or an intermediate acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. Both groups are given a Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>of 1.0 until tracheal intubation and again immediately before extubation. The patients are ventilated to assure normocapnia (defined as an arterial carbon dioxide tension of 4.5 to 6.0 kPa if arterial blood sampling is carried out, otherwise capnography is used to adjust ventilation).</p><p>Several important elements of the perioperative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] are stressed in the trial protocol (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The protocol recommends cefuroxime 1.5 g and metronidazole 1.0 g given intravenously as standard antibiotic choice, but we define appropriate antibiotic therapy according to Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] because of the high number of surgical procedures. Antibiotic therapy must be given within 60 minutes of skin incision, and we consider 'timely administration' to be fulfilled if the first and second antibiotic is given before skin incision.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol for perioperative care of patients undergoing laparotomy.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Protocol element</td><td align="left">Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><underline>Preoperative:</underline></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Bowel preparation</td><td align="left">No routine oral preparation used for colonic resection.*</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fasting guideline</td><td align="left">Allowed to drink clear fluids 2 hours before anaesthesia.*</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><underline>Perioperative:</underline></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Epidural analgesia</td><td align="left">Placed at thoracic level corresponding to the incision in elective procedures and used intraoperatively.*</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fluid therapy</td><td align="left">A preoperative deficit in acute surgery corrected preoperatively, but no routine fluid preload used.

This score (range 0&#x02013;70) combines wound appearance the first 5 postoperative days with additional surgical treatment and a score higher than 20 indicates wound infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Patients presenting with symptoms of pulmonary complications are examined according to routine clinical practice by the attending physician, including chest radiographs or CT, when relevant.

Only the primary and secondary outcomes and serious adverse events will be compared statistically.

According to the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines for analyses of randomized clinical trials of medicinal products N<underline>o</underline> 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] univariate analyses will be carried out for all outcome measures. In multivariate analyses, the intervention effects will be adjusted by the following covariates being the stratification variables: centre, diabetes mellitus, acute or elective surgery, and body mass index (&#x0003c;30 or &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) as well as the following: COPD, daily smoking, surgical incision extending above the umbilical transversal, duration of surgery, and age (&#x0003c;40 or &#x02265;40 years). All intervention effect estimates will be given with 95% confidence limits and a two-tailed P-value &#x0003c; 0.05 considered significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>We estimated the frequency of surgical site infection to be 16% in the control group. This was based on the previously reported frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the inclusion of acute laparotomies in our trial. A fixed effects meta-analysis  model showed a relative risk reduction of 25% if all 4 trials are included  and 45% if the Pryor trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] were excluded. We thus expected a relative risk reduction of 33%. We calculated that a total sample size of 1400 patients would allow us to detect or reject a difference in surgical site infection between 16% and 10.7%, with 5% type 1 error risk, 80% power, and 10% dropout.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial sequential analysis of cumulative meta-analysis</title><p>In a single trial, interim analyses increase the risk of type I error. To avoid an increase of overall type I error, monitoring boundaries can be applied to decide whether a single randomized trial could be terminated early because of the P-value being sufficiently small. Because no reason exists why the standards for a meta-analysis should be less rigorous than those for a single trial, analogous trial sequential monitoring boundaries can be applied to meta-analysis as trial sequential analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The underlying assumption for this analysis is that significance testing is performed each time a new trial is published. Trial sequential analysis depends on the quantification of the required information size. Cumulative meta-analysis of trials are at risk of producing random errors, because repetitive testing of accumulating data runs the risk of random errors and the information size requirement, analogous to the sample size of a single optimally powered clinical trial, is not met. Information size calculations were based on an assumption of a plausible relative risk reduction with an a priori relative risk reduction of 33% surgical site infections. The trial sequential analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] adjusting for repeated testing on accumulating data shows that we still lack sufficient information dependent of the Pryor trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. If all trials were included, neither the trial sequential monitoring boundary nor the traditional boundary (P &#x0003c; 0.05) were crossed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and the required heterogeneity adjusted information size is 5051 to reliably detect or reject a relative risk reduction of 33% with a type I error risk of 5% and a type II error risk of 20%. If the Pryor trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] is excluded, the cumulative meta-analysis may be conclusive adjusted for repeated significance testing in cumulative meta-analysis, as the trial sequential monitoring boundary is crossed during the second trial (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As this post hoc exclusion of one of the trials testing Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>= 0.80 vs. Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>= 0.35 may be biased, we therefore concluded, considering the result of the meta-analysis of all the trials, that there may still be an information gap of more than a thousand randomized patients. So we calculated that 1400 patients must be randomized and assessed to reliably confirm a detection or rejection of a 33% relative risk reduction of surgical site infections after abdominal surgery with Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>= 0.80 vs. Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>= 0.30.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Trial sequential analysis with a required information size of 5051</bold>.

The cumulative z-curve constructed for a random effects model as heterogeneity is 74% crosses the traditional boundary (P = 0.05) once and return to non-significant values. The cumulative z-curve never crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary.

The cumulative z-curve constructed for a fixed-effect model as heterogeneity is 0% crosses both the traditional boundary (P = 0.05) after the first trial and the trial sequential monitoring boundary during the second trial.

Primary and secondary outcome measures, occurrence of any serious adverse event and occurrence of any non-serious adverse event were presented to the DMC under blinded codes for the 2 arms of the trial.

Furthermore, potential harms from a high oxygen fraction, primarily pulmonary complications, have not been adequately assessed.</p><p>Some additional trials suggest that a high oxygen fraction in the perioperative period is beneficial. Firstly, patients undergoing nitrous oxide-free anaesthesia with 80% oxygen had fewer wound infections than patients receiving nitrous oxide-based (70% N<sub>2</sub>O, 30% oxygen) anaesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The higher oxygen concentration could have contributed significantly to this difference, because nitrous oxide may not be a risk factor for wound infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Secondly, another large trial investigating treatment of hypoxia via continuous positive airway pressure in the postoperative period also demonstrated a reduction in wound infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, even if the nitrous-oxide trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] is incorporated in the trial sequential analysis, there is still a gap of information of approximately 1500 patients to reject an intervention effect of 33% relative risk reduction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Trial sequential analysis of all trials irrespective of adjuvant inhaled gases</bold>. The effect of 80% oxygen vs. 30% oxygen on surgical site infections calculated in cumulative meta-analysis of all trials irrespective adjuvant inhaled gases (the trials by Greif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], Pryor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], Belda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], Mayzler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Myles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). The low-bias heterogeneity adjusted information size (LBHIS) is 4500 based on a relative risk reduction (RRR) suggested by the low-bias trials of 33% and a meta-analytic estimate of the frequency of surgical site infection in the control group (30% oxygen) on 14% with a type I error risk of 5% and a power of 80%. No crossing of the trial sequential monitoring boundary at any time despite P &#x0003c; 0.05 after the first trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The gap of information to reject an intervention effect of 33% relative risk reduction is approximately 1500 patients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-9-58-4"/></fig><sec><title>Strengths</title><p>Our trial is the first trial to report potential benefits as well as harms in all patients receiving supplemental oxygen. This is strengthened as a consequence of the mandatory monitoring according to the ICH-GCP standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], including adverse events.</p><p>The low-bias design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and large sample size allows us to reliably detect even smaller intervention effects than the four previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We furthermore report surgical site infections according to the CDC-criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which also consider the most severe surgical site infection; the organ/space infection.</p><p>In addition, the PROXI-Trial is the first investigation of supplemental oxygen including acute patients. Apart from higher rates of peroperative contamination, these patients may have more cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidity than elective patients and accordingly a higher risk for low local tissue oxygen partial tension, which could increase the benefit of a high oxygen fraction. On the other hand, these patients are also more prone to postoperative pulmonary complications and a potential harm of a high oxygen fraction cannot be excluded either.</p><p>We choose to include gynaecological cancer surgery, because this account for a large and increasing proportion of laparotomies, as increasing numbers of colorectal procedures are now performed laparoscopically. We believe this may strengthen the external validity of the trial and the generalizability of the trial results. Patients with benign gynaecological conditions are not considered for inclusion. This was decided because we primarily sought to include patients with a high risk of surgical site infections, thus avoiding low power to detect or reject an intervention effect. The frequency of surgical site infection is estimated to be only 2% in patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score I-II undergoing clean or clean-contaminated abdominal hysterectomy with a duration of surgery less than 2 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and 4% after abdominal hysterectomy for benign conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>The stratified randomization is used to avoid skewed allocation of patients with important prognostic factors for surgical site infection and allows us to adjust intervention effect estimates for the stratification variables (diabetes mellitus, obesity and acute surgery) with the highest power. The lack of such stratification was a major limitation in the trial by Pryor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. With stratification for center, we furthermore match the different distribution of surgical procedures in the participating hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Some important limitations must be noted. Firstly, some patients in the control group may need more than the allocated 30% oxygen in order to keep arterial oxygen saturation above 94%. However, this practice is in accordance with clinical practice and we believe such pragmatic nature of the intervention is important. Our <italic>per protocol </italic>analysis will assess if close adherence to the protocol is associated with better outcome.</p><p>Secondly, we are not able to apply all elements of the standard treatment to all patients. Timely administration of antibiotics and epidural analgesia influences postoperative outcome, but this is not possible to achieve in all patients. The antibiotic regimen is recorded to assess whether it is adequate for the given type of surgery and the most common pathogenic bacterial flora. Protocol deviations may result in a higher frequency of surgical site infection, but that may reflect clinical practice.</p><p>Thirdly, it is possible that the mixture of different surgical procedures may be associated with the risk of overlooking a beneficial effect related to specific surgical procedures, such as colorectal resections, but the type of surgery is not always known at the time of deciding the inspiratory oxygen fraction and we are aiming at elucidating the effect of a high oxygen fraction in connection with open gastroenterological procedures in general, including emergency surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We believe our pragmatic trial design increases the external validity, because the protocol is in accordance with clinical practice. We anticipate that the results of this trial may be generalizable to a general surgical population undergoing laparotomy.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>APHIS: a priori heterogeneity adjusted information size; APIS: a priori information size; ASEPSIS: <underline>a</underline>dditional treatment, <underline>s</underline>erous exudate, <underline>e</underline>rythema, <underline>p</underline>urulent exudate, <underline>s</underline>eparation of deep tissues, <underline>i</underline>solation of bacteria and duration of inpatient <underline>s</underline>tay; CDC: Center of Disease Control and prevention; CONSORT: consolidated standards of reporting trials; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CT: computed tomography; DMC: data monitoring committee; Fi<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>: inspiratory oxygen fraction; ICH-GCP: International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice; LBHIS: low-bias heterogeneity adjusted information size; NNISS: National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System; Pa<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>: arterial oxygen partial pressure; PEEP: positive end expiratory pressure; PROXI: <underline>P</underline>e<underline>r</underline>ioperative <underline>Ox</underline>ygen Fraction &#x02013; Effect on Surgical Site <underline>I</underline>nfection and Pulmonary Complications after Abdominal Surgery: a Randomized Clinical Trial; RRR: relative risk reduction; SENIC: Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control; SKS: health service classification system codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Each author has made substantial contributions to the conception and design and has been involved in the critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content.
