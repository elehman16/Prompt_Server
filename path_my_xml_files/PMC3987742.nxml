Thus, inhibition of the progression of radiological damage in RA has been documented for GCs given in addition to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> However, the relationship between short-term and long-term GC exposure and cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality in RA is still controversial.</p><p>The discussion on the side effects of GC use is still far from settled. While adverse effects of long-term GCs use, at least at high doses, are well recognised in the general population and include effects on blood pressure, insulin resistance, lipid profile, homeostasis, body weight and fat distribution,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;10</xref> the nature of unfavourable CV effects and possible modulation of effects of GCs by other processes in RA are less well known.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> Some data are available which imply that chronic GC use has no additive proatherogenic effects in the inflammatory milieu.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A systematic literature review has shown poor association between low-dose GC exposure and CV risk factors, and probably no effect on atherosclerosis in patients with RA.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> GCs may have antiatherogenic effects mediated by their anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative actions in the vessel wall, and modify the recovery from occlusive vascular events and intravascular injury.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref></p><p>However, in the scientific literature, the potential risks and benefits of GC exposure in RA have shown disparate results. Increased CV and/or mortality risk associated with the use of GCs, particularly with increasing doses, has been found in several studies,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;25</xref> while other studies have found GC use to improve CV/mortality prognosis<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> or to have no or an uncertain effect.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Diversity of outcome definitions, different stages of RA disease, GC exposure in various dosages at any time during follow-up and the potential for confounding by indication in observational cohorts make the results of the studies not fairly conclusive.</p><p>In an attempt to shed some light on the CV risk of exposure to low-dose prednisolone in early RA, we performed this study with retrieval of data from the previously conducted randomised prednisolone trial, a BARFOT (Better Anti-Rheumatic PharmacOTherapy) study.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In that trial, prednisolone 7.5&#x02005;mg/day added to the initial DMARD retarded the progression of radiographic damage after 2&#x02005;years, provided a high remission rate and was well tolerated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Adults with a diagnosis of RA according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria 1987<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and symptom duration &#x02264;12&#x02005;months were eligible for the BARFOT inception cohort study.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The design of the 2-year low-dose prednisolone multicentre open-label randomised study, nested in the BARFOT cohort, has been described in detail previously.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This trial is registered with ISRCTN <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.org">http://www.isrctn.org</ext-link>, number 20612367.

The mean (SD) daily dose of prednisolone, in those taking prednisolone, decreased from 7.2 (1.1) mg at the 2-year follow-up to 6.5 (3.6) mg at the 4-year follow-up and 4.9 (3.3) mg at the 8-year assessment.</p><p>In the NoP-group, most patients (94%) continued without prednisolone after the two study years, although prednisolone therapy was initiated and maintained over a period of more than 6&#x02005;months during the follow-up in 7/111 patients (6%), with a mean average dose (SD) of 5.2 (1.4) mg daily.</p><p>Ever usage of a biological agent throughout 10&#x02005;years of observation was evenly distributed in the treatment arms (15% of the patients in each group).</p><p>The mean (SD) BMI at the 2-year visit was similar in the two study groups, 26.2 (4.8) and 27.1 (4.4) in the P-group and the NoP-group, respectively, p=0.21. None of the enrolled patients became a smoker during the observation period. Thus, the never-smoking status throughout the study was not changed. During follow-up, the number of patients registered with hypertension increased to 33 (30%) in the P-group and to 41 patients (37%) in the NoP-group, p=0.24. Diabetes mellitus was recorded in 2 patients (2%) in the P-group versus 10 patients (9%) in the NoP-group, p=0.017, and hyperlipidaemia in 6 (5%) versus 3 patients (3%) in the respective groups, p=0.50.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>During 10&#x02005;years of observation, the total number of incident CV events was 17 of 112 patients (15%) in the P-group (7 cases of AMI, hospitalisation for angina pectoris and coronary interventions; 7 cases of ischaemic stroke and 3 of TIA), as compared with 15 of 111 patients (14%) in the NoP-group (corresponding events in 10, 3 and 2 cases), p=0.72. None of the events was fatal. Incident CV events occurred after a median of 5.4&#x02005;years (range 3&#x02013;114&#x02005;months) in the P-group and 4.9&#x02005;years (range 2&#x02013;120&#x02005;months) in the NoP-group, p=0.66.</p><p>For the entire cohort, the total follow-up time was 2041 person-years.

The estimated risk for a composite CV event, a first coronary artery event and death did not differ between patients assigned to receive prednisolone or not. However, the observed age-adjusted relative risk for a first cerebrovascular event among prednisolone treated patients was increased by about four times that among those not treated with prednisolone. It should be noticed, however, that due to the low number of events and the wide estimated rates, a clinically important CV risk in the long term in an individual patient treated with prednisolone is uncertain.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study addressing CV and survival consequences of exposure to low-dose prednisolone during 2&#x02005;years in early RA in a randomised design. It should be mentioned that a good half of those randomised to prednisolone stopped that treatment after 2&#x02005;years from baseline and that a further fourth quarter stopped after 4&#x02013;5&#x02005;years. In contrast, only a few patients who were randomised not to take prednisolone initiated prednisolone therapy during follow-up. Still, the distribution of traditional risk factors during the study period (BMI, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia) was similar in the treatment groups, which strengthens the present findings and also challenges the idea of a negative impact of prednisolone on traditional CV risk factors in patients with an inflammatory condition.</p><p>Our study is different in several important ways to previous studies in respect of the relationship between GC exposure and CV in RA and these differences make a broad comparison of the results difficult.</p><p>Based on prescription databases from the general population, Wei <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> reported an increased risk for CV disease in GC users only in doses &#x02265;7.5&#x02005;mg of prednisolone or equivalent, the relative risk being 2.56 (CI 2.18 to 2.99). Avina-Zubieta <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> determined that the current dose (13% risk increase per additional 5&#x02005;mg/day), cumulative duration of past GC use (10% risk increase for every additional year) and total cumulative dose (6% per each gram accumulated in the past) were independently associated with an increased risk of first myocardial infarction (MI) in RA cases identified through administrative data sources. In that study, GC exposure again included GCs dispensed by pharmacists at some time over the entire disease course. It should also be noted that participants using GC had a high absolute risk of the CV outcomes and, owing to the lack of direct information on individual patient characteristics, surrogate indices were applied to control for confounding by indication. In a population-based incidence RA cohort, Davis <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> reported that, overall, a higher risk of the initial combined CV outcome was associated with recent exposure to GC, adjusted HR 1.66 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.41), and the highest tertile of cumulative exposure (&#x0003e;7000&#x02005;mg of prednisone equivalents), HR 2.11 (95% CI 1.47 to 3.04), whereas there was no association with past GC exposure &#x0003e;3&#x02005;months, or mid tertile cumulative exposure (&#x0003e;1500 to &#x02264;7000&#x02005;mg).</p><p>Conversely, a lower prevalence for lifetime CV morbidity among patients with prolonged exposure to GCs, similar to conventional DMARDs and anti-tumour necrosis factor blockers, has been shown by Naranjo <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> in the cross-sectional study in non-selected outpatients with RA, HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.98). In a prospective RA cohort, Gonzalez-Gay <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> could not confirm an excess risk of incident CV events or CV mortality induced by a median dose of prednisone 5&#x02005;mg/day for at least 1&#x02005;year, and the mean (SD) cumulative dose of prednisone of 13.5 (9) g at the end of the study. Interestingly, risk of hospitalisation for MI and stroke, which was assessed in the nested case&#x02013;control study reported by Solomon <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> was significantly increased only if GC were used in monotherapy (MTX monotherapy used as the reference group), but not in combination with other DMARDs.</p><p>Our results further suggest that it may be possible to avoid the potential negative effects of GC on future ischaemic coronary artery complications and survival prognosis if GCs are used in low doses, over limited time, in conjunction with DMARDs in patients with a low baseline rate of traditional CV risk factors. This is in line with the encouraging reports about associations between effective antirheumatic therapy and favourable overall CV and survival prognosis,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;41</xref> which formed the basis for the hypothesis that a dampening of systemic inflammation by GC may halt development of atherosclerotic disease.</p><p>Using the present knowledge, it seems fair to say that even if the possibility of an excess CV risk associated with GC exposure cannot be excluded, the negative effects of GC may be counteracted by the positive impact of suppression of chronic inflammation. Thus, the significant benefits of the low-dose GC therapy, both in terms of disease activity and radiographic progression in the present trial,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> as compared with therapy not including GC, could most likely have overcome adverse coronary events and overall survival. In support of this hypothesis, the previous subgroup analysis has shown that a low dose of prednisolone in early RA was not proatherogenic, considering the carotid artery intima-media measures, presence of atherosclerotic plaques and endothelial function after 5&#x02005;years of follow-up.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Accordingly, we observed a tendency towards reduction in mortality for patients with a better therapy response, possibly due to an overall decrease in inflammation related to the antirheumatic therapy.</p><p>When it comes to the potential cerebrovascular risk of GC use, the evidence is limited. There are studies showing an excess risk when using GC,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> while several others have failed to find any excess risk.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Notably, few studies have divided CV events into subtypes. Such a subdivision could be of importance, considering the possibility of different aetiologies of coronary and cerebrovascular events. The results of our study indicate that even low-dose GC exposure could be associated with long-term cerebrovascular safety issues in patients with RA. What pathways of the GC would be involved in occurrence of cerebrovascular events but not coronary events are unclear. About 14&#x02013;30% of all strokes in the general population are of cardioembolic origin, and atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for this type of ischaemic stroke.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> An almost twofold increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter has been reported in current and long-term users of GC in a population-based case&#x02013;control study.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> As we found differences in the risk of ischaemic coronary and cerebrovascular complications, we cannot exclude that the excess cerebrovascular risk in our study was essentially confined to participants with other specific underlying risk factors, for example, atrial fibrillation. Such a possibility, however, could not be tested here through hospitalisation registries.</p><p>Our study has several important strengths such as an incidence cohort of patients with RA with the diagnosis validated by the ACR criteria, randomised allocation to therapy within the setting of prospective follow-up, long observation period sufficient for development of studied complications, high compliance with the treatment protocol, few losses to follow-up or therapy discontinuation. Furthermore, the reliable nationwide registry system ascertains the outcomes.</p><p>However, these data should be interpreted with caution because it is not clear to what extent a more prolonged therapy with oral GCs may affect the risk of CV-related adverse clinical events and survival. Further, the population of this study was relatively young and had a low frequency of baseline traditional CV risk factors. Then, we could not have anticipated the observed baseline imbalance between the treatment groups, but the age difference was adjusted for in the analyses. It should also be acknowledged that the prednisolone trial was not primarily designed to examine the risk of incident CV events. Given the low precision of estimated hazards and restriction of measurements to prednisolone exposure only in the first 2&#x02005;years, regardless of subsequent prednisolone use, the results should be interpreted as non-definitive regarding the possible long-term risks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has focused on the long-term CV and mortality risks of low-dose GC therapy in RA and adds further weight to the arguments for appropriate use of GCs in early disease. Our data suggest that the 2-year low-dose GC exposure in patients with early RA may have affected the risk of cerebrovascular events. On the other side, the results of this study would argue against GC-induced risk of ischaemic coronary artery complications in a population with low frequency of background traditional CV risk factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e156" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004259.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e157" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004259.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the following members of the BARFOT (Better Anti-Rheumatic PharmacOTherapy) study group: Maria Andersson, Kristina Forslind, Catharina Keller, Ido Leden, Bengt Lindell, Ingemar Petersson, Christoffer Schaufelberger, Annika Teleman and Jan Theander.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> IH and BS designed the original low-dose prednisolone study and were involved in acquisition of data.
