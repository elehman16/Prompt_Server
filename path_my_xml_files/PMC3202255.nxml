A scientific and technological revolution has occurred over the last three decades. Due to the rapid modernization, people are leading more stressful lives. Many of them are not able to adapt to the stresses of day to day life and these people are prone to develop psychosomatic illnesses. There are several psychosomatic diseases, with essential hypertension (EHT) being an important one.</p><p>The modern world in which there have been so many amazing achievements is also a world full of stress. We find stress everywhere: within the family, in business organizations or enterprises, and in every social or economic activity. Right from the time of birth till the last breath drawn, an individual is exposed to various stressful situations. Thus, it is not surprising that interest in this issue has been increasing. The present era can be appropriately called the &#x02018;era of anxiety and stress.&#x02019;</p><p>There is a close connection between our body and our mind. If there is a psychological factor affecting a medical condition, it is important to treat the psychological problem as well as the medical problem. According to Ayurveda, <italic>Vata</italic> and <italic>Mana</italic> (mind) are mainly vitiated in the psychic diseases.</p><p>There is no direct reference to EHT in the classical texts of Ayurveda. Many scholars have studied the texts in great detail. These relevant references as indicated in those texts, hence have been classified by those scholars. They have come to the conclusion that <italic>Hridaya</italic> and processes of <italic>Rasa Vikshepa</italic> or <italic>Anudhavana</italic> by <italic>Vyana Vayu</italic> has become helpful to understand the disease. Though the exact nomenclature of the disease is to some extent controversial, the signs and symptoms of the disease can be understood in terms of <italic>Dosha, Dushya, Dhatu</italic>, etc. Looking at EHT from this perspective, we can assume that vitiated <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> is the main cause of the disease, as the <italic>Dhatu Gati (Rasa Gati)</italic> or <italic>Vikshepa</italic> is achieved by <italic>Vayu</italic> itself.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] <italic>Pitta</italic> and <italic>Kapha</italic> complement the effect of vitiated <italic>Vata</italic> and support the progress of the disease with <italic>Rasa, Rakta</italic> (whole blood) being the main mediator of vitiation. This suggests the involvement of <italic>Tridosha</italic> in disease.</p><p>In the Ayurveda system of medicine, <italic>Sarpagandha</italic> Vati has been described as <italic>Nidra Janak</italic> and a molecular nutrient for the brain, which can be used to relieve anxiety, stress, and mental fatigue. <italic>Shirodhara</italic>, on the other hand, is used to induce relaxation of the mind and the entire physiology. Thus, both help alleviate stress and anxiety. <italic>Shirodhara</italic> is suitable for patients suffering from Shiroroga, metabolic disorders, and the different kinds of mental diseases described in Ayurveda. The study was aimed to examine the effects of Shriodhara in patients suffering from <italic>Uccha Raktachap</italic> (EHT). Some of our senior colleagues have previously studied the effects of <italic>Shirodhara</italic>. They used <italic>Chandana Bala Taila Jala Takra Dhara</italic> for <italic>Shirodhara</italic>. In 1983, <italic>Shukla</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] conducted a study on the effect of <italic>Shirodhara</italic> by Takra in patients suffering from <italic>Abhiviruddha Raktachapa</italic>. We have chosen <italic>Shirodhara</italic> by <italic>Bala Taila</italic>, which is known to have a beneficial effect on all the sensory organs and to make the patient quiet and calm. The effect on the mind is such that the patient is said to become free from anxiety and stress. <italic>Bala Taila Shirodhara</italic> also modifies the energy condition of the mind.</p><p>Therefore, this project was undertaken to find a safe and effective Ayurvedic method of treatment for hypertension that would be free of any adverse effect and would maintain blood pressure within normal limits, i.e., below 140/90 mmHg as recommended by the World Health organization (WHO).</p><p><italic>Sarpagandha</italic> Vati is extensively used in Ayurveda for the management of hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>The aims of study were to evaluate the role of <italic>Manasika Bhava</italic> in the pathogenesis of EHT and to assess the efficacy of <italic>Shirodhara</italic> and <italic>Sarpagandha</italic> Vati in its management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 47 patients of EHT were randomly selected from outpatients and inpatients department of Panchkarma, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Jamnagar.

It is described in the Samhitas and Nighantu as <italic>Kapha Vata Shamak, Nidra Karaka</italic>, and <italic>Uccharaktachapahara</italic>; thus, it alleviates the <italic>Vata, Pitta</italic>, and <italic>Kapha</italic> and act as <italic>Mastiska Shamak</italic> and <italic>Nidrajanan</italic>. It is having <italic>Krimighna, Aampachaka</italic> and <italic>Hridayavasaadaka</italic> properties. It is used as an antihypertensive drug, it has antiarrhythmic activity, and is useful in <italic>Anidra. Rauwolfia serpentina</italic> is the first herbal antipsychotic drug. By its action on the vasomotor center it leads to generalized vasodilatation, with a lowering of blood pressure and by its depressant action on the cerebral centers, it soothes the general nervous system.</p><p>Acharya Charaka has defined <italic>Snehana</italic> as the treatment, which produces viscosity, softness, solubility, and <italic>kleda</italic> in the body (Cha.Su.22/10). <italic>Snehana</italic> is one among the <italic>Shadvidhopakramas</italic>. Pouring of a liquid on the forehead is known as <italic>Shirodhara</italic>. It can be done using different medicaments, e.g., <italic>Taila</italic> (oil), <italic>Takra</italic> (buttermilk), <italic>Kshira</italic> (milk), <italic>Kwatha</italic> (decoction), etc. When it is done with medicated ghee or <italic>Taila</italic>, it is called <italic>Tailadhara</italic>. This Tailadhara is included among the different varieties of <italic>Murdha Taila</italic>, which are <italic>Abhyanga, Seka, Pichu</italic>, and <italic>Basti</italic>. They are called <italic>&#x02018;Uttarottar Gunaprada.&#x02019;</italic> Dhara can be used not only in psychic diseases but also in psychosomatic illnesses like IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), psoriasis, EHT, etc.</p><p>Continuous pouring of <italic>Bala Taila</italic> on the forehead for a specific period has a tranquilizing effect and induces sleep. Modern science accepts that after local application as an ointment a drug may pass through the stratum corneum and into the blood vessels to produce desirable effects at a remote target organ. The continuous pouring of <italic>Bala</italic> oil with the patient in a relaxed and comfortable position has an additional effect, which can be compared to that which a baby feels when being cradled by the mother. This has a sedative and soothing effect for the brain and produces sleep.</p><p><italic>Bala Taila</italic> poured on the forehead may be absorbed and produce a tranquilizing effect by reaching the brain cortex. It might be possible that the medicaments in the oil have neurotransmitter-like actions and when these reach the brain cortex they correct deficiencies of certain neurotransmitters. In <italic>Bala Taila, Tila Taila</italic> is anti-<italic>Vata</italic>, and its <italic>Snigdhatva</italic> properties help <italic>Tarpaka Kapha</italic> in properly facilitating the connection of the <italic>Indriyas</italic> and <italic>Vishaya</italic>, which may have been deranged by aggravated <italic>Vata</italic>. The active ingredients of <italic>Bala</italic> oil penetrate into the circulation via the forehead and produces a <italic>Vatahara</italic> effect. However, <italic>Bala Taila</italic> produces lubrication and nutrition. Hence, <italic>Shirodhara</italic> facilitates for better working by its <italic>Medhya</italic> effect. However, <italic>Atibala</italic> has <italic>Medhya</italic> effect by which it re-establishes <italic>Dhee, Dhriti, and Smriti</italic>, thus preventing <italic>Prajnaparadha</italic>.</p><p>The overall effect of therapy in group A and in group B on chief complaints and <italic>manasa bhava</italic> are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overall effect on chief complaints</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-31-436-g008"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Overall effect on Manasa Bhava</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-31-436-g009"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Manasa Bhavas</italic> like <italic>Chinta, Krodha, Bhaya</italic>, etc., play an important role in the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of diseases, and also have effects on the response to treatment &#x02013; <italic>Uccharaktachapa</italic>. Hence, the type of drug/therapy that should be recommended is one that can pacify these disturbed <italic>Manasika Bhavas</italic>, calming the mind and relaxing the entire physiology. This can be accomplished by combining a mental health&#x02013;promoting therapy like <italic>Shirodhara</italic> along with <italic>Sarpagandha Vati</italic> to relieve anxiety, stress, etc. In this study, <italic>Sarpagandha Vati</italic> helped in reducing both systolic and diastolic pressure. <italic>Shirodhara</italic> reduced both systolic and diastolic pressure in a more pronounced way.</p><p>On the basis of this study, it appears that patients with EHT can be managed better if a stress-relieving procedure like <italic>Shirodhara</italic> is given along with Ayurvedic antihypertensive drugs like <italic>Sarpagandha Vati</italic>. During the follow-up study we observed that though a minimal rise in blood pressure took place over the 1-month period, both the groups showed good control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
