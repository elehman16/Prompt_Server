It is associated with various psychiatric disorders including eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and depression (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Flett &#x00026; Hewitt, 2002</xref>), it can interfere with daily functioning and it can impede the progress of treatment of Axis I disorders (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Blatt, Quinlan, Pilkonis, &#x00026; Shea, 1995</xref>). Despite the clinical problems that can be associated with perfectionism, there is little agreement as to the nature of the construct. Some view dysfunctional perfectionism as a stable personality characteristic that is not readily amenable to change (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Blatt et al., 1995</xref>). Others view it as a multidimensional construct with a strong interpersonal component (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt &#x00026; Flett, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt, Flett, Besser, Sherry, &#x00026; McGee, 2003</xref>), and still others argue that concern over mistakes are central (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Frost, Marten, Lahart, &#x00026; Rosenblate, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Most recently, we proposed a cognitive-behavioural model of a highly specific form of perfectionism, termed &#x0201c;clinical perfectionism&#x0201d;. This construct grew out of clinical observations made when treating patients with eating disorders, and refers specifically to a dysfunctional type of self-focused perfectionism in which the individual determinedly pursues self-imposed, personally demanding standards, despite adverse consequences. Central to this construct is the view that the individual's self-evaluation is largely, or even exclusively, dependent on the pursuit and achievement of their standards for performance (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Shafran, Cooper, &#x00026; Fairburn, 2002</xref>). A critical component of clinical perfectionism is not simply that the individual strives for high standards, but rather, the impact of not meeting these standards on self-evaluation. According to this cognitive-behavioural account, a range of maintaining mechanisms accounts for the persistence of clinical perfectionism including behaviour such as checking and avoidance, and cognitive factors such as dichotomous thinking operationalised as rigid rules (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Riley &#x00026; Shafran, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Shafran et al., 2002</xref>). Such perfectionism is a problem in its own right, and is also suggested to impede successful treatment of Axis I disorders in cases where the domain of clinical perfectionism overlaps with that of the disorder (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Shafran et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>There has been some controversy regarding this construct (e.g., <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Shafran, Cooper, &#x00026; Fairburn, 2003</xref>) and we are in full agreement that other forms of perfectionism such as socially oriented perfectionism can also pose clinical problems. Our goal in developing the specific construct of clinical perfectionism was to identify its maintaining mechanisms to enable the development of a highly focused brief intervention of clinical value. There has been some preliminary support for the construct and the cognitive-behavioural analysis. For example, a qualitative analysis was consistent with the conceptualisation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Riley &#x00026; Shafran, 2005</xref>). Recently <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dunkley, Blankstein, Masheb, and Grilo (2006)</xref> found that &#x0201c;self-criticism substantially accounts for the relation between perfectionism measures and depressive, anxiety and eating disorder symptoms&#x0201d; (p. 80) which is consistent with the view that self-evaluation is at the heart of perfectionism, rather than striving for high standards per se.</p><p>There is also support for the newly developed cognitive-behavioural intervention derived from the analysis. In a single case report of a patient with binge eating disorder, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Shafran, Lee, and Fairburn (2004)</xref> found that the cognitive-behavioural intervention for clinical perfectionism was effective in the reduction of both clinical perfectionism and binge-eating and that improvements were maintained at five-month follow-up. Furthermore, a case-series study found that six out of nine participants showed some improvement in their perfectionism (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Glover, Shafran, Brown, &#x00026; Fairburn, in press</xref>).</p><p>These case studies contribute to the literature on the treatment of perfectionism that includes studies of emotion focused therapy (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg &#x00026; Bolger, 2001</xref>), psychodynamic therapy (e.g., <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Blatt, 1992</xref>), and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) (e.g., <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson &#x00026; Rodway, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">DiBartolo, Frost, Dixon, &#x00026; Almodovar, 2001</xref>) including cognitive-behavioural self-help (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Antony &#x00026; Swinson, 1998</xref>). In one of the first randomised controlled trials of treatment for perfectionism, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pleva and Wade (in press)</xref> demonstrated that eight sessions of guided self-help, using the cognitive-behavioural manual by <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Antony and Swinson (1998)</xref>, was effective in reducing perfectionism in a non-clinical sample. However, the newly developed cognitive-behavioural treatment specific for <italic>clinical</italic> perfectionism requires further evaluation using a rigorous design and clinical participants. Hence, the aim of the current study was to compare the therapeutic effects of CBT for clinical perfectionism with a waitlist (WL) control, and to investigate maintenance of any effects over eight and 16-weeks. It was hypothesised: <list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>CBT would be superior to a WL control condition.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>clinical perfectionism would be reduced after CBT, and these effects would be maintained at 8 week and 16-week follow-up.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>successful treatment of clinical perfectionism would result in an improvement in any accompanying Axis I diagnoses.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Participants were randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (IT) or an initial eight-week WL group <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3" altimg="si3.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. After the initial eight-week delay, all those in the WL condition received the active intervention. Allocation was made using a random number list using a generated by computer, and concealing the result of each randomisation into numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. These envelopes were only opened after the participant had consented to participate. Research assessments were conducted blind to the randomisation condition at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and on two follow-up occasions (8 and 16 weeks after treatment). Participants in the WL condition had one extra assessment at the beginning of the WL period<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). All assessments and therapy sessions took place at the Oxford University Department of Psychiatry and the study was approved by the NHS Central Office for Research Ethics Committee (COREC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty participants (18 female) met inclusion criteria for clinical perfectionism according to a semi-structured interview based on the cognitive analysis. Fundamental to inclusion was that the individual's self-evaluation was largely, or even exclusively, dependent on the pursuit and achievement of their standards for performance and that their pursuit of these standards was interfering with daily functioning. Of these, 15 were referred by clinicians and five were recruited via advertisements.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Clinical perfectionism</title><p>The Clinical Perfectionism Examination (CPE; Riley, Cooper, Fairburn, &#x00026; Shafran, in preparation) is a 12-item investigator-led interview based on the cognitive-behavioural analysis (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Shafran et al., 2002</xref>), designed to assess severity of clinical perfectionism.

The CPQ (Fairburn, Cooper, &#x00026; Shafran, in preparation) is a twelve-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess current level of clinical perfectionism. Its individual items assess the cognitive, behavioural and affective components of setting goals and striving to meet them, and the consequences on the individual's self-evaluation when these standards are met or not met. Responses are rated on a four-point scale (1&#x02013;4) ranging from &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;all of the time&#x0201d;.

The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI&#x02014;II; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Beck, Steer, &#x00026; Brown, 1996</xref>) is a widely used 21-item self-report instrument used to measure the cognitive, behavioural and somatic severity of depression in adults and adolescents aged 13 and over.

The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Beck, Epstein, Brown, &#x00026; Steer, 1988</xref>) is a 21-item self report instrument used to assess severity of anxiety, and is especially developed to minimise its relationship with depression.

Treatment was conducted on an individual outpatient basis, and consisted of 10 sessions over eight weeks. Sessions were 50&#x000a0;min long and occurred twice weekly for the first three weeks, weekly for the subsequent three weeks and a two-week interval thereafter. The treatment was manualised, and the protocol consisted of four elements developed originally by <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fairburn, Cooper, and Shafran (2003)</xref>. These elements are: (1) identifying perfectionism as a problem and establishing maintaining mechanisms (e.g., repeated performance checking and avoidance, over-working or over-training); (2) conducting behavioural experiments to learn more about the nature of their perfectionism, and alternative ways of living (e.g., the impact of checking repeatedly vs. checking only occasionally); (3) psychoeducation and cognitive restructuring (in combination with behavioural experiments) to modify personal standards, self-criticism, &#x0201c;rules&#x0201d; and cognitive biases such as selective attention to perceived failure; (4) broadening the individual's scheme for self-evaluation, by examining existing methods of evaluating the self, and identifying and adopting alternative cognitions and behaviours (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fairburn, Marcus, &#x00026; Wilson, 1993</xref>).</p><p>This protocol is one component of a new cognitive behavioural treatment for eating disorders (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fairburn et al., 2003</xref>) and was adapted specifically for this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment fidelity</title><p>Audiotapes of 20 therapy sessions (10% of all sessions) were randomly selected and rated by an independent clinical psychologist familiar with the treatment protocol. The rater listened to the tapes and rated the degree of adherence to the protocol as well as the quality of the therapy session, using the following dimensions: supportive encouragement, conveyance of expertise, and warmth. These dimensions were taken from criteria used by <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Agras, Walsh, Fairburn, Wilson and Kraemer (2000)</xref> in their study of treatment for bulimia nervosa. All ratings were made on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. The mean score for adherence to the protocol was 5.35 (SD=1.18) i.e., good. Quality of therapy sessions was also good, with the mean score for supportive encouragement 5.65 (SD=.99), conveyance of expertise 6.00 (SD=1.21), and warmth 5.95 (SD=.95).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Eighteen participants completed the full course of 10 sessions of treatment and attended all research assessments.

Relevant MANOVAs and post hoc comparisons or planned contrasts were used to investigate the effects of CBT for clinical perfectionism immediately following treatment and at both follow-ups. The level of clinically significant change was calculated for the main outcome measure (the CPE) using <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson and Truax's (1991)</xref> definition and method.

Prior to treatment, 10 (50%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder or major depressive episode (6 generalised anxiety disorder; 5 social phobia; 2 obsessive-compulsive disorder; 2 major depressive episode; 1 panic disorder with agoraphobia; 1 specific phobia). Immediately following treatment, five participants (25%) met criteria (one of whom had not met criteria pre-treatment) reducing to four participants at eight-week and 16-week follow up.<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn">3</xref></p><p>Participants who were randomised to the WL condition were also interviewed with the SCID prior to entering the WL phase. Six participants met criteria for an anxiety disorder or major depressive episode at this stage and this did not change when they were reassessed at the end of the WL. To further investigate the effect of treatment vs. WL across time on BDI, BAI and BSI scores, a 3 (time; 0 vs 8 vs 16-weeks)&#x000d7;2 (condition; IT vs DT) mixed MANOVA was carried out.

In this small study, effect sizes were large (comparing well with trials of CBT for other forms of psychopathology, e.g., <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chambless &#x00026; Gillis, 1993</xref>) and reductions in clinical perfectionism were maintained at eight week and 16-week follow-up. Fifteen participants were clinically significantly improved at post-treatment assessment and remained so at both follow-up assessments. The number of participants meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder or major depressive episode halved after treatment which is reflected in the reductions in self-report measures of psychopathology, and comparisons of those receiving immediate vs delayed treatment tentatively suggest that the intervention had a clinically significant impact on co-occurring psychopathology.</p><p>A variety of measures of perfectionism were used in this study. The scores on both Multidimensional Perfectionism Scales significantly reduced with treatment, although the changes on the two interpersonal subscales of the MPS-H did not endure and the changes were not significantly different in the subset receiving immediate treatment compared to the WL group. This could be for a variety of reasons, including the small sample size in each group and the lack of time-frame specified by the multidimensional measures. The multidimensional measures purposefully do not specify a time-frame because the construct that they are designed to assess is &#x0201c;trait-like&#x0201d;, stable and enduring (e.g., <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cox &#x00026; Enns, 2003</xref>). By contrast, clinical perfectionism is not viewed as a stable dysfunctional personality style but rather a form of psychopathology maintained by specific cognitions and behaviour. It is not intended that this brief, focused intervention reduces other aspects of perfectionism. It also remains to be established whether the decreases in clinical perfectionism are merely due to changes in other psychopathology. This is likely to be the case for some patients since perfectionism has been shown to change with successful treatment of an Axis I disorder (e.g. <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lundh &#x00026; &#x000d6;st, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Rosser, Issakidis, &#x00026; Peters, 2003</xref>). However, it is also likely that there are some patients for whom clinical perfectionism is a barrier to change in the Axis I psychopathology and for whom a specific intervention is warranted.</p><p>There are a number of limitations of the current study that should be taken into account. First, and foremost, there was a small sample size comprised predominantly of women. Although a significant difference between the WL controls and the group treated with CBT on the measures of clinical perfectionism were found, the study may have been underpowered to detect smaller differences in other measures. Second, although the study controlled for the passage of time and the effects of repeated assessment by using a WL comparison group, the study lacked a comparison group to control for non-specific effects. Thus, it cannot be concluded that changes were specific to the intervention. Third, research is needed to establish whether the intervention has any impact on other aspects of perfectionism, including perfectionistic vulnerability. For example, correlational analyses would have allowed further examination of whether or not treatment reduced participants&#x02019; underlying vulnerability to engaging in perfectionist beliefs and behaviours. Finally, the study only assessed anxiety disorders and major depressive episodes and did not assess the degree of impairment to daily functioning caused by clinical perfectionism, or accompanying Axis I disorders, before treatment or afterwards. Including a measure of daily functioning would have supported clinical judgment that participants&#x02019; clinical perfectionism was causing a significant clinical problem as well as providing a further indication of the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p>In conclusion, this small randomised controlled trial provides preliminary data that a specific form of perfectionism (clinical perfectionism) that interferes with patient's functioning, can be reduced with a focused, brief intervention based on a clearly specified theory. Acceptability of the treatment was good with only one participant dropping out of treatment and an additional participant declining to complete the follow-up assessment. Given that the intervention is cognitive-behavioural and relatively brief, it could be used as an adjunct to existing cognitive-behavioural interventions when clinical perfectionism is proving to be a barrier to change, or as a stand-alone treatment for people with clinical perfectionism as their primary problem.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
