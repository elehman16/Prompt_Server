In phase 1 studies, compared with non-pegylated IFN beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a had a longer terminal half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>), greater exposure (peak serum concentration [<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>] and area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve [AUC]), and prolonged and higher elevations in well-characterized pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of type 1 interferon receptor activation (serum neopterin and 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetase) [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These characteristics support the notion that pegylation of IFN beta-1a provides potential for increased biologic activity and more convenient, less frequent dosing.</p><p>In the ADVANCE study, a phase 3 multicentre, randomized, double-blind study with a 1 year placebo-controlled period, 1512 patients with RRMS were randomized to and received either placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 500) or peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g administered once every 2 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 512) or once every 4 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 500) [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At year 1 of ADVANCE, peginterferon beta-1a dosed every 2 weeks reduced annualized relapse rate [ARR; primary endpoint] by 36%. Risk of relapse, risk of disability progression and the number of new or newly-enlarging T2 lesions (secondary endpoints), along with gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions (tertiary endpoint) were also reduced, when compared with placebo [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The safety profile reflected that of established IFN beta-1a therapies. While peginterferon beta-1a dosed every 4 weeks also had a significant effect on the clinical endpoints, the reduction relative to placebo in ARR and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) endpoints was numerically greater in the every 2 weeks dosing group compared with the every 4 weeks dosing group.</p><p>The objectives of these intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) and PD analyses from the ADVANCE study were to estimate PK and PD parameters of peginterferon beta-1a in patients with RRMS, to explore covariates that influenced PK parameters and to assess the impact of treatment-emergent antibodies on PK and PD parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and patients</title><p>ADVANCE was a 2 year, phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study with a 1 year placebo-controlled period. The full methods of the ADVANCE study have been published previously [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During year 1 of the study, patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of placebo, peginterferon beta-1a at a dose of 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g every 2 weeks, or peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g every 4 weeks. To maintain the blind, patients received either peginterferon beta-1a or placebo every 2 weeks. Those randomized to the peginterferon beta-1a dosed every 4 weeks group received alternate injections of placebo and peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks. At the end of year 1, patients on placebo were re-randomized to peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g dosed every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks. Thus, during year 2, all patients received dose-frequency blinded peginterferon beta-1a. Key eligibility criteria were a diagnosis of RRMS as defined by the McDonald criteria, an age of 18 to 65 years, a score of between 0 to 5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS, with higher scores indicating greater disability [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), and at least two clinically documented relapses in the previous 3 years, with at least one of these relapses having occurred within the 12 months prior to randomization. Patients who had progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), pre-specified laboratory abnormalities and prior interferon treatment for MS exceeding 4 weeks or discontinuation less than 6 months prior to baseline were excluded. The protocol was approved by each site's institutional review board and was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Every patient provided written informed consent prior to study entry.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood sampling</title><p>Blood samples were taken from all patients for PK and PD analysis, using a combination of intensive and sparse sampling strategies. The intensive PK and PD samples were targeted to be taken from 5% of the overall population who provided additional consent for the intensive PK study pre-dose, and at 6, 24, 28, 36, 72, 120, 168 and 240&#x02009;h post-dose during week 4 and week 24 (the first week of the study was designated as week 0).</p><p>For sparse sampling, one sample was taken after each dosing at weeks 4, 12, 24, 56 and 84. The window for drawing a sparse sample was defined as at least 1&#x02009;h after the last dose administered at week 4 and no later than 10 days after the scheduled dosing date at weeks 12, 24, 56 and 84. The rationale for this sampling window was that the serum drug concentration may fall under the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) by 10 days post-dose, which would render a PK blood draw irrelevant. The sampling window at week 4 was shorter as the patients were in the office during this visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of serum concentrations of peginterferon beta-1a</title><p>Serum concentrations of peginterferon beta-1a were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The quantitative range was 31.3&#x02013;1500&#x02009;pg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The accuracy of the assay was in the range of 100.4&#x02013;103.6% during study testing and the precision of the assay, expressed as percent coefficient of variation (%CV) and evaluated using assay controls, was less than 7%. Serum neopterin was measured using a validated competition ELISA. The quantitative range was 1.29&#x02013;101&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The accuracy range of the assay was 97.9&#x02013;99.7% during study testing and the precision of the assay, expressed as %CV and evaluated using assay controls, was less than 10%.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunogenicity assays</title><p>Immunogenicity assays, including testing of anti-interferon binding antibodies (anti-IFN BAbs), anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies (anti-IFN NAbs) and antibodies directed against the polyethyleneglycol (PEG) moiety of peginterferon beta-1a (anti-PEG antibodies), were performed using validated assays. Anti-IFN BAbs were detected by a sandwich ELISA. Positive serum samples were subsequently tested for anti-IFN NAbs in a cell-based myxovirus protein A induction assay and then titered to generate a quasi-quantitative assessment of NAbs concentration. Anti-PEG antibodies were tested and titred to generate a quasi-quantitative assessment in an ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>PK and PD analyses</title><p>The PK and PD parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonLin software (Pharsight, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) based on intensive data. The PK parameters included AUC(0,&#x003c4;), AUC(0,168&#x02009;h), <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, time to reach <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>), apparent total clearance (CL/<italic>F</italic>), <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and apparent volume of distribution (<italic>V</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>F</italic>). PD parameters included median peak neopterin concentration (E<sub>peak</sub>), area under the effect&#x02013;time-curve over 336&#x02009;h from dosing (E<sub>AUC(0,336&#x02009;h)</sub>), and time to reach maximum effect (E<sub><italic>t</italic>max</sub>). Correction for baseline neopterin concentration was applied for calculation of E<sub>peak</sub>. E<sub>AUC(0,336&#x02009;h)</sub> was estimated because neopterin elevation lasted up to 2 weeks based on a previous study and was calculated by defining partial area in Phoenix WinNonLin. Correlations between AUC(0,&#x003c4;) (mean of week 4 and 24) and selected baseline demographic characteristics (age, gender, weight, body mass index [BMI] and body surface area [BSA]) were examined, using a linear regression analysis. As renal function has been shown to affect clearance of peginterferon beta-1a [<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], correlation between AUC over the dosing period (AUC(0,&#x003c4;)) and creatinine clearance (CL<sub>cr</sub>) rates, estimated by the Cockcroft&#x02212;Gault equation [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], was also examined. The impact of treatment-emergent antibodies on peginterferon beta-1a exposure was assessed by comparing the individual parameters in antibody positive (up to week 24) subjects with the respective group median values, as well as via visual inspection of sparse PK concentration&#x02013;time plot stratified by antibody status.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient demographics</title><p>A full description of participant flow in the ADVANCE study and details of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics in each treatment group have been published previously [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Forty-four patients consented to the intensive PK and PD subgroup at year 1 of the ADVANCE study. Among these, four male and 21 female patients received peginterferon beta-1a (every 2 weeks <italic>n</italic> = 12; every 4 weeks <italic>n</italic> = 13) and had sufficient time point samples for evaluation of PK and PD parameters. Of these patients, mean (SD) age was 36.2 (10.6) years, mean (SD) weight was 69.9 (16.0) kg, mean (SD) BMI was 25.7 (5.4) kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, and mean (SD) BSA was 1.78 (0.22) m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>In general, PK profiles were similar across treatment groups (every 2 weeks <italic>vs.</italic> every 4 weeks dosing) and over time (week 4 <italic>vs.</italic> week 24) (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref> and Table&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). For both every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks dosing groups, no accumulation was observed.

In general, the neopterin concentrations peaked at approximately 3 days post-dosing, which was 1.5 to 2 days later than peginterferon beta-1a peak time, and remained above the baseline level at 10 days post-dosing (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>), after peginterferon beta-1a concentration had dropped below the LLOQ. Comparing neopterin pre-dose concentrations at weeks 0, 4, and 24 for both groups, it was evident that neopterin concentrations had returned to baseline within 2 weeks after the previous dose for both the every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks dosing groups (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). The E<sub>peak</sub> and E<sub>AUC(0,336&#x02009;h)</sub> of the every 2 weeks dosing group decreased by 40% and 48%, respectively, from week 4 to week 24.

Median AUC from time 0 to 168&#x02009;h post-dose (AUC(0,168&#x02009;h)) was reported to be 27.2&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1&#x02009;</sup>h in healthy volunteers [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which compares with the median AUC(0,168&#x02009;h) that ranged from 23.5 to 32.0&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1&#x02009;</sup>h in the present study in RRMS patients. The PK parameters exhibited high variability in both populations. These results suggest that RRMS does not alter disposition of peginterferon beta-1a. Therefore, previous PK analyses in healthy subjects, which showed that peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g provided a nine-fold higher AUC relative to intramuscular administration of non-pegylated IFN beta-1a 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (based on a cytopathic effect assay) [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], could be extrapolated to the RRMS population. Corrected for dosing frequency, peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks dosing regimens provided 4.5-fold and 2.3-fold higher cumulative AUC, as compared with non-pegylated IFN beta-1a administered weekly. Although definitive exposure&#x02212;efficacy relationships are yet to be established, the increased cumulative exposure potentially explains the maintained efficacy of peginterferon beta-1a despite its reduced dosing frequency. The AUC from time 0 to 96&#x02009;h post-dose (AUC(0,96&#x02009;h)) of another non-pegylated IFN beta-1a is reported to be 294&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;81&#x02009;IU&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1&#x02009;</sup>h [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] following a single 60&#x02009;&#x003bc;g dose. When considering a 240% accumulation at steady-state, correcting for dose, IFN beta-1a 44&#x02009;&#x003bc;g three times weekly provides a cumulative monthly (12 doses) AUC of 23.0&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1&#x02009;</sup>h (units converted based on <italic>in vitro</italic> specific activity of 270 mIU&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In comparison, peginterferon beta-1a dosing every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks provided 2.5- and 1.2-fold higher monthly cumulative AUC, respectively. It should be noted that a head-to-head comparison study would provide a more reliable comparison of the cumulative exposure of pegylated and non-pegylated IFN beta-1a products. Nevertheless, AUC comparisons for peginterferon beta-1a and non-pegylated IFN beta-1a confirm the desired PK modification by pegylation and support the concept of pegylation [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>For peginterferon beta-1a, no accumulation was observed. The accumulation observed with other subcutaneous pegylated IFNs such as for pegylated IFN alpha-2b (PEG-Intron&#x000ae;) [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys&#x000ae;) [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which are dosed at 1.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 180&#x02009;&#x003bc;g weekly, respectively, compared with peginterferon beta-1a could be due to the more frequent weekly dosing schedules.</p><p>Correlations between PK parameters and demographic characteristics were explored in the present study, using a two stage approach [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The two stage approach has been applied in new drug development and evaluation processes for more than 30 years [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;1<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The main advantage of the two stage approach is minimal data manipulation and the mean estimates of parameters are usually unbiased. However, rich PK data are required for each subject. Multivariate analysis or non-linear regression is rarely carried out using this approach. Additionally, the random effects are likely to be overestimated. An alternative approach would be population PK analysis, which could combine information from subjects with intensive and sparse PK sampling and test for multiple covariates on multiple PK parameters simultaneously. A population PK analysis is currently underway and relationships analyzed in this report will be further examined.</p><p>Similar pharmacological activity was observed for peginterferon beta-1a 125&#x02009;&#x003bc;g administered every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks, based on neopterin concentrations, which peaked at approximately 3 days after each dosing. The neopterin response decreased over time in the present study (week 4 <italic>vs.</italic> week 24), especially in the peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks dosing group. Previous studies in humans and monkeys have shown that continuous exposure to interferon beta-1a reduced the magnitude of neopterin response [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It is thought that this may be a result of the down regulation of the type 1 IFN receptor [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or inhibitory feedback by prolonged elevation of neopterin concentrations [<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, neopterin did remain elevated for 10&#x02212;14 days following each dose. These results suggested that neopterin and the monthly cumulative duration of IFN pharmacological activity of the every 2 weeks dosing group is therefore doubled relative to the every 4 weeks dosing group.</p><p>Treatment-emergent anti-PEG antibodies did not seem to impact peginterferon beta-1a PK or PD. The impact of treatment-emergent anti-IFN BAbs and NAbs was inconclusive due to low incidence in patients in the ADVANCE study. In the phase 3 ADVANCE study, administration of peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks consistently provided statistically significant differences <italic>vs.</italic> placebo for all clinical measures, with numerically greater treatment effects across relapse activity outcomes and MRI endpoints <italic>vs.</italic> peginterferon beta-1a administered every 4 weeks [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The approximate two-fold higher monthly cumulative exposure and longer monthly cumulative duration of PD response in the peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks dosing group, compared with the every 4 weeks dosing group, seen in this study was expected based on the dose regimens used and the results of previous studies with peginterferon beta-1a [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and may partly explain the better clinical efficacy with peginterferon beta-1a dosed every 2 weeks <italic>vs.</italic> every 4 weeks in the phase 3 study [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, peginterferon beta-1a dosed every 2 weeks provided approximately two-fold greater cumulative AUC over a month relative to the every 4 weeks regimen, with a similar <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>. No accumulation was observed. Neopterin elevations were sustained for approximately 2 weeks post-dosing and dosing every 2 weeks provided a two-fold longer duration of pharmacological activity relative to dosing every 4 weeks. Results from this PK and PD study may provide an explanation for the enhanced efficacy observed with peginterferon beta-1a dosed every 2 weeks compared with every 4 weeks in patients with RRMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The study was sponsored by Biogen Idec Inc (Cambridge, MA, USA).
