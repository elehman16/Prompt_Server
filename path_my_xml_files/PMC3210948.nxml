In this study, we examine whether swallow tests performed using a bolus of semisolid food (bolus swallow test, BST) offer benefits. In a prospective, randomised, blind study, the results of a standardised saliva swallow test (SST), WST, BST, combinations of these tests and an endoscopic swallow test (FEES) in patients with oropharyngeal swallowing disorders of neurological (NEU) and non-neurological (NNEU) origin were compared. Sensitivity, specificity, test accuracy and inter-rater reliability were analysed. 62 patients (mean age&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;64.68; range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22&#x02013;84) were included in the study (NEU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40; NNEU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22). A sensitivity of 70.7% (NEU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;70.3%, NNEU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;71.4%) and specificity of 82.5% (NEU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;92.3%; NNEU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100%) were determined for the WST.

The gold standard diagnostic procedures for oropharyngeal dysphagia are videofluoroscopy and fibre-optic endoscopic swallowing examination (FEES). Because these procedures are technically demanding, the tendency in everyday practice is to try to obtain meaningful information on a patient&#x02019;s swallowing ability by using standardised screening procedures. This is primarily achieved using swallow tests with water, modified in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Under current recommendations, clinical swallow tests for oropharyngeal dysphagia are carried out using water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This, however, runs contrary to clinical experience which shows that semisolid food causes fewer problems in patients with swallowing disorders. Thus, semisolid food is generally used in the early stages of swallowing therapies. Investigations using water, which is more difficult to swallow, have the advantage that test results have a higher sensitivity where the result is negative. Smaller changes which could nevertheless endanger the patient are more likely to be identified. This method also, however, classifies many patients who are able to swallow simpler foods as having a swallowing disorder. This is reflected in the high sensitivity and low specificity of the water swallow test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to examine whether, by changing the consistency of the food used, it is possible to achieve a better balance between sensitivity and specificity and thus achieve a better degree of predictability with regard to swallowing disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was carried out as a prospective, randomised, blind study after being scrutinised by Berlin ethics committee (EA1/087/06). Comparison was made between standardised swallow tests carried out using saliva (SST), water (WST) and a bolus (BST), combinations of the above and the results of FEES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The clinical swallow tests were performed by three therapists trained in the technique. FEES was carried out within 24&#x000a0;h of the clinical swallow test by an ENT specialist who was not present during the clinical tests and was not aware of the results of these tests.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Test subjects</title><p>The study was carried out on a mixed population of patients (62 patients; mean age&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;64.68; range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22&#x02013;84) with swallowing disorders of varied origin who were undergoing in-patient treatment in the ENT department, stroke unit or early rehabilitation clinic of an acute care hospital. Patients were aged over 18 and had sufficient vigilance to ensure that they were able to take food and adequate situational understanding to be able to follow instructions. Patients who were pregnant, were fitted with a non-deblockable tracheostomy tube, had limited vigilance, inadequate situational understanding or clinical indications of an acute infection were excluded from the study. The tests were carried out sitting at a table or sitting up in bed depending on the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Swallow tests</title><p>A detailed explanation was given before carrying out all tests, and the written consent of the patient or their carer was obtained.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Clinical variables</title><p>To evaluate a patient&#x02019;s swallowing ability, the clinical variables breathing (airway obstruction, breath noises, raised breathing rate, etc.), voice and coughing (with and without follow-up swallowing) were evaluated after each swallow during the clinical swallow tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. During the saliva swallow test, vigilance (restricted or unrestricted) and swallowing following oral stimulation according to the facio-oral tract therapy (F.O.T.T.<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] were also assessed (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Berlin swallow test</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="405_2011_1628_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Saliva</title><p>The clinical examination commenced with an assessment of saliva swallowing. Spontaneous swallowing of saliva and swallowing frequency were assessed while preparing for the test and positioning the patient.

If it proved impossible to facilitate a swallowing attempt, the examination was terminated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Liquid and semisolid food</title><p>For the remainder of the examination, the sequence of food consistencies was selected at random. The WST involved testing two volumes each of 5, 10 and 20&#x000a0;ml water in ascending order. The patient was instructed to drink each volume of liquid in one go. The BST involved testing 1&#x000a0;g (1/3 teaspoon), 2.5&#x000a0;g (1/2 teaspoon) and 5&#x000a0;g (1 teaspoon) of jelly in ascending order. In order to monitor voice tone, patients were asked to phonate an &#x02018;ah&#x02019; sound after each individual swallow attempt. A break of 1&#x000a0;min was allowed between each swallow, during which the investigator observed whether the patient was able to remove any residues (check for coughing with or without follow-up swallow). The test was interrupted if the patient was not capable of attempting to swallow, coughed during three swallow attempts or exhibited confused coordination of breathing and swallowing. Swallowing of liquids and semisolid food was assessed using the penetration&#x02013;aspiration scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; liquids were assessed as in the BST).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Fibre-optic endoscopic swallowing examination</title><p>The endoscopic control examinations were carried out independently of the clinical tests by an ENT specialist and a therapist.

The issue of an appropriate clinical screening instrument for obtaining a comprehensive picture of a patient&#x02019;s swallowing ability has been a hot topic for several years.</p><p>This study has been able to demonstrate that the BST and BST<sub>SST</sub> are suitable clinical diagnostic instruments for patients with conditions of both neurological and non-neurological origin (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Results of swallow tests. The results of the swallow tests and combinations of these, sub-divided by underlying disorder</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="405_2011_1628_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>The primary tests used in everyday clinical practice are various modified versions of the WST. The literature describes various versions of the WST with varying results. DePippo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] described the <italic>Burke Dysphagia Screening Test</italic>. Their 1992 study examined 44 stroke patients. It found a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 94%. Hinds et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] adopted DePippo&#x02019;s 3&#x000a0;oz WST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] for their study of 115 stroke patients and added the clinical variables swallow capacity and volume per swallow. With these two clinical variables taken into consideration, they found a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 69%. Excluding these two clinical variables, sensitivity fell to 73%, specificity to 67%. Daniels et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] studied 59 stroke patients using a 70-ml WST. Patients drank two 5&#x000a0;ml, 10&#x000a0;ml and 20&#x000a0;ml volumes of water. Sensitivity was 92.3%, specificity 66.7% (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Comparison of the water swallow test. The results shown for our investigations are for the neurological group only</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="405_2011_1628_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>In our study, the WST did not achieve the high levels of sensitivity described in the literature, but did show a higher specificity. This result applied equally to the neurological group. No values for the remaining test subjects are to be found in the literature. The differences in results between test procedures are likely to be due to modifications to the examination procedure and the variables selected.</p><p>The clinical variables used to assess swallowing ability in the individual test procedures vary between studies. Following a study by Daniels et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], most test procedures take account of evaluation of voice and the occurrence of coughing after swallowing. Logemann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] introduced the <italic>Northern Dysphagia Patient Check Sheet</italic> and cited an aspiration sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 58% for the variable &#x0201c;cough during trail swallows&#x0201d;. On the basis of this study, we added the terms &#x0201c;coughing with follow-up swallow&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;coughing with no follow-up swallow&#x0201d; to the variable &#x02018;cough&#x02019; on our examination sheet. This subdivision was intended to help assess whether patients were able to perceive and deal independently with any residue. In addition to assessing voice, assessment of breathing was also adopted.</p><p>Extending the procedure previously described in the literature, an SST has been added to the clinical examination. The additional evaluation of saliva should allow a better assessment of the patient&#x02019;s everyday abilities, making the results more meaningful. Combining the WST and SST reduced both sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity was also reduced in each of the sub-groups although specificity remained unchanged in the non-neurological group (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Contrary to our hypothesis, the comparability of the consistencies of saliva and water meant that combining the SST and WST results did not allow more meaningful conclusions to be drawn.</p><p>In contrast to the clinical experience that, at least for patients with disorders of neurological origin, semisolid food is more easily swallowed, BSTs have been studied in clinical diagnostics only rarely. Tohara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] studied 63 stroke patients using 3&#x000a0;ml water and 4&#x000a0;g pudding. Their BST had a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 66%. A study by Trapl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] described the <italic>Gugging Swallowing Screen</italic> (GUSS). 50 stroke patients were examined using the GUSS, which required them to swallow varying volumes of water (3, 5, 10, 20, 50&#x000a0;ml) and 1/2 teaspoon of pudding. The GUSS achieved a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 50&#x02013;69% (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Comparison of the bolus swallow test. The results shown for our investigations are for the neurological group only</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="405_2011_1628_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>The BST used in our study achieved a lower sensitivity but significantly higher specificity than comparable studies. Patients who did not have a swallowing disorder were identified with a greater degree of certainty. Where the BST was combined with an SST, sensitivity was increased, whilst specificity was reduced, a finding which applied across both sub-groups (non-neurological and neurological). In this case, the combination of two consistencies appears to improve the quality of the conclusion reached.</p><p>In order to allow comparison with the GUSS, the results of our tests were summarised in a comparable fashion. Combining all of the tests did not achieve the sensitivity of the GUSS. The result of the BST<sub>SST</sub> did, however, exceed that of the GUSS.</p><p>This study confirms that a bolus swallow test offers advantages over a water swallow test. For patients with neurological disorders, who generally have altered sensitivity in addition to motor disorders, the benefit offered by the BST lies in improved perception of the bolus in the oral and pharyngeal cavities and thus better control during the oral phase of swallowing. Water is the more difficult consistency for patients with a swallowing disorder of neurological origin. Despite this fact having been known for many years, previous clinical dysphagia screening tests have primarily tested liquids. One reason for this is concern about the potential risk posed to patients from aspiration of a bolus. This ignores the fact that a bolus such as jelly consists largely of water and is thus more or less equivalent to a liquid. Various studies have shown that the primary factor influencing the occurrence of pneumonia is not the consistency of the substance aspirated, but the bacterial flora within the oral cavity through which the food passes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another reason for using a liquid is the desire to increase the usefulness of the conclusions drawn from the test by increasing its difficulty. However, our investigations show that a combination of an SST and a BST allows the most reliable assessment of aspiration risk to be made.</p><p>The study is limited by its small sample size. Further studies with larger populations are required. The use of endoscopic examinations to assess aspiration is known to have limitations. Other studies also, however, use endoscopy as a control examination. In many cases, in view of the severity of the patient&#x02019;s underlying condition and the point at which the examination is carried out on the intensive care unit, this is the only option available.</p><p>Previous studies have considered only patients with a neurological disorder and have excluded patients with swallowing disorders of non-neurological origin. Patients who have undergone surgery to remove tumours have in most cases substantial anatomical changes due to resection and, in general, a lesser degree of altered sensitivity. In the non-neurological group, the WST also achieved good results in addition to the good results achieved with the BST. The results presented here show for the first time that a single test procedure can be used to investigate all patients. Other patients groups, such as geriatrics and children, must in future be included in scientific studies of clinical procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study show that the BST offers significant benefits for identifying aspiration for both the test population as a whole and for neurological and non-neurological sub-groups. As well as being highly sensitive and specific, a combination of BST and SST was found to be the only test with a statistically significant correlation with the endoscopic examination. The tests have adequate inter-rater reliability for everyday clinical use. A bolus swallow test should in future form an additional component during clinical diagnosis of dysphagia and dysphagia screening.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Open Access</title><p>This article
