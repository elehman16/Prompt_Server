				<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of music on elevated state of anxiety as
many patients become stressed and anxious during diagnostic procedures. The study was
conducted on 104 consecutive patients undergoing GI endoscopy for various reasons.
Patients were randomly assigned to two groups regardless of sex, age and underlying
disease. One group of 54 patients were made to listen to a recorded Indian classical instrumental
music before and during the procedure, while the other group of 50 patients did not.
Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate were recorded at the beginning of consultation
and end of procedure. Perception of procedure using a three point attitude scale was
assessed. Our results indicate that the background Indian classical music is efficacious in
reducing psychological distress during a gastroscopic examination. We suggest that music
could be applied to other medical situations as well, which tend to generate undue psychological
stress and anxiety. Music, as a familiar personal and culture medium, can be used to
ease anxiety, to act as distractor, to increase discomfort and pain threshold.</p>
