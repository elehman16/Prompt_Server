While a number of conceptual definitions have been offered,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> the most common considers shared decision-making a process in which providers and patients exchange information, deliberate about available options together and come to agreement on the option to implement.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Shared decision-making is conceptually distinct from paternalistic decision-making, which assumes that the patient&#x02019;s preferences have no place in the decision-making process and from informed decision-making, which assumes that the provider&#x02019;s only legitimate role in the decision-making process is information provision.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref>
</p><p>Proponents of shared decision-making have described it as an &#x02018;ethical imperative&#x02019;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and the &#x02018;pinnacle of patient-centred care&#x02019;.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There is also a growing body of evidence of its generally positive impact on patient affective-cognitive, behavioural and health outcomes in a range of clinical contexts.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In contraceptive care, shared decision-making may represent a strategy for promoting health and well-being while safeguarding patient autonomy, the importance of which is emphasised in key practice guidelines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> For example, shared decision-making about contraceptive methods may facilitate the prevention of unintended or unwelcome pregnancies by increasing the likelihood that people choose methods aligned with their individual preferences and values, are satisfied with the methods they adopt and use them in a way that takes full advantage of their potential contraceptive and other benefits. The anticipated gains from shared decision-making about contraceptive methods may be particularly pronounced for members of minority racial and ethnic groups and people of low socioeconomic status, who experience significant disparities in contraceptive care and outcomes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>Despite the numerous observed and theoretical advantages of shared decision-making, there remains a paucity of evidence on how to facilitate its adoption. A recent systematic review of interventions for improving the adoption of shared decision-making by healthcare providers found that, while interventions targeting patients alone (eg, question prompt lists) or providers alone (eg, audit and feedback) had some&#x02014;if modest&#x02014;positive effects on the adoption of shared decision-making, effects were generally greater when interventions targeted both groups.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, based on the small number and poor quality of available studies, reviewers were tentative in their conclusions and advocated for further research to respond to this important knowledge gap. Answering this call, this paper describes the protocol for a study that will assess the comparative effectiveness of patient-targeted and provider-targeted interventions for facilitating shared decision-making about contraceptive methods in the healthcare visit.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objectives</title><p>The first objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a patient-targeted intervention (a video+prompt&#x02009;card that encourages patients to ask three specific questions in the healthcare visit) and a provider-targeted intervention (decision aids+training for providers in their use; see <italic>Interventions</italic>), on shared decision-making about contraceptive methods in the healthcare visit. The second objective is to evaluate the effect of these interventions on the occurrence of a conversation about contraception in the healthcare visit, satisfaction with the conversation about contraception, intended contraceptive method(s), intention to use a highly effective method, values concordance of the intended method(s), decision regret, contraceptive method(s) used, use of a highly effective method, use of the intended method(s), adherence, satisfaction with the method(s) used, unintended pregnancy and unwelcome pregnancy (see <italic>Outcomes and measures</italic>). The third objective is to evaluate the feasibility of the interventions (operationalised as rates of patient exposure to the interventions) and their acceptability to patients<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">i</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Research questions</title><p>There are four research questions pertaining to the first study objective: (1) does implementing the video+prompt&#x02009;card increase the rate of shared decision-making about contraceptive methods compared to usual care? (2)&#x000a0;does implementing the decision aids+training increase the rate of shared decision-making about contraceptive methods compared to usual care? (3)&#x000a0;does implementing the video+prompt&#x02009;card <italic>and</italic> the decision aids+training result in greater increases in the rate of shared decision-making about contraceptive methods compared to usual care than implementing either of the interventions alone? and (4)&#x000a0;what patient characteristics and other factors modify the effect of implementing the interventions on the rate of shared decision-making about contraceptive methods?

This design will enable us to assess the effect of the two interventions, both alone and together, as compared with usual care. The clusters will be clinics (see <italic>Study setting</italic>) and participants will be a subset of patients attending these clinics (see <italic>Participants</italic>). While a cluster randomised controlled trial requires more participants than would a trial with a different approach to randomisation, we consider a cluster design most robust to prevent the contamination possible if the unit of randomisation were to be patients or providers.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study setting</title><p>The trial will take place in 16 clinics in the Northeast United States, permitting the recommended minimum of four clusters per trial arm to minimise potential confounding from cluster effects.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Participating clinics may be primary care and/or reproductive healthcare clinics but must deliver contraceptive care, which we define as providing contraceptive methods on site, prescribing or referring people for contraceptive methods and/or counselling people about contraceptive methods. Participating clinics must also have sufficient patient flow that staff are confident to be able to facilitate 10 eligible patients, on average, completing a postvisit survey each week. Within each clinic, contraceptive care may be provided by any person with relevant training (eg, a physician, nurse, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, midwife, non-medically&#x000a0;licensed counsellor). Participating clinics may operate in hospital or community settings, be located in rural or urban areas, be publicly or privately funded and be for-profit or not-for-profit. Participating clinics may deliver services in more than one geographic location but, to minimise contamination, may not employ someone who delivers contraceptive care in another participating clinic and may not employ a study investigator. Participating clinics will receive monetary compensation for the time expended by clinic staff on data collection and other administrative activities related to their role in the study. A list of participating clinics may be requested.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Video+prompt card (patient-targeted intervention)</title><p>We developed a brief video intended to be viewed by patients in the clinic immediately before the healthcare visit. The video was designed to enhance patients&#x02019; motivation, skills and self-efficacy to ask their providers three questions in the healthcare visit: (1) what are my options? (2) Wwhat are the possible pros and cons of those options? and (3) How likely are each of those pros and cons to happen to me? Earlier iterations of these questions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">ii</xref></sup> increased shared decision-making when used by unannounced standardised patients in a primary care setting in Australia<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and were the focus of the AskShareKnow programme, a multipronged intervention that was feasible to implement in a reproductive and sexual healthcare setting in Australia and acceptable to patients.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The video was adapted from a 4-min video that comprised one component of the AskShareKnow programme.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Our adaptation features a patient sharing a personal account of her experiences of healthcare, communicating the benefits of asking questions, normalising challenges associated with asking questions and encouraging people to ask the three target questions. The format and content of the adaptation responded to patient and stakeholder perspectives solicited via discussions among the research team (which includes patient partners and stakeholder representatives), focus groups with patients and consultation with the patient featured in the adaptation, who has since joined our research team. We developed versions of the video in English and Spanish, each with and without on-screen captions. We will supply clinics with tablet computers programmed to view the videos and headphones.</p><p>We also developed a small prompt card intended to be distributed to patients who view the video. The card was designed to remind patients of the three questions presented in the video. The prompt card was adapted from a refrigerator magnet that comprised another component of the AskShareKnow programme.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Again, we developed versions of the prompt card in English and Spanish. We will supply clinics with the prompt cards and display stands.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Decision aids+training (provider-targeted intervention)</title><p>We developed seven one-page decision aids on contraceptive methods intended to be used by providers with patients during the healthcare encounter. There are decision aids on long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, short-acting reversible methods, barrier methods, natural methods, permanent methods and emergency methods as well a decision aid that provides an overview of these six categories of contraceptive methods. The decision aids were designed to help providers facilitate shared decision-making about contraceptive methods in the healthcare visit. The format of the decision aids was adapted from that used in Option Grid decision aids for clinical encounters, which have been found to increase shared decision-making in osteoarthritis care<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and to be acceptable to physicians.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> We engaged patients and stakeholders in developing the decision aids, including via a survey of patients and contraceptive care providers,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> patient focus groups and review of decision aid iterations by patient partners and stakeholder representatives. We developed versions of the decisions aids in English and Spanish. We will supply clinics with tear-pads of the decision aids and display stands.</p><p>We also developed a 5-min training video and accompanying written guidance intended to be viewed by providers before beginning to use the decision aids (and as frequently as desired thereafter). The training video and frequently asked questions were designed to enhance providers&#x02019; motivation, skills and self-efficacy to use the decision aids to facilitate shared decision-making in the healthcare visit. The content of the training video was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> which was devised to guide implementation research that involves healthcare provider behaviour change. The video features an Obstetrician-Gynaecologist, Nurse Practitioner and patient representative explaining how decision aids can support the delivery of quality healthcare and providing guidance on using the decision aids with patients. The written guidance reinforces and elaborates on training video content. We will host the training video and frequently asked questions on the study website. One or more clinic representatives will be charged with encouraging and enabling relevant healthcare providers in the clinic to review the training video and written guidance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Implementation of interventions</title><p>The strategies we developed to support adoption of the interventions purposefully omitted elements difficult to scale (eg, face-to-face training by intervention developers, periodic feedback on rates of patient exposure to the interventions) to maximise the ecological validity of study findings. For the video and prompt card, we developed a set of presentation slides for clinic staff that provides guidance on their objectives and implementation. The slide deck will be hosted on the study website, along with a preview of the video and prompt card. One or more clinic representatives will be charged with encouraging and enabling others in the clinic to review the slide deck. For the decision aids and training, we also developed a set of presentation slides for clinic staff that provides guidance on their objectives and implementation. The slide deck will be hosted on the study website. Again, one or more clinic representatives will be charged with encouraging and enabling others in the clinic to review the slide deck. To further approximate real-world conditions, we will not prevent clinics from implementing concomitant interventions or care during the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Data collection</title><p>We will collect study data via longitudinal patient surveys administered immediately after the index healthcare visit (T1), four weeks (ie, 28 days) after the index healthcare visit (T2) and six months (ie, 182 days) after the index healthcare visit (T3) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Participants may elect to complete surveys in English or Spanish. The T1 survey will be administered in clinics using tablet computers and the Qualtrics online survey platform.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> At the end of the T1 survey, we will invite a subset of participants (see <italic>Participants</italic>) to give permission to be recontacted for the T2 and T3 surveys. Participants aged 20 years and older may elect to complete these surveys online (with email correspondence) or on paper (with postal mail correspondence). Participants aged under 20 years may only elect to complete these surveys online (with email correspondence) to safeguard their privacy. A unique password will be used to link participant responses across surveys. Copies of the surveys may be requested.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Data collection schematic</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017830f01"/></fig><p>We have devised several strategies to maximise data quality. We chose to collect data via surveys rather than interviews given the vulnerability of the topic area to social desirability bias.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> For the T1 survey, which will be administered in clinics and collect data on participants&#x02019; care experiences and evaluations, we elected to use an online survey completed via tablet computer to ensure no handling of surveys by clinic staff and thus reinforce the confidentiality of responses. The study information sheet also reassures participants that no healthcare providers from participating clinics will have access to identified participant-level data. For all surveys, we used programmed or instructional skips to ensure that participants will be asked only relevant questions, thereby minimising survey fatigue. In the online surveys, we also implemented additional data quality strategies, such as pop-up messages that notify participants of missed questions and invite them to respond prior to proceeding to the next page.</p><p>We will also administer the T1, T2 and T3 surveys to a group of patients who attend participating clinics before we begin the trial. This &#x02018;pilot&#x02019; data collection will replicate the trial data collection and thus, allow clinic staff time to become proficient in data collection processes. A further advantage of this pilot data collection is that we can assess equivalence between clinics in the usual rate of shared decision-making about contraceptive methods, adopt stratified assignment of clinics to trial arms if warranted (see <italic>Assignment</italic>) and statistically adjust for the usual rate of shared decision-making in relevant data analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Assignment</title><p>Each clinic will be assigned to one of the four trial arms using permuted-block randomisation with an equal allocation ratio to achieve balance in the number of clinics per trial arm. Should we observe non-equivalence between clinics in the rate of shared decision-making about contraceptive methods during the pilot data collection period, we will adopt stratified permuted-block randomisation. Specifically, we will rank clinics according to the rate of shared decision-making and construct four strata based on this ranking, with one clinic assigned to each trial arm in each stratum.

First, we chose to implement the trial in 16 clinics in reasonable proximity to our research institution. This minimised costs and thus enabled us to enrol the recommended minimum number of clusters per trial arm.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, potential confounding from cluster effects may have been further minimised by a greater number of clinics and the racial, ethnic and linguistic diversity of participants enhanced by greater geographical diversity in clinics. Second, we chose to collect minimal contact information for participants eligible for the T2 and T3 surveys. Given the sensitivity of the topic, we considered this important for preventing both barriers to recruitment and risks to participants&#x02019; privacy. However, this simultaneously limited opportunities for participant contact and may compromise retention. Third, while clinic estimates of the total number of eligible patients during the study period will enable calculation of the participation rate, a lack of information on the characteristics of all eligible patients will preclude conclusions about sample representativeness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Research ethics approval</title><p>Institutional Review Board approval for the study was granted by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College (Study #00028721) as well as by an external Institutional Review Board affiliated with one participating clinic.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Consent</title><p>When adopting a cluster randomised study design, it is not usually feasible to obtain participants&#x02019; consent to randomisation.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 47 48</xref> Instead, consent to randomisation is typically provided by a surrogate decision-maker at the cluster level.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> We will obtain agreement to randomisation from a representative from each clinic and will seek eligible patients&#x02019; informed consent to participate in data collection for the study.</p><p>To eliminate barriers to participation and minimise risks to participants, we were granted Institutional Review Board approval for a waiver of documented informed consent and for a waiver of parental consent for participants aged 15&#x02013;17 years.

Patients who select &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; in response to the question &#x02018;Now that you have read this information, do you agree to participate in this study?&#x02019; that follows this electronic information sheet will be taken as having given informed consent and will proceed to the T1 survey immediately. Paper copies of the information sheet will also be available in participating clinics. The study information sheet may be requested.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Privacy and confidentiality</title><p>We have adopted several strategies to protect the privacy of participants. We were granted Institutional Review Board approval for a waiver of documented informed consent (see <italic>Consent</italic>) and will administer the provision of participant compensation from the research institution so that no information on participants will be stored in any clinic. The waiver of documented informed consent also means that patients can participate in the study without ever providing their name or contact details if they are willing to forego compensation. Participants aged under 20 years may only elect to complete the T2 and T3 surveys online (with email communication) to safeguard their privacy. Participants aged 20 years and older who elect to complete the T2 and T3 surveys on paper will receive (and send) all associated correspondence in unbranded envelopes. We will use an otherwise meaningless random code generated during T1 survey completion to link participant surveys across the three time points. Finally, we have restricted access to identified participant-level data and files (see <italic>Data management</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Monitoring</title><p>Following internal institutional consultation, we determined that a formal Data and Safety Monitoring Board was unnecessary due to the minimal risks associated with study participation and the focus of the study on outcomes other than mortality or morbidity.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> We anticipate no harms arising from implementation of the interventions. If we become aware of any harms or other adverse events, either through study data or other avenues, we will review and address these according to standard institutional processes in consultation with the relevant Institutional Review Board(s). We will also file regular reports on trial progress and any adverse events with the Institutional Review Boards. Although we intend to conduct some analyses of pilot data collected before assigning clinics to trial arms, we do not anticipate undertaking any interim analyses of trial outcome data and have not devised any stopping guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Dissemination policy</title><sec id="s3e1"><title>Full protocol</title><p>Members of the scientific community and the public can access the full study protocol via this open access publication.
