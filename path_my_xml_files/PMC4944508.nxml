The gender distribution also did not differ significantly across groups (&#x003c7;2 (2, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;72) =3.29, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07). Measures of FPG (t(70)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77), 2hPG (t(70)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.96, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.054) and HbAlc (t(70)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.12, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.27) similarly did not differ between groups at baseline. Comparison of the taVNS and sham taVNS groups using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a significant difference in 2hPG between groups over the course of the experiment (F(2)&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.79, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004) (Figure 4 and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The decrease in 2hPG was significantly greater in the taVNS group compared to that in the sham taVNS group (Table 3). After adjusting for age, gender, and BMI, the effect remained significant (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Measures of FPG (FGG (1.84)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.48, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.093) and HbAlc (F(1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63) did not differ significantly between the taVNS and sham taVNS groups over time in both crude analysis and after adjusting for age, gender, and BMI (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For FPG, Mauchly&#x02019;s Test of Sphericity indicated that assumptions of sphericity were violated, thus Greenhouse Geisser corrected degrees of freedom were used. Further analysis of other secondary outcomes indicated that the taVNS and sham taVNS groups differed significantly in systolic blood pressure over time (F(1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.21, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.044).

All effects remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, and BMI (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Analysis of other secondary outcomes, with comparison between the taVNS and no-treatment control groups, indicated that there were no significant differences between the two groups in systolic blood pressure (F(1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.99, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32). diastolic blood pressure (F(1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.27, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.27), or BMI (F(1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.96) over time. Repeated measures ANOVA between the sham taVNS and no-treatment control groups showed that the two groups differed significantly in their levels of 2hPG (FGG(1.72)&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.51, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and HbAlc (F(1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.94, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;.018) over the course of the experiment. Measures of both 2hPG and HbAlc increased over the 12&#x000a0;weeks in the control group, and decreased over the course of the 12&#x000a0;weeks in the sham taVNS treatment group. After controlling for age, gender, and BMI, only the effect for change in 2hPG remained significant (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">5</xref>).
