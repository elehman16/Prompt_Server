stabilization exercise on neck posture, muscle activity, pain, and quality of life in
individuals with neck pain and forward head posture. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen
participants were recruited according to the selection criteria and were randomly
allocated to the scapular stabilization group (n=8) and the control group (n=7). The
scapular stabilization group underwent training for 30 minutes a day, 3 times a week for 4
weeks; the control group performed relaxation exercises for 4 weeks. [Results] After
training the scapular stabilization group showed significant improvement on the
craniovertebral angle, upper trapezius muscle activity, serratus anterior muscle activity,
Neck Disability Index scores, Visual Analog Scale scores, and World Health Organization
Quality of Life Assessment-BREF scores compared to those in the control group.
[Conclusion] Scapular stabilization exercise can help improve the head posture and pain in
the patients with neck pain and forward head posture. Controlling the muscular activities
through scapular stabilization exercise also improves the patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Neck pain</kwd><kwd>Scapular stabilization exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neck pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders, next to back pain. Many
people seek medical centers for the treatment at least once in their lifetime<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Individuals with chronic neck pain have
altered postural behaviors due to the tasks that require prolonged sitting such as
computer-based work, paper work in the office, or industry-related tasks. Most of the
patients with neck pain spend all day in sitting position. Continuous neck pain has the
potential to change the biomechanics of the cervical spine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Forward head posture frequently appears in the patients with neck disorders. Approximately
60% of the neck pain patients are reported to have forward head posture. Continuous forward
head posture increases the load on the posterior cervical structures such as bones,
ligaments, joint capsules, and muscles, and changes scapular kinematics and kinetics<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have shown that forward
head posture leads to shortening of the posterior neck extensors, tightening of the anterior
neck and shoulder muscles, and affects scapular position and kinematics<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Serratus anterior and upper trapezius muscles are the
primary stabilizers of the scapula that regulate the force to control scapular motion for
functional activities. Properly coupled motions of these two muscles are considered
necessary for correct scapular movements, including proper initiation and recruitment of the
muscles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abnormal scapular orientations
can alter the activation of the stabilizing muscles such as levator scapulae and upper
trapezius muscles, and also the mobilizing muscles such as rhomboids and pectoralis
minor<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Traditional ways to treat neck pain include deep neck flexor stabilizing exercises, manual
therapy, electrical therapy, and non-surgical interventions. Helgadottir et al. revealed
that changes in scapular orientation caused neck pain in the patients who performed reaching
or weight-lifting tasks with their upper extremities<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies reported that neck pain during upper extremity tasks
is due to a change in the upper trapezius muscle activity and alters scapular axis in
scapular orientation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The strategies for
dealing with neck pain can include scapular posture stabilization, upper trapezius and
serratus anterior muscle activity regulation, and muscle re-education. Another possible way
to improve neck pain and mechanical dysfunctions of the cervical spine is to exercise the
neck and shoulder muscles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
scapular stabilization exercise on neck posture, muscle activity, neck pain, and quality of
life in the patients with neck pain and forward head posture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The researchers recruited a total of 15 patients with neck pain. The inclusion criteria
were as follows: (1) craniovertebral (CV) angle of 44 degrees or less, (2) suffered at least
3 months of neck pain, (3) no cervical or shoulder neurological movement disorder, and (4)
shoulder flexion at least 130 degrees or more. This study excluded if they had a history of:
(1) cervical surgery and cervical spine fracture, (2) temporomandibular surgery, (3)
pathologic trauma, and (4) psychosocial problem. This study informed all participants of the
purpose and procedures of this study, after which the subjects signed a consent from for
participation. The local institutional review board approved the study.</p><p>This study involved a pretest-posttest control group design. This study assigned the 15
participants to the experimental group (n=8) and the control group (n=7), based on the
demographic characteristics of the subjects. Subjects in the experimental group performed
scapular stabilization exercise for 30 minutes per session, 3 days a week for 4 weeks while
the control group conducted relaxation exercises for the same period. The scapular
stabilization exercise was composed of five stages: (1) in supine position, the patient was
instructed to take a deep breath to relax the body while holding his shoulders and neck in a
comfortable posture; (2) the patient bent his knees and placed his feet flat on the floor,
and held the posture without any neck movement. Then the patient raised his dominant arm to
90&#x000b0; shoulder flexion with full elbow extension and scapular protraction. This posture was
held for 10 seconds before returning to the starting position<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three laps of 10 repetitions with one-minute break in between were
performed; (3) in quadruped position, the patient lifted up his arms alternatively with
shoulder abduction and 120 &#x000b0; flexion. This posture was held for 10 seconds before returning
to the starting position. Three laps of 10 repetitions with 30-second break in between were
performed; (4) in sitting position with 90&#x000b0; knee flexion on a stool or bed without back
support, the patient held a pair of dumbbells (2&#x02005;kg) in each hand and laterally lifted them
up while maintaining the height of scapulae below 80&#x000b0;. This scapular position was held for
10 seconds before returning to the starting position<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three laps of 10 repetitions with 30-second break in between were
performed; (5) in sitting position, a mirror was placed in front of the patient. The patient
was instructed to check and correct his posture by himself. To evaluate the effects of
scapular stabilization exercise, this study used the following outcome measures: CV angle,
surface electromyography, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Neck disability index (NDI), and
World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF).</p><p>This study used SPSS for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for data
analysis. A paired t-test was used to compare pre and post-treatment results of each group.
An independent t-test was used to determine the changes in the experimental group compared
to the control (reported as the mean&#x000b1;standard deviation). The statistical significance level
was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The researchers recruited a total of 15 patients with neck pain (11 men, four women, aged

patterns and motor control, and that these muscles are replaced by other muscles to perform
similar movements<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Movement pattern correction is an important part of
muscle-recruiting strategies in rehabilitation. Recovering the normal activation of the
serratus anterior and trapezius muscles is essential for neck and shoulder disorder
rehabilitation. A study by Wegner et al. reported that patients with forward head posture
showed more anterior-tilted shoulder joints, lesser serratus anterior muscle activity, and
greater scapular internal rotation during shoulder flexion compared to normal subjects<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thigpen et al. reported that patients
with forward head posture had a significantly decreased activity in the serratus anterior
muscle when performing overhead shoulder flexion tasks. The authors suggested that the
change in the serratus anterior muscle activity is one of the reasons for biomechanical
changes in the scapula<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Holtermann et al.
showed that the decreased activity of the upper trapezius muscle and the increased activity
of the serratus anterior muscle through motor control leads to functional changes associated
with head posture<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proper firing
patterns and recruitment of muscles require coupling of the serratus anterior muscle with
the upper, middle, and lower trapezius muscles, consequently resulting in &#x0201c;force couples,&#x0201d;
which are considered necessary for normal scapular orientation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the main goal was to inhibit the over activity of muscle
(i.e., upper trapezius) and to facilitate the muscle with weak activity (i.e., lower
trapezius and serratus anterior) for postural control. Previous research studied
artificially increased upper trapezius muscle activity and found that it increased the
forward head angle. The main goal of the study was to inhibit over-activation of the muscle
(i.e., upper trapezius) and to facilitate the weak muscles (i.e., lower trapezius and
serratus anterior) for postural control<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the serratus anterior and upper trapezius muscles are
more controlled in the forward head posture after training in this study, and resulting
scapular or thoracoscapular position are changed from normal to the forward head posture.
The training in this study resulted in the most controlled use of the serratus anterior and
upper trapezius muscles, and brought the scapular and thoracoscapular positions closer to
normal from forward head posture.</p><p>This study used VAS, NDI, and WHOQOL-BREF to estimate the recovery of pain, activity
limitations according to disability, and quality of life. Neck pain with forward head
posture is associated with many different conditions such as excessive workload, postural
disorders, psychological state, poor postures, and structural disorders<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this makes neck pain with forward head posture a
more common disease than other musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disorders. Correlation
between pain and its severity was found in neck pain patients with forward head posture.
Chronic neck pain affects active participations in daily activities and influences emotional
control, and may lead to depression associated with frustration and anger. Pain can also
deteriorate the quality of life, which is considered an important indicator of health
care<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The exercise program used in this study was 4 weeks long, which is a relatively short
amount of time, and therefore, the results of this study could not determine the long-term
effects of the exercise. Another limitation of this study is the small sample size; making
it difficult to generalize the effects of scapular stabilizing exercise. In addition, the
subjects with neck pain experienced fatigue easily and were not able to concentrate for a
long time; we did provide the subjects with a break after performing loaded flexion task for
EMG analysis. Despite these limitations, the effects of scapular stabilizing exercise on
different degrees of forward head posture and muscular activity in patients with neck pain
can be studied during various scapular movements. Further studies with various exercise
protocols are essential for neck pain patients with forward head posture.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Szeto</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name><name><surname>Straker</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>EMG median frequency changes in the neck-shoulder
