The users were included if they were males, more than 18 years of age, satisfying DSM IV criteria for opiate dependence, already maintained on buprenorphine/buprenorphine-naloxone combination for at least 6 weeks during, which they are stabilized on the medication, willing to receive standard treatment as well as practice Yoga, currently using opiates by injecting route (last One month) or history of two failed abstinence attempts in case of non-injecting opiate users (following conventional treatment), were from a defined catchment area and provided informed consent. They were excluded if they had a severe physical illness or disability due to which they may be unable to participate in the program or unable to come for follow-up, presence of current psychiatric illness, impairment of cognitive functions as assessed clinically and refusal to participate in the study. No incentives were paid to the sample for participation in the study.

A WHO QOL BREF Hindi translation[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] was used.

Within the group, changes were compared for baseline as compared to 3 months follow-up and 6 months follow-up separately. For study group, compared to baseline, no differences in Physical domain scores at 3 months follow-up were observed, the scores however increased significantly at 6 months follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). For psychological domain, compared to baseline, scores decreased significantly at 3 months follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) but increased significantly at 6 months follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

The addition of SKY further still improved QOL scores in all four domains &#x02013; physical, psychological, social relations, and environmental for study group at 6 months indicating a causal relationship for these changes. Both study and control group showed lower domain scores at 3 months in physical well-being. This domain is characterized by pain, energy, sleep, mobility and activities and though being on treatment reduces pain, drug hunger, improves sleep patterns but probably this sense of improvement diminishes as treatment continues and they no longer feel any physical progress. Another possible reason for this may be that the internal standard by which patients appraise themselves shifts and the same items elicit fundamentally different answers over time. Higher and significant physical domain scores at 6 months probably indicate cumulative positive effects of SKY intervention. The psychological domain scores improved both at three and 6 months. This domain has items on positive feelings, cognitions, self-esteem, body image, negative feelings, and spirituality. It is likely that Yoga and meditation produces cognitive restructuring or change in perception of self and situations. The environmental domain has items on safety and security; home environment; finance; health social care; information, leisure; physical environment and transport. Scores showed improvement due to change in perception of the environmental situation evident both at three and 6 months. The effect size was highest for Psychological followed by environment and then physical domain. No between-group differences in social relationship domain scores probably indicates that following pharmacological treatment both groups had better personal relationships, regained trust from their families and relatives and were receiving social support. These initial study results indicate that participation in SKY program enhanced QOL of substance users undergoing the same and possibly support a biological mechanism of SKY in producing beneficial effects. Negative Urine drug screening[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] results at 6 months follow-up indicated no drug use, lapse/relapse for all in the study group. The addition of SKY breathing technique helped study group to emerge out of addiction and further possible relapses.</p><p>The strength of our study is that it is the first randomized control trial to see the effect of comprehensive yogic breathing in improving QOL and promoting abstinence among opioid dependent users. A limitation of our study is that the sample size was small; therefore, to further confirm the benefit, a larger sample size needs to be studied. Lastly, a 2:1 ratio of study and control group is not usually taken and can be avoided in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The SKY intervention produced a significant change in the QOL of opioid dependent users as compared to control the group. The SKY program holds promise and can be used as a beneficial, low-risk adjunct for substance users undergoing treatment. Though proper training by a skilled teacher is essential for the safe and effective practice of SKY, its daily practice will maximize the benefits. Substance use treatment providers may be encouraged to use SKY as an adjunct to the treatment process of substance users.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The investigators are grateful to AYUSH for providing funds to conduct the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Shukla</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rehabilitation of drug-addicted persons: The experience of the nav-chetna center in India</article-title><source>Bull Narc</source><year>1988</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>43</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3064843</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kraftsow</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Yoga for Wellness</article-title><year>1999</year><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Penguin Compass</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Malathi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Damodaran</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Patil</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Maratha</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of yogic practices on subjective well being</article-title><source>Indian J Physiol Pharmacol</source><year>2000</year><volume>44</volume><fpage>202</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10846636</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Woodyard</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Exploring the therapeutic effects of yoga and its ability to increase quality of life</article-title><source>Int J Yoga</source><year>2011</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>49</fpage><lpage>54</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22022122</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dhawan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Chopra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Does buprenorphine maintenance improve the quality of life of opioid users?</article-title><source>Indian J Med Res</source><year>2013</year><volume>137</volume><fpage>130</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23481062</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zope</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Zope</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sudarshan kriya yoga: Breathing for health</article-title><source>Int J Yoga</source><year>2013</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>4</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23440614</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhawan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Chopra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Addiction research centres and the nurturing of creativity: National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, India &#x02013; A profile</article-title><source>Addiction</source><year>2013</year><volume>108</volume><fpage>1705</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23075217</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Skevington</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lotfy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Connell</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name></person-group><collab>WHOQOL Group</collab><article-title>The World Health Organization's WHOQOL-BREF quality of life assessment: Psychometric properties and results of the international field trial.
