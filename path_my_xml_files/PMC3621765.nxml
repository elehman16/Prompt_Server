The subjects were classified to an amnestic MCI group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) with neuroimaging measures, and other MCI group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) before the randomization. Subjects in each group were randomized to either a multicomponent exercise or an education control group using a ratio of 1&#x02236;1. The exercise group exercised for 90 min/d, 2 d/wk, 40 times for 6 months. The exercise program was conducted under multitask conditions to stimulate attention and memory. The control group attended two education classes. A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that no group &#x000d7; time interactions on the cognitive tests and brain atrophy in MCI patients. A sub-analysis of amnestic MCI patients for group &#x000d7; time interactions revealed that the exercise group exhibited significantly better Mini-Mental State Examination (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.04) and logical memory scores (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.04), and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.05) compared to the control group. Low total cholesterol levels before the intervention were associated with an improvement of logical memory scores (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.05), and a higher level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly related to improved ADAS-cog scores (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The results suggested that an exercise intervention is beneficial for improving logical memory and maintaining general cognitive function and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy in older adults with amnestic MCI. Low total cholesterol and higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor may predict improvement of cognitive functions in older adults with MCI.

The number of older adults living with AD is predicted to increase from the current 26.6 million to 106.2 million by 2050 globally. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Brookmeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> The current standard of care for mild to moderate AD involves treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to improve cognitive function. The <italic>N</italic>-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist memantine has also been reported to improve cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe AD. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Emre1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> While these drugs improve the symptoms of AD, they do not have substantial disease-modifying effects. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Citron1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Thus, attempts have been made to identify individuals at increased risk of AD, and to test interventions that might delay the progression of prodromal symptoms of dementia.</p><p>An association has been proposed between regular participation in physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, and a variety of cognitive benefits. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Lautenschlager1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Scherder1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-vanUffelen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Lam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> Several meta-analyses have reported that physical activity is associated with improvements in attention, processing speed, and executive function in older adults with and without cognitive impairments. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Angevaren1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-vanUffelen2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> However, these studies produced some inconsistent findings, with some reporting cognitive gains in memory function <xref rid="pone.0061483-vanUffelen2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and other study reporting equivocal results. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Angevaren1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>
</p><p>Evidence from neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies has suggested that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a clinical prodrome to degenerative dementias such as AD. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> For example, a population-based study in Sweden reported that the relative risks of progression to dementia in a 3-year follow-up in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe cognitive impairment (without dementia), were 3.6, 5.4, and 7.0, respectively. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> However, of the individuals with MCI, 11% remained stable, and 25% exhibited an improvement in cognitive function between baseline and follow-up observation. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> This variation in MCI populations should be examined to facilitate the development of interventions for inhibiting the progression of dementia. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to investigate the effects of exercise or physical activity on cognitive function in older adults with MCI. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Lautenschlager1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Scherder1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-vanUffelen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Lam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> These studies have revealed the effects of exercise or physical activity on cognitive function, including executive function, in older adults with MCI. However, the effect of exercise on memory function in this population remains unclear.</p><p>The precise neurobiological mechanism for the improvement of cognitive functions remains unknown, however a large number of rodent studies suggest a central role of certain molecules such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The molecules have been shown to facilitate neurogenesis in the hippocampus, promote synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and angiogenesis and enhance growth and protection of neurovasculature. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Neeper1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> In fact, some neuroimaging studies of human subjects revealed that aerobic exercise increased hippocampal volume, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Erickson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and gray and white matter regions including the cingulate cortex, supplementary motor cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Colcombe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>
</p><p>The present randomized trial was designed to test whether a 6-month supervised multicomponent exercise program could reduce the rate of cognitive decline, especially in memory function, and reduce the rate of brain volume decline among older adults with MCI. The multicomponent exercise program included aerobic exercise, muscle strength training, and postural balance retraining, because previous reviews suggested that combined aerobic exercise and strength training interventions improved attention and working memory to a greater extent than aerobic exercise alone. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-Colcombe2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> We explored the biomarkers for identifying improvement of cognitive functions.

Inclusion criteria specified that prospective participants were community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years and over. A total of 528 prospective participants with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5, or who complained of memory impairment, were recruited in the first round of eligibility assessments. Of these, 135 subjects satisfied the requirements of the second round of eligibility assessments, which included neuropsychological tests, which included language and memory tests, attention and executive function tests, clinical diagnosis, activities of daily living (ADL), educational level, and magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-five subjects were excluded, meaning that a total of 100 subjects took part in the study (mean age, 75.4&#x000b1;7.1 years; 65&#x02013;95 years, men n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;55, 51%). All subjects met the definition of MCI as per the Petersen criteria. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Petersen2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> All MCI subjects had objective impairments in either episodic memory and/or executive functioning at least 1.5 standard deviations below the age-adjusted mean for at least one of the neuropsychological tests. Final classification of subjects was based on the above factors and consensus of a team of neuroscientists. Exclusion criteria included a CDR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, or a CDR of 1&#x02013;3, a history of neurological, psychiatric, or cardiac disorders or other severe health issues, use of donepezil, impairment in basic activities of daily living (ADL), and participation in other research projects. Subjects were classified to an amnestic MCI group (aMCI) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) with neuroimaging measures, and other MCI group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) before the randomization.

The purpose, nature, and potential risks of the experiments were fully explained to the subjects, and all subjects gave written, informed consent before participating in the study. The subjects had the capacity to consent because they maintained general cognitive function and daily activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>The six-month, multicomponent exercise program included biweekly 90-minute sessions involving aerobic exercise, muscle strength training, postural balance retraining, and dual-task training. In addition, the exercise program included a focus on promoting exercise and behavior change. Two trained physiotherapists involved in geriatric rehabilitation conducted each intervention. Each exercise class contained 16&#x02013;17 participants, and each supervised session began with a 10-min warm-up period and stretching exercise, followed by 20 min of muscle strength exercise. The subjects then practiced aerobic exercise, postural balance retraining, and dual-task training for 60 min. In the aerobic exercise and postural balance retraining, subjects underwent circuit training, including stair stepping, endurance walking, and walking on balance boards. The mean intensity of the aerobic exercise was approximately 60% of maximum heart rate which was similar to the intensity used in previous studies. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Lautenschlager1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061483-vanUffelen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> Eleven of the 40 classes during the six-month intervention period included approximately 20&#x02013;30 minutes of consecutive outdoor walking. In the dual-task training sessions, subjects performed concurrent cognitive tasks during exercise. For example, the subjects in the exercise group were asked to walk while inventing their own poem, as aerobic exercise. In the ladder training exercise, subjects learned to step in consecutive square segments, and were instructed to step as quickly and accurately as possible. Before and after each session of the program, physiotherapists conducted a health check of each subject. The physiotherapists and a well-trained instructor implemented risk management for accidents and other adverse events during the program. The subjects were instructed to carry out daily home-based muscle strength exercises and walking, which were self-monitored using a booklet and pedometer based on the concept of promoting exercise and behavior change. Attendance at each session was recorded and a transportation service was provided for participants, if necessary, to help subjects maintain their participation in the program.</p><p>Subjects in the education control group attended two education classes about health promotion during the 6-month study period. The class provided information regarding healthy diet, oral care, prevention of urinary incontinence, and health checks. However, the group did not receive specific information regarding exercise, physical activity, or cognitive health.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Cognitive Functions</title><p>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) <xref rid="pone.0061483-Folstein1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) <xref rid="pone.0061483-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> were used to assess general cognitive function.</p><p>Modified versions of the logical memory subtest from the WMS-R <xref rid="pone.0061483-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> was used to assess memory function.

Three-dimensional volumetric acquisition with a T1-weighted gradient echo sequence was then used to produce a gapless series of thin sagittal sections using a magnetization preparation rapid-acquisition gradient-echo sequence (repetition time, 1700 ms; echo time, 4.0 ms; flip angle 15&#x000b0;, acquisition matrix 256&#x000d7;256, 1.3-mm slice thickness).</p><p>In analysis of brain volume, we used the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD), which enables the examination of atrophy of the bilateral medial temporal areas including the entorhinal cortex (MTA-ERC) using voxel-based morphometry. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Hirata1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> The VSRAD has been shown to achieve high accuracy (87.8%) in discriminating patients in the very early stages of AD with MCI from normal control subjects using Z scores. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Hirata1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> A previous VSRAD study reported that atrophy of the MTA-ERC exhibited a clear functional relationship with blood flow changes in the hippocampus, thalamus and temporal lobe, which were suggested to be closely related to inter-regional anatomical and physiological connections. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>
</p><p>Acquired MRI images were formatted to gapless, transaxial images, followed by extraction of the gray matter images using SPM2. Anatomical standardization was used to fit each individual brain to standard template MRIs in the common coordinate system of the MNI T1 MRI template. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Ashburner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> The segmented gray matter images were then subjected to affine and nonlinear standardization using a template of prior gray matter. The anatomically standardized gray matter images were then smoothed again using an isotropic Gaussian kernel 12 mm in full width at half maximum, to determine the partial volume effect and create a spectrum of gray matter intensities. Gray matter intensities were equivalent to the weighted average of gray matter voxels located in the volume fixed by the smoothing kernel. Regional intensity was considered equivalent to gray matter concentration. We compared the gray matter image of each patient with the mean and standard deviation (SD) of gray matter images of healthy volunteers using voxel-by-voxel Z score analysis. In the final step, the Z score was calculated according to the following equation: (Z score&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;((control mean)&#x02212;(individual value))/control SD). The Z score thus reflected the degree of atrophy in bilateral MTA-ERC. Higher Z scores indicated clearer MTA-ERC atrophy. VSRAD also automatically measured the degree of atrophy in the whole brain cortices (WBC), including the hippocampus: if the Z-score was more than 2.0 within a voxel, the area was considered to exhibit atrophy. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Hirata1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> Thus, the proportion of atrophic area in the whole brain (%) was measured in the following way: 100&#x000d7;([the number of voxels with Z-score&#x02265;2.0]/[the number of whole brain voxels]).</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>Biochemical measures3</title><p>T-cho, HbA1c, BDNF, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) were used as biomarkers. Blood samples were collected between 11 am and 4 pm in a non-fasting state.

Serum was then harvested and stored at &#x02212;25 &#x000b0;C until analysis. Analyses were carried out centrally in one laboratory (Special Reference Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). BDNF and VEGFR1 were measured with the Quantikine Human kit (R&#x00026;D systems, Inc. Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Two time points were treated as the within-subjects factor (effect over time) and the differences between the exercise and control groups were treated as the between-subjects factor. When the repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that the group &#x000d7; time interaction was significant, tests of simple main effects were performed to determine which group or groups differed significantly across the intervention period. Alpha level of the post-hoc analyses were adjusted for the Bonferroni method, i.e. corrected alpha&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.025.</p><p>Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of improvements in cognitive function. Dependent variables were the cognitive tests which showed significant improvements in the comparison between before and after the intervention of all subjects. Based on the results from the cognitive tests, the subjects were dichotomized into two categories; the subjects who improved their cognitive test scores (improvement group) and the subjects who showed no improvement, or who exhibited a deterioration in their cognitive test scores (no improvement group). Biochemical variables at baseline measurements were treated as independent variables. Covariates such as age, sex, educational level, and the intervention group were included in the logistic model.</p><p>The univariate analyses and repeated-measures ANOVA were performed with all subjects grouped together as well as with a sub-group that was limited to older adults with aMCI. The logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of improvement of cognitive functions in all subjects.

Animal studies have revealed that the structure and function of the hippocampus, a brain region critical for certain forms of cognition, is adversely affected by hyperlipidemia. (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Farr1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>) Abnormal lipid metabolism may be undesirable status for improvement cognitive functions, especially memory. Exercise is also a valid and feasible way to manage lipoprotein levels and regular activity may be potential strategies for preventing cognitive decline in elderly individuals. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Angevaren2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>
</p><p>One of the main determinants of cell size is cell growth, which is modulated by certain growth factors, such as BDNF. The levels of BDNF-associated gene expression have been found to increase with physical activity. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Neeper1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> BDNF expression has also been suggested to play a role in learning and synaptic plasticity. <xref rid="pone.0061483-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> The present results indicate that high serum BDNF levels have a beneficial effect on general cognitive function in older adults with MCI.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations</title><p>The present study involved several limitations. The small sample size should be addressed by replication with a larger group of adults with MCI. Of the 135 potential subjects screened for eligibility in our study, 35 were excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria, refusal to participate, or medical reasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061483-g001">

</xref>). This selection bias may have affected the generalizability of our findings to population-based samples. Other limitations include unknown group differences in risk factors of cognitive decline and AD, such as apolipoprotein E &#x003b5;4 genotype, and inflammation, although there were no significant differences between groups in terms of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, medications, biomarkers of lipid metabolism, physical performance, instrumental ADL functioning, or depressive mood. In addition, it is possible that the improvement in the exercise group resulted from the social contact to which the intervention group was exposed. This possibility cannot be completely excluded with the present design, and should be addressed in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current results indicate that a multicomponent exercise program can provide cognitive benefits for older adults with aMCI. The effects of exercise were most pronounced for logical memory and general cognitive function in older adults with aMCI. Exercise was found to maintain the atrophy levels of the whole brain cortex in older adults with aMCI. Improvement of cognitive function was associated with low T-cho and high BDNF levels at baseline. A future follow-up investigation is required to determine whether the observed effects are associated with prevention or delayed onset of AD in older adults with MCI.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061483.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
