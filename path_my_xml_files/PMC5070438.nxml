The initial standard therapy for acute asthma includes oxygen supplementation, nebulized beta-2 agonist with or without ipratropium bromide, and corticosteroids (oral or parenteral).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] A subset of children with acute exacerbation has a poor response to initial treatment and requires second-line therapy. The second-line adjuvant therapy may include magnesium sulfate, aminophylline, intravenous (IV) beta-2 agonist, or helium-oxygen, but there is no consensus among asthma care providers regarding the superiority of one treatment modality over the other. A small proportion of hospitalized children with acute asthma even fails to respond to this second-line adjuvant therapy and may need mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Ketamine, a phencyclidine-derived drug, is used frequently in children for procedural sedation and analgesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Adverse effects of ketamine in children are minor, infrequent, and mostly, self-limiting.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Ketamine had sympathomimetic activity and may relieve bronchospasm.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Many case reports, case series, and observational studies had shown the efficacy of ketamine in acute exacerbation of asthma in children who failed to initial therapy.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Aminophylline is a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and causes bronchodilatation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Aminophylline, when added to the standard therapy for acute exacerbation of asthma in children, improved lung function within 6 h of treatment; however, there was no apparent reduction in symptoms and duration of hospital stay. There is insufficient evidence for aminophylline for the impact on oxygenation, pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation. Aminophylline use was associated with a significant increased risk of vomiting.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The standard therapy includes the use of oxygen supplementation, inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist, ipratropium bromide, systemic steroids (if exacerbation is moderate to severe), and magnesium sulfate (if poor response even after adding systemic steroids).</p><p>Ketamine may be a potential therapy for acute asthma in children, but there is a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Children of 1&#x02013;12 years of age with acute moderate-to-severe exacerbation of asthma having PRAM score &#x02265;5 at 2 h of the standard therapy were eligible for inclusion in the study. Treating physician diagnosed asthma in pediatric emergency room. The study person was informed by mobile phone once the diagnosis of acute asthma was made, and he/she was available within minutes to enroll the patient. Patients with a history of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, co-existing primary parenchymal pulmonary disease other than pneumonia due to asthma itself (e.g., cystic fibrosis), or co-existing congenital/acquired heart diseases were excluded from the study. Similarly, patients with known hypertension, known allergy to ketamine or aminophylline, and patients with raised intracranial pressure were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Interventions</title><p>All children with acute exacerbation of asthma received initial standard therapy: Oxygen supplementation; salbutamol nebulization, 0.15 mg/kg (minimum 2.5 mg) for every 20 min for 1<sup>st</sup> h and then 0.5 mg/kg (maximum 10 mg) for every 1 h; ipratropium nebulization 0.5 mg/dose, for every 20 min for 1<sup>st</sup> h, and then 0.5 mg/dose 6 hourly if needed; and systemic steroids, 10 mg/kg of hydrocortisone loading followed by 2.5 mg/kg 6 hourly, if needed. The PRAM score was monitored for every 30 min. The PRAM score[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] included five parameters, namely, suprasternal retractions, scalene muscle contraction, air entry, wheezing, and O<sub>2</sub> saturation, with a score of 0&#x02013;2 or 3 for each item. The total score ranged from 0 to 12 with a score of &#x0003c;5 indicating mild exacerbation, score of 5&#x02013;8 indicating moderate exacerbation, and score of &#x02265;9 indicating severe exacerbation of asthma. If PRAM score remained &#x02265;5 at 1 h of therapy, IV magnesium sulfate 25 mg/kg over 30 min was given. The patients were eligible for enrollment in the study, if PRAM score remained &#x02265;5 by the 2 h of standard therapy. The enrolled patients were randomized to one of the two following groups: (1) IV ketamine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg bolus over 20 min, followed by continuous infusion of 0.6 mg/kg/h for 3 h; (2) IV aminophylline 5 mg/kg bolus over 20 min followed by the continuous infusion of 0.9 mg/kg/h for 3 h. The 3 h were chosen based on the previous studies where ketamine was used for 3 h. Standard therapy was continued during the study period. Treating physician decided further management after the study ended at 3 h of intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome measure was change in PRAM score from enrollment to the end of the intervention.

Arterial blood gas was performed at enrollment and at 180 min. PEF was performed at enrollment and at 180 min in patients above 5 years of age who were able to perform the procedure, and the best of three attempts was considered for analysis.

Betts and Parkin first used ketamine successfully in an asthmatic child in 1971.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Since then, there had been several case reports and small case series of successful use of ketamine for relieving bronchospasm in children with acute asthma exacerbation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Petrillo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] used ketamine (IV loading dose of 1 mg/kg/h, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.75 mg/kg/h for 1 h) in a prospective observational study for ten children with status asthmaticus who were unresponsive to standard treatment. They found that clinical asthma score improved significantly after starting ketamine. However, they observed side effects of ketamine in four out of ten patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The adverse effects may be due to higher dose of ketamine than our study. A previously published RCT by Allen and Macias[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] randomized 68 children with acute asthma to receive either ketamine (<italic>n</italic> = 33) as IV bolus of 0.2 mg/kg, followed by a 2 h infusion at 0.5 mg/kg/h or an equal volume of normal saline placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 35). The efficacy was assessed by Pulmonary Index Score (PIS) and found that ketamine was not beneficial over standard therapy. They did not observe any side effect of ketamine.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The lack of benefit of ketamine in the study may be because of lower dose of ketamine as compared to our study and other studies. The acute asthma severity score used was different (PIS vs. PRAM) in this study and our study. A placebo-controlled RCT in adults used ketamine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg bolus, followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h infusion for 3 h, found that the studied outcomes were similar between the ketamine and the placebo groups.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the same study, the initial bolus dose was 0.2 mg/kg, but it was later decreased to 0.1 mg/kg due to dysphoric reactions. In another RCT in adults, a 1 mg/kg ketamine dose was used on mechanically ventilated patients; the ketamine group had improved wheezing, PO<sub>2</sub>, and PCO<sub>2</sub> as compared to placebo.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] A recent Cochrane review found only one RCT of ketamine in the treatment of acute asthma in children and concluded that there is a need for more RCTs on ketamine.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine had been used in a bolus dose ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg and in infusion dose ranging from 0.15 mg/kg/h to 2.5 mg/kg/h in different observational and clinical trial studies.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Similarly, duration of infusion also varied from 1 h to 5 days.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Further trials on ketamine in acute asthma exacerbation should explore an appropriate dose of ketamine that is sufficient to cause bronchodilatation, but without significant side effects. There is no study in the past which compared ketamine and aminophylline. In a Cochrane review regarding aminophylline for acute asthma exacerbation in children, where eight trials were included, it was found that aminophylline when added to standard therapy for acute exacerbation of asthma in children improved lung function within 6 h of treatment; however, there was no apparent reduction in the symptoms and duration of hospital stay. There was insufficient evidence for aminophylline for the impact on oxygenation, PICU admission, and mechanical ventilation. Aminophylline use was associated with a significant increased risk of vomiting, but no difference in hypokalemia, headaches, tremor, seizures, arrhythmias, and deaths.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>There are limitations too in the present study. Ideally, ketamine should have been compared with placebo to observe the effect. We did not use placebo in the controlled arm because our Ethics Committee did not allow placebo arm as we enrolled the patients with moderate&#x02013;to-severe exacerbation of asthma who failed to respond to standard therapy including magnesium sulfate, and use of placebo in such situation might not be justifiable. Further, the treating team and patients were not blinded to the intervention, though outcome assessor was blinded to the intervention. Another limitation is this is a single-center study. There were six patients below 2 years of age, and we did not perform any viral study on them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ketamine is equally efficacious as compared to aminophylline for acute asthma in children who respond poorly to standard therapy.</p><p>The trial is registered at the Clinical Trials Registry-India with number as CTRI/2013/09/004000.
