However, there is no substantive evidence supporting which treatment strategy is superior. Taping with Kinesiotape (KT) is a new method that is used as an alternative to the more established taping and bracing techniques used for the prophylaxis and treatment of ankle sprains. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of KT on ankle sprain by comparing acupuncture combined with KT (AcuKT) with acupuncture alone in patients with acute lateral ankle sprains.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This study is a prospective, multi-center (DongShin University Gwangju Oriental Hospital, DongShin University Mokpo Oriental Hospital, and KyungHee Korean Medicine Hospital), outcome assessor-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio.

The acupuncture group will receive acupuncture treatment at ST36, ST41, BL60, BL62, KI3, KI6, GB39, and GB40 once per day, 5 days per week (excluding Saturday and Sunday) for 1 week. The AcuKT group will receive acupuncture treatment at ST36, ST41, BL60, BL62, KI3, KI6, GB39, and GB40 and the ankle meridian tendino-musculature and a figure-of-eight shape form of KT treatment once per day, 5 days per week (excluding Saturday and Sunday) for 1 week. The primary outcome will be pain evaluation assessed according to a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), while Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), edema, European Quality of Life Five Dimension-Five Level Scale (EQ-5D-5 L) score, and number of recurrent ankle sprains will be considered as secondary outcome measures. VAS, FAOS, and edema measurements will be performed at baseline (before intervention), 5 days after the first intervention (i.e.<italic>,</italic> at the end of the intervention), and 4 weeks after the completion of intervention. EQ-5D-5 L measurements will be conducted at baseline, 5 days after the first intervention, 4 weeks after the completion of intervention, and 26 weeks after the completion of intervention.

Reported incidence rates range from 2.2 sprained ankles per 1000 person-years in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] to 5.3&#x02013;7.0 sprained ankles per 1000 person-years in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Ankle sprains are more serious than commonly believed because, in addition to the immediate onset of pain, swelling, and loss of joint motion, it has been reported that in 15&#x02013;73% of lateral ankle sprain cases, chronic ankle instability with recurrent sprains and residual sensations of giving way may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Ankle sprains also result in high costs to society, due to increased healthcare resource use and work absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Ankle sprains are usually graded on the basis of the severity of the injury. Grade I is characterized by mild stretching or partial tearing of the anterior talofibular and/or calcaneofibular ligaments, accompanied by mild tenderness and swelling, but with only slight or no functional loss. Grade II is characterized by incomplete tearing of ligaments with moderate pain, swelling, and functional loss. Grade III is characterized by complete tearing of ligaments resulting in severe swelling, pain, and loss of function and motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The three main modalities of treatment for ankle sprains are surgical treatment, conservative treatment involving immobilization with a plaster cast or splint, and functional conservative treatment with tape, a semi-rigid brace, or a lace-up brace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2015, ankle sprain was the fourth most common reason for visits to traditional Korean medicine (TKM) clinics, and 1.1 million Korean ankle-sprain patients received TKM treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In TKM, complementary and alternative therapies are believed to relieve pain, reduce swelling, and help the body restore damaged tissue in cases of ankle sprain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Taping with Kinesiotape (KT) is used as an alternative to the more established taping and bracing techniques for the prophylaxis and treatment of ankle sprains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. KT uses the newest form of elastic tape developed in the 1970s by Dr. Kenzo Kase, and was designed to yield therapeutic benefits while providing support and stability to muscles and joints without restricting the body&#x02019;s range of motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The tape used for KT differs from the traditionally used white athletic tape. It has unidirectional elasticity and, before applying it to the skin, it can be stretched to 140% of its original length so that it applies a constant pulling (shear) force to the skin. Furthermore, the tape used for KT is air permeable and water resistant, and can be worn for several days without removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. KT may assist in ankle sprain management by reducing pain, altering muscle function, improving circulation, enhancing proprioception, and repositioning subluxed joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objective</title><p id="Par25">The objective of the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of KT for the reduction of pain in patients with ankle sprain, and compare the efficacy of acupuncture combined with KT treatment (AcuKT) with that of acupuncture alone in patients with acute lateral ankle sprains (ALASs).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hypothesis</title><p id="Par26">The null hypothesis is that, in ALAS patients, AcuKT does not improve the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score-determined severity of pain significantly more than acupuncture alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par27">Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) advice and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 guidelines are followed below, to describe the design of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

However, patients will not be permitted to engage in treatments to improve ankle-sprain symptoms, other than the therapies administered as part of this study. All medical devices will be inspected by investigators, including acupuncture needles and KT. Investigators will record the results of check-ups in the management register.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Application of Kinesiotape</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2527_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcome measurements</title><p id="Par39">VAS, FAOS, and edema measurements will be performed at baseline (before intervention), 5 days after the first intervention (i.e., at the end of the intervention), and 4 weeks after the completion of intervention. EQ-5D-5 L measurements will be conducted at baseline, 5 days after the first intervention, 4 weeks after the completion of intervention, and 26 weeks after the completion of intervention. Numbers of recurrent ankle sprains will be assessed at 4, 8, 12, and 26 weeks after the completion of intervention.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Primary outcome</title><p id="Par40">Given that the objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of KT on pain reduction in patients with ALAS, the primary outcome assessed will be changes in pain as determined via VAS, which is commonly used in clinical trials and other studies to determine primary outcomes. The VAS that will be used in this study is a 10-cm-long straight line marked at each end with labels that anchor the scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Patients will be asked to place a mark on the line at a point representing the severity of their pain, where the anchors are &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pain as bad as it could be.&#x0201d; Scores are recorded in millimeters, thus yielding a total score range of 0&#x02013;100 mm. The VAS is often treated as an interval-level scale (with equality between intervals) and subjected to arithmetic operations (e.g., calculation of change scores) and parametric statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p id="Par41">The secondary outcomes assessed will be changes in FAOS, edema, EQ-5D-5 L, and the number of recurrent ankle sprains. The FAOS is a self-administered questionnaire specific for feet and ankles, designed to assess week-to-week changes in symptoms and function after foot and ankle injuries. It consists of five subscales, pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living, functioning in sport and recreation, and foot- and ankle-related quality of life (QoL). The last week is taken into consideration when the answering options are given (% Likert boxes), and each question is scored from 0 to 4. A normalized score (in which100 indicates no symptoms and 0 indicates extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Edema will be measured in cm via the figure-of-eight method. The measuring tape will be applied such that the following landmarks will be crossed in a figure-of-eight fashion: (1) navicular tuberosity; (2) distal tip of the lateral malleolus; (3) distal tip of the medial malleolus; and (4) base of the fifth metatarsal. The resulting measurement will be compared with a corresponding measurement derived from the uninjured ankle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The European Quality of Life Five Dimension Scale (EQ-5D) is a generic instrument for assessing health-related QoL. It is based on a descriptive system that defines health in terms of five dimensions, mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three response categories corresponding to no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The EQ-5D-5 L, which will be used in this study, is a new version of the EQ-5D that includes five levels of severity in each of the existing five EQ-5D dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Ankle sprain recurrence is defined as an ankle sprain occurring as a result of sports participation or other daily activities, and which causes one or more of the following: (1) the subject has to stop the sports activity; (2) the subject cannot fully participate in the next planned sports activity; (3) the subject cannot go to work/school the next day; or (4) the subject requires medical attention (ranging from onsite care administered by a GP to personal care administered by a sports physician) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Incidence of adverse events</title><p id="Par45">Adverse events are undesirable and unintentional signs, symptoms, or diseases that appear during or after treatment in a clinical trial. The subjects in the current study will be requested to voluntarily report any adverse events. All adverse events that occur during the trial will be documented. Adverse events that may occur in this study include skin irritation, bleeding, local hematoma, pallor, sweating or dizziness, fainting during acupuncture treatment, retained needle after treatment, continuous severe pain &#x0003e;&#x02009;1 h after acupuncture, and objective worsening of existing symptoms. The CRC will record adverse events in detail, including the time and date of occurrence, degree of severity, any measurement related to the treatment of the event, and any potentially causal relationship between the treatment and the event, and will report all adverse events to the principal investigator (PI) and the relevant IRB. If serious adverse events occur, defined as those causing severe disability or malfunction, then appropriate measures will be taken and incidents will be immediately reported to the PI and the relevant IRB. If there is an adverse event due to the clinical trial, participants will notify the CRC and the PI, and the participants will be compensated by the &#x0201c;Clinical Trial Compensation.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Quality assurance</title><p id="Par46">The trial protocol has been reviewed and revised by experts on acupuncture, orthopedics, rehabilitation, statistics, and methodology several times. Before the trial, all staff will be required to attend a series of training sessions. These sessions will ensure that the personnel involved fully understand the trial protocol and standard operating procedures (SOPs) that will be used during the study. The Data Monitoring Committee is composed of the PI and the CRC. Monitoring and auditing of the clinical trial will be conducted by a clinical research associate (CRA). The CRA will verify all documents related to the clinical trial including Case Report Forms (CRFs) and SOPs, and monitor whether the clinical trial is conducted in accordance with the prescribed protocols and SOPs. Monitoring and auditing will be independent of the PI and sponsor. In the event that the protocol described herein is revised, the revisions will be required to be approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, and the IRBs of DongShin University Gwangju Oriental Hospital, DongShin University Mokpo Oriental Hospital, and KyungHee Korean Medicine Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par47">The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome measure, pain, as determined via the VAS. In accordance with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we have established the number of groups at 2, the effect size as 0.906, with a one-sided alpha level of 0.025, and a statistical power of 0.8. Based on these parameters, the required sample size calculated using G*Power is 42 (21 per group). Estimating a maximum dropout rate of 30%, we have determined that a total of 60 participants&#x02014;30 in each group&#x02014;will be required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par48">Baseline characteristics will be described and compared.

A repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be conducted for the VAS of pain and the secondary outcomes (FAOS, edema, and EQ-5D-5 L). Dependent variables will include values measured before intervention, at the completion of intervention, and 4 weeks after the completion of intervention.

Missing values will be implemented by multiple imputations. In addition, differences between subjects who complete the study and those who drop out will be analyzed statistically to investigate whether any particular factors are significantly associated with dropping out. Interim analyses will not be performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Confidentiality and data management</title><p id="Par50">Participants&#x02019; identification records will be kept confidential until the results of the study are published. All documents related to the trial, including CRFs, will be recorded and labeled with participant identification codes and will not show the name of the participant. The serial number codes will be stored in sealed, opaque envelopes, kept in a double-locked cabinet, and opened in the presence of the patient and a guardian. All participant data will be recorded in Excel files by the CRC. Additionally, raw data (CRFs) will be stored in a cabinet until the end of the study. Written informed consent for the publication of their individual details and accompanying images will be obtained from the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par51">Nearly all ankle sprains are simple grade-I (mechanically stable) or grade-II (some joint laxity) ligament sprains. Grade-III sprains (clinical and/or radiological evidence of instability) constitute a small minority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although the prevalence of grade-III sprains is low, there is strong evidence supporting the use of immobilization and, occasionally, surgical correction in the management of these injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Conversely, clinical standards for the acute management of grade-I and -II ankle sprains are not well defined and there is no evidence supporting a clinically important improvement in outcome with the addition of supervised physiotherapy to usual care in grade-I and -II ankle sprains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. KT is one of the functional treatment options for ankle sprain in TKM, which include tape, a semi-rigid brace, and a lace-up brace. &#x0201c;Meridian muscle&#x0201d; is a TKM concept that includes the muscles, ligaments, and tendons of the part where 12 meridians pass. Ankle meridian tendino-musculature and the figure-of-eight shape form of KT treatment is a KT technique applied to the ankle and surrounding meridian muscle, including from ST42 to ST36 over the tibialis anterior muscle to assist active dorsiflexion and inversion, and from GB42 to GB34 over the peroneus longus and brevis muscles to assist active ankle eversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The objective of the proposed study is to investigate the potentially synergistic effects of KT combined with acupuncture in grade-I and -II ankle sprains, but notably, the study has some limitations. First, there is concern that the short treatment period planned to minimize dropout rates may affect the results of the study. Second, we have no choice but to adopt a single-blinding (outcome-assessor-blinding) approach, because sham treatment is impossible due to the characteristics of the KT method. Efforts to maintain objectivity include separating the CRC who manages the treatment schedules, the practitioner who conducts the treatments, and the assessor.</p><p id="Par53">The results of this study will provide preliminary evidence on the utility and acceptability of KT for patients with grade-I and -II ankle sprains, and will serve as a basis for further research.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p id="Par54">We will report the final data to the Ministry of Health and Welfare through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, and will publish the results at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par55">This trial is ongoing.
