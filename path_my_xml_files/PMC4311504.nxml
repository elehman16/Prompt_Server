Recent randomized phase III trials have shown that concurrent chemoradiotherapy is superior to chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy in terms of response and survival in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is also associated with greater acute toxicity, <italic>which</italic> includes bone marrow suppression and esophagitis, than sequential chemoradiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>S-1 (TS-1, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) is a new oral fluoropyrimidine agent designed to enhance anticancer activity and to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity. It consists of tegafur (a 5-FU Pro-drug), 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine (an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase), and potassium oxonate (an inhibitor of phosphoribosyl transferase), in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1. S-1 has been shown to induce a comparable response to the other single agents for metastatic NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Two studies of S-1 plus cisplatin for advanced NSCLC showed a response rate of 32.7&#x02013;47% and a median survival time of 11&#x02013;16 months. These studies also reported only very few severe gastrointestinal or hematological toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>To date, there have been no reported randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy (SCCR) versus cisplatin plus concurrent thoracic radiation (CCR) for stage III NSCLC. Therefore, more rigorous studies are required to elucidate the feasibility and efficacy of S-1 for the treatment of these patients.</p><p>We conducted a single-center, randomized controlled pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy for treating NSCLC patients.

The other eligibility criteria were an age between 20 and 80&#x000a0;years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, no previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients also had to have the following standard laboratory test results: a leukocyte count of 4000&#x02013;12 000/&#x003bc;l, a platelet count of &#x02265;100 000/&#x003bc;l, a hemoglobin level of &#x02265;9&#x000a0;g per 100&#x000a0;ml, a serum bilirubin level of &#x02264;1.5&#x000a0;mg per 100&#x000a0;ml, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels of &#x02264;100&#x000a0;IU/ml, an alkaline phosphatase level of no more than twice the upper limit of normal, a normal creatinine level, and a partial pressure of arterial oxygen of &#x02265;65&#x000a0;torr in room air.

After qualifying, patients were assigned to either of two treatment groups: SCCR group or CCR group. The allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing the randomization assignments. In addition, all the outcome assessors and data analysts were blinded in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment schedule</title><p>A CT scan of the chest tumor was conducted in order to determine tumor volume before therapy. Patients in the CCR group received cisplatin (60&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1 and then at 4-week intervals, and they also underwent radiotherapy, which was administrated concurrently on day 1 by chest irradiation. Two different radiation target volumes were planned. The initial dose (approximately 40&#x000a0;Gy) was administered to the primary tumor, the ipsilateral hilum with a 2-cm margin, and the involved mediastinal lymph nodes with a 1-cm margin. Prophylactic radiation fields were not planned, except for subcarinal lymph nodes. Subsequently, a 20&#x000a0;Gy dose was given as a booster once a day for 5&#x000a0;days each week over a period of 6&#x000a0;weeks using a linear accelerator generating at least 4&#x000a0;MeV photons, in accordance with tumor shrinkage. In addition to receiving the same intervention as the CCR group, patients in the SCCR group were also administered S-1 (orally at 40&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> per dose, b.i.d., on days 1 through 14).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evaluation of response and toxicity</title><p>All eligible patients who received treatment were considered assessable for response and toxicity measures.

Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the starting date of induction chemoradiotherapy until disease progression or death. Patients whose disease had not progressed at the time of study treatment discontinuation continued to be assessed until progression was documented. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the starting date of induction chemoradiotherapy until death from any cause. Sample size was calculated on the basis of an expected 15% difference between the 2 groups. OS was calculated from the day of randomization to the day of death. Data for surviving patients were censored on the date on which they were last known to be alive. PFS was computed from the date of randomization to the date of relapse, death, or completion of follow-up, whichever occurred first. Data on patients who were alive and progression free were censored at the time of the last follow-up visit.

The overall frequency of AEs was similar in both groups and most side effects were not severe. The frequencies of both drug-related AEs and severe AEs were higher in the SCCR group than in the CCR group.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. First, the trial was randomized thereby reducing selection bias. Second, although there was no consensus regarding the appropriate dose of SCCR for patients with locally advanced NSCLC, the dose used in our study was within the therapeutic range. Further studies with a larger sample size and longer duration of SCCR treatment are needed to further confirm the results of this study.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate promising efficacy and a very acceptable toxicity profile for SCCR in patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Despite the short follow-up period, these encouraging clinical and pathological results warrant further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SX conceived of the study, participated in the coordination and design of the study, performed.
