Not only due to the growing number of people with dementia (PwD), but also because care increasingly occurs at home. The limited available professional workforce and the high economic costs of dementia care place pressure on informal caregivers and on future dementia care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The progressive nature of dementia poses stress and physical and emotional health challenges to informal caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is no available cure for dementia, therefore, caregiver support interventions particularly focus on the maintenance of quality of life and social engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that psychosocial caregiver interventions have a moderate effect on caregiver health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, caregivers do not always use available services because of the prevailing stigma and experienced threshold associated with asking for support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, it will become important to develop cost-effective, accessible and innovative caregiver support methods. The Internet might provide a new arena for support because worldwide Internet usage and computer literacy are rapidly growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Internet interventions require less financial and human resources, and they are easily accessible in the home setting, regardless of distance, time and physical constraints. Previous studies have shown the promising effects of online training and self-management programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; in particular, e-health interventions that fit caregiver needs and focus on the enhancement of positive experience are more likely to be accepted and strengthen caregiver functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Currently, there are challenges associated with research on technology interventions in dementia care, particularly in the development, methodology, effectiveness and implementation of such research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Hence, further studies are needed to investigate the potential of social media tools in providing support for dementia caregiver networks. Therefore, an innovative social support tool entitled &#x0201c;Inlife&#x0201d; was developed and launched in the Netherlands. The Inlife platform is user-friendly and unique because it was developed specifically for caregivers and PwD to lower the observed threshold for asking for support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and to increase positive interactions in personal care circles. The present paper describes the design of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) used to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of Inlife for caregivers of PwD. The primary study objectives are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par24">To investigate whether the use of Inlife is more effective than treatment as usual for caregiver social support and caregiver competence</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">To evaluate the intervention quality and sampling quality to determine internal and external validity</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">To explore the barriers and facilitating factors associated with use of the Inlife platform and its successful implementation in (clinical) practice</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par27">An RCT design will be used to compare a waiting-list control group with an intervention group. Self-reported data will be collected pre-intervention (T<sub>0</sub>) and at 8-week (T<sub>1</sub>) and 16-week follow up (T<sub>2</sub>). The 16-week follow-up assessment serves as a primary endpoint to compare group effects. After the initial 16-week study period, the participants in the waiting-list control group can start using the Inlife platform, whereas caregivers in the intervention group are free to continue using the platform. Furthermore, a long-term follow-up measurement is scheduled for 42&#x000a0;weeks (T<sub>3</sub>) after baseline. See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the flow diagram.

The exclusion criteria are being overburdened, having serious health problems that could interfere with participation (e.g., burn-out or surgery), as assessed by the study staff, and being unavailable for a full period of more than 4&#x000a0;weeks during the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par31">Following completion of the baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which will use the Inlife platform for 16&#x000a0;weeks or to the waiting-list control group, which will receive treatment as usual. The randomisation will be performed by a computer programme that will be controlled by an independent researcher. A block randomisation procedure will be used to minimise the risk of unbalanced assignment to the intervention and control groups. Randomly generated blocks of several sizes (4, 6 and 8) will be used. The block size and randomisation pattern will be randomly chosen at the beginning of each block. This process reduces the chance that the randomisation process can be predicted. The researchers will remain independent because the allocation and assessments are conducted online. Independent of the group allocation, automatically generated emails (with links for the follow-up assessments) will be sent to the primary caregiver.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention condition</title><p id="Par32">Inlife is an online social support platform that consists of several functionalities.

The items reflect the level of competence or feelings of being capable of caring for the PwD on three domains: satisfaction with the PwD as a care recipient (3 items), satisfaction with their performance as a caregiver (2 items), and the consequences of involvement in care for the personal life of the caregiver (2 items). A total sum score will be calculated by summing the scores for responses of &#x0201c;disagree&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; (range 0&#x02013;7), and higher scores indicate a greater sense of competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The answers are provided on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree). The total score ranges from 12 to 84, and a higher score reflects higher levels of perceived social support. The psychometric properties of the scale are good, as demonstrated in non-clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and clinical populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the MSPSS has previously been used in caregiver intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p id="Par41">The Social Support List 12-Interactions (SSL12<italic>-</italic>I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] assesses the extent of received social support, as measured in terms of social interaction with members of the primary social network. The questionnaire consists of 12 items divided into 3 subscales of 4 items each: everyday support, social support in problem situations and esteem support. The response options range from 1 (&#x0201c;seldom or never&#x0201d;) to 4 (&#x0201c;often&#x0201d;). The total score ranges from 12 to 48, with higher scores reflecting a higher level of received support.

The psychometric qualities are evaluated as sufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There are 5 response options, ranging from 1 (&#x0201c;yes! very strongly agree&#x0201d;) to 5 (&#x0201c;no! very strongly disagree&#x0201d;).

The HADS measures the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. The anxiety and depression subscales contain 7 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (a great deal of time). The total scores for both scales range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more anxiety and depression symptoms.

The ICECAP-O assesses a person&#x02019;s sense of capability and overall wellbeing; measured by five states or attributes associated with attachment, role, enjoyment, security and control. A summary score, ranging from 0 (no capability) to 1 (full capability), is calculated for each statement describing an attribute. Higher scores indicate better wellbeing/quality of life. The ICECAP-O assesses broader outcomes, and compared to the more widely used EQ-5D, it might be more sensitive to differences between the intervention and comparison groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The Care Related Quality of Life scale (CarerQol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] measures the impact of informal care by assessing seven domains of burden (based on the Euroqol-5D (EQ-5D)), which are rated on a 3-point scale ranging from 1 (no burden) to 3 (a lot of burden); it contains an additional valuation component to measure general wellbeing using the degree of happiness scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (completely unhappy) to 10 (completely happy).

The PSS consists of 10 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The sum score on the PSS ranges from 0 to 40, with higher scores representing higher levels of stress. Sufficient psychometric quality has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The caregiver interpersonal relationship scale is a custom questionnaire that aims to measure the degree of positive interactions and connectedness within the caregiver network of the PwD. The authors based the scale on the existing Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] to closely reflect the primary study objective, to increase positive involvement and interactions in the PwD caregiver network. In the literature, there is no validated questionnaire that measures interpersonal relationships through positive interactions and involvement specifically for caregivers of PwD. Although this custom questionnaire has not yet been validated, it provides an approximate indication of the positive interactions experienced by caregivers of a PwD. The scale consists of 6 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The total score ranges from 6 to 30, with higher scores reflecting more positive interactions within the PwD care network.</p><p id="Par50">The PPQ was adapted for this study to measure the feasibility of Inlife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The PPQ contains 34 items relating to usability, user-friendliness and satisfaction with the Inlife platform; it is measured on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores reflect greater feasibility. Participants in the intervention group will complete the entire scale after the 16-week intervention period.

The topics will include the use of the intervention in daily life, potential factors influencing Inlife use, social support impact and feelings of competence in the caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Process outcomes</title><p id="Par52">Next to the RCT, a process evaluation will be conducted to improve the interpretation of the results and to explore the factors that might influence the implementation of the Inlife intervention. As part of the process evaluation, the intervention quality and sampling quality will be examined to determine internal and external validity.</p><p id="Par53">Sampling quality will be examined by describing (1) the recruitment procedure, (2) the randomisation and allocation procedure, (3) the informed consent procedure and (4) the barriers and facilitators encountered during the recruitment procedure. The reach will be defined by calculating the proportion of participating caregivers compared to the total number of persons approached.</p><p id="Par54">Intervention quality will be evaluated by determining (1) the relevance of the intervention, (2) the feasibility of the intervention and (3) the extent to which the intervention was performed according to the protocol (e.g., deviations from the Inlife usage period and missing online measurements).</p><p id="Par55">Sampling quality data will be obtained from the research database. Intervention quality data will be collected from the quantitative Inlife Programme Questionnaire, which will be completed after the 16-week intervention period. Subjective experiences will be assessed during the evaluation phone call 2&#x000a0;weeks after the start of the intervention, and from the semi-structured interviews (in a subsample of Inlife users). Additionally, objective measurements of the Inlife user log data (e.g., clicks per functionality and number of new posts), and the number of dropouts will be examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par56">The sample size was determined based on previous intervention studies of caregivers of PwD with the Short Sense of Competence Questionnaire (SSCQ) as an outcome measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], using repeated measures and interaction within and between variables with a mean effect size of 0.5. In accordance with the following assumptions: alpha 0.05 and power 80%, we aim to include 102 primary caregivers (51 participants per group). Allowing for a 20% loss to follow up, we aim to enrol 122 caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><p id="Par57">All analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, using IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp. Released 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).</p><p id="Par58">Prior to the main analysis, data will be examined for missing values, outliers and normality. To investigate whether randomisation was successful, potential differences in the baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups will be determined using either the <italic>t</italic> test for the continuous variables or the chi squared (X<sup>2</sup>) test for the categorical variables. In the case of missing values, we will examine whether they are missing completely at random (MCAR). If the variables are MCAR, based on a comparison between the baseline characteristics of the study completers and the participants with missing values (no <italic>P</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05), list-wise deletion will be applied, whereas when the missing values are not at random, we will apply a multiple imputation strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">To test the first hypothesis examining the differences in the outcome variables of the intervention group and waiting-list control group, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed, with the outcomes of the T<sub>2</sub> assessment (i.e., measured at 16&#x000a0;weeks, after this period the waiting-list control group can start with Inlife). The outcomes assessed at the T<sub>2</sub> follow up will be included in the model as dependent variables and groups as between-subject variables. Potential baseline differences between the treatment arms will be included as covariates, if necessary. Each outcome measured will be assessed as a dependent variable in separate analyses.</p><p id="Par60">To test the changes in the primary and secondary outcome measures over the total study period, data from the intervention group and waiting-list control group will be analysed using a linear mixed model (LMM). The LMM will estimate the fixed effects of the regression slopes representing the changes during the intervals (T<sub>0</sub>-T<sub>1</sub>) and (T<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>2</sub>) in the intervention only and waiting-list control group and after the (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>3</sub>) follow up. This process enables a comparison of the rate of change in the caregivers who did not receive the intervention compared to the caregivers who received the intervention (T<sub>0</sub>-T<sub>2</sub>), and it provides insight into whether the potential effects on the outcome variables will be sustained by evaluating the rate of change from the 16-week follow up to the 42-week follow up (T<sub>2</sub>-T<sub>3,</sub> intervention group only). Furthermore, LMM accounts for the fact that the data are correlated through nesting in individuals. Potential missing values are handled efficiently under the missing at random (MAR) assumption, using maximum likelihood estimates for the missing observations; hence, it is suitable for intention-to-treat analysis. Therefore, variables known to predict missing values will be included in the LMM analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Intervals will be entered as categorical variables, using three dummies. The best model fit of the models with random intercept (at the participant level) and with random intercept and random slope (at interval level) will be compared with likelihood ratio tests. All tests will be two-tailed, with an alpha level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Semi-structured interviews and process evaluation</title><p id="Par61">Data obtained from the qualitative semi-structured interviews (with a subsample of approximately 10 participants) will be transcribed verbatim.

Text fragments will be assigned codes, which will be organised into categories. Then, the categories will be merged into common themes in a consensus meeting with a third independent researcher.</p><p id="Par62">All participants will rate their opinions regarding the usability and user-friendliness of Inlife on the PPQ. These scores will be analysed through descriptive statistics. Additionally, explorative analyses of the research database will be performed to summarise the response rates, reasons for participation, researchers&#x02019; notes of user experiences with Inlife and findings regarding sampling quality and intervention quality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par63">In this paper, we outlined the design of a randomised waiting-list controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and process of Inlife, an online social support platform for caregivers of PwD to improve social support, feelings of caregiver competence and positive interaction. The development of Inlife was based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework and tested in a feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The Inlife intervention is specifically developed with potential users, and it is unique because it facilitates social support for the primary caregiver and PwD in separate care circles, thereby providing different functionalities and privileges to all involved network members.</p><p id="Par64">As suggested by the MRC framework, we considered the factors that can influence implementation by integrating a process evaluation in our study design. The process evaluation will facilitate understanding about the delivery and quality of the intervention and provides insight into the contextual, personal and situational factors influencing the intervention effectiveness in a real-world setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We expect the intervention to be successfully implemented because Inlife is designed together with potential users, and it will be made available by both community services and online services at the regional and national levels.</p><p id="Par65">Using a mixed-method design, our study will provide valuable insight into the real-life usability and effectiveness of the Inlife intervention. Previous studies have shown that the measures used in intervention studies often do not fit the targets addressed by the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], therefore, we used a custom interpersonal relationship scale to measure positive interactions, specifically within the dementia care network. Additionally, the semi-structured interviews may provide insight into the possible barriers to and facilitators of implementation. This information will be essential not only to improve the Inlife platform but also to implement the Inlife intervention on a broader scale in clinical practice. Moreover, our study findings will provide recommendations for future research into online interventions for caregivers, as these studies are expected to increase due to the increase in computer literacy and education level of future generations being faced with growing numbers of PwD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">In conclusion, the results of this study will add to the knowledge base of the usability and effectiveness of e-health interventions to support caregivers of PwD. We expect that Inlife will effectively increase caregiver social support and feelings of competence, and might aid in the positive interactions within the dementia caregiver network. This study will also provide valuable insights for policy makers, clinicians and researchers into the challenges in the usability and implementation of online social support interventions in the field of dementia care.</p><p id="Par67">Given the promising benefits of technology and online support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], Inlife might be a valuable social support resource that can be used in routine dementia care.
