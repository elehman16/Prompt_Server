Current evidence indicates that an underlying defect in insulin secretion in the presence of insulin resistance leads to the development of diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is already characterized by impaired first-phase insulin secretion, a determinant for further progression to diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Lifestyle changes involving healthy diet, moderate weight loss, and increased physical activity reduce the risk of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The extent to which this is due to reduced insulin resistance or improved insulin secretion is not known. Improvements in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity after 1 year of lifestyle intervention were associated with lower diabetes risk in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study during a follow-up of 3.2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In a substudy of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) in persons with IGT who did not progress to diabetes, insulin secretion measured during a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) remained stable for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, data from long-term intervention trials on the mechanisms that may result in improvement of glucose metabolism and prevention of diabetes associated with healthy lifestyle changes are scarce.</p><p>Therefore, we investigated the effect of surrogate indices of early-phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on diabetes incidence in individuals participating in the Finnish DPS. We also evaluated whether insulin secretion response in the OGTT was modified by insulin sensitivity and obesity, and how lifestyle intervention may affect the &#x003b2;-cell function.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Design of the DPS</title><p>The DPS was a randomized, controlled, multicenter study in Finland between the years 1993 and 2000 (ClinicalTrials.govNCT00518167) in which 522 individuals with IGT were randomized into an intervention or control group in five centers. The study design and methods of the DPS have been reported in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the National Public Health Institute of Helsinki, Finland, and all of the study participants gave written informed consent.</p><p>The main inclusion criteria were BMI &#x0003e;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, age 40&#x02013;64 years, and IGT based on the mean values of two OGTTs according to the World Health Organization 1985 criteria. Random allocation to one of the two study groups was stratified according to the center, sex, and the 2-h glucose at the screening OGTT. At baseline and at annual visits, individuals completed a medical history questionnaire and underwent a physical examination that included anthropometric measurements and an OGTT.</p><p>For this study, analyses were limited to those 443 participants who had at least one measurement of glucose and insulin at 30 min during the 4-year follow-up trial because samples for 30-min insulin and glucose were not collected at baseline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1272/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). The median length of the study was 4 years (range 1&#x02013;6). During this 4-year follow-up period, all participants were undergoing the randomized intervention. Participants who developed diabetes discontinued the study (<italic>n</italic> = 12, <italic>n</italic> = 14, and <italic>n</italic> = 19 at years 2, 3, and 4, respectively), and the measurements from their previous annual visits before diagnosis were used for the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Program for the intervention group</title><p>The intervention program has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Briefly, the individuals in the intervention group received individually tailored dietary advice aiming at reducing weight and the intake of total and saturated fat and increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Individuals in the intervention group also received individual guidance to increase their level of physical activity. The most intensive period of intervention was during the first year of the study, when the participants showed improvement in main lifestyle indicators (e.g., body weight and glucose and lipid concentrations). The control group received general advice on the benefits of weight reduction, physical activity, and a healthy diet.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Glucose and insulin homeostasis</title><p>During 1993 to 1996, a baseline 2-h OGTT was performed (75 g glucose load). In the OGTT performed during follow-up visits starting from the middle of 1996, samples were also taken for 30-min insulin and glucose and for 60-min glucose measurements (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1272/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Laboratory determinations</title><p>Glucose levels were measured locally by standard methods, and the measurements were standardized by the central laboratory in Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).

As surrogate indices of the first/early-phase insulin secretion and of peripheral insulin sensitivity, the ratio of total insulin AUC and total glucose AUC during the 0&#x02013;30 min OGTT (AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub>) and the Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity (Matsuda ISI: 10,000/square root of [fasting glucose &#x000d7; fasting insulin &#x000d7; (arithmetic mean of glucose &#x000d7; arithmetic mean insulin both during an OGTT at 0, 30, and 120 min)]) were calculated according to published equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These indices were chosen based on a previous large population study conducted by our local collaborators in which Matsuda ISI and AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> were considered the best indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In addition, a frequently sampled IVGTT was performed in a subsample of the DPS, and the insulin sensitivity index (S<sub>I</sub>) and acute-phase insulin response (AIR) were calculated by the MINMOD Millennium software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). AIR and S<sub>I</sub> measured at year 4 were used for validation of the AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 53) and Matsuda ISI (<italic>n</italic> = 47). The Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) of AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> with AIR was 0.67 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Matsuda ISI had a correlation of <italic>r</italic> = 0.73 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) with S<sub>I</sub>. We also calculated Matsuda ISI according to the latest publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) to assess insulin sensitivity at baseline without using the 30-min glucose and insulin values. Its correlation coefficient was also significant (<italic>r</italic> = 0.74, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) versus S<sub>I</sub> in IVGTT. Both Matsuda ISIs were strongly correlated at all 4-year follow-up visits (<italic>r</italic> between 0.94 and 0.95, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 for all).</p><p>Because of the known nonlinear relationship between insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, we also adjusted, by regression analysis, the log of AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> by the log of the Matsuda ISI at each year of the study to obtain insulin secretion independently of insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We then transformed the adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> back into untransformed values by taking the antilog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) to obtain Matsuda ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> (ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub>). ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> was strongly correlated with S<sub>I</sub>-adjusted AIR (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.63, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The outcome variables were averaged from the available yearly measurements of each participant during the 4-year follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). For those individuals developing diabetes during the first 4 years, the measurements at the time of conversion to diabetes and thereafter were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Variables with a non-normal right-skewed distribution were log transformed for statistical analyses and given as geometric mean with a 95% CI. To test the association of the BMI and Matsuda ISI with insulin secretion at the 4-year follow-up and to test whether there was a group effect, univariate general linear models adjusted for age and sex were constructed. The association of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity during the first 4 years of follow-up with the risk of incident diabetes during a mean of 6 years of follow-up was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age, sex, and study group (intervention or control). For those participants who developed diabetes during the first 4 years, the measurements taken at the year of diagnosis were excluded. Univariate general linear modeling was used for comparisons between progressor and nonprogressors to type 2 diabetes during a mean of 6 years of follow-up for the main variables measured during the 4-year follow-up. A value of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Participants in the intervention group showed greater reductions in fasting and postchallenge glucose levels and in body weight compared with those in the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we demonstrated that higher insulin sensitivity estimated as Matsuda ISI and higher insulin sensitivity-adjusted insulin secretion (ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub>) during the 4-year follow-up study were both associated with lower diabetes incidence during a mean follow-up of 6 years. Regression to NGT was more strongly associated with higher ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> than insulin sensitivity. Individuals who developed type 2 diabetes reduced less BMI during the first year of the intervention, were more obese, and had lower Matsuda ISI and ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> values during the study than the individuals who did not develop type 2 diabetes.</p><p>We found that AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> per se did not predict diabetes during the mean 6-year follow-up, unless Matsuda ISI contribution was taken into consideration in the models. In contrast, low Matsuda ISI and ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> were both associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes, independently of BMI. Previous prospective studies have shown that insulin resistance and impaired early-phase insulin secretion predicted the conversion from IGT to diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Moreover, in insulin-resistant states, improvement of insulin resistance protected from diabetes and was associated with lower endogenous insulin requirement and preservation of &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Therefore, some improvement in insulin secretion adjusted for insulin sensitivity seems to be possible in the IGT phase, resulting in better &#x003b2;-cell function and possibly lowering the risk of developing diabetes. Altogether, these findings clearly demonstrate the importance of insulin secretion in the development of type 2 diabetes and that the effect of insulin sensitivity on insulin secretion needs to be taken into account due to their complex interaction.</p><p>In line with published observations, we observed that insulin sensitivity, which was higher in the intervention than in the control group during the 4-year follow-up, was inversely associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and also inversely associated with BMI during this same interval. In previous findings from a subsample of individuals participating in the DPS, the improvement in insulin sensitivity between baseline and the fourth year of the study was strongly correlated with the magnitude of weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These findings were independent of randomization group, and the associations found could be partly explained, for example, by a possible decrease in nonesterified fatty acid release that accompanies loss of body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Although at first glance paradoxical, the lower AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> observed in the lifestyle intervention group can be explained by the improvement in Matsuda ISI, which remained higher during the follow-up in this group, and reductions in body weight and BMI in the intervention arm during the first year of the study compared with the control group. Our study, along with other studies but with shorter follow-up duration, shows that a lower BMI and better insulin sensitivity are associated with a decrease in the demand of insulin in obese, insulin-resistant, and glucose-intolerant individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>We could not find any difference between the intervention and control groups concerning ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> that could indicate a direct beneficial effect of lifestyle intervention on &#x003b2;-cell function. Excluding data from the year diabetes was diagnosed may have underestimated the effect of lifestyle intervention. Nevertheless, higher ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> during the follow-up was associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes and a higher chance of regressing from IGT to NGT. Moreover, participants who had higher increase in Matsuda ISI during the most intensive period of the intervention trial, and who mostly belonged to the intervention group by study design, had higher ISI-adjusted AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> during the follow-up. Therefore, weight loss achieved with the lifestyle intervention may be a mediating factor on preserving &#x003b2;-cell function by improving insulin sensitivity and perhaps by avoiding lipotoxicity resulting for example, from ectopic fat accumulation, higher release of nonesterified fatty acid, and activation of inflammatory cascades, all factors related to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of targeting reduction in BMI to improve insulin sensitivity and preserve insulin secretion capacity to prevent or postpone the conversion from IGT to diabetes.</p><p>A major limitation of our study was that we could not estimate early-phase insulin secretion and sensitivity from OGTT at baseline before the intervention began. Nonetheless, the main clinical and metabolic features related to insulin and glucose metabolism, such as BMI, age, sex proportion, glucose, and insulin parameters did not differ between the intervention and control groups. Therefore, the differences between groups reported in this study are likely to be a reflection of the intervention itself. Of note, diabetes incidence was similarly lower in the original intervention group as in the population included in this study. Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were not measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp or the IVGTT. We did not use the oral glucose minimal model indices for estimating insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), which also includes the incretin response, because we did not measure C-peptide. However, we used an IVGTT for validation of the indices used in the current study in a subsample of the DPS. In DPS, early-phase insulin secretion (AIR) has high repeatability, which, as the insulin sensitivity-adjusted AIR, was also associated with diabetes risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In a similar population, AIGR<sub>0&#x02013;30</sub> and Matsuda ISI were considered the best indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The averaged values of measures of obesity, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion during the 4-year follow-up were used for the analyses. The main changes in lifestyle and body weight occurred during the first year of the study and were largely maintained thereafter. To decrease the variability of the crude measurements and increase the statistical power, we therefore averaged values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Strengths of the current study include the well-characterized and homogenous study population (obese individuals with IGT) and yearly measurements during a relative long period of follow-up of a large and carefully conducted lifestyle intervention study population.</p><p>Our results indicate that the reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes after lifestyle intervention is related to the improvement of insulin sensitivity. The weight loss achieved with the lifestyle intervention, which also improved insulin sensitivity, might have beneficial effects on better preservation of &#x003b2;-cell function. Because weight loss results from joint effects of changes in diet and physical activity and is possibly modified by genetic factors, the interplay between their effects on insulin secretion and risk of developing type 2 diabetes requires further and more detailed investigation.</p></sec>
