We investigated brain plasticity following a combined MI-BCI and tDCS intervention in chronic subcortical stroke patients with unilateral upper limb disability. Nineteen patients were randomized into tDCS and sham-tDCS groups. Diffusion and perfusion MRI, and transcranial magnetic stimulation were used to study structural connectivity, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and corticospinal excitability, respectively, before and 4 weeks after the 2-week intervention. After quality control, thirteen subjects were included in the CBF analysis. Eleven healthy controls underwent 2 sessions of MRI for reproducibility study. Whereas motor performance showed comparable improvement, long-lasting neuroplasticity can only be detected in the tDCS group, where white matter integrity in the ipsilesional corticospinal tract and bilateral corpus callosum was increased but sensorimotor CBF was decreased, particularly in the ipsilesional side. CBF change in the bilateral parietal cortices also correlated with motor function improvement, consistent with the increased white matter integrity in the corpus callosum connecting these regions, suggesting an involvement of interhemispheric interaction. The preliminary results indicate that tDCS may facilitate neuroplasticity and suggest the potential for refining rehabilitation strategies for stroke patients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Repetitive, task-specific motor training is one of the key components of post-stroke rehabilitation; however, active voluntary movement is challenging or even impossible for patients with severe motor impairment. By combining robot-assisted motor imagery and brain-computer interface (MI-BCI), we have developed a system to automatically drive the movement of the stroke-affected limb of a patient with a robotic arm via motor imagery of the arm which can be detected from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. By providing multisensory feedback and facilitating integration with motor learning, MI-BCI has been demonstrated to be a promising tool for improving functional recovery in stroke patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Another emerging technique for facilitating the functional recovery after stroke is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). TDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that delivers weak direct current through two saline-soaked electrodes (anode and cathode) over specific areas of the scalp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that anodal tDCS is able to induce an increase in corticospinal excitability, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), while cathodal tDCS exerts a suppressive effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. More importantly, repetitive tDCS sessions may induce behavior changes that last for weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The long-lasting after effect of tDCS is thought to be associated with the long term potentiation that underlies the learning process; therefore, tDCS holds the potential for improving motor function recovery through modulation of brain plasticity. However, the exact mechanism is still elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that anodal tDCS on ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) or cathodal stimulation on the contralesional M1 may improve the motor recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a few studies suggested that anodal tDCS may enhance the detection accuracy of motor imagery by EEG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which is a major limitation of MI-BCI. With the converging evidence, we investigated whether combining tDCS and MI-BCI may further improve neuroplasticity and functional recovery in stroke survivors with motor impairments.</p><p id="Par4">To understand the neuroplasticity induced by the MI-BCI and tDCS, we applied neuroimaging to track the structural and functional recovery following the rehabilitation. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), by measuring the random movements of water molecules (i.e., diffusion) in tissues, is sensitive to the microscopic structural, compositional, and organizational changes of the white matter (WM) in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. There are several commonly used DTI metrics, including the parallel diffusivity (Dp), radial diffusivity (Dr), and fractional anisotropy (FA). Dp is related to the axonal integrity, while Dr is associated with factors such as membrane permeability, myelin thickness, and axonal density. FA is usually thought to reflect the overall integrity of the axonal fibers. These DTI metrics could provide useful information in stroke patients to determine the extent of the WM lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, the relationship with functional recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and process of intervention/recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an indicator of the cerebrovascular function and neural activity due to its tight coupling with the cerebral metabolism. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-invasive MRI technique for quantitative measurement of CBF without the usage of exogenous contrast agent. While numerous studies have investigated the disruption of CBF during acute or subacute phase of stroke, limited studies have looked at CBF in the chronic stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Two case reports have related the CBF deficits with functional impairments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. One study reported interhemispheric rebalance of CBF during the functional reorganization and recovery after unilateral stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we applied DTI, ASL and TMS to understand the changes in gray and white matter and excitability of the corticospinal pathway before, immediately after 2 weeks of anodal tDCS and MI-BCI and 4 weeks post-intervention in moderate-to-severe stroke patients with upper limb disability. We hypothesized that the combination of tDCS with MI-BCI training will induce greater and longer-lasting neuroplasticity in the white matter tracts, gray matter function, and excitability of the corticospinal pathway compared to MI-BCI alone. Our results show that adding tDCS can induce long-lasting changes in cortical excitability and CBF, as well as enhance the integrity in white matter connecting the bilateral sensorimotor cortices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par6">The study was in compliance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association, and approved by the Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) of the National Healthcare Group, Singapore (Clinical Trial Registration Unique Identifier: NCT01897025, date of registration: July 8, 2013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01897025">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01897025</ext-link>). Sample size was determined by our preliminary results and other studies that used similar endpoints. Forty-two subjects were assessed for eligibility between June 2011 to January 2014.

Each subject underwent ten 40-minute sessions of MI-BCI training over 2 weeks, each session preceded with either 20&#x02009;minutes of tDCS or sham-tDCS (current ramped up and down to give subjects the sensation of the stimulation), applied at 1&#x02009;mA through a pair of saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes (35&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>), as per published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

A lower stimulator output to elicit RMT indicates a higher degree of corticospinal excitability. All Subjects were seated upright on a chair and was instructed to keep still and relaxed during the TMS measurement. Subjects were also instructed to place both the left and right arms comfortably on a pillow on their laps and to remain as relaxed as possible. A 70 mm figure-of-eight coil was placed on the scalp at a 45&#x000b0; orientation and the optimal scalp position for activating the abductor pollicus brevis (APB). The optimal location of the APB on the M1 was determined from initial exploration over a 10-mm grid marked on a cap. MEP amplitudes were recorded from APB via surface electrodes in a belly-tendon arrangement, using Medelec Synergy EMG system (VIASYS Healthcare, UK). Short intra-cortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were measured using paired pulse TMS with an initial conditioning stimulus of 80% of RMT and a test stimulus of 120% of RMT separated by an inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 2ms to induce SICI, while an ISI of 10 and 15ms were used to elicit ICF. Due to the high stimulator output, fewer trials was used in order to reduce the level of discomfort.

The brain of the mean image was extracted to create a brain mask, which was then applied to the entire 4D series. After a 2nd round of motion correction on this brain extracted series, CBF was quantified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In order to minimize the artifacts by imperfect labeling and residual motions not corrected, a threshold of the whole brain mean CBF plus 3 standard deviations was applied to the CBF map, such that those hyperintensities exceeding the threshold were replaced by the mean of the neighboring voxels. The CBF map was then flipped (if lesion on the left hemisphere) and transformed to the MNI152 space by a combination of an affine registration from the flipped mean control image to the MPRAGE image and a nonlinear registration from the MPRAGE image to the MNI152 template. A study specific gray matter (GM) mask was generated by combining a binary GM mask based on the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic cortical structural atlas thresholded at 25%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and a brain coverage map covering more than 90% of the subjects. The GM mask was applied to the registered CBF images after 2D Gaussian smoothing with FWHM of 6mm. Voxel wise group comparisons on the CBF maps were carried out with multiple comparison correction based on Gaussian random field theory, with a significance threshold of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 at both voxel and cluster levels. The CBF maps were further correlated with the FMA scores. In addition, ROI based analysis was performed in the primary motor cortex and primary somatosensory (S1) cortex as defined by the Harvard-Oxford cortical structural atlas. For each ROI, relative CBF change was calculated as the difference between the post and pre-training CBF normalized by the latter. A CBF asymmetry ratio was calculated as the contralesional mean CBF over the sum of both sides.</p><p id="Par14">Although all patients had their lesion core in the subcortical area, one stroke subject was removed due to excessive lesion extending to cortical areas, resulting in 9 stroke subjects in each group of the DTI data.

The correlation was not seen in our results, possibly due to the relatively long time post stroke at the study enrollment (range 10&#x02013;86 months, median 29 months), and the wide range of age (29&#x02013;70 years) and baseline motor performance (pre-training FMA ranging from 19.5 to 46), the short intervention duration, or lack of motor execution training on top of the motor imagery training.</p><p id="Par25">Another WM tract that plays important roles in normal motor execution is the corpus callosum, which connects the left and right cortical areas including the motor and somatosensory cortices. We found that the baseline FA in the ipsilesional part of <italic>cc</italic> was affected by the stroke even though it is remote from the lesion. MI-BCI training led to significant FA reduction in the ipsilesional <italic>cc</italic> in the section subserving the premotor and supplementary motor areas. On the other hand, combining with tDCS improved the structural integrity of the middle and posterior parts of the <italic>cc</italic>, which connects the motor and sensory cortices. Previous studies have suggested that the interhemispheric inhibition is critical in the normal unilateral or bilateral movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, which can be interrupted by the impairment of <italic>cc</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. A recent DTI study in chronic stroke patients found that reduced FA in the transcallosal M1-M1connection was negatively associated with motor recovery following tDCS and physical/occupational therapy, but not related to baseline motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, they found the association between white matter microstructural integrity and motor recovery was stronger in the <italic>cc</italic> than in the <italic>cst</italic>. In another study, lower FA in chronic stroke patients compared with healthy control was found in the transcallosal S1-S1 rather than M1-M1 connection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Consistent with these finding, we found increase of FA in the tDCS group more in the sensory (bilaterally) than the motor (only on the ipsilesional side) section of <italic>cc</italic>, suggesting an important involvement of the sensory system in motor function.</p><p id="Par26">The preliminary findings of widespread CBF reduction in stroke patients and the positive correlation between CBF change and FMA change in both sham and tDCS groups are in line with other studies where restoration of perfusion in hypoperfused areas is related to enhanced clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the CBF was reduced in the tDCS group especially in the ipsilesional sensorimotor area. So far, only few studies have reported the short-term effect of tDCS on CBF. A positron emission tomography (PET) study of the CBF in healthy subjects reported that anodal tDCS predominantly increased CBF in many cortical and subcortical areas while cathodal tDCS decreased CBF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. A study using ASL concurrently with tDCS found that CBF increased by either anodal or cathodal tDCS during stimulation, and then continued to be increased a few minutes after anodal stimulation while decreased after cathodal stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Another ASL study of tDCS in healthy volunteers showed widespread CBF decrease within 10&#x02009;minutes after anodal or cathodal tDCS compared to the period during stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. This is consistent with our observation of bilateral CBF reduction in the sensorimotor cortices. Although the ipsilesional CBF correlated with the RMT, the overall mechanisms that lead to such a long-lasting down-regulation of CBF and its implication on the motor function need further investigation.</p><p id="Par27">Another interesting finding in the tDCS group is that the regions where the increase of CBF correlated with functional improvement corresponded well with the cortices subserved by the <italic>cc</italic> sections with higher FA. Earlier DTI and fMRI study showed that greater damage to the <italic>cc</italic> was associated with stronger activation in bilateral motor areas and poorer motor outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. In accordance with this finding, our results suggested that improved transcallosal connectivity associates with recruitment of other functional cortices and/or functional integration, which facilitates the motor recovery. This is different from using MI-BCI alone in the sham group, where the functional recovery is correlated with unilateral, not bilateral, CBF change.</p><p id="Par28">ROI analysis of the CBF in the primary motor and sensory cortices showed that ipsilesional CBF was lower than the contralesional side. After MI-BCI training, CBF was increased on both sides but more on the ipsilesional side, indicating a re-balance process during recovery. This finding supported the hypothesis that balanced interhemispheric interaction is critical for normal motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. On the other hand, tDCS enlarged the interhemispheric difference by reducing the CBF on the ipsilesional more than the contralesional side. Interestingly, the enlarged CBF imbalance did not lead to lower function improvement compared to the sham group, possibly because of the positive effects of tDCS on strengthening the interhemispheric connectivity of the <italic>cc</italic>. Cumulating evidence from magnetoencephalography, electromyography, TMS, and fMRI studies have suggested that the contralesional motor cortices may play either a supporting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> or hindering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> role in the functional recovery of the affected limb, depending on factors such as time post-stroke, lesion size and location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. The exact mechanisms of the interhemispheric interaction and how these may influence post-stroke functional recovery remain to be investigated.</p><p id="Par29">Either enhancing ipsilesional M1 excitability by anodal tDCS, or inhibiting contralesional M1 by cathodal stimulation, has been demonstrated to improve motor function in stroke patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. By combining the two approaches, bi-hemispheric tDCS has been demonstrated to be about 50% more effective than uni-hemispheric tDCS in promoting motor function in healthy subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. A recent study in stroke patients further showed that 5 sessions of physical motor training combined with bi-hemispheric tDCS produced larger functional improvement than physical therapy alone, and the after effects outlasted the intervention by at least 1 week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Our bi-hemispheric tDCS intervention, despite with more training sessions, did not show behavioral advantage over MI-BCI alone. Possible reasons include weaker current intensity applied (1 vs 1.5&#x02009;mA), shorter stimulation duration (20 vs. 30&#x02009;min), later assessment of motor function post training (3 vs 1 week) in our study. On the other hand, studies have suggested that activity in contralesional motor cortices may interfere with the motor recovery of the affected limb in some patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. In particular, decreased contralesional motor excitability may mitigate functional recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. In our study, we didn&#x02019;t find changes in contralesional motor excitability and hence it may not be the reason.</p><p id="Par30">There are several limitations in the current study. First of all, the sample size is relatively small, especially in the CBF analysis with some data removed due to poor image quality. The sample size for RMT measurement was even smaller because no RMT can be determined in several patients even at the maximum stimulation intensity. This has been an issue for most BCI or tDCS studies in stroke rehabilitation. Multi-center study will be needed to not only increase the sample size but also to evaluate the reproducibility. Secondly, though exclusion criteria was carefully set aiming to exclude other neurophysiological or psychiatric confounding conditions, considerable pathological heterogeneity still exists in the patient cohort in terms of the post-stroke time, the size and location of the lesion, and the baseline motor function. All these factors, together with demographic factors such as age, sex, whether the preferred hand was affected, and life-style may contribute to the observed variance in the structure, function and behavior. In our pilot analysis incorporating these factors (except for life-style which was not available) as co-variants into the statistical models relating DTI metrics with behavior score, no significant difference in the results was observed (data not shown). A more homogeneous sample pool will certainly boost the statistical power, though difficult in practice. Thirdly, the impaired vascular function and potentially lower baseline CBF in some patients may affect the accuracy for determination of functional improvement using hemodynamic-based measures, including CBF and blood oxygenation level dependent contrast. In our analysis, percent CBF change was used to minimize the bias of the baseline CBF. In the ROI analysis, no deficiency in CBF was observed in the sensorimotor cortex and hence the analysis on absolute CBF in this area would still represent tissue function. Fourthly, the montage of tDCS used (anode on the M1 and cathode on the contralateral supraorbital area) would make the current passing through not only the primary motor but the premotor and S1 areas as well. Therefore the involvement of these other areas in the plasticity can not be ruled out. Finally, image flipping was used in our processing pipeline to facilitate voxel-wise analysis. The brain is not symmetric along the midline in terms of both structures and functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Therefore image flipping may introduce error in the image registration and variance into the statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par31">In this preliminary study, we found the enhanced neuroplasticity in WM structure and cortical function by tDCS following a combined MI-BCI and tDCS training in chronic stroke patients. Although no further behavioral improvement was found, the long-lasting increase of ipsilesional motor excitability and WM integrity between motor-related areas indicate the facilitating effect of tDCS. Our results support the critical role of interhemispheric interaction in the motor functional recovery. The knowledge of the neuroplasticity in terms of structural and functional alterations and adaptations during cortical neuromodulation and motor learning would facilitate future research to design more effective rehabilitation strategy for chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
