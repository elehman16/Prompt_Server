Traditionally, patients were advised to restrict post-operative activity as this was believed to reduce the risk of disc reherniation and progressive instability. However, this practice would often delay patients return to work. In contemporary practice many surgeons do not restrict patient post-operative activity due to the perception this practice is unnecessary. We describe a randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of activity restrictions on clinical outcome following lumbar discectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">The lumbar microdiscectomy and post-operative activity restriction trial is a multi-centre, randomised, controlled single blinded trial. Two hundred ten patients due to undergo single level lumbar microdiscectomy without a history of previous spine surgery, infection or fracture are randomised to be advised either restricted or unrestricted activity for a period of 30&#x000a0;days following lumbar microdiscectomy. Actual adherence with trial allocation will be monitored bioelectronically via a wearable device. Outcome assessment at follow up will occur at 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome will be a composite endpoint comprising changes in Visual Analogue Scale (Leg and Back), Oswestry Disability Index and the absence of intervertebral disc reherniation or secondary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This randomised controlled trial will directly compare post-operative protocols of activity restrictions and no restrictions following lumbar discectomy with adherence monitored bioelectronically.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p id="Par4">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=371557&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN12616001360404</ext-link> (retrospectively registered 30/09/2016).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lumbar Discectomy</kwd><kwd>Spine</kwd><kwd>Restrictions</kwd><kwd>Post-Operative</kwd><kwd>Sitting</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Cabrini Research Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Lumbar microdiscectomy is the most commonly performed spinal surgical procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Lumbar microdiscectomy is indicated for radicular pain unresponsive to conservative management (e.g. analgesia and physiotherapy), neurological deficit (e.g. weakness) or for cauda equina syndrome.</p><p id="Par6">Lumbar microdiscectomy is minimally invasive, patients typically mobilize the same day and are discharged home the following day, making the operation suitable for day-procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Traditionally following surgery, patients have been advised to restrict sitting, lifting or resuming other activities of everyday life, and are advised to either stand or lie for variable periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Sitting imposes greater intradiscal pressure than does standing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] though evidence that increased pressure increases disc reherniation risk is lacking.</p><p id="Par7">Such restrictions impact upon patients&#x02019; ability to return to work, travel or drive and basic comfort. It has been suggested that activity restrictions may also raise patient anxiety regarding reherniation risk. Moreover, neurosurgical practice regarding activity restriction varies, the dearth of evidence resulting in absence of clear clinical guidelines for surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational physicians. If no difference in outcomes are observed between groups in this randomised controlled trial future patients would be able to rapidly resume their normal activities, productivity, work and do so without fear or associated psychological morbidity. This would provide an evidence base to postoperative care and consensus amongst surgeons.</p><p id="Par8">Two prospective studies published in the 1990s reported incidence of symptomatic recurrent disc protrusions and reoperation, and time to return to work in a cohort of patients whose movement was not restricted post lumbar microdiscectomy. Compared to rates in the literature among movement-restricted patients, adverse outcomes in this cohort were not considered higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, in the absence of a control group and randomisation, the evidence from such studies is relatively weak.</p><p id="Par9">Bono et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] recently published the first report of a randomised controlled trial investigating post-operative activity restrictions following lumbar discectomy. This trial compared post-operative protocols consisting of short (two weeks) and long (six weeks) periods of activity restriction following lumbar discectomy. The authors observed no significant difference in outcome as assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) back or leg pain or Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Disc reherniation rates differed between the groups observing short (11%) and long (7%) periods of activity restriction. This difference did not achieve statistical significance or translate into an appreciable difference in clinical outcome. However, the authors noted the study was underpowered to detect a significant difference in disc reherniation rate and calculated approximately 800 patients per arm would be required to achieve sufficient statistical power.</p><p id="Par10">All previous studies on post-operative restrictions following lumbar discectomy have relied on self-reported adherence to mobility restrictions. Non-adherence is a well-recognized phenomena in spine surgery trials with non-adherence rates in SPORT approximately 40% at one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Such outcomes are likely to be biased. Contemporary wearable electronic devices that can accurately record the patient&#x02019;s position (i.e. sitting/standing) enable empirical observation of patient adherence to a regimen of sitting restrictions with great reliability. This trial will be the first to track post-operative adherence to activity restrictions following lumbar discectomy and the impact of adherence on outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Question</title><p id="Par11">Is the outcome of patients without restrictions inferior to those observing sitting and activity restrictions following lumbar discectomy?</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par12">The study aims to determine whether the outcome of patients without imposed sitting and other behavioral restrictions post lumbar microdiscectomy are inferior to those of patients with imposed restrictions, in terms of disc reherniation, pain and disability outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p id="Par13">The will be a randomised controlled surgeon and assessor-blinded trial.

Intervertebral disc reherniation and reoperation are important considerations as potential primary endpoints. In SPORT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] 20% of patients who underwent surgery rated their progress as less than a major improvement at one year yet only 6% had undergone reoperation. Thus, reherniation and reoperation alone do not account for the majority of unsatisfactory patient outcomes following lumbar discectomy. The use of a composite endpoint allows for the capture of multiple outcomes that influence the overall success of a clinical intervention while also allowing for increased statistical efficiency and efficient resource utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">As such the primary endpoint to be assessed in this trial consists of a composite of the following widely accepted outcome measures:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par39">18 point reduction in VAS lower back</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">25 point reduction in VAS legs</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">15 point improvement in ODI score</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">Absence of disc reherniation (defined as repeat surgery at the same level)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">No other secondary intervention (epidural or nerve root injection, medial branch block)</p></list-item></list>

The authors recruited 108 patients and noted disc reherniation rates of 11% in the 2-week restriction group and 9% in the 6-week restriction group. Previous studies have indicated a reherniation rate ranging from 2 to 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Annual reported reherniation rates have been closer to 4&#x02013;5% in large series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The authors of the randomised controlled trial calculated it would be necessary to have 800 patients in each arm in order to detect a statistically significant difference in disc reherniation rate and that this may not be feasible. We are in agreement with this assessment.</p><p id="Par70">Reported rates of clinical success for lumbar discectomy vary widely dependent on the criteria.

Furthermore, prolonged sitting has been suggested to decrease lumbar lordosis, increase spinal loading and muscle activity and contribute to accelerated disc degeneration and low back pain independent of previous operative intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The randomised controlled trial of Bono et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] demonstrated no significant difference in outcome measures between patients who observed two weeks or six weeks of activity restrictions though was underpowered to detect differences in reherniation rates. The only prior studies investigating the impact of removing post-operative restrictions reported no increased risk of reherniation or reoperation in patients not observing activity restrictions following lumbar discectomy surgery but these studies lacked a comparator group and their design was subject to potential bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Modern lumbar discectomy is now minimally invasive and results in less tissue destruction, further undermining the hypothetical rationale for activity restriction. In a recent survey of Australasian Neurosurgeons, many advised either no sitting restrictions (22%) or sitting as comfort allows (40%) [unpublished data, Daly et al.]. However, the vast majority (84%) advised restricted lifting.</p><p id="Par76">In an uncontrolled prospective cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] patients who did not observe post-operative activity restrictions returned to work earlier. Mean time to return to work in the cohort was 1.2&#x000a0;weeks. Currently extant recommendations suggest four to 16&#x000a0;weeks off work following lumbar discectomy surgery.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Activity monitoring/adherence</title><p id="Par77">The activity monitor will monitor and record patient posture (i.e. lying, sitting or standing) and activity (walking, running or cycling) over the one month period following lumbar microdiscectomy. This device is sensitive to acceleration. The validation report described 90.8% correlation between activity monitor output and video analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Data is recorded over the one month period on the stand-alone device and then transferred to the study computer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par78">Back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and intervertebral disc degeneration is a significant contributor to back pain. Lumbar microdiscectomy, performed for symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation, is the most commonly performed spine surgical procedure. Activity restrictions have traditionally been recommended following this operation and patients often advised to delay return to work for four or more weeks with restrictions of similar duration applied to other activities of daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Clarification of the role of post-operative restrictions will allow standardisation of post-operative care and potentially allow patients to return to work more rapidly thus reducing the social and economic burden of this condition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par79">Trial funding was provided by the Monash Department of Surgery Infrastructure Fund and Cabrini Private Hospital Research Grant.
