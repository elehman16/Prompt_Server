It is increasingly evident that gut microbes influence the host&#x02019;s metabolic and immunological activities <xref rid="pone.0087796-Musso1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bckhed1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Accordingly, intestinal microorganisms may influence the development of both intestinal and generalized inflammation, although the mechanism remains unclear <xref rid="pone.0087796-Turnbaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087796-Turnbaugh2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the intestine is a site of inflammatory processes. Several biomarkers, including calprotectin (CLP), S100A12, IL-8, IgM, IgG, neutrophil elastase, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, and eosinophil cationic protein, have been used to detect intestinal inflammation in patients with CF <xref rid="pone.0087796-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. We previously found increased concentrations of fecal CLP and rectal nitric oxide (rNO) in children with CF, suggesting that intestinal inflammation is a feature of CF <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bruzzese1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This finding was confirmed by endoscopy in children with CF <xref rid="pone.0087796-Werlin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that patients with CF have a different pattern of intestinal microbes than do healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0087796-Scanlan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087796-Duytschaever1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The majority of bacteria present in the intestinal and respiratory tracts were represented by 8 distinct genera, and there was a microbial link between the two organ systems that was reflected in core microbiota dominated by <italic>Veillonella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species <xref rid="pone.0087796-Madan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Further, fecal samples from CF patients consistently demonstrated reduced loads of bifidobacteria <xref rid="pone.0087796-Duytschaever2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In a preliminary cross-over trial in children with CF, administration of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG (LGG) was associated with a reduction in intestinal inflammation as measured by CLP and rNO concentrations <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bruzzese1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Interestingly, administration of LGG was associated with a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and hospital admissions and an improvement in the forced respiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bruzzese2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087796-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These data suggest that probiotics delay respiratory impairment, which is a major goal in the treatment of CF.</p><p>On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that there exists a link between the composition of intestinal microbiota and inflammation. Although direct evidence is not available, the intestinal microenvironment in children with CF is expected to be different from that of healthy children as a consequence of Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) malfunction, frequent use of antibiotics, pancreatic enzyme supplementation, and pharmacological suppression of gastric acid production. Intraluminal pH varies with the anatomical site and microbial fermentation of dietary residues; these variations may affect the composition of the bacterial community and its metabolic activity <xref rid="pone.0087796-Belenguer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, among children with atopy, the administration of LGG induced a global modification of intestinal microflora, suggesting that an intestinal microbiome composed of a multitude of probiotic species may protect against the development of allergic disease when compared with one dominated by a single commensal species <xref rid="pone.0087796-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The aims of the present study were 1) to investigate the composition of gut microbiota in children with CF as compared with healthy controls, 2) to investigate the correlation between microbial balance and intestinal inflammation, and 3) to test the hypothesis that LGG administration restores intestinal microflora and decreases inflammation in children with CF. First, we analyzed fecal microbiota by carrying out denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of fecal samples of children with CF. To investigate the effects of the administration of LGG on composition of microbiota and intestinal inflammation, 22 children with CF were enrolled in a short-term study with administration of LGG. The effect of probiotic intake on intestinal microbial structure was investigated by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) based on the results of DGGE and RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087796.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087796.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>We enrolled clinically stable children with CF who had no acute intestinal or extraintestinal diseases and had not taken antibiotics for at least two weeks.

Stool samples were collected from healthy controls in order to investigate intestinal microbiota composition in an age-matched population. Intestinal microflora was also evaluated by FISH in an additional population of children with CF who were on antibiotic treatment. Twenty-two children with CF were enrolled in the randomized double-blind clinical trial in order to evaluate the effect of LGG on intestinal inflammation and intestinal microflora composition.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment or placebo arms. Patients randomized to the treatment arm received 6&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> CFU of LGG once daily for 1 month. Patients randomized to the placebo arm received placebo once daily for 1 month. The randomization protocol was generated by a statistician not involved in patient management. LGG and placebo formulations were masked and coded appropriately to ensure blindness. LGG formulations were composed of maltodextrin (163 mg), gelatin capsule (75 mg), LGG (60 mg), and magnesium stearate (2 mg). The placebo was composed of maltodextrin (223 mg), gelatin capsule (75 mg), and magnesium stearate (2 mg). LGG and placebo capsules were identical in appearance, taste, and color, and only a numeric code differentiated the two formulations.</p><p>Before and after administration of LGG or placebo, a microbiological investigation was carried out using FISH, and intestinal CLP concentration was measured. This study constituted a pilot study in preparation for a large trial, and it was formally registered as a clinical trial at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01961661).

However, the causal relationship between aberrations in microbiota and specific diseases remains unclear. Specific abnormalities in intestinal microbiota that are consistently associated with a pathological condition are termed &#x0201c;signatures.&#x0201d; This raises the possibility that a specific pattern of intestinal microbiology maybe a &#x0201c;hallmark&#x0201d; of disease rather than contributes to pathophysiology of a disease <xref rid="pone.0087796-Buccigrossi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>We previously reported that intestinal inflammation is frequent in patients with CF <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bruzzese1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The present study confirms that intestinal microecology is disrupted in children with CF and is significantly different from that of age-matched healthy controls. There were three specific hallmarks of the CF microbiota: 1) reduction in species richness, 2) reduction in species similarity among children with CF, and 3) a different pattern of bacterial species. A different pattern of bacterial species in children with CF was characterized by an absence or reduction in selected species and the presence or increase in others as compared with healthy controls.</p><p>The DGGE profiles showed a reduced number of bands, indicating a reduction in biological diversity. This result was supported by the differences in Shannon index between children with CF and healthy controls. A reduction in biodiversity of microbiota is a marker of dysbiosis and is probably a consequence of selective environmental pressures <xref rid="pone.0087796-Marteau1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, it is also associated with intestinal inflammation, including active inflammatory bowel disease <xref rid="pone.0087796-Takaishi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In addition to the limited biodiversity, the common &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; of bands detected in all healthy controls was absent from children with CF. Several of the profiles of children with CF did not contain the microbiologic core, and others contained only a few bands of the core. This pattern suggests that the core structure of the intestinal microbiota is disrupted in children with CF, who may have their own specific pattern. These findings apply to children with severe CF genotypes and may not hold true in milder cases of CF.</p><p>We hypothesized that the abnormal small-intestine environment of patients with CF, which is characterized by electrolyte abnormalities and an acidic pH, could select for specific bacterial genera and species. In turn, the aberrant microbiota could contribute to, rather than result from, intestinal inflammation in CF. The hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence. Recently, intestinal microbiota of identical twins with Crohn&#x02019;s disease were molecularly analyzed; results indicated that the microbial profiles of individuals with ileal involvement significantly differed from healthy controls and from patients with colonic involvement <xref rid="pone.0087796-Dicksved1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In particular, reduced abundance of <italic>B. uniformis</italic> and increased abundance of <italic>B. ovatus</italic> and <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> were detected in patients with Crohn&#x02019;s disease with ileal involvement as compared with those with colonic involvement and in healthy controls. <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> was also reduced in ileal specimens from children with Crohn&#x02019;s disease, ulcerative colitis, and indeterminate colitis as compared with control subjects <xref rid="pone.0087796-Conte1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Low levels of <italic>B. vulgatus</italic>, <italic>B. ovatus</italic>, <italic>B. uniformis</italic>, and <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> spp. were also detected in patients with ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome as compared with healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0087796-Noor1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>We found a similar reduction in the abundance of <italic>B. uniformis</italic> and <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> in children with CF as compared with healthy controls. We also identified a significant reduction in <italic>E. rectale</italic> in children with CF. <italic>E. rectale</italic> is a butyrate-producing bacteria, and butyrate is the preferred energy source for colonic mucosa, protecting it from colitis and colorectal cancer and promoting the normal development of colonic epithelial cells. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a protective role against intestinal inflammation, and it is possible that SCFA-producing intestinal microbiota may prevent intestinal inflammation. We speculate that the reduced load of <italic>E. rectale</italic>, <italic>B. vulgatus</italic>, and <italic>B. uniformis</italic> found in children with CF may be involved in intestinal inflammation.</p><p>We also found a significant inverse correlation between the richness of CF microbiota and intestinal inflammation. This was most evident in children with fecal CLP concentrations &#x0003e;200 &#x000b5;g/g, who showed a significantly lower number of bands in the upper part of the gel, which corresponds to <italic>Bacteroides</italic> (data not shown). Administration of antibiotics further reduced the same microbial species already reduced in children with CF as compared with healthy controls.</p><p>We further investigated the role of probiotic administration on intestinal microbiota. Lynch <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported that LGG administration affected the overall composition of intestinal microbiota in a population of infants at high risk for asthma <xref rid="pone.0087796-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This finding raised the hypothesis that administration of a single probiotic strain may globally modify the microbiota, thus promoting bacterial communities that modulate host immune responses. In the present study, LGG administration restored the composition of intestinal microbiota, making it more similar to that of healthy controls. There was a concurrent reduction in intestinal inflammation, similar to previous trials <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bruzzese1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bruzzese2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Together with previously reported benefits for respiratory exacerbations, hospital admissions, and respiratory function, our results indicate that LGG administration modifies intestinal microbiota and ultimately contributes to its beneficial clinical effects <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bruzzese1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087796-Bruzzese2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our data provide direct evidence that intestinal microbiota are disrupted in children with CF and is associated with intestinal inflammation. Antibiotic therapy exacerbates these abnormalities. The administration of LGG may partially restore a healthy intestinal microbiota, thus promoting communities that limit intestinal inflammation and improving the disease course.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0087796.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
