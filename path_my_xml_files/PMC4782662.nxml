not studies about its action when used in lacquer vehicle to control skin
lesions. A double-blind study was conducted with 40 patients that utilized
clobetasol 0.05% in one hemibody and just the vehicle in the other hemibody.
Twenty of them used petrolatum as vehicle and the others used lacquer. An
assessment was conducted using the clinical index PASI and a quality of life
questionnaire (Dermatological Life Quality Index). There was no statistical
difference between groups. There was a trend of favorable response particularly
in the hemibody treated with clobetasol.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Clobetasol</kwd><kwd>Psoriasis</kwd><kwd>Therapeutics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>FAPESP</funding-source><award-id>2008/09433-9</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>Financial Support: FAPESP: research support 2008/09433-9 CNPq:

accelerated cell proliferation of keratinocytes and by the inflammation that originate
parakerotosic scales.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Its cause is still unknown. However, it is known that
its onset or exacerbation depend on several factors: genetic, immunological,
environmental, and biochemical, besides the influence of emotional factor.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Treatment may be topical or systemic. Use of clo-betasol propionate, a synthetic
glucocorticosteroid with high power, is already known and widely used.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
Most patients (80%) present mild clinical form of the disease and are candidates for
topical treatment. Even patients with extensive forms of the disease often continue with
resistant lesions after systemic treatment and require association with topic
medications. Treatment is also problematic due to the fact that disease manifestations
are not uniform and due to adhesion difficulties.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In the case of topical
treatments, it occurs mostly due to cosmeceutical issues (drugs that have unpleasant
odor or that dirty the clothes).<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Therefore, we sought a vehicle option
that could increase adherence to treatment. The use of clobetasol in lacquer still
hadn't been evaluated in skin lesions and was expected to eliminate the mentioned
cosmetic factors that occur with certain ointments.</p><p>This study, developed after receiving authorization from the Ethics Committee of the
Medical School (FCM)/ Unicamp, was prospective and double-blind. We selected two groups
of 20 patients. Both groups used clobetasol 0.05%: the first group used lacquer as
vehicle and the second used petrolatum. In both cases, volunteers were given two
bottles, one with "R" indication, to be used on the right hemibody, and another with "L"
indication, to be used on the left hemibody. Only one of the bottles contained the
active ingredient and only the person responsible for the formulation knew this
information.</p><p>For the selection of volunteer patients we used PASI index (Psoriasis Area and Severity
Index), which assesses the extent and severity of psoriasis. With the assessment of PASI
it is possible to classify psoriasis as mild, moderate and severe based on skin
manifestations. The disease is considered mild when indexes are &#x02264;10 and moderate
to severe when they are &#x02265;10.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Patients assisted by the Dermatology
Department of the State University of Campinas Medical School (FCM-UNICAMP), presenting
mild to moderate psoriasis at the beginning of the protocol, participated in the
research. The study selected individuals with a minimum age of 18 years, with no use of
topical treatments or sudden changes of clinical presentation for at least two months.
Patients with severe form of the disease at baseline or known allergy to lacquer were
excluded.</p><p>The study included 40 patients, 24 men. Mean age was 53.9 years, ranging between 18 and
81 years.</p><p>In the initial consultation, after prior consent by volunteers, the attending physician
determined the clinical index of each hemibody, based on PASI criteria. The same
procedure was conducted in consultations in Day 30 and Day 60 of treatment. Patients
also answered, in each of these consultations, to the self-administered questionnaire
DLQI (Dermatological Life Quality Index) used to assess quality of life.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>In the end, clinical rates obtained were confronted with the information declared by the
pharmaceutical and the analysis of the DLQI values was performed. For the comparative
analysis of the results, we used the SPSS 15.0 program.</p><p>Three patients in each group did not complete the proposed two months of treatment. In
the group using lacquer as vehicle, two patients reported severe pruritus associated
with erythematous lesions after a few days of application of the lacquer, and another
patient was withdrawn due to clinical worsening. Use of lacquer in extensor areas, such
as knee and elbow, has also been criticized by two patients who completed the study, due
to the occurrence of dryness, breaking of the film and and desintegration of the
product. In the group using petrolatum as vehicle, two patients left the protocol and
another presented allergy referred as eyelid swelling and pruritus on the face, which
led to the suspension of topical use.</p><p>Clinical rates of each hemibody showed an improvement tendency in both groups of
patients. This tendency was also observed even in hemibodies in which only the vehicle
was applied, according to the graphics on the mean and standard deviation for a 95%
confidence interval. Considering the mean, there was an improvement in both groups, most
evident within the first month of treatment. The hemibodies exposed to lacquer showed a
higher improvement tendency compared with that observed in control hemibodies. Observing
the mean, this tendency was slightly higher in hemibodies treated with clobetasol
ointment. As standard deviations touch, there was no statistically significant
difference between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Tendency of
improvement in the hemibody exposed only to vehicle may represent a placebo effect of
topical use, but the possibility of absorption of the active ingredient in both vehicles
and hydrating/moisturizing potential of the ointment vehicle should be considered.</p><p>

</p><p>Results obtained with DLQI are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">figure
2</xref>, whose distribution shows that there was a tendency toward improvement of
quality of life in both groups, with no statistical difference between them.</p><p>Results suggest that use of clobetasol in lacquer must be considered, especially in the
most localized lesions and psoriasis thinner plaques, besides the use in nail
lesions.</p><p>
