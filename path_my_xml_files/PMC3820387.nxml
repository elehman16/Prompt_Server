on pain, and stiffness of patients with stroke-induced chronic osteoarthritis. [Subjects]
Forty-four patients with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to either the whirlpool
group (n=24) or the control group (n=20). [Methods] Subjects in the whirlpool group
immersed their legs in a whirlpool bath at 40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C for 40 minutes 5 times a week for 8
weeks. The control group of patients was instructed to perform activities as usual without
using a whirlpool bath. Pre-immersion and post-immersion measurements of the Western
Ontario and McMaster University arthritis index (WOMAC)-pain and stiffness indexes were
compared to determine the effects of the intervention. The paired t-test was performed to
test the significance of differences before and after the experiment. The independent
t-test was conducted in order to test the significance of differences between the
whirlpool and control groups. Statistical significance was accepted for values of
p&#x0003c;0.05. [Results] The WOMAC-pain score, and stiffness index were significantly lower
after the intervention. [Conclusion] Immersion of the lower extremities in a whirlpool
bath was beneficial for patients with chronic stroke-induced knee osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Whirlpool</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is caused by the blockage of brain blood vessels or hemorrhage. The main symptoms of
stroke are sensory, motor, cognitive, and emotional problems, and they impose constraints on
carrying out basic daily activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These stroke problems are treated focusing on the nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pain caused by stroke is mainly neuropathic arising from damage to the central nervous
system, and it occurs in parts related to the neurological system that are related to
cerebrovascular lesions. These pains are continuous or intermittent and are associated with
sensory abnormalities at the site of pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, musculoskeletal pain in patients with stroke is a
consequence of stroke. It results from excessive use, and causes secondary functional
disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Excessive use of the
unaffected side of patients with stroke, damages the soft tissue, and intra-articular
cartilage changes occur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Radiographs of
the knee joint of the hemiparetic and unaffected side of post-stroke hemiplegia patients
show asymmetry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, in the lower
limbs of elderly subjects or patients with hemiplegia, causes the part with arthritis is
most commonly the knee. Osteoarthritis is a disease that causes pain and physical
dysfunction as articular cartilage wears out and local degenerative change appears<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In patients with stroke, knee arthritis
induces arthralgia, ROM limitation, muscle strength reduction, and motor dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, preceding studies using
non-surgical intervention methods for patients with osteoarthritis have reported electrical
treatments such as superficial heat application and short wave diathermy for deep heat
application<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation, electro-acupuncture, low level laser therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and therapeutic exercises such as aerobic exercise show
beneficial effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Water is commonly used in the therapeutic field as it generally has an effect that promotes
healing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Whirlpool treatment was
first started by the French army in the period of the First World War. It is currently used
as a treatment method in many countries for medical and surgical conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The whirlpool treatment relaxes muscle
tension, and provides a feeling of comfort. Especially, in post-surgical patients, it
decreases pain, reduces complications, and helps to bring forward the discharge date<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Whirlpools are recommended as a treatment
for reducing pain in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, we couldn't find any reports in
the literature of research targeting osteoarthritis of patients with stroke.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects on pain, stiffness, and
function of whirlpool treatment for patients with knee osteoarthritis caused by chronic
stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were patients with stroke who were hospitalized at a university
hospital located in D city. The selection criterion was patients who had had stroke with
hemiplegia for more than 6 months and less than 5&#x02005;years. The exclusion criteria were:
patients who were incapable of cycling or functional training due to lumbodynia,
inflammation of the joints, or degenerative disease, who were undergoing other medical
treatments for other specific details, or who were incapable of implementing exercise
programs due to inability to understand verbal commands due to severe impairment of
perceptual abilities, or cognitive and communication disorders. Through the selection
criteria, 50 patients were enrolled in this research. Prior to distributing consent forms,
all the subjects received an explanation of the procedures and the purpose of this research,
and the research was then implemented with subjects who signed consent forms.</p><p>The 50 subjects who were selected by the selection criteria were randomly divided into 2
groups, 25 subjects each were allocated to the whirlpool group and the control group. The
randomization method was selection of a sealed envelope. During the 8 weeks of the research,
1 patient in the whirlpool group, and 5 patients in the control group dropped out, leaving
24 subjects in the whirlpool group, and 20 subjects in the control group. The data of these
subjects were used in the statistics of the final analysis. The reasons for dropping out
were: three patients in the control group moved to another hospital, and the remainder gave
up voluntarily.</p><p>In the whirlpool group, the subjects' legs were immersed in whirlpool baths at 40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C for 30
minutes after conservative physical therapy for 30 minutes. The subjects of the control
group received conservative physical therapy only for 30 minutes without the whirlpool bath.
The interventions were conducted 5 times a week for 8 weeks.</p><p>In this study, pain and stiffness were used to evaluate the knee osteoarthritis of the
subjects, patients with stroke. For assessment tools, the Western Ontario and McMaster
University Arthritis Index (WOMAC) was used. WOMAC has 3 categories of pain, stiffness, and
function. In this study, WOMAC-pain scores and WOMAC-stiffness scores were used. Subjects
are interpreted to have better functional status when their WOMAC scores are lower<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many translated versions of the WOMAC
indices in several languages are available. The Korean version of WOMAC used in this study
has a good reliability (ICC 0.79&#x02013;0.89) and its psychometric properties are comparable with
those of the original<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SPSS 18.0 for Windows was used for the statistical analysis of this research. The data were
normally distributed. To compare the before and after exercise effects within the whirlpool
group and the control group, the paired sample t-test was implemented. To compare the
difference between the two groups, the independent sample t-test was implemented. The level
of statistical significance (&#x003b1;) was chosen as 0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender<break/>(male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke type<break/>(CI/ICH)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemiplegic side<break/>(Rt./Lt.)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age<break/>(years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height<break/>(cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight<break/>(kg)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Whirlpool Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14/10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.1 (4.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160.6 (6.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.2 (8.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13/7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12/8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.3 (4.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.5 (7.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.0 (7.5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are frequency or mean (SD), CI; Cerebral Infarction, ICH; Intra-Cranial

arising from hemiplegia and compensatory behavior by the unaffected side<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Arthritis accompanying stroke causes pain,
and worsens patients' functional status, becoming an undermining cause of independent
living<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic pain is observed in
75% of patients with stroke, and the level of pain is moderate to severe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the whirlpool treatment
had a meaningful effect on pain and stiffness.</p><p>Water soaking treatments utilize hydrostatic pressure, buoyancy, viscosity and
thermodynamics, physical characteristics of water. Especially, hydrostatic immersion
combined with warm temperature particularly is bath effective at reducing and improving
blood circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, the
optimum temperature of a whirlpool bath is 36&#x02013;40&#x000b0;C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since Koreans prefer hot temperature, 40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C was used in this
research. The pain score after the whirlpool therapy reduced 26%, from 15.0 to 11.1
(p&#x0003c;0.05). The stiffness reduced 37.3%, from 5.9 scores to 3.7 (p&#x0003c;0.05). Heat treatment
for patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis involve conduction such as hot
pack and paraffin bath, convection such as whirlpool bathing, and methods that uses
conversion such as ultrasound<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The warm
whirlpool bath used in this research had a heat transfer effect on the immersed area. Blood
flow, capillary permeability, nerve conduction, and collagen extensibility increases through
vasodilation as a result of heat treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore in this research, we think that pain and stiffness were
reduced by the effect of heat. During whirlpool immersion, the pain adjustment mechanism
which is generated by the warm water temperature and water turbulence increases the
threshold of pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, whirlpool
therapy increased joint ROM by stimulating the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it is not correct to conclude
that all aspects of arthritis improve with pain reduction. In previous research, not all
pain reductions due to interventions for knee osteoarthritis were reflected in patients'
activity levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle weakness of
muscles such as the quadriceps is the major cause of knee osteoarthritis. Proprioceptive
deficits of joints as well as muscle weakness impose limitations on physical balance and
daily living activities of patients with arthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. With the purpose of restoring the strength of weakened muscles,
muscle strengthening exercises have been effective for arthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, research into the effects of muscle
strengthening exercise combined with whirlpool treatment for post-stroke arthritis patients
is necessary in the future. A limitation of this study is that the physical function
assessment of WOMAC was not performed, because it is difficult to distinguish whether the
cause of functional limitation is osteoarthritis or stroke. Therefore, further study of the
functional evaluation of stroke patients with osteoarthritis is needed consider specific
outcome measures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Sun Moon University Research Grant of 2010.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>KN</given-names></name><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><name><surname>Au</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Relationship of motor and cognitive abilities to
