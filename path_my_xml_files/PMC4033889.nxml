The patterns due to the as-prepared material bear with it the characteristic patterns of HA but not with much resolution and intensity. It contained no other crystalline phase other than HA. The broad patterns around at 30&#x000b0; indicate that the crystallites are very tiny (~20 nm) in nature with much atomic oscillations.

The results of the present study demonstrated an improvement in clinical and radiographic parameters with use of HA graft. The difference in the oral hygiene status from baseline to 3 months and 6 months respectively and from 3 months to 6 months were statistically insignificant. This suggests that oral hygiene was maintained optimally well throughout the period of study. Similar pattern was observed for the plaque scores and gingival index scores. Yukna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Meffert <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also reported no effect on the plaque index when HA graft was used in treatment of intrabony defects. The above studies, like the present followed strict plaque control and maintenance of oral hygiene throughout the study period. These observations suggest that HA was well tolerated in the hard and soft tissues and does not seem to evoke any inflammatory response significantly. The similar results have been confirmed clinically by Kenny <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] who reported uneventful post-operative healing. The HA was well tolerated by the gingival tissues during initial healing and thereafter including 6-month evaluation period.</p><p>The present study demonstrates a decrease in PD from baseline to 3 months and 6 months with difference of 3.25 &#x000b1; 1.2304 mm and 3.75 &#x000b1; 1.6874 mm respectively which was found to be statistically significant. However, the decrease from 3 to 6 months was statistically insignificant. Similar observations were seen for relative attachment level. These findings signify the use of HA graft in the clinical resolution of intrabony defects. Also, Kenny <italic>et al</italic>. reported in the re-entry data that there was a measurable improvement in the gain of attachment level which was duplicated with an equivalent improvement in the depth of the defect seen at re-entry.</p><p>In accordance with the observations of the current study, Yukna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also reported a decrease in pocket depth of 2.8 &#x000b1; 1.4 mm and gain in clinical attachment level of 1 &#x000b1; 0.1 mm. On comparison with the current study, this decrease is less. This is because the period of evaluation in the study of Yukna <italic>et al</italic>. was of 5 years during which some recurrence might have occurred due to the lack of oral hygiene maintenance by the patients.</p><p>The improvement in the clinical probing and relative attachment level was well supported by the decrease in the radiographic area of the intrabony defect in the control group of the present study, which was determined in a manner similar to that as described by Eickholz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The observations of the present study show a decrease in the size of the defect from baseline to 3 and 6 months respectively to be statistically significant. Also, the difference from 3 months to 6 months was statistically significant.</p><p>The increase in the radiodensity in the defect, and hence a decrease in the defect size, signifies that use of HA graft results in resolution of the intrabony defect. However, the nature of the restoration of the defect that whether the graft acted as a filler material or allowed for ingrowth of the bone cannot be inferred from the clinical and radiographic observations of the present study. Evaluation of the true nature of attachment requires histological investigation.</p><p>In accordance with the radiological observations of the current study, Okuda <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Scabbia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] evaluated the depth of the intrabony defect radiographically using the same landmarks used in the current study after a period of 12 months and reported significant gain in the bone height and reduction of the depth of the defect.</p><p>Osteoconductivity, solubility, sinterability, and mechanical reliability of HA can be enhanced by controlling its particle size and structural morphology in the order of a nanoscale. NHA which has been used as a test material in the present study posseses exceptional biocompatibility and bioactivity properties with respect to bone cells and tissues, probably due to its similarity with the hard tissues of the body.</p><p>Beside a good biocompatibility, a synthetic bone substitute should also ensure the formation of new bone after their implantation. It would seem rational to suggest that particles too large in size will resorb at a slower rate and offer a overall reduced surface area, while particles too small in size may induce inflammation, be readily resorbed or phagocytosed and result in an interparticulate space of a reduced dimension that would not be conducive to cellular migration and ingrowth.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In fact, an optimal synthetic bone substitute is resorbed by hydrolytic and cellular degradation process involving the action of macrophages and further is replaced by vital bone over time. A major prerequisite for this process is angiogenesis because newly formed blood vessels transport oxygen and nutrients into the implanted bone substitute, a physiological milieu is created, which supports the ingrowth of bone cells and also differentiation of pluripotent stem cells from the surrounding tissue to an osteoblastic phenotype.</p><p>Laschke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that NHA revealed areas of degradation at day 14 after implantation. However, 2 weeks is too early a rate of resorption and clinical results following and any gain in clinical attachment level or decrease in an intrabony defect is highly unexpected. In contrast, our study showed a significant decrease in pocket PD and decrease in radiographic area of defect. Therefore, more histological studies are required to determine the degradation rate of NHA. Furthur Laschke also reported that within these areas, vascularized granulation tissue could directly invade the biomaterial. This guided vascularization may accelerate formation of new bone in bone defects, because osteoblasts are facilitated to migrate into these vascularized areas where the remaining nondegraded fragments serve as scaffold for invading cells. In this process, the newly developing blood vessels play an important role, because it has previously been reported that endothelial cells stimulate the differentiation of preosteoblasts to osteoblasts by expression of osteotropic growth factors, such as endothelin-1 and Insulin like growth factor (IGF -1). Vice-versa, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by osteoblasts further sustains the proliferation of endothelial cells and thus the formation of new blood vessels.</p><p>Sun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study demonstrated that NHA can promote periodontal ligament fibroblast proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in comparison with dense HA. Furthermore, they reported that the increased proliferation capability of periodontal ligament fibroblasts under the influence of nanometer order HA indicated that latter had better compatibility and resorbability than dense HA. Recent research has shown that synthetic nanostructured HA has higher biocompatibility for microvascular endothelium.</p><p>Nanostructured HA promotes up-regulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)-2 and primes endothelial cells to VEGF action. FGF-2 plays a biological pleiotropic role, including cell migration, angiogenesis, bone development and repair. Also, a synthetic bone substitute must not only support the growth and foster the phenotype of the cell type for the tissue it is to replace (i.e., osteoblasts), but also support the cells that are responsible for maintaining the bone cells (i.e., fibroblasts) The upregulation of FGF-2 through gene transcription is an important event which explains the role of HA nanocrystals in inducing a positive and controlled angiogenic phenotype in endothelium. The robust increase of FGF-2m RNA (3-6 fold) translates into a significant production of the soluble FGF-2 isoform.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In the current study it was decided to use powder form of NHA which served as the test group of the study. The results of the test group demonstrate statistically insignificant difference in plaque scores from 3 to 6 months. A similar trend was seen in the simplified oral hygiene index scores and gingival index scores. On comparison of the test group with the control no significant difference was observed, which showed that NHA did not have any adjunctive effect in improving the plaque scores or the oral hygiene of the patient. These factors were more influenced by the fact that bilateral defects were chosen and patient's own maintenance which was reinforced timely during the recall periods.</p><p>In the present study there was statistically significant difference in the PD and relative attachment level between baseline and 3 months and baseline and 6 months in the test group. But there was no significant difference between 3 months and 6 months in the test group. Similar to the other parameters, no significant improvement of the test group was seen over the control group. These observations parallel that of the study of Kasaj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] who reported significant improvement in PD and clinical attachment level (CAL) at 6 months after surgery compared to baseline. In a previous study evaluating the healing of intrabony peri-implantitis defects following an application of an NHA paste as a graft or a bovine derived Xenograft in combination with a collagen membrane, both treatment procedures produced clinically significant PD reductions and CAL gains.</p><p>The use of NHA in the treatment of periodontal defects was evaluated in the pioneer study of Zuev <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] who found Ostim to be not inferior to bone transplant and devoid of its shortcomings in the treatment of 395 patients with periodontal defects including mainly periodontal abcesses. Later Kasaj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] stated that at 6 months after surgery, the treatment of intrabony periodontal defects with an NHA paste produced clinically and statistically significant PD reductions and CAL gains compared to open flap debridement alone.</p><p>On the other hand Heinz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] compared clinical outcomes of papilla preservation flap surgery with or without the application of a novel NHA bone graft substitute. They observed that after 6 months statistically significant reduction in probing pocket depths and gain in probing bone levels in the test group. These observations were in accordance to that of the present study. Schnettler <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found that NHA binds to the bone and stimulates bone healing by stimulation of osteoblast activity.</p><p>The current study also demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in area of defect from baseline to 6 months and from 3 to 6 months. However, the decrease in area from baseline to 3 months was statistically insignificant. This might be because of the very small particle size and early resorption within 12 weeks as reported by Thorwarth <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] who used microradiography to assess the mineralization content and degradation of the test material. They stated that the accelerated initial ceramolysis of the material did not hinder the bone healing process which follows the principles of a primary angiogenic reossification. Bone regeneration starts from the borders of the defect and carries on centripedally. The ceramic material functions as an osteoconductive guideline for the growing bone trabeculae. They stated that newly formed bone was discriminated from local bone by lower degree of mineralization, the different architecture of spongiosa and lack of alignment of the trabecular trajectory. The present study coincides with the above study and the clinical findings in the present study also reveal evidence of regeneration after 12 weeks (3 months). However, in the present study microradiographic technique was not used. Also, no additional effect of the test group was noted over the control group.</p><p>Similar findings were reported by Klawitter <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who stated that trabeculae of bone vary in size from 20 to over 100 &#x003bc;m. When a trabecula reaches about 100 &#x003bc;m, it carries its own blood vessels, much in the same way an osteon does via Haversian canal. Compact bone has haversian systems or osteons of between 50 and 250 &#x003bc;m. Thus, to support trabecular bone ingrowth, the pores would need to be at least 40-100 &#x003bc;m, and to support osteonal bone ingrowth, pores of at least 100 &#x003bc;m would appear necessary. Later Hirschorn[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported that particle size of about 380 &#x003bc;m in diameter would yield this minimal dimension and particles yielding under 100 &#x003bc;m space dimensions may possess less mineralization potential. Therefore in the present study the tested material i.e., NHA which had a particle size of ~20 nm shows statistically insignificant results over the control group.</p><p>In view of above, Fucini <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found that there was no difference in defect fill between demineralized freeze dried bone allograft particles of 250-500 &#x003bc;m size compared to those of 850-1000 &#x003bc;m. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis of the interparticulate space among bone replacement grafts condensed under a uniform standard force showed that autogenous bone harvested low and high speed rotary instruments, freeze dried bone allograft (250-710 &#x003bc;m). Bio-oss (Cancellous and cortical), Osteograf LD, Perioglas and Osteogen yielded a 40-100 &#x003bc;m interparticulate space. Autogenous bone harvested by back action chisels, demineralized freeze dried bone allograft (350-500 &#x003bc;m). Osteograf N (300-700 &#x003bc;m), Biocoral, Biogran, Interpore 200 and Calcitite (40-60 &#x003bc;m) HA granules yielded an interparticulate space that was equal to or greater than 100 &#x003bc;m.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Another important property of nanomaterials which might have played a major role in regeneration in the current study is development of <italic>self assembly</italic> which helps to integrate different functions into synthetic extracellular matrices. These synthetic extracellular matrices will need to perform functions such as to sustain cell viability and proliferation, allow the establishment of a blood vessel network formation and provide sufficient support to prevent tissue collapse. In recent times, developments in this field have seen the use of pH-induced self-assembly of a peptide-amphiphile to artificially construct a nanostructured fibrous scaffold with the structural features of extracellular matrices. After cross linking, the newly produced fibers are able to direct mineralization of HA to form a composite material in which the crystallographic axes of HA are aligned with the long axes of the fibers. This alignment is similar as that observed <italic>in vivo</italic> between collagen fibrils and HA crystals in bone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Despite good clinical results the current study was not subjected to histological analysis. Therefore, confirm evidence of periodontal regeneration cannot be stated. Also, differences in the physiochemical and structural characteristics between NHA and HA used in the past and in the present study may lead to differences in the regenerative/osteoconductive properties. Material properties including porosity, surface geometry, and surface chemistry play a role in determining the osteoconductive capacities of a graft which must be analyzed histologically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Further studies using more subjects and histologic analysis could clarify the benefits of the new synthetic bone grafting material. In addition, a longer post treatment observation interval may be needed to confirm the stability of clinical outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nasr</surname><given-names>HF</given-names></name><name><surname>Aichelmann-Reidy</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Yukna</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone and bone substitutes</article-title><source>Periodontol 2000</source><year>1999</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>74</fpage><lpage>86</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10321217</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hanna</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Trejo</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Weltman</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of Intrabony defects with bovine derived Xenograft alone and in combination with Platelet rich plasma.
