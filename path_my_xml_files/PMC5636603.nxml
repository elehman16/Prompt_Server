Competency in these modalities is ensured by requiring case minimums, and oral and written examinations. However, there is a paucity of information detailing the various teaching modalities residency programs utilize outside of the operating room (OR).</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> A 16-question survey was sent to all integrated and independent program directors. Information regarding non-surgical resident education was collected and analyzed.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> There were 43- responses (45%). Most programs had 6&#x02013;10 faculty (43%), and a majority (85%) required faculty to participate in resident education outside of the OR. Residents most commonly had 3&#x02013;4 hours (43%) of protected educational time 1 day per week (53%). Non-surgical education consisted of weekly lectures by attendings (44%) and resident (54%), as well as weekly CoreQuest (48%), teaching rounds (38%), and PSEN (55%). Monthly activities included M&#x00026;M (81%) and Journal Club (86%). Indications conference was either monthly (41%) or weekly (39%). Cadaver labs, visiting professors, board prep, in-service review, and meetings with program director occurred yearly or several times a year. Forty-nine percent of programs sponsor one educational course per resident. In addition, a majority of programs (65%) do not receive outside funding for education.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> These findings illustrate the current state of non-surgical resident education in plastic surgery. They demonstrate that residents participate in a diverse number of non-surgical educational activities and that a large percentage of programs depend on resident-run education. Further study is necessary to correlate these results with quantifiable outcome measures.</p></body></article>
