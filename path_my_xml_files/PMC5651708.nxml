In our discussions with target bar owners and managers there was varied enthusiasm, but general acceptance of the idea of installing the free water dispenser, even among those bars that currently charge for water. Only one of eight approached bars declined the idea of participating. Following meetings and evaluation of bar clientele, we chose a convenience sample of four bars with approximately matched clientele based on age, location, and race/ethnicity of clients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par10">This developmental pilot was designed as a two-phase study with a 3-month (Sep 2012&#x02013;Nov 2012) Pre-Intervention phase to confirm patron demographics matching and that there were no significant differences in the study primary outcome measures at baseline and a 18-month (Feb 2013&#x02013;Aug 2014) Post-Intervention comparison phase where two gay bars received the intervention condition and the other two gay bars received the control condition. Of note both intervention bar and control bar participants received breathalyzer measurement coupled with normative feedback upon exiting the bars secondary to ethical and safety concerns related to BACs measured over the legal driving limit. The two bars selected to receive the full multi-level intervention were the first 2 bars to agree to the physical changes necessary to make water freely available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Subject Sampling and Eligibility</title><p id="Par11">Subjects for evaluation in this study were sampled using a portal-exit sampling strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

Study staff members approached and attempted to recruit every patron exiting the bar&#x02019;s main entrance (the portal) over the course of the 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h shift. In order to maximize study participation, the field team included staff members who fit in with the gay bar atmosphere and would likely be perceived by bar attendees as approachable, nonjudgmental, and fun. Between 2&#x02013;4 staff members were present during each recruitment shift to approach, screen, and survey potential participants.</p><p id="Par12">Eligible participants were male-identified bar patrons over the age of 18 who had consumed at least one alcoholic beverage that night. Once eligibility was determined, study staff conducted verbal informed consent and offered a study information sheet to each participant. Participants received a small token of appreciation (e.g., candy, bottle-opener, toy of about $1&#x02013;2 in value) and packet of safer sex supplies and referrals for their participation. Study subjects were deemed competent to engage in informed consent if they could repeat the study&#x02019;s purpose and describe back to study staff the procedures that were to occur to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Individuals who were identified as too intoxicated to provide informed consent were offered assistance in finding safe transportation home and referral to other services.

Survey items included subject demographics, motivations for choosing one bar over another (multiple choice&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;other, specify), prior bar attendance that evening, number and types of drinks consumed at current and prior bars, time spent in the bar that evening, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] with hazardous drinking defined as an AUDIT-C score of&#x000a0;&#x02265;4, frequency of binge drinking (five or more drinks consumed at one setting), past sexual risk taking (defined as any condomless anal sex with a known or potentially HIV serodiscordant partner) and next intended destination (another bar, home, restaurant, other). In addition, participants sampled exiting intervention bars in the Post-intervention period were asked about exposure to the in-bar media campaign, their knowledge and use of installed water dispensers. All subjects in the Post-Intervention period (control and intervention bar patrons) were asked about how useful they found the normative feedback of their BAC compared to other bar patrons using a 5 point scale (&#x02018;Not at all&#x02019;, &#x02018;A little bit&#x02019;, &#x02018;Moderately&#x02019;, &#x02018;Quite a bit&#x02019;, &#x02018;Extremely&#x02019;).

Comparison testing during the Pre-Intervention period was carried out to confirm no significant differences were present in study outcome measures at baseline given the non-random assignment of intervention arm. Mean values, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated overall and by bar type (control/intervention) using standard equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. To test for significant differences between the intervention and control bars for BAC% and other outcome measures we used Pearson <italic>&#x003c7;</italic>
<sup>2</sup> or Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test or non-parametric tests (where cell sizes went below accepted limits or distributions were non-normal). For comparisons of proportions of borderline statistical significance, single-sided tests were reflexively done with the assumed direction of the intervention resulting in the more favorable direction. In addition, we also performed multivariable linear modeling of measured BAC over the Pre- and Post-Intervention periods on the impact of intervention arm controlling for race and age using robust standard error calculation to account for clustering of measures within bars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Both a full model with all racial categories included and a best-fit model were calculated including indicators for time period (pre- and post-intervention) to account for temporal trend and interactions between time period and intervention bar status.

Twenty-eight percent (95% CI 24.5&#x02013;33.5%) reported seeing the free water dispenser during their time in the bar and among those, 25% (95% CI 18.2&#x02013;34.8%) reported using the water dispenser at that bar visit. When asked about the usefulness of the BAC normative feedback, 48.5% (95% CI 43.8&#x02013;53.2%) of control bar subjects thought the normative feedback was &#x0201c;quite a bit&#x02019; or &#x0201c;extremely&#x02019; useful compared to a higher proportion in intervention bar subjects (55.2%, 95% CI 50.3&#x02013;60.0%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.046).

Both objective measures of alcohol consumption (measured BAC% by breathalyzer) and subjective measures of alcohol intake and misuse (self-report AUDIT-C and binge drinking) showed significantly lower levels of alcohol and hazardous drinking among intervention bar subjects compared to control bars subjects post-intervention whereas no differences were observed between the bars pre-intervention. The post-intervention effect on BAC was present in both of the intervention bars equally, with reductions in the mean BAC of 0.013 and 0.017 relative to each bar&#x02019;s pre-intervention mean (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01 for both). The strength and consistency of the results are highly supportive of a distinct beneficial intervention effect among gay bar patrons exposed to the multi-level intervention.</p><p id="Par22">As a proof of concept and feasibility trial this study has demonstrated that it is possible to engage with gay bar venues as sites for alcohol as well as HIV risk reduction interventions. These bars already play a central role in HIV prevention in the gay community as locations for distribution of condoms and safer sex messages and as social spaces for fundraisers for HIV care and prevention agencies. Given the growing community and public health system awareness of alcohol misuse as a contributing factor in new HIV infections and the significant potential of structural interventions to produce lasting, efficient and cost-effective benefits, this research strongly points towards the feasibility and potential impact of the tested multi-level intervention to address alcohol use among MSM in gay bar settings.</p><p id="Par23">Indeed, structural alcohol interventions of this type are likely to be effective in responding to two identified priority areas for HIV prevention in San Francisco and elsewhere; (1) alcohol as a driver of the HIV epidemic and (2) the high risk of HIV infection among young MSM. The San Francisco Department of Public Health and the HIV Prevention Planning Council have officially identified alcohol as &#x0201c;driver&#x0201d; of the local HIV epidemic by virtue of alcohol&#x02019;s prevalent heavy use (10% or higher in the population) combined with evidence showing an independent association of alcohol doubling the risk of HIV acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Gay bar venues may be an excellent intervention point for modifying alcohol associated HIV risk among MSM. Evidence supporting this supposition is that among young MSM 18&#x02013;29&#x000a0;years old in San Francisco, frequent bar attendance has been shown to be significantly associated with heavy alcohol use and binge drinking (&#x0003e;5 drinks per episode, OR 2.17, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] compared to those with less frequent bar attendance. This finding is echoed among MSM of all ages in San Francisco in the 2011 NHBS survey where 61% of MSM reported binge drinking in the past month among those sampled from venues serving alcohol compared to 31% reporting binge drinking among MSM sampled from venues not serving alcohol (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The finding from this current study of a significant age association with BAC with younger MSM having higher levels of blood alcohol particularly points to the potential utility of this intervention in addressing alcohol misuse and associated HIV risks among young MSM.</p><p id="Par24">Overall, the study found high levels of alcohol use and misuse in a context of significant sexual risk among gay bar patrons, echoing concerns and opportunities for intervention with this venue-associated population of MSM. Although the study was able to observe significant reductions in alcohol intake and misuse in response to the intervention, observation of reductions in subsequent HIV transmission risks associated with the alcohol impact were more challenging to see. We did not see any reductions in reported condomless, potentially serodiscordant anal sex with last partner at the time of exit from the bar in the post-intervention period. It is likely that retrospective recall of transmission risk at last sex may not be the correct temporal link to behavior change in response to an intervention effect that has just occurred (currently less intoxicated). Future evaluations of the intervention effect on subsequent sexual risk should attempt to measure sexual risk behavior on the evening following bar exit in a follow-up cohort design, something that was not possible with the current study&#x02019;s anonymous design.</p><p id="Par25">The study has a number of limitations. First, this developmental study was designed as a non-randomized, contemporaneously controlled trial of a small number of gay bar venues. The non-random choice of intervention bar status, although motivated by practical concerns, could have introduced bias accounting for some of the observed differences between the control and intervention bars. Arguing against this possibility is the similarity in the study&#x02019;s primary outcome measures pre-intervention and the degree to which the bars were well-matched on clientele and alcohol intake patterns. Second, use of the portal exit-capture strategy for subject selection was associated with a participation rate less than 50%, calling into question the representativeness of the study sample. Community level effectiveness trials, particularly venue-based studies, are often challenged by recruitment strategies and the response rates seen in this study are in line with other studies of heterosexual bars in the alcohol research field. Although the lower participation rate may make the study estimates biased in the absolute, the relative comparisons between the control bar and intervention bar subjects remain valid given that we saw no evidence of differential participation rates or characteristics by intervention arm status. Likewise, because of the exclusion of potential study subjects who were too intoxicated to participate in informed consent, the estimates of BAC and binge drinking prevalence are likely to be conservative estimates and would have been higher if those intoxicated persons had been included in the study sample.</p><p id="Par26">In conclusion, we observed a significant beneficial intervention effect of lower levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and lower levels of reported hazardous and binge drinking among MSM in San Francisco gay bars in response to a multi-level, structural alcohol intervention consisting of freely accessible water, in-bar media messaging campaign promoting the use of water for pacing alcohol intake and normative feedback of patron BAC compared other gay bar patrons. Further research expanding and adapting this intervention to other cities outside of San Francisco is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-017-1934-z">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-017-1934-z</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) Grant 1R21AA020467 and the California HIV Research Program IDEA Award Grant ID10-SF-069.
