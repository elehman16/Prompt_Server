Disease activity and clinical improvement were evaluated by Assessment in Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) responses, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS). Kaplan&#x02013;Meier was used to identify patients with sustained ASAS partial remission (PR) or ASDAS inactive disease (ID) for three or more consecutive visits spanning &#x02265;6 months. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with remission. Explanatory variables included baseline demographic and disease characteristics and week 12 responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 311 patients who received at least one dose of adalimumab, 202 (65%) completed the 5-year study. Among 125 patients who received 5 years of adalimumab, 70%, 77%, 51% and 61% achieved ASAS40, BASDAI 50, ASAS PR and ASDAS ID, respectively. Of 311 adalimumab-treated patients, 45% and 55% achieved sustained ASAS PR and ASDAS ID at any time during study participation. The strongest predictor of remission at years 1 and 5 and of sustained remission was achieving remission at 12 weeks of treatment; baseline characteristics showed weaker associations. Adverse events were comparable with previous reports on adalimumab safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with active AS, the efficacy and safety of adalimumab were maintained through 5 years with about half of the patients experiencing sustained remission at any time during the study.

Among those who received 5 years of adalimumab treatment, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical response or benefit. Over half of the patients achieved remission based on criteria for ASAS PR (63/124, 50.8%) or ASDAS ID (75/124, 60.5%). Similar long-term data from the open-label extension of a randomised controlled trial of etanercept in AS reported that 18/59 patients (30.5%) were in ASAS PR at 5 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Infliximab use through 3 years showed that 15/46 patients (32.6%) demonstrated ASAS PR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> The safety, the type and rate of adverse events seen through 5 years of adalimumab treatment were consistent with previous study reports and the known safety profile of adalimumab in other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> No new safety signals were noted.</p><p>Important therapeutic decisions are often made based on expected outcomes. Identifying factors that predict treatment response can assist clinicians in these management decisions. In a similar way, determining predictors of exceptional response, such as long-term disease remission over a long period, is helpful in shaping both the doctor's and the patient's expectations for chronic treatment. Previously published analyses predicting treatment response with anti-TNF treatment in patients with AS have examined short-term clinical responses (&#x02264;6 months) and mainly focused on improvement, not disease remission. This is the first report in patients with AS of patterns and predictors of sustained remission, defined as ASAS PR or ASDAS ID for at least three consecutive study visits spanning a period of at least 6 months.</p><p>Analyses aimed at predicting clinical outcomes have identified shorter disease duration and the closely related variable of younger patient age as relevant factors for treatment response at 3 or 6 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> A randomised controlled trial of adalimumab in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis also suggested that younger age was associated with clinical outcomes after 1 year of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Disease duration was not significantly associated with long-term remission in the univariate models described here, a discrepancy possibly due to the limited number of patients with short disease durations. This study does support the hypothesis that better outcomes are achieved in younger patients, as age was a significant negative predictor of long-term remission at 1 and 5 years of adalimumab treatment.</p><p>Baseline disease characteristics were often weakly predictive of long-term remission. Lower levels of baseline total back pain, inflammation, patient and physician global assessments of disease activity, BASDAI and BASFI increased the probability of a patient achieving remission at 1 and 5 years of adalimumab treatment. Randomised controlled trials, cohort and registry data have shown associations of baseline BASFI with achieving a BASDAI 50 response after 3-6 months of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> These same studies identified baseline CRP values as indicative of future response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>; however, the focus was primarily on short-term improvement and not long-term remission. An abnormal baseline CRP level was not a significant predictor of long-term remission as shown in the analyses conducted with the 5-year data from ATLAS. This indicates that raised CRP should not be a mandatory requirement for treatment of AS with TNF inhibitors. Patients with existing syndesmophytes at baseline were less likely to reach long-term remission in this study. Thus, initiation of anti-TNF treatment before the onset of new bone formation may enable a patient to achieve remission over the course of treatment.</p><p>In this study, the most notable factors that predicted long-term remission at years 1 and 5 of adalimumab treatment were early treatment responses at week 12, particularly achievement of remission. Most previous reports did not consider initial response as a potential indicator of future success. The hypothesis that short-term outcomes are more predictive of future response than baseline characteristics is supported by findings from an open-label infliximab study, which showed that an initial ASAS20 response at week 2 was predictive of ASAS20 at week 10; unfortunately, the impact of clinical improvement after 2 weeks of treatment was not evaluated relative to longer-term remission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Likewise, results presented here suggest that, more than the baseline disease characteristics, attainment of remission early in the course of treatment is predictive of long-term treatment success.</p><p>About half of the patients achieved sustained remission, the majority of whom met these criteria within a year of treatment initiation. In multivariate analyses, attainment of either ASAS PR or ASDAS ID at 12 weeks eliminated most baseline patient and disease characteristics from predictive models. A similar relationship between early treatment response and sustained remission has been described in a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Although these results might initially appear to suggest that baseline variables have no impact on attaining sustained remission, the influence of baseline characteristics on attaining remission at 12 weeks must be considered.</p><p>These results are in alignment with current recommendations for evaluating treatment response after at least 12 weeks of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Achieving BASDAI 50 at week 12, in conjunction with expert opinion, has been identified as an appropriate gauge for continuation of anti-TNF treatment; results presented here suggest that patients who are in remission after 12 weeks of treatment (either by ASAS PR or ASDAS ID) are more likely to achieve long-term and sustained remission with continued adalimumab treatment.</p><p>One of the strengths of this analysis is the length of follow-up. It is also the first report to examine long-term remission by both ASAS PR and ASDAS ID criteria and the first to demonstrate early attainment of remission as a predictor of long-term and sustained remission. Limitations of this study include the open-label, uncontrolled nature of the long-term post hoc analysis. There may be other characteristics related to sustained disease control that were not considered. The use of observed and completers' analyses may reflect a positive selection bias, since patients who remain in the study are likely to be those who benefit from the treatment and show good clinical response. Conversely, the possibility of a negative selection bias exists, as patients who discontinued owing to non-response early in the study might have achieved sustained remission with a longer duration of treatment.</p><p>The 5-year ATLAS data confirm that the early clinical improvements and safety profile seen with adalimumab in patients with AS are maintained through 5 years of treatment, supporting a favourable benefit:risk profile for the long-term use of adalimumab in patients with AS. Early achievement of remission with adalimumab was the most compelling predictor of subsequent long-term and sustained remission in patients with AS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold> Abbott Laboratories.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests</bold> JS has received research grants, speaker's fees, or consulting fees from Abbott, Merck and Pfizer.
