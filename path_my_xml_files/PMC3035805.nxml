This study tested the role of friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior as a mediator of the effects of a classroom based intervention on children&#x02019;s tobacco experimentation. 433 Children (52% males) were randomly assigned to the Good Behavior Game (GBG) intervention, a universal preventive intervention targeting disruptive behavior, and facilitating positive prosocial peer interactions. Friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior was assessed from age 7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years. Participants&#x02019; experimentation with tobacco was assessed annually from age 10&#x02013;13. Reduced rates in tobacco experimentation and friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior were found among GBG children, as compared to controls. Support for friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior as a mediator in the link between intervention status and tobacco experimentation was found. These results remained after controlling for friends&#x02019; and parental smoking status, and child ADHD symptoms.

For instance, in both the US and the Netherlands, approximately 10&#x02013;15% of 10-to-11-year-old children reported experimentation with tobacco, a percentage that increases to approximately 35% at age 13&#x000a0;years (Monshouwer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>; Mowery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>). Experimentation with tobacco at this age places children at risk for regular smoking at later ages (Costello et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1999</xref>; Patton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2006</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2004</xref>), but also at risk for alcohol use (Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>) and illicit drug use (Korhonen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2008</xref>).</p><p>Studies have focused on the role of friends in the initiation and further development of tobacco use. For instance, a study among US youths aged 11&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years found that among those who smoke, the odds of having friends who also smoke is increased 7.12 times when compared to youths who don&#x02019;t smoke (Mowery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>). To illustrate, having parents or caretakers who smoke increased the odds of youths smoking by 2.88 (Mowery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>). This study aimed at exploring the role of friends&#x02019; behavioral characteristics in the early years of elementary school on children&#x02019;s tobacco experimentation from age 10&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years. Specifically, we aimed at testing this link using a randomized controlled preventive intervention study, the Good Behavior Game (GBG; Barrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1969</xref>; Dolan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1989</xref>). We explored whether having friends with lower levels of disruptive behavior, as found among children who received the GBG intervention, mediated the program&#x02019;s impact on children&#x02019;s tobacco experimentation.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Friends&#x02019; Disruptive Behaviors and Children&#x02019;s Tobacco Experimentation</title><p>In search of the identification of risk factors for early experimentation with tobacco, influences from friends during middle childhood have been studied. Indeed, friends do influence children&#x02019;s smoking habits (Kobus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>; Mowery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Prokhorov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2006</xref>), possibly through processes of imitation, social reinforcement, and by making cigarettes available (Hoffman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>). The actual imitation by children of friends&#x02019; smoking behavior is less likely in the early years of elementary school, as most children during middle childhood have not experimented with tobacco. However, some elementary school children do affiliate with friends who engage in disruptive behavior (Snyder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1997</xref>; Snyder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2005</xref>; van Lier and Koot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>; van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005a</xref>; Vitaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2007</xref>). Having friends who are disruptive has not only been found to be a risk factor for the continuation of children&#x02019;s disruptive behavior (Boivin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>; van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005a</xref>; Vitaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2007</xref>; Vitaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2001</xref>), but also a predictor of tobacco use (Dishion and Owen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>; Fergusson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>; Fite et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). Thus, during middle childhood, it may not be the actual imitation of friends&#x02019; smoking behavior or reinforcement of smoking behavior per se which triggers starting experimentation with smoking. Rather, having friends with disruptive behaviors problems may, via emphasis on, or modeling and selective reinforcement of risky behavior create a context in which early experimentation with tobacco is likely.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Effects of GBG on Children&#x02019;s Tobacco Experimentation and Friends&#x02019; Disruptive Behaviors</title><p>Given the negative outcomes associated with early tobacco experimentation, several studies have been directed at its prevention. These studies have found that children&#x02019;s experimentation with tobacco use may be reduced by school-based interventions. In a previous study on the sample used in the present study, it was shown that GBG children less frequently engaged in tobacco experimentation over the ages of 10&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years (van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2009</xref>). US based studies using the GBG showed that childhood reductions in tobacco use among GBG children (Kellam and Anthony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1998</xref>) persisted into adolescence (Furr-Holden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Storr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002</xref>) and even young adulthood (Kellam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>). For instance, in young adulthood, the proportion of GBG children who smoked regularly was 6%, compared to 14% among control-group children (Kellam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the GBG is not a preventive program aimed at the reduction of substance use. Rather, the GBG is a classroom management program, with as primary purpose the prevention of disruptive behavior problems, such as conduct problems or symptoms of ADHD, among elementary school children. The program aims to create a positive and predictable school environment, by improving classroom structure, facilitating prosocial peer interactions, and by focusing on, and systematically rewarding appropriate behavior. Specifically, in order to improve classroom peer relations, in the GBG disruptive and non-disruptive children work together in teams, and teams as a whole are rewarded for endorsing positive and prosocial classroom behavior. In this way the GBG tries to break the cycle of negative peer experiences and selective affiliation with deviant peers which characterizes children with behavior problems.</p><p>Thus, by facilitating prosocial peer relations the GBG aims to reduce children&#x02019;s disruptive behaviors. When this aim is achieved indeed, the GBG may reduce children&#x02019;s risk of connecting with friends who engage in disruptive behavior. If having friends with high levels of disruptive behavior in elementary school is truly predictive of tobacco experimentation, reduction of these friends&#x02019; disruptiveness would result in lower levels of tobacco experimentation. One of the processes through which the program resulted in reduced rates of children&#x02019;s problem behavior was through improved peer relations, indicated by improved peer acceptance, and reduction of friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior (van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2005b</xref>; Witvliet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>). Given these previous findings and the evidence for a role of friends&#x02019; disruptiveness in the prediction of tobacco experimentation, we aimed at testing whether reduction of friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior, as found among GBG children, explained why GBG children become less likely to experiment with tobacco.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Important Controls</title><p>Apart from having friends with high levels of disruptive behavior children&#x02019;s own disruptiveness has been shown to be a risk factor for early experimentation with tobacco (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>; Patton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2006</xref>). Moreover, disruptive children have also been found more likely to affiliate with friends who engage in disruptive behaviors (Fite et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Laird et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2001</xref>; Vitaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2007</xref>). It may therefore be the child&#x02019;s behavioral problems that predict early tobacco experimentation, possibly via the affiliation with disruptive friends. For instance, it has been shown that early behavioral regulation difficulties predict maladaptive social relations and that the consequences of these behavioral problems are the driving force in the link to substance abuse disorders (Fite et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Tarter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1999</xref>). Apart from disruptiveness, symptoms of ADHD are thought to put children at risk for tobacco experimentation (Elkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>; Upadhyaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2002</xref>; Upadhyaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>). ADHD-related impulsiveness may make children prone to experiment, while they also have problems of understanding and considering the long-term consequences of smoking (Wilson and Levin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2005</xref>). Thus, disruptive behavior problems and symptoms of ADHD should be controlled for when studying the link between friends&#x02019; disruptiveness and children&#x02019;s tobacco experimentation. This is especially the case for the present study as the GBG has show to reduce both children&#x02019;s disruptive behavior problems and symptoms of ADHD (Dolan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1993</xref>; Ialongo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2001</xref>; Ialongo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>; Kellam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1994</xref>; van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2004</xref>; van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2005b</xref>; Witvliet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>). Therefore, it might be that the reductions in children&#x02019;s disruptiveness and ADHD symptoms rather than reductions in their friends&#x02019; disruptiveness account for a reduced likelihood of GBG children to experiment with tobacco. In fact, in a previous study, it was found that reductions in symptoms of ADHD mediated the program&#x02019;s effect on tobacco experimentation over ages 10&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years (Huizink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>).</p><p>Besides child behavioral risks, having&#x02014;even few&#x02014;friends who smoke, and having parents who smoke has been linked with children&#x02019;s smoking behavior (Kobus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>; Mowery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Prokhorov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2006</xref>). Therefore, in order to examine whether friends&#x02019; disruptiveness is indeed a risk factor for children&#x02019;s tobacco experimentation, we have to control for the behavioral tendencies of the children themselves and the possible influences of friends&#x02019; and parental smoking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The Present Study</title><p>The aim of this study is to test the role of friends&#x02019; disruptiveness from age 7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years in the development of tobacco experimentation over the ages 10&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). RCTs have been proposed as a unique design for testing the role of social factors in developmental psychopathology (Hinshaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>; Kellam and Rebok <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1992</xref>; Rutter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2001</xref>). We hypothesized that reduced rates of friends&#x02019; disruptiveness, as found among children who followed the GBG curriculum compared to controls, mediated the lower rates of tobacco experimentation among GBG children. In studying this link, we will take possible sex-differences into account as boys are more likely to affiliate with antisocial friends than girls (van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">b</xref>, Vitaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2007</xref>). In addition, we tested whether the results held when controlling for children&#x02019;s co-existing disruptive behavior and symptoms of ADHD, and for having friends or parents who smoke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from 13 elementary schools in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Initially, 744 children were eligible for inclusion and for 666 children informed consent from parents or parent substitutes was obtained (90% participation rate). The mean age of these children was 6.9&#x000a0;years (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6) at baseline, 52% of the sample were males. Sixty-nine percent of the children were from Dutch descent, 10% Turkish, 9% Moroccan, 5% Surinam/Dutch Antillean, and 7% from other ethnic groups. Thirty-six percent of the children were from a family with low socio-economic status (SES), which closely resembled the general Dutch population (32%; Statistics Netherlands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>).</p><p>Assessments of tobacco experimentation over the ages 10&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years were available for 525 children of the original sample (79%). However, because of our focus on the prevention of early tobacco experimentation, we selected those children for whom data on tobacco experimentation were available from age 10&#x000a0;years onwards (477 children; 72% of original sample). Because of our focus on the role of friends, we only included participants who had reciprocated friendships over the period of age 7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years, reducing the study sample to 433 children. (Reciprocated friendships indicated that both the participant and the friends agreed on their relationship as a friendship.)

After this baseline assessment, classes within each school were randomly assigned to the GBG or to a control condition, resulting in 56% of the participants receiving the GBG program. The GBG was implemented during second and third grade (ages 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years). Children were then followed-up annually over the elementary school period, which ends in grade 6 (age 12&#x000a0;years) in the Netherlands. The final assessment was at age 13&#x000a0;years, when children had transitioned to high school. In the Netherlands this means that children move to a variety of different schools.</p><p>Data collection was always executed in the spring of each school year. In the spring of grades 1&#x02013;4, peer nominations were obtained through face-to-face interviews by trained interviewers. Self-reports of substance use were collected from grade 4 (age 10&#x000a0;years) onwards. The questionnaire was part of a larger booklet and was filled out in the classroom, supervised by two trained supervisors of the research team. The children were told that their answers would be confidential and that they did not have to answer any of the questions if they did not want to. Teachers were not present in the classroom while the children were filling out the questionnaires.</p><p>At age 13&#x000a0;years, the questionnaire for the assessment of substance use was part of a larger booklet used for the young adolescence follow-up assessments, which was sent to the participants and returned by mail.

The GBG was adapted for use in the Netherlands (Van der Sar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2002</xref>; Van der Sar and Goudswaard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2001</xref>). The program is described in detail elsewhere (van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2004</xref>). In short, teachers and students choose positively formulated class-rules, which are accompanied by pictograms. Based on behavioral observations of rule-breaking classroom behaviors, teachers assign children to one of three/four teams while ascertaining that teams contain an equal number of disruptive and non-disruptive children. Positive peer relations are facilitated by the GBG by stimulating children to collaborate with team members, by encouraging children to support each other in behaving appropriately, and by systematically rewarding compliance to positively formulated class rules within teams. Each team receives a number of cards. Teachers take a card when a student violates a rule. Teams are rewarded when at the end of the game at least one card remains.</p><p>The GBG was implemented in three stages. In the <italic>introduction stage</italic>, the GBG was played for three times a week during 10&#x000a0;min. In the <italic>expansion stage</italic>, the GBG was expanded in time, settings, and behaviors targeted. Rewards were delayed till the end of the week and month. In the <italic>generalization phase</italic>, emphasis was on explaining children that the GBG rules always apply. Children received compliments for appropriate behavior. GBG-sessions were used as booster sessions.</p><p>Each intervention year, teachers participated in three afternoons of training, and were coached in their classroom during ten 60-min classroom observations by the school advisory services. External school advisors evaluated implementation fidelity at the schools. Control-condition teachers were monitored in not implementing the GBG. Over the 2-year intervention period, the GBG was played on average 116.28 times (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45.59) per class for a total of 8162&#x000a0;min (136&#x000a0;h) (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4781&#x000a0;min.). In five classes in which the GBG was implemented incompletely (teachers did not move on to the expansion phase), the game was nonetheless played on average 63.20 times (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21.62). In the remaining 13 classes, in which the program was implemented completely, the mean number of sessions was 139.69 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34.11).

The PP<sub>DB</sub> score at each assessment was computed in three steps. First, all children were asked to indicate the three classmates of either sex they liked most. These liked-most indications for each child were used to identify the preferred peers of each child. Second, disruptive behavior of all children in the class was assessed via a peer nominations procedure.

Third, using this score of each child in the class, it was then possible to assess the (reciprocal) preferred peers&#x02019; disruptive behavior in the same way as for the participants themselves.

Cigarette experimentation was scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (did not smoke at given age) to 7 (smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day). Of those who reported cigarette experimentation, the majority reported smoking less than one cigarette per week. We therefore focused on experimentation versus no-experimentation (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no tobacco experimentation at given age, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;tobacco experimentation, which included all scores ranging from &#x02018;smoking one cigarette or less a week&#x02019; to &#x02018;smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day&#x02019;). The percentage of children experimenting with tobacco was 5.3, 10.6, 12.7, and 14.1 at ages 10&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years, respectively. These percentages are in accordance with those reported for youth of similar age from the general Dutch population (Monshouwer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Covariates/Control Variables</title><p><italic>Percentage of preferred peers who experimented with tobacco</italic> (as an indication of friends who smoke) was assessed at age 10 and 12&#x000a0;years. The assessment of preferred peers of participants is described above (step one in the computation of PP<sub>DB</sub>). Tobacco experimentation was assessed via the SUQ for all children in the class. Using this score, a tobacco experimentation score was computed for each of the participants&#x02019; preferred peer. The percentage of preferred peers who experimented with tobacco was computed by dividing the number of preferred peers who reported tobacco experimentation by the total number of preferred peers at ages 10 and 12&#x000a0;years.</p><p><italic>Parental smoking</italic> was assessed during a telephone interview when children were 10&#x000a0;years old. At the time of the assessment, parents were asked if they currently smoked.

The two scores were divided by the number of children in the class minus one (nominating oneself was not allowed) and then summed to a total score. Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas for the total score ranged from 0.86 to 0.90 over the four assessments.</p><p><italic>Children&#x02019;s symptoms of ADHD</italic> were assessed by teacher ratings. In first and third grade (age 7 and 9&#x000a0;years), ADHD symptoms were assessed over the last 2&#x000a0;months by means of the Teacher&#x02019;s Report Form (TRF/6&#x02013;18; Achenbach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1991</xref>; Verhulst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1997</xref>). The 13 items of the DSM-IV oriented symptoms of ADHD scale were used (Achenbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>). Items included information on inattention (for example, &#x02018;this child has difficulty concentrating&#x02019;) as well as on behavioral impulsivity and hyperactivity (for example, &#x02018;this child is impulsive&#x02019;, &#x02018;this child talks out of turn&#x02019;, &#x02018;this child finds it hard to sit still&#x02019;). The 13 item scores were summed to a total ADHD score. Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas ranged from 0.90 to 0.91 over the assessments.</p><p>In second and third grade (ages 8 and 9&#x000a0;years), teachers were interviewed with the Problem Behavior at School Interview (PBSI; Erasmus MC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>).

The ADHD problem scale of the PBSI was used in this study. The ADHD scale consists of 8 items, focusing on inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Items included &#x02018;this child has difficulty concentrating&#x02019; and &#x02018;this child is impulsive&#x02019;.

Over the 2&#x000a0;year period of the intervention (age 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years) 17 children moved from a control group to an intervention group.

In the first step, we analyzed the development of preferred peers&#x02019; disruptive behavior (PP<sub>DB</sub>) using latent growth parameters, where the intercept reflects level differences, and the linear (and quadratic) term reflects time related increases or decreases in disruptive behavior of preferred peers (Muth&#x000e9;n <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1997</xref>). To account for the data structure in which data, as well as the randomization to intervention or control were nested within classes, a multilevel growth model was fitted. The growth parameters were regressed on intervention status (GBG vs. controls; between level) and male sex (within level), to study differential growth in preferred peers&#x02019; disruptive behavior as a function of intervention, and gender. The intercept was parameterized at the last, age 10&#x000a0;year assessment, because we were interested in post-intervention effects in levels of PP<sub>DB</sub> as predictor of tobacco experimentation trajectories.</p><p>In the second step we added the development of tobacco experimentation to the model (dual growth model). The growth parameters of tobacco experimentation were regressed on the growth parameters of PP<sub>DB</sub> as well as on intervention status. Standard errors were adjusted to account for the clustering of data within classrooms, using a sandwich estimator (Williams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2000</xref>). Mediation of GBG effects on tobacco experimentation by PP<sub>DB</sub> was tested in two ways. First, we tested whether the direct effect of GBG status on the growth parameters of tobacco experimentation became non-significant when accounting for the influence of PP<sub>DB</sub> (see Baron and Kenny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1986</xref>). Second, we estimated the joint significance of the indirect paths (path from GBG status to PP<sub>DB</sub> and path from PP<sub>DB</sub> to tobacco experimentation) (see MacKinnon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>).</p><p>In the third step, we tested whether the findings on the link between PP<sub>DB</sub> and tobacco experimentation would hold when accounting for friends&#x02019; tobacco experimentation, parental tobacco use, and children&#x02019;s symptoms of ADHD. A graphical representation of the final model is in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. All models were fit in Mplus version 5.1 (Muth&#x000e9;n and Muth&#x000e9;n <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1998&#x02013;2009</xref>). Over the seven repeated assessments, 32% of cases had missing data on one or more assessments, with 6% missing data on two or more assessments. These occasional missing data were handled using Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation. To explore whether the models fitted the data well, the chi-square statistic (non-significant test values indicate a good fit), the Comparative Fit Index and Tucker Lewis Index (CFI and TLI; acceptable fit values &#x0003e; 0.90; Bentler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1990</xref>), and the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA; acceptable value &#x0003c; 0.08; Browne and Cudeck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1993</xref>) were used.

Note that participants and friends were in the same classroom, and disruptive behavior scores of both friends and participants themselves were based on the same peer nominations scores. Thus, not having disruptive friends, but rather the disruptive behavior of children themselves may in fact account for the meditational link from GBG to tobacco experimentation via friends&#x02019; disruptiveness. We therefore added the assessments of children&#x02019;s peer nominated disruptive behavior over the ages 7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years as time-varying covariates to the model. Specifically, in this model the friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior scores were regressed on the child&#x02019;s disruptive behavior scores to control the friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior score for possible shared variance with children&#x02019;s disruptiveness. When controlling for children&#x02019;s disruptiveness, the previously found results remained the same: B&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.18, SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.11, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.11, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the strengths of the associations of the paths that comprise the indirect pathway (GBG to intercept PP<sub>DB</sub>, intercept of PP<sub>DB</sub> to intercept of tobacco experimentation) were similar across sex.

This was 5% for the preferred peers of children who did not experiment with tobacco. Of the children who experimented with tobacco, 47% of the parents smoked. This was 39% for children who did not experiment with tobacco. Also, as stated, GBG children had lower levels of symptoms of ADHD, which were found to mediate the effect of the program on tobacco experimentation at ages 10 and 11&#x000a0;years (Huizink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>).</p><p>We therefore tested whether our results would hold when controlling for the possible influence of friends or parents who smoke and for ADHD symptoms exhibited by the child. This model is depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The path from the intercept of preferred peers&#x02019; disruptive behavior to the intercept of tobacco experimentation was controlled for smoking of preferred peers and parents. In addition, we added the development of symptoms of ADHD from ages 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years to the model. Two measures of ADHD symptoms were used (TRF and PBSI), with missing data on either measurement handled as missing by design. At age 9&#x000a0;years, both instruments were completed. To account for this missing-by-design, a latent variable was considered for each of the time-points. Indicators for these latent variables were the total ADHD symptom scores derived from the TRF and PBSI at the given time-points. The factor loading of the TRF on the latent variables at each time-point was set at 1 by default; the factor loading for PBSI was held equal across time, and the measurement intercepts were constrained to be equal across time for both the TRF and PBSI scores (see also Huizink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). The intercept of ADHD symptoms was parameterized at the last assessment.</p><p>The results of this model are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

In this study, we tested the role of friends&#x02019; disruptiveness in the development of tobacco experimentation, using a randomized controlled intervention study, the GBG. Although the GBG is a classroom management intervention, one of the pathways through which the GBG improves children&#x02019;s behavior is by improving peer relations (van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2005b</xref>; Witvliet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>), making it an attractive instrument to test our hypothesis.</p><p>With regard to the role of friends&#x02019; disruptiveness on tobacco experimentation over age 10&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years, the results of this study are not entirely unequivocal. Early experimentation with tobacco (at age 10&#x000a0;years) was more prevalent among children who had friends with higher levels of disruptiveness in the years prior to, or at age 10. When testing the influence of the GBG intervention we found a reduction in children&#x02019;s experimentation with tobacco use. This effect of the GBG became non-significant when reductions in friends&#x02019; disruptiveness were accounted for. This suggests that the effects of the GBG on tobacco use were mediated by its effects on friends&#x02019; disruptiveness (Baron and Kenny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1986</xref>). However, in a second test for mediation in which the actual significance of the mediation path is estimated (MacKinnon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>), this indirect path from GBG to tobacco experimentation via friends&#x02019; disruptiveness just failed to reach conventional levels of significance. A trend toward significance was found, however, indicating that mediation is plausible. Moreover, these results remained virtually unchanged when we controlled for having friends or parents who smoked, and when accounting for reductions in symptoms of ADHD as found among GBG children. It is also important to note that we used a very stringent method to test for the link between friends&#x02019; disruptive behavior and tobacco experimentation. We studied whether reductions in friends&#x02019; disruptiveness established by a RCT focusing&#x02014;among other aspects&#x02014;on improving peer relations, mediated the reductions in tobacco experimentation. Such a randomized controlled associated change design is a unique design to test developmental psychopathology (Hinshaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>; Kellam and Rebok <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1992</xref>; Rutter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2001</xref>). Nonetheless, with the low baseline levels of tobacco experimentation in childhood and consequently limited possibilities to reduce these values, it may be hard to find definite proof for mediation in this regard. Therefore, although not unequivocal, our result mostly confirm the hypothesis that having friends with lower levels of disruptiveness in elementary school may protect children from starting to experiment with tobacco use in the second half of elementary school.</p><p>This study also showed that reduced rates of friends&#x02019; disruptiveness and reductions in ADHD symptoms each uniquely mediated the effects of the GBG on tobacco experimentation. These results thereby also extend previous results on the mediating role of child behavior characteristics (ADHD; Huizink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>) as decreases in peer risks also mediated reductions in tobacco experimentation. This suggests that a classroom management intervention aimed at structuring the classroom, and facilitating prosocial behavior and prosocial peer affiliation can be effectively used to prevent children from early experimentation with tobacco. Surely, the GBG did not prevent experimentation altogether. In fact, the rate of increase in experimentation among GBG children is similar to the rate in the control condition (van Lier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2009</xref>). However, compared to controls GBG children had always lower levels of tobacco experimentation, which persisted over a 4&#x000a0;year developmental span, despite the similar rate of increase in both groups. Thus, although not decisive, it may be concluded that universal behavioral management strategies, such as the GBG can be used as a first step in the prevention of disruptive behavior problems and associated risks, such as risky peer affiliation. Because of the effects in these domains of risk, such programs may also prevent later developing risk behaviors, such as tobacco experimentation.</p><p>This study is not without limitations. First, all children in this study received a general informative program on the prevention of substance use, including tobacco experimentation, in fifth and sixth grade (ages 11 and 12&#x000a0;years) elementary school. In the Netherlands, it is common that such programs are part of the normal curriculum of elementary schools. The research team provided all schools (GBG and controls) with the Health School and Drugs program (HSD; Jonkers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>). There was no control condition for HSD, making it impossible to statistically test for possible HSD effects on the findings of this study. However, reductions in tobacco experimentation were already present at age 10, thus prior to HSD and these relative differences between GBG children and controls persisted throughout the follow-up to age 13&#x000a0;years. Moreover, the mediators and control variables included in this study were assessed prior to HSD. This all suggests that the HSD did not affect the results as presented here. Second, no peer relations outside the classroom were considered. Elementary school children typically have friends within the classroom, even when friendship choices outside the classroom are allowed (Kupersmidt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1995</xref>). As friendships were limited within classes, and classes as a whole received the GBG, our results may imply that being in a context in which peers are less disruptive, protects individuals from tobacco-experimentation. Our results however do not necessarily imply that because of the GBG, children select less disruptive friends, which, in turn explains why they are lower on tobacco-experimentation. For such a conclusion, friendship selection of peers from classes who did not receive the GBG would have been needed. Also we did not ask children about their actual friendships, but rather about peers they preferred, which may not necessarily reflect friendships. However, reciprocated preferred peers&#x02019; scores were used in this study. Such scores indicate mutual preference, which closely resembles actual friendships. A third limitation is that we did not study micro processes of friends&#x02019; influence. We found support that having friends who engage in disruptive behavior is a risk factor in the pathway to tobacco experimentation. However, micro processes, through which friends may actively influence children&#x02019;s drift towards tobacco experimentation, such as modeling, reinforcing risky behavior such as tobacco experimentation, or even making cigarettes available, regardless of whether they actually smoked themselves, were not studied. Fourth, although our results suggested that the links between preferred peers&#x02019; disruptive behavior and tobacco experimentation were similar across sexes, the power to detect possible sex-differences may have been limited. Fifth, excluded children from this study were more likely to be of low SES families. The results should therefore be interpreted keeping this in mind. Finally, despite our test on the influence of friends via a randomized controlled design, no causal conclusions can be drawn from this study. Although we did run a number of tests to study whether our findings would hold, possible non-included variables may nonetheless account for the association.</p><p>The results of this study have implications for research on the development of psychopathology and tobacco experimentation. Our results suggested that having friends who engage in disruptive behavior may create a context in which children are more likely to start experimenting with tobacco early. This link persisted even when smoking of friends was accounted for. This suggests that the study of influence of peers who smoke should also take into account the (possibly previous) influence of disruptive behavior of these children. The results also demonstrate the power of early prevention. Not only can early, easily implementable universal programs prevent children&#x02019;s disruptive behavior problems, they can also reduce children&#x02019;s risks through the facilitation of prosocial, low risk peer relations. The results of this study showed that the reduced risk from the peer context may place children at lower risk for tobacco experimentation already at the age of 10&#x000a0;years, an effect that shows to persist into early adolescence.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which
