Consequently, the message informed these participants that &#x02013; unless they changed their behaviour &#x02013; they would be at higher risk of heart disease.

According to self-affirmation theory (Steele, <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>), these responses are elicited because our overarching desire for positive self-perception is threatened when we are told we are not acting sensibly or taking care of ourselves (cf. Harris &#x00026; Epton, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). So how can such resistance be overcome? Steele's theory suggests that defensiveness is eliminated or at least reduced when the self is affirmed, for example by completing a relevant values scale or writing a brief essay on an important value. Consistent with this, reviews have concluded that affirming important values or personal attributes can facilitate more dispassionate appraisals of threatening health messages and other unwelcome information (Aronson, Cohen, &#x00026; Nail, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Harris &#x00026; Epton, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; McQueen &#x00026; Klein, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Sherman &#x00026; Cohen, <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Such appraisals have generally resulted in greater message acceptance, because researchers have aimed to present &#x02018;good or high-quality information that should be accepted after a truly objective analysis&#x02019; (Munro &#x00026; Stansbury, <xref rid="b300" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, p. 1144).</p><p>In practice, however, health guidance may be focussed on what is ideal, and little consideration may be given to whether or not it is likely to be perceived as reasonable and acceptable to its recipients. For example, at least 80% of the UK population fails to achieve the &#x02018;five a day&#x02019; recommendation for fruit and vegetable intake (Henderson, Gregory, &#x00026; Swan, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Jackson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), and it is considered by many to be unrealistic (Anderson &#x00026; Cox, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Daborn, Dibsall, &#x00026; Lambert, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Likewise, widely publicized safe alcohol consumption guidelines of no more than 3&#x02013;4 units for men and 2&#x02013;3 units for women have been met with incredulity (Heather, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and are not considered helpful by those wishing to regulate their alcohol intake (de Visser &#x00026; Birch, <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In a review, Heather noted that &#x02018;in all probability, people's experience of everyday life will lead them intuitively to regard such warnings as non-sense &#x02026; and dismiss public health messages about drinking entirely&#x02019; (pp. 226&#x02013;227). In examples such as these, message rejection may be understandable and is arguably rational.</p><p>Evidence indicates that self-affirmation promotes open-mindedness and, thereby, facilitates attention to the merits and demerits of presented messages. Correll, Spencer, and Zanna (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) found that relative to those in a no-affirmation control condition, self-affirmed participants were more attuned to the strength of counter-attitudinal arguments. In a health context, this can have important consequences. For example, Klein, Harris, Ferrer, and Zajac (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) report evidence suggesting that the quality of message arguments determines whether self-affirmation is associated with increased or decreased feelings of vulnerability and intentions to change. When participants were presented with a message citing less reliable evidence supporting a link between caffeine consumption and fibrocystic breast disease, those who were self-affirmed felt less susceptible to the disease and expressed lower intentions to reduce their caffeine intake relative to those in the control condition. Similarly, when Zhao and Nan (<xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) used a weak message about the benefits of stopping smoking, self-affirmation produced greater negativity in judgements of this message.</p><p>Self-affirmation should also enhance judgement of whether or not it is appropriate to feel worried or reassured by a health message. Griffin and Harris (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) found that self-affirmation sensitized or &#x02018;calibrated&#x02019; participants&#x02019; responses to the personal relevance of a message about safe consumption levels for tuna. Concern was reduced amongst those eating within guidelines, but increased amongst those made aware that they had exceeded them. Similarly, using a message linking breast cancer to alcohol intake, Harris and Napper (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) demonstrated that self-affirmation strengthened links between whether or not stated limits were exceeded and perceived susceptibility. Initial findings suggest that these effects may extend to behaviour, with self-affirmation leading to greater sensitivity to personal risk when deciding whether to take an online test for susceptibility to diabetes (van Koningsbruggen &#x00026; Das, <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). van Koningsbruggen and Das interpret such findings as indicating that self-affirmation may have &#x02018;adverse effects&#x02019;, but, as Harris and Epton (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) note, self-affirmation &#x02018;is not a technique for increasing persuasion. Instead, self-affirming affords more objective appraisal of existing information allowing it to &#x02018;speak for itself&#x02019; &#x02026; whether that results in message acceptance depends on the quality of the information&#x02019; (p. 441).</p><p>Although there is evidence that self-affirmation may calibrate, or moderate, responses to threat messages according to whether individuals are informed that they are at low or high risk, no research has examined whether self-affirmation effects vary as a function of how reasonable it is to suggest that they need to change behaviour. Guidelines that result in quite healthy individuals being told that they are at risk may be especially prone to rejection following self-affirmation. Consider, for example, the advice of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence that there should be a long-term campaign encouraging 5- to 18-year-olds to engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for at least 60 min each day (Mayor, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The vast majority of older adolescents fail to meet these recommendations &#x02013; but there is wide variation in the extent of this &#x02018;failure&#x02019;. Many within this age group do little or no MVPA, whereas others meet or exceed the 150 min per week that are recommended for adults (Woods, Tannehill, &#x00026; Walsh, <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It seems appropriate to suggest that &#x02018;low exercisers&#x02019; are insufficiently active, but those who are active, but yet fail to meet these stringent guidelines, might reasonably reject the argument that it is necessary or even feasible to increase their physical activity levels to at least 60 min a day. Indeed, whilst physical inactivity has very high population attributable risks (e.g., for diabetes, colon cancer, and cardiovascular disease; Powell &#x00026; Blair, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), with adolescence being a critical period for preventing age-related decreases in activity and establishing habits for the future (Janz, Burns, &#x00026; Levy, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Riddoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Twisk, <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), the evidence for a particular threshold concerning the amount of physical activity is debatable (cf. Twisk, <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>As self-affirmation appears to increase sensitivity to information validity and personal relevance, the degree to which individuals fall short of recommendations has the potential to moderate its effects. When guidelines are provided, open-minded acceptance of the ease and necessity of behaviour change can occur in reference to the overall behaviour (e.g., increasing physical activity) or specified behavioural targets (e.g., getting at least 60 min of physical activity each day). It is probable that those who are relatively inactive will focus on being <italic>more</italic> physically active, whereas those closer to achieving the recommendations might be more focused on exactly <italic>how much</italic> activity is recommended to avert the threat &#x02013; particularly if they are in an accuracy-oriented mindset induced by self-affirmation. On this basis, self-affirmation can reasonably be expected to exert the typical effect of increasing message acceptance amongst those who are less active, but to facilitate open-minded rejection amongst those who are already relatively active.</p><sec><title>The current study</title><p>This study is the first to test whether the gap between actual and recommended behaviour moderates the effects of self-affirmation. In particular, the study focused on understanding how self-affirmation influences responses of those whose behaviour could reasonably be considered healthy, but who are informed that their failure to meet recommendations could increase their susceptibility to health risks. These issues are explored in the context of providing older adolescents (16- to 18-year-olds) with Department of Health (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) physical activity guidelines for their age group. In line with typical health promotion messages, participants were presented with information emphasizing that it is easy to meet recommendations and that whether or not this is achieved influences the risk of future ill-health.</p><p>We predict that the extent to which physical activity falls short of recommended levels will moderate the effect of self-affirmation on message derogation and acceptance, perceived risk, response- and self-efficacy, behavioural expectations, and self-reported physical activity. We hypothesize that amongst less active participants, self-affirmation will be associated with more positive responses in terms of (1) perception of the message (i.e., less message derogation, more acceptance), (2) behaviour-specific cognitions (i.e., higher perceived risk, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, and expectations for meeting the recommendations), and (3) higher levels of self-reported activity 1 week later. Conversely, we hypothesize that, amongst more active participants, self-affirmation will encourage rejection of the suggestion that increasing physical activity to least 60 min each day is necessary or feasible, producing the opposite pattern of findings on these measures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>One hundred and twenty-five adolescents were recruited from sixth form colleges in Sussex, United Kingdom.

There was no significant interaction between physical activity and self-affirmation for physical activity at T2 (<italic>p</italic> = .95).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Responses to health warnings can be inappropriate because of under-reaction due to defensiveness or overreaction due to oversensitivity to emotional arousal. Previous research has shown that self-affirmation leads to greater sensitivity according to personal risk factors and does not create undue alarm amongst those meeting health recommendations (Griffin &#x00026; Harris, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Our findings show, for the first time, that this sensitization extends to attempts to persuade relatively low-risk individuals that they nevertheless need to improve in order to meet challenging guidelines. That is, rather than necessarily increasing acceptance whenever messages claim individuals are at risk, self-affirmation appears to facilitate sensitivity to how reasonable messages are, given the disparity between achieved and recommended behaviour. There was evidence of the predicted moderating role of physical activity on self-affirmation effects for message acceptance, message derogation, response-efficacy, and self-efficacy, but not for perceived risk of heart disease, behavioural expectations, or self-reported physical activity.</p><p>As predicted, self-affirmed individuals who were already relatively active were more sceptical about whether it was necessary or feasible for them to get at least an hour of MVPA on every day of the week. These participants were less accepting of the message, more inclined to derogate it, and reported lower self- and response-efficacy for meeting the recommendations. This suggests that in certain circumstances, self-affirmation may lead to more realistic appraisals of challenging targets. This realism may ultimately prove beneficial, reducing the risk of demoralization and dissatisfaction with outcomes that can lead to failure in the maintenance of behaviour (Rothman, <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that the threshold at which self-affirmation began to be associated with decreased message acceptance was close to the average physical activity level of the participants. Comparative risk judgements for heart disease have been shown to be relatively accurate (Radcliffe &#x00026; Klein, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and it is possible that &#x02013; as well as the target-performance disparity &#x02013; comparative standing on the behaviour influenced whether or not calls for behaviour change were judged as reasonable. Indeed, research has shown that perceived comparative risk of health threats predicts attitudes towards taking protective action after controlling for perceptions of absolute risk (Klein, <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Peer comparison information has also been shown to be more important than recommended levels of the behaviour when both types of information are provided (Schmiege, Klein, &#x00026; Bryan, <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Considering also that participants who were more than averagely active were reaching the more well-known recommendation for adults (2.5 hr of moderate exercise per week), it is easy to see why greater open-mindedness might lead young people to be sceptical of the advice that it is necessary to exercise for 60 min/day. In previous research, self-affirmation has been linked to reliance on existing beliefs and greater self-confidence (Bri&#x000f1;ol, Petty, Gallardo, &#x00026; DeMarree, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Thus, in the current study, it possible that self-affirmed participants felt more able to decide whether recommendations were reasonable, with active participants becoming more doubtful about whether behaviour change was easy or necessary. Self-confidence might have also encouraged greater leniency when active participants were judging small disparities between their performance and the activity guidelines presented (McFarland &#x00026; Ross, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Schneider, <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Although we did not compare to a neutral message control, such effects suggest that caution may be needed in applying self-affirmation with lower-risk individuals and challenging health recommendations.</p><p>Amongst those whose activity levels were more discrepant with recommendations, self-affirmation appeared to go some way towards increasing persuasion. As predicted, self-affirmation was associated with significantly higher self-efficacy, and there were trends for greater message acceptance and less derogation compared with the control condition. This is in line with our prediction that relatively inactive individuals will focus on being <italic>more</italic> physically active, whereas those closer to achieving the recommendations might be more focused on the specific target. The absence of stronger effects may reflect the fact that the specific target was restated in the questions (e.g., &#x02018;Getting at least 60 min of moderate-vigorous physical activity a day is effective in reducing the risk of heart disease&#x02019;). That is, whilst encouraging open-mindedness amongst those whose activity is considerably below the recommended level may facilitate acceptance of the ease of <italic>increasing</italic> physical activity, it is possible that reminders of the target minimized this effect.</p><p>Another issue deserving of consideration is whether rejection of challenging messages induced by self-affirmation has behavioural implications. We found the expected moderation effect for self-efficacy &#x02013; typically a good predictor of behaviour (Sheppard, Hartwick, &#x00026; Warshaw, <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Williams &#x00026; French, <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) &#x02013; but no effects on self-reported behaviour 1 week later. Whilst some studies have reported benefits of self-affirmation for behaviour change (e.g., Epton &#x00026; Harris, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Jessop, Simmonds, &#x00026; Sparks, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Pietersma &#x00026; Dijkstra, <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), others have failed to find effects on self-reported behaviours 1 week later (Harris &#x00026; Napper, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Harris, Mayle, Mabbott, &#x00026; Napper, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Reed &#x00026; Aspinwall, <xref rid="b301" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). In their review, Harris and Epton (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) note that this is not a problem unique to the self-affirmation literature, and indeed, that it may be best to consider self-affirmation to be a motivational manipulation, which requires bolstering with procedures known to target volitional or goal-striving processes.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In common with other self-affirmation studies, we relied on self-reported behaviour. Whilst the items in the PACE+ Adolescent Physical Activity measure used here have been shown to have good convergent reliability with objective modes of assessment <bold>(</bold>Prochaska <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), it remains possible that T2 reports in both conditions were exaggerated following exposure to the physical activity recommendations. This may have undermined the ability of the study to detect differences between conditions. Future studies should aim to supplement self-reports with data from accelerometers or other measures less prone to error.</p><p>A further limitation is that the health message in this study highlighted the risk of heart disease, and although attempts were made to explain the personal relevance of this issue (e.g., &#x02018;fatty build-up in the coronary arteries occurs throughout life&#x02019;), clinical symptoms do not usually appear until later life (Janz <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Riddoch <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Twisk, <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and adolescents can find it hard to relate to diseases that characterize the adult population (Wistoft, <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This may explain the absence of self-affirmation effects on perceived susceptibility. It would be worthwhile to explore moderation of self-affirmation effects in the context of threats that are likely to be central to the identity of adolescents, such as weight-gain or other appearance-related consequences. More generally, there is a need for further examination of this understudied population within self-affirmation research (McQueen &#x00026; Klein, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, self-affirmation was associated with lower levels of acceptance when a message informed relatively active adolescents that (1) they were at increased risk of heart disease if they did not engage in at least an hour of MVPA every day and (2) it would be easy to achieve this target. There was also evidence that self-affirmation increased message acceptance amongst less active participants, although findings were less clear in this group. We interpret these results as extending previous findings that self-affirmation &#x02018;calibrates&#x02019; or sensitizes responses to health messages according to message quality and personal relevance (e.g., Correll <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Griffin &#x00026; Harris, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It is likely that self-affirmation increased open-mindedness through its effects on self-integrity, but there may be alternative explanations. As Harris and Epton (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) note, however, &#x02018;we currently know more about what does not appear to mediate the effects (e.g., explicit positive mood, boosts to state self-esteem, agreeableness) than what does&#x02019; (p. 973).</p><p>Self-affirmation can be a valuable tool for encouraging uptake of health messages &#x02013; but only when open-minded appraisals of their content can reasonably be expected to lead to acceptance. When recommendations are so challenging that they are likely to be considered unrealistic even by those who are not in a defensive mindset, self-affirmation may encourage message rejection.</p><p>Although we cannot say whether the message used had a detrimental effect (because there was no neutral message condition), our findings provide some indication that caution is needed when deciding whether and how to disseminate challenging health guidelines. Particularly when the majority of the target population fails to come close to the recommended behaviour, it might be advantageous to recognize dose&#x02013;response relations such as those found for physical activity and health (Janssen &#x00026; LeBlanc, <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). People prefer goals that achieve desirable outcomes, but that they also perceive to be feasible (e.g., Ajzen, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Bandura, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), and having targets that are out of reach can undermine participation in physical activity (Brawley &#x00026; Latimer, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Interpretation of effect sizes: Cram&#x000e9;r's <italic>V</italic>: .01 = small effect size, .06 = medium, .16 = large.
