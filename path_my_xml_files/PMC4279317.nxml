Intake of highly refined food with maximum percentage of carbohydrates and working with high-tech machineries, which makes a person less active and prone to <italic>Sthaulya</italic>. Now-a-days, <italic>Nidanas</italic> of <italic>Sthaulya</italic> are changing, e.g. previously <italic>Manasonivrtti</italic> (reduced mental exercises) and <italic>Harshanityatva</italic> (cheerfulness) were said to be the <italic>Nidanas</italic> of <italic>Sthaulya</italic>, but these are now changing to increasing stress, which causes episodes of binge eating leading to <italic>Sthaulya</italic>. Hereditary factor is also the prominent cause for <italic>Sthaulya</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p><italic>Samprati</italic> (etiopathogenesis) of <italic>Sthaulya</italic> can be interpreted in two ways. According to Charaka, increased <italic>Jatharagni</italic> (digestive power) causes maximum ingestion and leads to maximum absorption of <italic>Prithvi</italic> and <italic>Apa Mahabhuta</italic> dominant factors in the body leading to increased <italic>Medodhatu</italic> in the body.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] According to Dalhana, there is a state of <italic>Medodhatvagnimandya</italic> (reduced status of a type of metabolic component situated at the level of <italic>Medodhatu</italic>), which leads to excessive formation of improper <italic>Medodhatu</italic> leading to <italic>Sthaulya</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Here, <italic>Sthaulya</italic> is taken for study because there is abundant growth of <italic>Medodhatu</italic> in the body which is having <italic>Prithvi</italic> and <italic>Apa Mahabhuta</italic> dominance. It is a condition of <italic>Vriddha</italic> (increased) <italic>Medodhatu</italic>. It requires the drug which can cause a diminution of <italic>Medodhatu</italic> for its cure. Keeping this in view <italic>Gomutra Haritaki</italic> was selected. <italic>Gomutra</italic> and <italic>Haritaki</italic> both are having <italic>Kapha Medoghna</italic> (reducing <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Meda</italic>) properties due to <italic>Agni</italic> and <italic>Vayu Mahabhuta</italic> dominance in them. Hence, it was thought that <italic>Gomutra Haritaki</italic> will reduce <italic>Medodhatu</italic>. In this study, control group also planned to rule out the psychological effects of medicine, to rule out the changes occurring seasonally and to assess the effect of medicine other than diet restrictions and exercise.</p><p><italic>Abhakta</italic> and <italic>Pragbhakta Kala</italic> were decided for the administration considering the involvement of <italic>Doshas</italic> in the disease. Therefore, the dose was divided into 3 equal parts, i.e. 2 g for each Kala and administered in <italic>Abhakta</italic> (early morning) and <italic>Prakbhakta Kala</italic> (before lunch and dinner).</p><p>Strict diet and exercise schedules were advised to all patients. As the observations show, nearly 68% patients were housewives. Least awareness about following proper dietary habits and lack of time to follow exercise might be reasons behind increased prevalence of obesity in housewives and also dropout rates in the present study. The dropout rate of obese individuals is a point of concern observed in the present pilot study. This might be due to two reasons. Attraction towards diet (<italic>Laulya</italic>) is observed in patients, owing to which the patients do not agree to follow prescribed guidelines for a longer duration. Limited efficacy of trial drug may be the second reason as the patient's psyche expects faster weight reduction rate in shorter duration. When the medicine shows less effect than the expectations of patient, the psyche tries to divert towards vicious cycle of weight gain and obesity. The dropout rate itself indicates the need of a faster acting medicine for weight reduction in obesity.</p><p>In this study, 84% patients were females. The reason behind this observation might be the factors such as puberty, menstrual disturbances, menopause, post-operative and consumption or intake of oral contraceptives. In the observations almost 48% patients were found to have the family history of <italic>Sthaulya</italic> [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Charaka has also stated <italic>Beejaswabhava</italic> as one of the important causes of <italic>Sthaulya</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Observations from the present study confirms these statements from modern science as well as from Ayurveda. Better results were found in symptoms such as <italic>Atikshudha</italic> (excessive hunger) and <italic>Atinidra</italic> (excessive sleep) in the trial group than the control group which shows that <italic>Gomutra Haritaki</italic> might breaking the obstruction caused by <italic>Medodhatu</italic> in <italic>Koshtha</italic> and establishing normal pathway of <italic>Vatadosa</italic> in the <italic>Koshtha</italic>. Due to this reason, <italic>Atikshudha</italic> was found to be relived. This is also evidenced in classics that <italic>Gomutra</italic> with its <italic>Ushna</italic> (hot), <italic>Tikshna</italic> (sharp) properties and <italic>Haritaki</italic> with its own properties dose the role of <italic>Srotovibandhanashana</italic> (reliving the obstructions in the body channels).</p><p>Better results were found in symptoms such as <italic>Swedadhikya</italic> (excessive sweating), <italic>Angagauravata</italic> (heaviness of the body), <italic>Angadaurgandhya</italic> (bad body odor), <italic>Atipipasa</italic> (excessive thirst), <italic>Utsahahani</italic> (loss of enthusiasm), and <italic>Kshudra Swasa</italic> (dyspnoea on exertion), in Control Group than Trial Group.
