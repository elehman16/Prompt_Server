<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Health and societal costs of eczema are thought to cause a similar economic burden to that for asthma.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The term atopic eczema (synonymous with atopic dermatitis) is widely used to denote a clinical phenotype, rather than those who are truly atopic defined by the presence of IgE-specific antibodies to common environmental allergens. In this study, we use the term &#x02018;eczema&#x02019; throughout to refer to the &#x02018;atopic eczema&#x02019; clinical phenotype, in accordance with the recommended nomenclature of the World Allergy Organisation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Guidelines suggest that emollients form the mainstay of treatment for eczema and should be used regularly by all patients with other treatments, such as topical corticosteroids, used in addition where necessary.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Emollients are thought to act by providing a protective layer over the skin, decreasing moisture loss and occluding against irritants. There are three methods of application of emollients: (1) leave-on (directly applied) emollients, where emollients are applied to the skin and left to soak in; (2) soap substitutes, where emollients are used instead of soap or other washing products; and (3) bath emollients (or bath additives), which are oil and/or emulsifiers designed to disperse in the bath. All three approaches are often used together.</p><p>While there is widespread clinical consensus on the need for leave-on emollients and soap substitutes, there is less agreement regarding the additional benefits of bath emollients. Despite this, they are widely prescribed at a cost of nearly &#x000a3;25 million per year to the National Health Service (NHS) in England.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A previous systematic review has revealed no convincing evidence for the use of bath emollients in the treatment of eczema.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Available data consist of isolated case series and case reports, with no controlled studies. No relevant trials have been published since 2007<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and trial registries reveal no ongoing studies.</p><p>In addition to concerns about cost-effectiveness, potential harms from using bath emollients include skin irritation and greasier bath surfaces that can increase the risk of slips and accidents (listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics of leading brands). There is also a concern that people who use bath emollients in place of leave-on emollients are receiving substandard emollient therapy.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The effectiveness of adding antiseptic agents to bath emollients has also not been demonstrated. Two small randomised studies<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> compared &#x02018;bath emollient&#x02019; with &#x02018;bath emollient plus antiseptic&#x02019; on a range of outcomes, but there were no significant differences between groups, including colony counts of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> For this reason, we chose to exclude bath emollients which incorporate an antiseptic, because of the absence of benefit and possible increased risk of skin irritation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Pragmatic clinical trials aim to test the effectiveness of an intervention in a real-life setting in order to recruit a study population that is as similar as possible to the population on which the intervention is meant to be used. Whereas an explanatory clinical trial aims to answer the question, &#x02018;Can this intervention work under ideal conditions?&#x02019; a pragmatic approach seeks to answer the question, &#x02018;Does this intervention work under usual conditions?&#x02019;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Features of pragmatic trials include: that they use clinically important outcomes, commonly participant-reported outcomes; that they include longer term follow-up; and that participants are encouraged to adhere to the intervention only to the extent that would be anticipated in usual care.</p><p>Although relatively few pragmatic trials have been carried out in dermatology,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> we felt that a definitive pragmatic clinical trial, including outcomes of relevance to participants and including long-term follow-up, was the most appropriate design to address the question of the effectiveness of bath emollients in addition to standard eczema care in everyday care. We chose an &#x02018;open label&#x02019; design as it would not be possible to create a convincing placebo for bath emollients, which make the bath feel &#x02018;greasy&#x02019;. We wished to design a trial with a clinical outcome relevant to participants. In eczema, the appearance of the skin does not always closely reflect symptoms causing a major impact on the child and family, such as sleep disturbance and itch.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It was therefore particularly important to design a trial with a validated participant-reported primary outcome.</p><p>We aim to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding bath emollient to the standard management of atopic eczema in children, which includes regular application of leave-on emollients with use of topical corticosteroids as required. The BATHE trial is a pragmatic randomised open-label multicentre superiority trial with two parallel groups and a primary outcome of long-term control as measured by Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) weekly scores over 16&#x02005;weeks. Children will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either bath emollients plus standard eczema care or standard eczema care only. This paper outlines the study protocol, in accordance with the SPIRIT guidelines (Standard protocol items; recommendations for interventional trials).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study setting</title><p>The BATHE study will recruit participants registered at approximately 100 general practices in Wales, West of England and South-West England (list of practices will be on study website when available). Practices will be recruited through the local Clinical Research Networks in England and The National Institute for Social Care and Health Research in Wales. We aim to recruit practices that are broadly representative of UK primary care in terms of practice size and sociodemographics.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Eligibility</title><p>Children are eligible to participate in the study if they are aged over 12&#x02005;months and less than 12&#x02005;years with eczema according to UK Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Eczema.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We will exclude children with inactive or very mild eczema, defined as a score of 5 or less on Nottingham Eczema Severity Scale (NESS),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> in order to avoid floor effects. We will exclude children who usually have a bath less than once per week.</p><p>Children will be excluded if they or their carers are not prepared to be randomised to either intervention group or if their carer is unable to give informed consent or does not have sufficient English to complete the trial documentation. Children will be excluded if they are currently participating in any other clinical trial. If a family has more than one child who meets the eligibility criteria, they will be asked to choose just one child to participate in the trial, as it would be burdensome to have different bathing regimens within one family, as many will bath their children together.

Standard eczema care in this study constitutes usual general practitioner (GP) care, supplemented by evidence-based guidance. We will provide basic information on eczema care at baseline to participants and GPs in the form of a booklet based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> (available on study website). Standard care includes advice to regularly use leave-on emollients plus intermittent topical corticosteroids if required. Standard care of eczema in the UK is generally delivered through 10&#x02005;min consultations in primary care initiated by carers. GPs in the study will continue to refer to dermatology services when they feel this to be necessary. In the UK, referral criteria include: diagnostic uncertainty; eczema not satisfactorily controlled; child or carer may benefit from specialist advice on treatment application.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Baseline appointments will be carried out by a trial coordinator at the participant's GP surgery (or at their home if surgery premises not available) and informed consent/assent will be sought at this point. At the baseline appointment, both groups will be given basic information about eczema and will be given identical verbal and written information on how to wash children with eczema as soap avoidance is an important component of eczema care. This information is also available on the study website. We will ask all carers to either wash their child with water alone or to use a leave-on emollient as a soap substitute. If they have difficulties with this and request to use an emollient wash product then they may do so. Guidelines on frequency of bathing vary, but most healthcare professionals advise daily bathing for children with eczema<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and this advice is offered in our information to carers.</p><p>Children allocated to receive bath emollients will receive a prescription for a bath emollient from a GP in the participating practice and we will ask the prescriber to enter this as a &#x02018;repeat&#x02019; prescription, so that carers may obtain further supplies as necessary, reflecting usual prescribing in UK primary care. Carers will be asked to use bath emollients as prescribed or described on the packaging, to reflect how they are used in usual practice.</p><p>The British National Formulary (BNF) lists 13 different bath emollients, but in clinical practice, a few of these are commonly prescribed. We will encourage participating practices to prescribe one of the following products: Oilatum Fragrance Free Junior, Balneum bath oil or Aveeno Bath Oil. These products account for the majority of bath emollient prescriptions issued in the UK<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and appear in local prescribing formularies for participating centres. Participants may express a preference for one brand of bath emollient over another, or if no preference is expressed, the choice of prescription will be determined by the GP. If children or carers wish to change bath emollient during the trial then they may change to an alternative within the three above, or choose a different bath emollient if their GP is happy to prescribe this. Prescribers will be asked to avoid bath emollients that contain additional ingredients such as antipruritics and antiseptics.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention adherence</title><p>We will ask children and their carers to adhere to their treatment allocation for a year. If they feel that the eczema is deteriorating, we will ask carers to consult their GP in the usual way in order to address whether other treatments are necessary. We will encourage adherence to treatment allocation by ensuring that participating general practices are committed to supporting the study and receive clear advice regarding maintaining treatment allocation wherever possible. As this is a pragmatic trial we wish to evaluate the benefit of emollient use in everyday practice and, for this reason, will not make additional efforts to ensure adherence to treatment allocation in either group. We will assess adherence to treatment allocation in questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>Our primary outcome measure is difference between the two treatment groups in long-term control as measured by POEM scores captured weekly over the first 16&#x02005;weeks. POEM is a patient-reported outcome based on symptoms over the previous week which can be completed by the child's carer or the child themselves.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> POEM is the only patient-reported outcome that demonstrated sufficient validity and repeatability in a systematic review of outcome measures for eczema<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and has been recommended as the preferred instrument for capturing patient-reported symptoms in eczema trials by the Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.homeforeczema.org">http://www.homeforeczema.org</ext-link>). Our primary outcome measure is based on repeated measures of POEM data collected weekly over 16&#x02005;weeks because this reflects the impact of this relapsing and remitting chronic condition better than comparing outcomes at a single follow-up point. However, if weekly questionnaires prove too burdensome for participants and there is excessive missing data, we will consider change in POEM score from baseline to 4&#x02005;months as our primary outcome.</p><p>Because of the burden of weekly questionnaires on participants, we have limited weekly data collection to the first 16&#x02005;weeks of the trial for the primary outcome assessment but follow-up will continue for 12&#x02005;months. Participants may choose to complete questionnaires either online or by post.

The CHU-9D is a paediatric generic preference-based utility measure exclusively developed with children aged 7&#x02013;11&#x02005;years and is more suitable for capturing quality of life impact related to eczema, such as sleep disturbance and child's mood. Personal communication with the team who developed this measure confirmed that studies are underway trialling its application in children aged 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;years but, to our knowledge, there are no studies reporting for infants. There are no suitable utility measures validated for very young children aged 1&#x02013;4&#x02005;years, but the CHU-9D performed well in a similar population in the SPaCE feasibility trial (CHU-9D data currently being prepared for publication).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>We will use healthcare resource use data in order to cost the intervention, collected by practice records, and data collected by carer/parent-completed questionnaires based on the modified Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated for repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in weekly POEM scores over 16&#x02005;weeks.

Bath emollients make the bath feel &#x02018;greasy&#x02019;, and it is therefore not possible to make a convincing placebo, particularly as a survey carried out prior to the study suggested that many families of children with eczema have experience of using bath emollient (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009575TB2">table 2</xref>). As discussed above, the main focus for this pragmatic study is patient-centred, and primary outcome is therefore a participant/proxy-reported score. Care providers and clinical studies officers will not be blinded as they are involved in ensuring participants receive the correct treatment and may be involved in discussing adherence with participants over the course of the year. Furthermore, the additional staff cost that would have been incurred by having researchers &#x02018;blind&#x02019; to group allocation did not seem justifiable if the primary outcome is participant-reported.

All cost-effectiveness results will be presented on: (1) the cost-effectiveness plane, which captures the uncertainty around the results and shows the incremental cost and incremental effect of the comparison of interest in a two-dimentional plot, and (2) cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, which graphically represent the uncertainty, in terms of probabilities, regarding the cost-effectiveness of the new technology compared with the existing alternative. The cost-effectiveness unit of analysis will be: (1) the cost per unit change as measured by the primary outcome (POEM) at 16&#x02005;weeks; (2) cost per exacerbation avoided over 1&#x02005;year.
