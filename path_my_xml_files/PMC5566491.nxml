The NDisc trial is an ongoing multi-center, randomized study with a sequential phase I study within the combined phase I/II trial with close monitoring of tolerability and safety. Twenty-four adult patients were randomized and treated with the investigational medicinal product NDisc plus or the carrier material only. Rates of adverse events in Phase I of this trial were comparable with those expected in the early time course after elective disk surgery. There was one reherniation 7&#x000a0;months after transplantation, which corresponds to an expected reherniation rate. Immunological markers like CRP and IL-6 were not significantly elevated and there were no imaging abnormalities. No indications of harmful material extrusion or immunological consequences due to the investigational medicinal product NDplus were observed. Therefore, the study appears to be safe and feasible. Safety analyses of Phase I of this trial indicate a relatively low risk considering the benefits that patients with debilitating degenerative disk disease may gain.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Autologous disk chondrocyte transplantation</kwd><kwd>Degenerative disk disease</kwd><kwd>Lumbar back pain</kwd><kwd>Sequestrectomy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Innsbruck and Medical University of Innsbruck</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by [OrgName].</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Intervertebral disk degeneration (IVDD) is emphasized as an important cause of low back pain (LBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current treatment strategies are aggressive removal of the pathological disk or spondylodesis that do not address options of restoring structural or biological deteriorations of the intervertebral disk (IVD) as the underlying problem. Therefore, disk repair procedures are of interest to spine surgeons, because they offer a less invasive and biological alternative to lumbar fusion in an attempt to obviate LBP associated with IVDD earlier in the degenerative cascade. Advances in molecular biology are now encouraging innovative biological repair strategies. Different treatment modalities in vivo and in vitro include the administration of growth factors, the application of autologous or allogenic cells, gene therapeutic approaches, in situ therapy and the introduction of biomaterials, or a combination thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Especially, reinsertion of autologous nucleus pulpous cells or stem cells delays degeneration in experimental in vivo or in vitro models of disk degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In humans, the IVD potentially be repaired after a herniation by transplanting the patient&#x02019;s disk chondrocyte. According to this method, which is called the autologous disk-derived chondrocyte transplantation (ADCT), the disk tissue which herniated through the annulus fibrosus is removed at an initial surgical intervention. The chondrocytes are then enzymatically isolated, expanded in vitro and the suspension is reinjected into the damaged IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Transplanted cultivated cells have to survive in a harsh environment in the disk space with low nutrients and a high amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, NOVOCART<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Disk plus (NDplus) consists of a hydrogel with anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, anti-osteogenic properties, and autologous disk cells for ADCT. This biomaterial is able to achieve a positive milieu conditioning of the previously damaged intervertebral disk, and thus, is intended to increase the survival rate and regeneration capability of the transplanted cells. Furthermore, the liquid biomaterial polymerizes after being injected, which should improve the cells&#x02019;adherence.</p><p id="Par4">NDplus was developed to provide rehydration and biological integrity of degenerative lumbar disks to prevent secondary diseases such as osteochondrosis, recurrent lumbar disk herniation, or segmental instability. In this phase-I/II study, NDplus is being investigated for its clinical applicability, safety, and efficacy in the repair of herniated, nucleotomized disks, and of adjacent degenerated disks, if present. To date, autologous disk chondrocytes have not been transplanted into degenerative disks without previous disk herniation. This is possible in the presented study by injection of autologous cells not only in the nucleotomized, but also in the adjacent degenerated disks. As such, this is the first study to investigate a therapeutic as well as a prophylactic approach to treat degenerative disks of the lumbar spine.</p><p id="Par5">The objective of phase I was to develop a safety profile. This study further aims at developing and validating known and new biologic markers for the quality and clinical efficacy of the product as requested in the context of identity, purity, and potency characteristics of the medicinal/investigational product.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Clinical material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial description</title><p id="Par6">The NDisc study is a non-confirmatory, prospective, multi-center, unmasked, randomized study with two phases aimed at gathering preliminary clinical information on NDisc plus and NDisc basic used in the repair of herniated disks. The objectives of Phase I were to develop a safety profile and to evaluate feasibility of NDplus. This report presents data from Phase I up to 6&#x000a0;weeks after transplantation (Visit 4). Eligible patients underwent baseline assessments, sequestrectomy, and postoperative assessment of Visit 2. After this initial surgery, all patients were randomized with a 1:1 allocation ratio to either NDplus ADCT or NDbasic. Patients with a lumbar disk herniation were classified according to the presence (ADD) or absence (HD) of a degenerative disk at the adjacent level by the investigators of the center. At Visit 3, patients underwent pre-implantation assessments, transplantation and post-transplantation assessments. A follow-up was performed at Visit 4.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical investigation population</title><p id="Par7">Twenty-four patients with a single-level lumbar herniated disk were recruited consecutively in three different centers. The N-Disc trial aimed to include patients with symptomatic lumbar disk herniation who failed adequate conservative or interventional treatment approaches in accordance with the guidelines of the German Society of Neurosurgery and the German Society of Orthopedics and Orthopedic Surgery. Additionally, an MRI determined disk herniation at the treatment level needed to correlate with the primary symptoms. To minimize confounding, patients with significant comorbidities were excluded from the study. Further inclusion criteria needed to be met: (1) no previous lumbar spine surgery; (2) age between 18 to 60&#x000a0;years; (3) proficient enough in the German language to understand the study; (4) no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented associated lumbar disease such as lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or fracture. If patients showed an extensive damage of the annulus fibrosus intraoperatively that may subsequently pose a significant greater risk of recurrence or non-containment of the injected material, they were excluded from the trial and randomization was not carried out. Written informed consent has been obtained from each patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessments and laboratory values</title><p id="Par8">Overall patient disposition and demographics, neurological, and functional status were documented. Serology of HIV, hepatitis, and Treponema pallidum were determined preoperatively. Laboratory values such as interleukine-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as safety parameters were evaluated. All laboratory values were classified as normal or abnormal according to the laboratories normal ranges. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate as vital signs were assessed. Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) were documented. The analysis of adverse events was focused on treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE). A TEAE or TESAE is any AE or SAE that occurs during or after implant. Frequency and percentage of TEAEs were summarized according to the primary system organ class and preferred term and tabulated by treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title><p id="Par9">Preoperative MRI of the lumbar spine was performed in a standardized fashion on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner. The protocols included T1- und T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequences in sagittal and transversal planes, a sagittal STIR sequence, a sagittal thin slice double echo volumetry sequence, and a sagittal spin echo T2 multi-echo relaxometry sequence, additionally. Numerical and comparative measurements in disk height, volumetry, and T2 relaxations times of index and adjacent disks and categorial evaluation such as degeneration scale, and the presence or absence of stenosis were determined by MRI. Osteochondrosis was graded by Modic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The sequences were time optimized to improve patient&#x02019;s acceptance and enable integrability of study protocols in the local MRI schedules. Furthermore, an external institution (MEDIRI&#x02014;medical imaging research institute, Heidelberg, Germany) adapted the protocol to the local scanners to arrange image data comparability between the different study centers. Additionally, the institution trained local radiographers in standardized performance and engineered a software for central image processing and analysis.

Only two patients had TEAEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to the medical intervention or to either of the study treatment. One patient of the NDisc basic group experienced spinal pain 21&#x000a0;days post implant (non serious TEAE) assessed as related to both surgery and study treatment. One patient of the NDisc plus experienced an intevertebral disk protrusion (serious TEAE) assessed also as related to both surgery and study treatment. The patient underwent further surgery. No further spinal complications occurred in phase I. Considering the small number of patients with ADD, no differences were apparent between patients with and without ADD with respect to TEAEs and inflammatory parameters. The most commonly occurring TEAE was nasopharyngitis in three patients in the NDplus group and this was not related to the sequestrectomy or IMP.</p><p id="Par18">Laboratory parameters in both treatment groups increased temporarily after 36&#x000a0;h of sequestrectomy (CRP: NDplus group 3.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;mg/dL vs. NDbasic group 3.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;mg/dL; IL-6: NDplus group 10.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6&#x000a0;pg/mL and NDbasic group 12.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13&#x000a0;pg/mL) and turned to normal thereafter. CRP did not change after implantation, whereas IL-6 showed minor changes with a peak at 42&#x000a0;h post implantation. In the NDplus cohort IL-6 was elevated over a broader range, but this was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Laboratory values. <italic>SE</italic> sequestrectomy, <italic>IMP</italic> implantation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10143_2016_781_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

Osteochondrosis assessed by Modic grading of MRIs did not appear to worsen in any of the disk types during Phase I.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">We have described the safety results of the first randomized prospective clinical study for ADCT in the treatment of surgically treated lumbar disks and in degenerated adjacent. The goal of ADCT is to reduce the degenerative sequel after lumbar disk surgery or to prophylactically avoid degeneration in adjacent disks. Injection of material in the disk, however, theoretically carries several risks such as extrusion of the injected material, increased intradiscal pressure potentially provoking disk herniations, and local or systemic inflammatory reactions.</p><p id="Par23">Current treatment strategies for IVDD are aggressive surgical removal of the pathological disk or spondylodesis that do not address options of restoring structural or biological deteriorations of the IVD as the underlying problem. The rate of lumbar fusion surgery is rising dramatically compared to other musculoskeletal surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patient self-rating for unsuccessful treatment after fusions for degenerative conditions ranges from 30 to 40&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, major complication rates of up to 20&#x000a0;% and long-term consequences of spinal fusion like adjacent segment degeneration of 37&#x000a0;% within 10&#x000a0;years have to be kept in mind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, lumbar fusion does not sufficiently improve the patient&#x02019;s condition in many ways. Better outcomes were expected by substantially reducing the tissue damage with the introduction of minimal invasive spine surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, ADCT may offer a less invasive, biological alternative to lumbar fusion in an attempt to address LBP associated with IVDD earlier in the degenerative cascade.</p><p id="Par24">Surgical interventions entail physiological responses including the rise of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additionally, the reintroduction of disk cells to initiate cellular regeneration may also reactivate the innate immune system and potentially even specific immune responses. Therefore, observation of a pro-inflammatory response gives an early warning of potential complications like an autoimmune response against the implanted biomaterial. CRP is a long-term clinical standard to monitor innate responses and is independent of pain management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Among other pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 may be regarded as an important component contributing to the local inflammatory process in disk herniations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, serum levels of IL-6 may be increased in patients with lumbar radicular pain due to disk herniation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is no data in the literature, which role serum IL-6 plays after lumbar sequestrectomy. In our study population, CRP and IL-6 were evaluated 36&#x000a0;h after surgery. Furthermore, IL-6 increased 42&#x000a0;h after implantation, but turned to normal values thereafter. Thus, there is no indication of relevant immunological consequences of the intradiscal injection at short-term follow-up, neither in the NDisc plus nor in the NDisc basic cohort.</p><p id="Par25">Routine treatment (elective sequestrectomy) in the target patient population was considered to be associated with AEs such as recurrent disk herniation or ongoing or recurrent low back pain or sciatica in up to 25&#x000a0;% of patients within 2&#x000a0;years. Symptomatic reherniations occur in approximately 10&#x000a0;% of patients with the highest risk within the first 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recurrent symptoms due to disk degeneration or osteochondrosis also termed post-discectomy syndrome may occur over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the present Phase I study, there was one reherniation requiring reoperation early after sequestrectomy and before implantation was scheduled, which is clearly unrelated to the injection substrate. Thus, no indication for an increased risk of reherniations due to the injected biomaterial was observed.</p><p id="Par26">Early postoperative routine MRI is difficult to interpret due to postoperative changes. It is well known, that (residual) intervertebral disk protrusions are common on MRI after sequestrectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is therefore questionable if MRI in the early postoperative period after lumbar surgery is meaningful. Early postoperative MRI must be interpreted with caution, since correlation between clinical and radiological findings is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The MRI data in Phase I revealed a minimal EDFC in three patients. This may also occur after routine disk surgery. As previously described, in one case of EDFC, a patient developed a disk reherniation after transplantation, which required surgery 7&#x000a0;months after the index operation. Nonetheless, given EDFC as a common finding after disk surgery it is doubtful that the finding of small EDFC represents an elevated risk of reherniation.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Overall conclusions</title><p id="Par27">Overall, the rates of radiological and clinical reherniations as well as of AEs in Phase I of this trial are comparable with those expected in the early time course after elective disk surgery. No indications of harmful material extrusion or immunological consequences due to the IMP NDplus were observed. Therefore, the study appears to be safe and feasible. Safety analyses of Phase I of this trial indicate a relatively low risk considering the benefits that patients with debilitating degenerative disk disease may gain. Regardless of the promising results of this Phase I study, further analyses are necessary and warranted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial registration: EudraCT No: 2010&#x02013;023,830-22, ID NCT01640457, 08.11.2010</p></fn><fn><p>An erratum to this article is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10143-016-0787-7">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10143-016-0787-7</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Open access funding provided by University of Innsbruck and Medical University of Innsbruck.
