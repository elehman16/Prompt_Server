Prolonged DAPT has proven itself effective in further reducing cardiovascular events, yet with increased risk of bleeding. Thus, it is of great necessity to find an alternative drug that is as effective but safer and more economic than the P2Y12 inhibitors after termination of one-year DAPT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in 3600 eligible post-PCI patients from 36 tertiary hospitals (100 patients per hospital) across mainland China. The hospitals served as clusters are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Guanxinning tablet (GXNT) plus aspirin or aspirin alone for 12&#x000a0;months, with other conventional treatment applied in both groups. After the treatment period, all patients will be followed up for another 12&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome measure is composite cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, revascularization, ischemic stroke, and re-admission due to unstable angina. Secondary outcome measures are all-cause mortality, each&#x000a0;individual component of the primary outcome measure, and stopping or reducing the rate of nitroglycerin administration. Adverse events, including bleeding, will be closely monitored during the whole trial period. In addition, a cost-effectiveness study of GXNT for the study population will be conducted along with this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial aims to determine whether the addition of GXNT will further improve prognosis without increasing bleeding risk for patients with coronary artery disease who have switched from DAPT to aspirin alone after PCI.

Concerning the possibility of late or very late stent thrombosis, which is frequently associated with myocardial infarction, and may be fatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], researchers have conducted plenty of studies to explore the benefits and risks of prolonged (&#x0003e;12&#x000a0;month) DAPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among those, the DAPT trial is the largest and sufficiently powered trial, and demonstrated that, compared with 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; DAPT, an additional 18&#x000a0;months treatment with DAPT&#x000a0; further reduced the risk of stent thrombosis (hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.48, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and MACE rate (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.85, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), establishing the antithrombotic benefits of extended DAPT (&#x0003e;12&#x000a0;months) in post-PCI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Later, a systematic review comparing extended DAPT (&#x0003e;12&#x000a0;months) with standard 12&#x000a0;month therapy also confirmed the benefits of extended DAPT, demonstrating that extended DAPT significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.42 to 0.66) and stent thrombosis (0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.21 to 0.51) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, all the antithrombotic benefits of extended DAPT are accompanied by increased bleeding risk, which has raised broad concerns. For example, in the DAPT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], researchers found that 30&#x000a0;months of DAPT led to a 0.9% absolute increase in moderate to severe bleeding risk and a risk&#x02013;benefit analysis showed that prolonged DAPT, annually, resulted in three fewer stent thromboses and six fewer myocardial infarctions at the cost of five more major bleeds per 1,000 patients. Notably, a recently published meta-analysis of 12 trials, comprising over 34,000 patients receiving different durations of DAPT, revealed that bleeding was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality and that longer duration of DAPT was associated with more bleeding-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Besides, coronary artery disease itself is an exceedingly costly disease, costing a total of $316.6 billion annually in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and prolonged application of the P2Y12 inhibitors will definitely add to the economic burden of both the nation and individuals. Thus, it is urgent to find an alternative drug that is as effective, but safer and more economic than P2Y12 inhibitors.</p><p id="Par13">Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat coronary artery disease for&#x000a0;quite a long time and is receiving increasing popularity worldwide for its efficacy and low cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Guanxinning tablet (GXNT) is a traditional Chinese patent medicine and has been approved for marketing by the China Food and Drug Administration. It is developed, for convenience and better compliance, from the widely used Guanxinning injection, whose efficacy in reducing angina attacks and alleviating ST segment depression in the electrocardiogram has been broadly recognized and proved. Results of a meta-analysis involving 6064 patients with angina comparing Guanxinning injection versus control treatments (mainly nitroglycerin and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine), Guanxinning injection plus conventional treatment versus conventional treatment alone, and Guanxinning injection in combination with other forms of traditional Chinese medicine plus conventional treatment versus conventional treatment showed that Guanxinning injection was more effective than all controls in improving angina symptom and alleviating ST segment depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Guanxinning tablet, usually prescribed as an additional medicine to guideline-recommended standard medical treatment in China, comprises extracts from two well-established Chinese herbal medicines: Danshen (<italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>) and Chuanxiong (ligustrazine, <italic>Ligustium Wallichii Franch</italic>). Danshen, with tanshinones and phenolic acids as its main active compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], has long been widely used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. An emerging experimental study and clinical trials demonstrated that Danshen and its active compounds could prevent atherosclerosis by inhibiting platelet aggregation, decreasing low-density lipoprotein oxidation, preventing monocyte adhesion to endothelium, and impeding smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, macrophage cholesterol accumulation, and proinflammatory cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Chuanxiong, also a commonly used Chinese herbal medicine, together with its active compounds tetramethylpyrazine and ferulic acid could inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, preclinical studies indicated that GXNT is effective in inhibiting platelet aggregation, decreasing blood viscosity, and scavenging free radicals, which are all key pro-thrombotic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Notably, no adverse events have been reported during the daily use of GXNT. Thus, it appears that GXNT is safe and effective, and may be a promising alternative to P2Y12 inhibitor for prolonged antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing PCI. However, currently there is no adequately powered study assessing the safety and long-term efficacy of GXNT on clinically relevant outcomes for post-PCI patients.</p><p id="Par14">Therefore, we designed this multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the long-term benefits, safety, and cost-effectiveness of GXNT for patients who switch from DAPT to aspirin alone after PCI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives and design</title><p id="Par15">This study is a prospective, multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial aiming to explore whether the addition of GXNT to conventional treatment, including aspirin, will decrease MACEs without increasing bleeding risk for post-PCI patients who switch to aspirin monotherapy after the standard 12&#x000a0;months DAPT. An economic evaluation with 360 participants will be carried out alongside this trial in six of the 36 centers to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of GXNT.

Though participants in our trial may have a lower rate of mortality, reinfarction, and target vessel revascularization than the retrospective study, taking other components into account, including stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and re-admission for unstable angina, we estimate the 12&#x000a0;month rate for the primary outcome measure in patients taking aspirin alone might be 21%, and that GXNT will reduce the incidence by 21%.

Second, site monitoring will be conducted by a clinical research associate to confirm protocol compliance, ethical standards, regulatory compliance, and data quality. Third, computer logic checks will be automatically run to identify such items as missing and questionable data. Forth, less common and more complicated errors will be checked manually. Identified errors will be corrected to ensure data quality.</p><p id="Par44">In addition, a data safety monitoring committee independent of the sponsor will be recruited to guarantee the quality of the data and safety of the participants. If unexpected serious adverse events occur, and the data safety monitoring committee and investigators believe that GXNT will do great harm to participants, or results of the interim analysis to be conducted by the data safety monitoring committee show no trends of benefit, this study will be terminated early. Finally, an independent clinical endpoint committee will adjudicate all MACEs within the trial period and is blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par45">Completion of this clinical trial may provide a novel, promising, and safer alternative to P2Y12 inhibitors for prolonged antiplatelet therapy, which may further reduce MACEs for patients who have already received 12&#x000a0;months DAPT after PCI without increasing bleeding risk. GXNT&#x000a0;is a promising Chinese patent medicine for coronary artery disease. Experimental studies have demonstrated that GXNT could increase the serum NO level and coronary blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], reduce platelet aggregation and blood viscosity, and protect the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that GXNT might inhibit thrombosis through different mechanisms, such as inhibiting the formation of free radicals and intervening metabolism of arachidonic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These findings imply that GXNT is an effective treatment to depress platelet activity and can be used for patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI. In fact, GXNT is now widely used in patients after coronary stent implantation in China. However, there is insufficient evidence to show whether the long-term use of GXNT in patients who have received DAPT for at least 12&#x000a0;months after PCI can generate further cardiovascular benefits and whether it is cost-effective. All the findings and facts stated here serve as an impetus for large controlled trials to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of GXNT in patients with coronary artery disease after PCI. Thus, we designed this multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial, which will provide high-quality evidence for the use of GXNT in patients after coronary stent implantation who have switched from DAPT to aspirin monotherapy.</p><p id="Par46">The study is designed according to international clinical trial principles. Data will be monitored periodically and quality control measures will be implemented strictly, which all ensure an objective and scientific assessment of GXNT. In addition, as recruitment is of great importance to generalizability, the adoption of a cluster randomized design and extensive recruitment of hospitals across mainland China greatly broaden representation and generalizability, albeit limited to China alone. Moreover, the cluster randomized design is less costly, time-saving and convenient to implement than conventional randomized controlled trials, and could also avoid potential contamination, which occurs when subjects in the control arm are exposed to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">However, some limitations existing in this study may be a cause for concern. Recruitment may be quite difficult for some hospitals, considering the targeting of eligible patients. However, we have made detailed recruitment strategies including screening the PCI database, using media advertising and social media, etc., and we believe that with substantial effort devoted to overcoming the problem, we could successfully complete the recruitment with the pre-specified sample size.</p><p id="Par48">In conclusion, this study is designed to assess whether the addition of GXNT to aspirin and other conventional treatment in post-PCI patients after discontinuation of DAPT will further reduce MACEs without increasing the bleeding risk. Successful completion of this trial may provide a safe and effective alternative to P2Y12 inhibitors for long-term antiplatelet therapy.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par57">
