Many drug-related problems (DRPs) are detected in these patients, such as low adherence, therapeutic inefficacy, and safety issues. We evaluated the impact of pharmacist interventions on CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, HIV viral load, and DRPs in patients with HIV infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this 18-month prospective controlled study, 90 outpatients were selected by convenience sampling from the Hospital Dia&#x02013;University of Campinas Teaching Hospital (Brazil). Forty-five patients comprised the pharmacist intervention group and 45 the control group; all patients had HIV infection with or without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Pharmaceutical appointments were conducted based on the Pharmacotherapy Workup method, although DRPs and pharmacist intervention classifications were modified for applicability to institutional service limitations and research requirements. Pharmacist interventions were performed immediately after detection of DRPs. The main outcome measures were DRPs, CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and HIV viral load.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After pharmacist intervention, DRPs decreased from 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] =4.1&#x02013;6.2) to 4.2 (95% CI =3.3&#x02013;5.1) per patient (<italic>P</italic>=0.043). A total of 122 pharmacist interventions were proposed, with an average of 2.7 interventions per patient. All the pharmacist interventions were accepted by physicians, and among patients, the interventions were well accepted during the appointments, but compliance with the interventions was not measured. A statistically significant increase in CD4+ T-lymphocyte count in the intervention group was found (260.7 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> [95% CI =175.8&#x02013;345.6] to 312.0 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> [95% CI =23.5&#x02013;40.6], <italic>P</italic>=0.015), which was not observed in the control group. There was no statistical difference between the groups regarding HIV viral load.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study suggests that pharmacist interventions in patients with HIV infection can cause an increase in CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and a decrease in DRPs, demonstrating the importance of an optimal pharmaceutical care plan.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>pharmaceutical care</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>clinical pharmacy</kwd><kwd>CD4+ T lymphocyte count</kwd><kwd>AIDS</kwd><kwd>pharmacy service</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the increasing number, availability, and rapid emergence of new information on antiretroviral (ARV) agents, a substantial complexity has been introduced into treatment regimens for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-10-631" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This may lead to low adherence to ARV regimens, which directly affects therapeutic efficacy.

On days when the clinical pharmacy team was in Hospital Dia for appointments, medical charts of patients being attended were analyzed for fit with the study criteria, and those eligible were assigned to the intervention group. On days when the clinical pharmacy staff was not in Hospital Dia, patients were evaluated for eligibility and assigned to the control which was subsequently revised by the clinical pharmacy team.</p><p>Patients in the intervention group were asked to attend appointments with a clinical pharmacist after their routine physician appointments during the study period. Those in the control group received the usual care without appointments with the clinical pharmacists.</p><p>For the intervention group, at least two pharmacist appointments of 30&#x02013;60 minutes each were performed. The first appointment was named visit one. Visit two was defined as the second pharmacist appointment with new CD4+ count and HIV viral load results. Some patients attended more than one pharmacist appointment after visit one, but for study purposes, only visits defined as one and two were considered. For the control group, visits one and two were defined as medical appointments that included examination results. Patients in the intervention group who had fewer than two pharmacist appointments and patients in both groups who were referred to another health service during the study were excluded.</p><p>Pharmacist appointments began with data collection through patient interview regarding medical history. Besides patient reports about health and ongoing treatments, other information was obtained from family members or caregivers and other health professionals. The theoretical framework for the pharmaceutical appointment relied on Pharmacotherapy Workup, a process where pharmacists use rational decision-making to assess a patient&#x02019;s drug-related needs, identify drug therapy problems, develop a care plan, conduct follow-up evaluations, and ensure that all drug therapies are safe and effective.<xref rid="b31-tcrm-10-631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The Pharmacotherapy Workup was modified according to our institution&#x02019;s service limitations and research requirements. Forms used to record data and guide the pharmacist appointments were prepared by the study pharmacists.</p><p>The pharmacist team comprised two pharmacists responsible for performing the clinical pharmacist appointments and two pharmacists responsible for DRP analysis. The primary end point was the comparison between DRPs identified at baseline and at the end of the study for the intervention group. Secondary end points were the comparison between change in CD4+ and HIV viral load from baseline to study end in both the intervention and the control groups.</p><p>Before the pharmacist appointments, the patient&#x02019;s medical history was reviewed using his or her medical chart. The following data were collected for each intervention group patient: age, ethnicity, HIV diagnosis in years, HIV treatment in years, CD4+ count, HIV viral load, comorbidities, and ARV regimen. Patient symptoms, signs, complaints, medications in use, and self-reported nonadherence data were obtained through an interview during the pharmacist appointment. These data were analyzed by separate pharmacists on the team to identify and classify the DRPs related to all medications, including ARV therapy. For the control group, the same data were collected from the medical chart at the time when the patient was included in the study, but the pharmacist appointment was not performed, and additional data regarding medication were not collected; thus, the DRPs could not be accurately identified.</p><p>DRPs were individually identified and classified by two pharmacists, in seven categories: 1) unnecessary drug therapy: drug therapy is unnecessary because there is no clinical indication; 2) needs additional drug therapy: additional drug therapy is required to treat or prevent a medical condition; 3) ineffective drug: drug is not effective in producing the desired response; 4) dosage too low: dosage is too low to produce the desired response; 5) adverse drug reaction: drug causes an adverse reaction; 6) dosage too high: dosage results in undesirable effects; 7) noncompliance: the patient is not able or willing to take the drug regimen appropriately.<xref rid="b31-tcrm-10-631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> After identifying DRPs, the clinical pharmacists developed a pharmacist intervention plan comprising measures to be taken by the patient and medical team in upcoming appointments. The three main pharmacist goals were to resolve DRPs, prevent DRPs, and encourage the adoption of healthy habits (quality-of-life intervention).</p><p>Pharmacist interventions consisted of guiding patients, mainly with regard to adherence to the prescribed therapeutic regimen, and suggesting medication changes to physicians when needed. Pharmacist interventions were performed in case of problems with dosage, drug&#x02013;drug and drug&#x02013;food interactions, side effects, and adverse reactions. Verbal and written information about pharmaceutical interventions was provided to the patients and physicians.</p><p>A community pharmacy specializing in ARV treatment, also located at the University of Campinas, was responsible for providing the ARV treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to determine the extent of variation in data. Collected data were analyzed using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test to compare primary and secondary end points before and after interventions. For nonparametric data and because of the small sample size, DRP reduction, total pharmacist interventions, increase of CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and reduction in HIV viral load for the intervention group were analyzed by Spearman correlation test. A two-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 115 patients with HIV infection from Hospital Dia were screened between February 2009 and August 2010. Among them, 111 patients met the study inclusion criteria and were assigned to either the intervention group (n=57) or control group (n=54). Four patients could not be included in the study because of obesity (n=3) and being older than 60 (n=1). Consent was obtained from all patients participating in the study. During the study, 12 patients in the intervention group were excluded: six were transferred to another health care center, and six did not attend at least two pharmacist appointments. From the control group, nine patients were excluded: seven were transferred to another health care center, and two died. Thus, the final sample included 90 patients (n=45 for both groups). The average interval between visit one and visit two for both groups was 5.47&#x000b1;3.94 months, and the average duration of each visit was 1 hour.

This difference in CD4+ count was the most relevant between the study groups.

Aside from its limitations, the study contributes to the discussion of clinical care in both national and international health care scenarios. The study also shows the importance of an optimal pharmaceutical care plan and that the distribution of ARV treatments should be associated with educational initiatives. Further studies are encouraged to confirm the initiative of this program.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, the patients were allocated for control or intervention groups based on convenience sampling, which can lead to selection bias. Second, the pharmacists were not blinded, which may have influenced the DRP identification and quantification process. However, the pharmacists were not the same as those who interviewed the patients during their appointments, minimizing this influence. Third, it was not possible to quantify DRPs in the control group. Although the control group did not participate in pharmaceutical appointments, DRP quantification could have been obtained through medical chart revision. However, the medical charts were not complete and are not as useful for gathering accurate information as is a pharmaceutical appointment. Fourth, some relevant information that could contribute to the study was not obtained, such as pill count. Due to Hospital Dia characteristics and study requirements, all pharmacist appointments were performed by two pharmacists, which is unusual in pharmaceutical care services owing to financial issues. These research singularities were a result of study adaptations to the requirements of Hospital Dia. Finally, CD4+ counts and comorbidities were not identical in both study groups at inclusion. However, the difference between the groups regarding CD4+ count was not statistically significant.
