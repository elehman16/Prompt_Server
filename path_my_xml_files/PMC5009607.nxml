Using a variety of strategies, CHWs have been deployed to implement a range of health service activities and act as agents to foster social change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They are typically community members selected to perform functions related to basic preventive, curative, and promotional healthcare delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Most programs around the world rely upon CHWs who have minimal training and have no university-based degree training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In sub-Saharan African and other developing countries where CHWs are utilized, they receive brief technical training, usually focused on the provision of specialized packages, such as integrated packages (maternal and child health), focused package (antenatal care, newborn and family planning) and specific burden of diseases (Tuberculosis, malaria, HIV-AIDS, etc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Their orientation and training range from 5&#x000a0;days to 9&#x000a0;months for programs where CHWs serve as multi-purpose paramedics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Mounting evidence suggests that CHWs specializes on various health services have improved utilization of those services, for example the uptake of maternal and child health services by increasing community awareness about newborn care, prevention of communicable diseases and the use of rapid diagnostic tests to diagnose and treat malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several important programs involve CHWs in the management of childhood illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However there are voluntary and salaried CHW. The voluntary dedicate a limited time of about 2 to 4&#x000a0;h a week differently from salaried, who are full time on targeted intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The major factor limiting time devoted by voluntary and salaried CHWs to the community health works is poor remuneration, supervisions and supplies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A number of countries have either scaled up CHW programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] or seek to address the shortage of health workers by expanding CHW coverage and care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Tanzania is one of the countries aiming to increase coverage of health services provision and improve the continuum of care between the community and health facilities through the engagement of CHWs. This is pointed out in a document named Tanzania&#x02019;s Primary Health Care Improvement Policy of 2007 (known by its Swahili acronym, &#x0201c;MMAM&#x0201d;), which calls for the development of a paid official government cadre of CHWs and reinforced in the Health Sector Strategic Plan IV 2015&#x02013;2020. With development of policy guides, and presence of different types of CHW in Tanzania, the Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW), the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) and the Mailman School of Public health of the Columbia University (MSPH-CU), in collaboration with the Tanzania Training Centre for International Health (TTCIH) developed curriculum and trained a standard CHW for 9&#x000a0;month. The trained cadre of CHWs was called Community Health Agents (CHAs) which in Swahili is &#x0201c;<italic>Wawezeshaji wa Afya ya Jamii&#x0201d;</italic> (&#x0201c;<italic>WAJA</italic>&#x0201d;). <italic>WAJAs</italic> are working in three rural districts of Tanzania in randomized cluster trial intervention called Connect Project. The project aims to strengthen the health system by utilizing <italic>WAJAs</italic> whom they are connecting communities to the health system, with the aim of reducing maternal mortality and improving child health to achieve MDGs 4 and 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p><italic>WAJAs</italic> perform a number of activities including health education, health promotion, curative and non-health-related work activities such as documentation and preparation of routine reports. Understanding the proportion of time that <italic>WAJAs</italic> spend on each activity and implication for the amount of time devoted to direct patient care is a key in understanding and strengthening the implementation of the <italic>WAJA</italic> program. Previous study in Southern Tanzania had shown that a minority of facility health worker time is spent on direct patient care, in spite of its importance relative to other activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A study from Ethiopia found that health extension workers spent less time at community (37&#x000a0;%) compared to time spent at health post (51&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Another study from rural Ghana showed that community health officers and health extension workers spent only 12% of their time for direct patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There is a need of exploring the time spent by CHW at community as there evidence that even at rural setting the health worker spent less than 1&#x000a0;% of their time in preventive and outreach services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that purposely has to be shared and performed by CHW.</p><p>The present study focused on understanding how the <italic>WAJAs</italic> spend their time on all tasks, grouped into community health services activities, other work-related activities and personal activities. In addition, the study assessed the relative proportion of observed CHW activities on maternal and child health services, health education, health promotion and documentation to better understand how the functioning of the <italic>WAJA</italic> program reflects the project&#x02019;s focus on maternal and child health. This will point the time <italic>WAJAs</italic> spent at community in this project, and picture out what should be done during scaling up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area and setting</title><p>The study took place in the Rufiji, Ulanga and Kilombero districts of Tanzania. In 2012, the Ifakara Health Institute in partnership with Rufiji, Ulanga and Kilombero districts deployed 142 full-time <italic>WAJAs</italic>, paid an amount equivalent to $120 USD per month, through their districts and deployed to some of the villages of these districts. <italic>WAJAs</italic> were attached to the existing health system and received supportive supervision from the clinicians based at the nearest health facility located within the village or near village.

A total of 30 <italic>WAJAs</italic> were working in the 14 selected villages. Participation in the study was voluntarily and written consent was obtained from each participant before the onset of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measurement tool</title><p>To capture information about time allocation direct observation was used along with a multidimensional work classification tool (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) for sampling activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This tool facilitates data recording during observation and can facilitate recording of all task to the most detailed. A number of studies have been done using such tools to look at similar issues in developing countries. Woelk and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] looked at two urban clinics in Harare and Zimbabwe; Desai and McCaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] assessed time use among health workers at health facilities in Jamaica. In Ghana, Frimpong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] assessed Community Health Officers working at the village level in rural Ghana and in Zambia, Counihan and colleague [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] assessed community health workers who uses RDTs to diagnose malaria. Each of these studies used activity sampling techniques and concluded that facility-based health workers could exercise flexibility in the time they allocated to different tasks. However, none of these studies were on CHWs working full time and tasked with providing multiple services entirely at the household level.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Direct Observation Activity Classification Guide</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Code</th><th>Activity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td>1.

In overall, <italic>WAJAs</italic> spent 42.9&#x000a0;% of their time on health education and promotion while the direct patient care was devoted to only 12.3&#x000a0;% of the total working duration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>WAJA time use breakdown, 8.00&#x000a0;AM&#x02013;4.00&#x000a0;PM to each category of community 416 health service work</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2016_1718_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> presents the average distribution of time allocation for each hourly period of the standard working day.

From 8:00&#x000a0;AM to 9:00&#x000a0;AM, <italic>WAJAs</italic> spent an average of 60&#x000a0;% of their time providing health services. This increases to about 85&#x000a0;% between 9:00&#x000a0;AM and 11:00&#x000a0;AM, and then declines over the afternoon to less than 10&#x000a0;% by 4:00&#x000a0;PM. Personal activities like taking care of family and farming occurred mainly at the beginning of the day and after 2:00&#x000a0;PM.

The finding that <italic>WAJAs</italic> are engaged in work-related activities for only 59&#x000a0;% of their working hours may be partly attributed to the fact that <italic>WAJAs</italic> are a new cadre in the Tanzanian health system and therefore require extensive supportive supervision and follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to ensure productivity. Because <italic>WAJAs</italic> are new to these responsibilities, they are in need of an enabling environment and quality support from the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Typically, CHWs work in specific programs for an abbreviated period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] rather than as full-time, paid employees appeared to use few hours. Future implementation and scale-up of the <italic>WAJA</italic> program requires an understanding of the factors constraining the proportion of time that <italic>WAJA</italic> spend on community health services in the context of their full-time employment.</p><p>Findings showed that large portion of time been devoted is on promotion and preventive cases has also been observed by other study in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The communities are surrounded by a number of health issues that need daily clarification and reminds. These are issues like maternal education, under five health education and other health promotion of which CHWs invest more time on them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] compared to facility based staff even working in rural setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Our study found that traveling from one household to another appear to take a large portion of <italic>WAJA</italic> time similar to that of Odendaal in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and may be related to the dispersed settlement patterns of the study communities in which the <italic>WAJAs</italic> provide services at the doorstep level. Supervision appeared small as this cadre was designed to work independently in a community for the large part of the time. Similar study done in Ghana documented that, less frequently of supervision reduces the volume of care by health workers working alone even at health facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Supervision as one of human resource management component is important as it creates a chance for discussion on challenging areas when services delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study is based on a relatively small number of participants and estimates of their working time are subject to a number of definitions and boundaries. In this case, boundaries have been influenced by the working location and preset working hours from 8:00&#x000a0;AM to 4:00&#x000a0;PM. Our study was unable to address the fact that <italic>WAJAs</italic> sometimes work outside the normal range of working hours, and therefore did not measure their activities off-hours such as response to emergencies, emergency provision of first aid and advice.</p><p>Another limitation is the fact that the study took place within a 30-day period, and therefore seasonal variations could not be observed. This study was conducted just after the end of the harvest season in Rufiji district and during the harvest season in Kilombero and Ulanga districts. Patterns of illness and <italic>WAJAs</italic> responses were therefore only representative of this small portion of the year. <italic>WAJA</italic> activities during the observed harvest and post-harvest seasons may have important differences compared to the rainy seasons when cultivation is taking place, because at this time, community members often reside on farms far away from their permanent homes. Understanding variation in <italic>WAJA</italic> time use in response to seasonal factors is important in this setting where the majority of community members are subsistence farmers.</p><p>Finally, the direct observation methods employed by this study are limited, that is <italic>WAJAs</italic> may have modified their work routines in response to the presence of the research assistants observing their work. Rather than capturing a sampling of actual <italic>WAJA</italic> work routines, direct observation rather captures a sampling of <italic>WAJA</italic> work routines in the presence of a research assistant given the task of observing their work. While this method may not capture a completely accurate portrayal of <italic>WAJA</italic> work routines, direct observation is considered more reliable than <italic>WAJA</italic> self-reports of their time use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>WAJA</italic> are a new cadre playing a crucial role in linking communities to the health system. This study observed that <italic>WAJAs</italic> spent a large portion of their time as intended in health education and promotion. However, greater effort should be directed to strengthening supervisory systems and follow-up of challenges <italic>WAJAs</italic> facing in order to increase the proportion of working hours spent on provision of services to their clients each day. In addition, it will be important to identify factors that facilitate and or hinder <italic>WAJA</italic> activities seasonally, as they work in rural area where most clients are subsistence farmers who move to their farms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We sincerely thank the study participants (<italic>WAJA</italic>), and members of the Connect project, including Ruth Wilson, Awena Malendo, Dominick Mboya, Doroth Maganga and Samweli Likasi, for their cooperation during data collection.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The Connect Project is funded by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and Comic Relief.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>All principle results are within the manuscript in the form of figures.
