Around 75% of preterm birth follows spontaneous preterm labour, sometimes preceded by preterm premature membrane rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Babies born preterm are at increased risk of a variety of adverse short term (neonatal) and long term complications, including neurodevelopmental disability. Women with a previous preterm birth (especially those women who delivered before 34&#x02009;weeks following spontaneous preterm labour), women with a short cervix in early pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and women with a previous cone biopsy or laser loop excision to the cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] are at all at increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth.</p><p>Several large trials and meta-analyses have shown progesterone to be effective in preventing or delaying preterm birth in selected high risk women (short cervix or previous preterm birth) with singleton pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is data that both intramuscular 17 hydroxyprogesterone caproate and vaginal progesterone are effective in preventing preterm birth. OPPTIMUM likewise is investigating the efficacy of progesterone in women at elevated risk of preterm birth, but will crucially address longer term childhood developmental outcomes.</p><p>Although an improvement in short term neonatal outcomes has been shown in some trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] these have not consistently been confirmed in meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Data on longer term outcomes in singletons is limited to follow up of babies of women in the Meis trial, where 80% of babies were assessed by questionnaire at a mean age of four years. No differences in childhood outcomes were demonstrated, despite the progesterone group having a lower incidence of preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms of action of progesterone are somewhat uncertain although a direct inhibitory effect on the processes of parturition seem likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Additionally progesterone could exert anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and/or direct CNS protective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which could help to reduce the risk or severity of long term neonatal problems.</p><p>If the prevention of preterm birth is accompanied by a reduction in the complications of prematurity, then <italic>in utero</italic> progesterone should be predicted to have long term beneficial effects. Harmful long term effects are however also possible. Although direct teratogenic effects of progesterone are unlikely, there could be adverse effects of keeping the fetus in utero in a compromised intrauterine environment where infection or inflammation is present. Caution is therefore warranted before progesterone use becomes widespread, particularly since drugs (including antibiotics and estrogens) thought to be beneficial in women at risk of preterm birth have now been demonstrated to have long term adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The OPPTIMUM study is designed to determine whether progesterone prophylaxis to prevent preterm birth has long term neonatal or childhood benefit. Specifically it will study whether, in women at elevated risk of preterm labour, prophylactic vaginal natural progesterone, 200&#x02009;mg (compared to placebo), daily from 22 &#x02013; 24&#x02009;weeks up to 34&#x02009;weeks gestation, improves obstetric outcome by lengthening pregnancy thus reducing the incidence of preterm delivery (before 34&#x02009;weeks), improves neonatal outcome by reducing a composite of death and major morbidity and leads to improved childhood cognitive and neurosensory outcomes at two years of age.</p><p>The OPPTIMUM study began recruiting in January 2009. Since then, one large, and several other smaller studies have reported the effect of progesterone, either as vaginal progesterone or as intramuscular 17 hydroxyprogesteronecaproate. None fully addresses the crucial question regarding long term outcome (childhood development at 2&#x02009;years). Additionally, we note that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated that long term childhood outcome data are required to determine the clinical benefits and risks of 17 hydroxyprogesteronecaproate for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a previous preterm birth.<sub>.</sub><sup>a</sup> An FDA panel also recently ruled that data supplied on vaginal progesterone gel &#x0201c;do not [yet] support the efficacy of progesterone gel compared with placebo in reducing the risk of preterm births before 33 completed weeks of gestation among women with a short cervical length&#x0201d;.<sup>b</sup> We believe that OPPTIMUM will address these important evidence gaps about the efficacy of vaginal progesterone and any childhood effects of progestogens in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Aim(s)</title><p>The aim of the OPPTIMUM study is to determine whether, in women at high risk of preterm labour, prophylactic vaginal natural progesterone, 200&#x02009;mg daily from 22 &#x02013; 34&#x02009;weeks gestation, compared to placebo:</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Improves obstetric outcome by reducing the incidence of preterm delivery (before 34&#x02009;weeks gestation).</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Improves neonatal outcome by reducing a composite of death and major morbidity.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Leads to improved childhood cognitive and neurosensory outcomes at two years.</p></sec><sec><title>Centre(s)</title><p>More than 60 hospitals, principally in the UK.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Double blind randomized placebo controlled trial.

In the case of any events the Investigator should initiate the appropriate treatment according to their medical judgment. All adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) that occur after being randomized to treatment must be recorded in detail in the patient notes. SAEs occurring in mother or baby from the time a participant is randomised until 30&#x02009;days after stopping taking study treatment/placebo or until 28&#x02009;days after delivery (whichever is the later) should be reported to the co-sponsors using the trial documentation. The standard definition of a serious adverse event will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This is any event that: results in death; is life threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe); requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Hospitalisations for treatment planned prior to randomisation and hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition will not be considered as an SAE, nor, for the purposes of this study, will the following events: miscarriage, preterm labour / suspected preterm labour, premature rupture of membranes (PROM) / suspected PROM, preterm delivery, preterm delivery in maternal interest, preterm delivery in fetal interest, hospitalisation for pregnancy induced hypertension, hospitalisation for &#x0201c;maternal discomfort&#x0201d;, hospitalisation for &#x0201c;rest&#x0201d;, hospitalisation for &#x0201c;observation&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;monitoring&#x0201d; for which the women are admitted for a period of less than 12 hours; normal&#x0201d; childhood illnesses (including infectious diseases and minor injuries) and complications arising from prematurity.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis plan, including sample size and power calculations</title><p>At the commencement of the study in 2008, we planned to recruit 750 women in the &#x0201c;fFN positive&#x0201d; group. We estimated that such a sample size would provide 80 &#x02013; 95% power at the 5% level of significance for the primary obstetric outcome, 80% power for the neonatal outcome and 93% power for the childhood outcome (although further dilution of the latter was anticipated after incorporation of the deaths in a two stage statistical model &#x02013; see below).</p><p>In 2010, the study was expanded to allow randomisation of women in the &#x0201c;fFN negative&#x0201d; group after analysis of preliminary (blinded) data in July 2010, together with the result of an HTA funded systematic review on screening for preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] showed that our initial selection strategy erroneously missed women at medium to high risk of preterm birth. This change was endorsed by the Trial Steering committee, the MHRA, the ethics committee, and by the funder. The inclusion of women at a lower risk of the primary outcomes necessitated an increase in the sample size. The minimum new sample size is anticipated to be in the order of 1125 (375 fFN positive and 750 fFN negative women), but the proportions of each will dictate the exact sample size, as it is anticipated that at least 2 fFN negative women are required to achieve the event rate predicted in 1 fFN positive woman. Workings for the sample size calculation for the fFN positive group alone, and for the revised combined group of fFN positive and fFN negative women are shown in the Appendix.</p></sec><sec><title>Type of analysis (e.g. intention to treat) and statistical tests</title><p>All primary efficacy analyses are carried out on the intention to treat population (ITT).

Primary analyses are repeated in an exploratory manner on the per protocol population (including [i] compliance within an acceptable range and [ii] fulfilment of inclusion and exclusion criteria).</p><sec><title>Obstetric outcome</title><p>The primary obstetric outcome is delivery or fetal death before 34 completed weeks of gestation based on ultrasound (based on the projected date of delivery estimated from scan in the first trimester). The following null hypothesis will be tested: &#x02018;There is no difference in the incidence of delivery or fetal death before 34 completed weeks of gestation between the group treated with 200&#x02009;mg / day progesterone and the group treated with placebo from week 22&#x02013;24 to week 34 of gestation or earlier delivery&#x02019;.</p><p>The outcome is compared between the treatment groups using a logistic regression model including treatment and previous pregnancy of at least 14&#x02009;weeks. The hypothesis will be tested with a likelihood ratio test.</p></sec><sec><title>Neonatal outcome</title><p>The primary neonatal outcome is a binary outcome indicating whether one of the following has occurred:</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Death</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Brain injury (defined as any intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (excludes subependymal haemorrhages), parenchymal cystic or haemorrhagic lesion or persistent ventriculomegaly (VI &#x0003e;97th percentile)</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Severe chronic lung disease (defined as need for &#x02265;30% oxygen and/or positive pressure (positive pressure ventilation or nasal continuous positive airway pressure) at 36&#x02009;weeks post menstrual age or discharge, which ever comes first).</p><p>The following null hypothesis will be tested: &#x02018;There is no difference in the combined incidence of neonatal death, brain injury or severe chronic lung disease between the group treated with 200&#x02009;mg / day progesterone and the group treated with placebo from week 22&#x02013;24 to week 34 or earlier delivery&#x02019; This outcome is also compared between the treatment groups using a logistic regression model including treatment and previous pregnancy of at least 14&#x02009;weeks. The hypothesis will be tested with a likelihood ratio test.</p></sec><sec><title>Childhood outcome</title><p>The primary childhood outcome is the Bayley III score, a continuous measure. This outcome will, by definition, not be available on babies who have died. Thus deaths need to be incorporated into the analysis, since the number of deaths may be sufficiently large as not to be negligible, and/or there may be a difference in the number of deaths between the two randomised groups. We will therefore use a two-stage statistical model that jointly models the treatment effect in both deaths and survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], with deaths modelled using a binomial test and survivors modelled using a generalised linear model. The two parts are then combined to form the appropriate test statistic. Secondary analyses that adjust the estimated treatment effect for covariates felt to be of importance will be used as appropriate. Note that we will not be adjusting for gestational age in our analysis of childhood outcomes. The hypothesised mechanism of action of progesterone is to increase gestational age by reducing the proportion of women giving birth prematurely.

Many authorities, including the FDA<sup>a</sup> and the Royal College of Obstetricians in the UK<sup>c</sup> agree. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] suggests that women at risk of should be encouraged to enroll in trials of progesterone, although the SOGC also gives advice about the dose and formulation of progestogens for women who have opted to take them. Other authorities endorse the use of progesterone based on current literature. For example the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in guidelines published in 2008 and reaffirmed in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] is more positive about the use of progesterone, saying that &#x0201c;progesterone supplementation for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth should be offered to women with a singleton pregnancy and a prior spontaneous preterm [before 37&#x02009;weeks] birth&#x0201d; and that &#x0201c;progesterone supplementation for asymptomatic women with a very short cervical length (less than 15&#x02009;mm) may be considered&#x0201d;. In 2012, the Society of Maternal and Fetal Medicine Publications committee suggests that women with singleton pregnancies with prior preterm birth be given 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone, and that those with a short cervix &#x02264; 20&#x02009;mm be given vaginal progesterone (although they indicate that routine screening is &#x0201c;an object of debate&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The OPPTIMUM study will provide further evidence on the effectiveness of vaginal progesterone for the prevention of preterm delivery in selected high risk women.

All these power calculations allow for loss to follow up rates and compliance. Delivery &#x0003c;34&#x02009;weeks on placebo is expected to be 40% (data from an untreated high risk UK population with a positive fFN test at 22&#x02009;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and 27% on progesterone consistent with the odds ratio of 0.45 for the overall PTB with any progestational agent in the most recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. With 750 randomised, the study will have 95% power at a 5% level of significance to detect such a reduction from 40% to 27% using a two-sided binomial test. For a more modest reduction from 40% to 30% (odds ratio 0.64) the study would still have 80% power. For the neonatal outcome, the Meis study found 7.2% died, 14.6% had CLD and 5.2% had IVH on placebo, compared to 4.6% death, 8.6% CLD and 1.3% IVH on progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our neonatal primary outcome is a composite of these and also includes non-haemorrhagic brain injuries. With n&#x02009;=&#x02009;750 randomised, the OPPTIMUM study would have 80% power at a 5% level of significance to detect a difference in this composite outcome of death, brain damage, or chronic lung disease from 20 to 12%, using a binomial test.</p><p>The childhood developmental outcome at 2&#x02009;years will be assessed using the Bayley III Cognitive Scale which correlates well with later IQ. With 750 randomised, the study will have 93% power at a 5% level of significance to detect a difference in means equivalent to 0.25 of a standard deviations, using a two sample two sided <italic>t</italic>-test. Based on previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we estimate the standard deviation will be about 15 points, enabling us to detect a difference of 4 points in the Bayley Score. In clinical terms, a difference of 4 points is small, thus the power of the study to detect larger, more clinically significant differences, is high. We have powered this outcome at over 90% to make some allowance for a possible dilution of the power due to incorporating the deaths (using a two stage statistical model).</p></sec><sec><title>The revised sample size calculation below, based on blinded data (as of April 2011) and inclusion of the "fFN"- group is around 1250 participants</title><p><bold>Obstetric outcome</bold> (delivery &#x0003c;34&#x02009;weeks).</p><p>The table below gives the estimated power for three combinations of sample size (all 1:2 fFN+/fFN- groups, assuming 375:750 (total 1125), 400:800 (total 1200) and 425:850 (total 1275) assuming (fFN+, fFN-) event rates (delivery&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;34&#x02009;weeks) of (40%, 10%), (45%, 13%), and (45%, 15%). All calculations assume a relative treatment effect of 32.5%.</p><p>The justification for these combinations is as follows:</p><p>1. The 40% untreated rate is as per the original assumption. We have looked at the blinded (aggregated) event rate for the first 67 women randomised in OPPTIMUM (ignoring any possible bias created by recording the early births before later births in the most recently randomised). For the fFN&#x02009;+&#x02009;group, 29/67 (43%, 95% exact confidence interval 31% to 56%) had delivered at &#x0003c;34&#x02009;weeks. The blinded event rate according to the assumed 40% untreated rate with a 27% treated rate (32.5% relative reduction) would be 33.5%. Although the numbers are relatively small, there appears to be a higher event rate than anticipated, which would be consistent with having selected a higher risk and hence scarcer subset than we planned for). An overall blinded rate of 43% could comprise an untreated rate of 52% and a treated rate of 35%. We assume conservatively that the baseline event rate in the untreated fFN&#x02009;+&#x02009;group is 45%.</p><p>2. For the fFN- group women data on the first 24 women suggested that 8/24 (33%, exact 95% confidence interval 16% to 55%) had delivered early. As indicated above, this percentage is likely to be inflated since we record the early deliveries before observing the term deliveries. However, fortunately, we also had followed up those who were not randomised (by definition, all of whom had a negative fFN test) into OPPTIMUM from the start. Of the 398 followed, 32 have had a delivery &#x0003c;34&#x02009;weeks. We know that 57% of these 398 would have been eligible for the trial (short cervix&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25&#x02009;mm), and the epidemiology indicates that it is very unlikely to give birth &#x0003c;34&#x02009;weeks with none of the classic risk factors. So we conservatively estimate that around 13% (i.e. around 29/225, exact confidence interval 9% to 18%) of those recruited into the fFN- group, based on OPPTIMUM data, will have a delivery &#x0003c;34&#x02009;weeks.</p><p>The conclusion is that it seems likely that if we recruit at least 1125 (375:750) we will have almost 90% for the primary obstetric outcome, assuming a slightly higher rate in the fFN&#x02009;+&#x02009;group (45% rather than 40%) and a corresponding untreated event rate of 13% in the fFN- women. If as we expect from the early returns the fFN- event rate is &#x0003e;15%, we will be comfortably powered at the original 95% for the obstetric outcome.

In the original calculation we assumed that the difference in mean Bayley score would be 4 units with a common standard deviation of 15 units. It is more difficult to assess the power convincingly with a mixture of fFN&#x02009;+&#x02009;and fFN- women on a continuous outcome such as the Bayley Score, since the power calculation requires assumptions about not just the anticipated treatment effect but also the assumed variability via the standard deviation. If we assume the same 4 unit difference in the fFN&#x02009;+&#x02009;and a 4/3 unit difference in the fFN- group (consistent with the pro-rata rate of delivery &#x0003c;34&#x02009;weeks), with the same 15 unit standard deviation, then the study will have 71%, 73%, and 76% power if 1125, 1200, or 1275 are randomised (375:750, 400:800; and 425:850) as per Tables&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> above. However, this is for an unadjusted analysis, and in practice we will adjust for fFN&#x02009;+&#x02009;and fFN- group, and a limited number of other baseline covariates strongly related to Bayley Score at 2&#x02009;years (e.g. gender) as specified in the statistical analysis plan, and this will reduce the variability and hence increase the power. For example, if the underlying variability in the lower risk group is lower &#x02013; say halved, at 7.5 units, consistent with a higher proportion having uniformly high Bayley Scores since they have no disability &#x02013; then the approximate power would be 93%, 94%, and 95% respectively for 1125, 1200, or 1275 randomised in total. In practice the reduction in variability by adjusting for both this design variate (fFN&#x02009;+&#x02009;and fFN- ) and additional baseline covariates may be considerably greater, so we are confident that the original power on the childhood development outcome will be protected at or above the original 90% level by randomising at least 1125 subjects (375:750).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Endnotes</title><p><sup>a</sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm242234.htm">http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm242234.htm</ext-link></p><p><sup>b</sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57363066/fda-panel-votes-down-preterm-birth-gel/">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57363066/fda-panel-votes-down-preterm-birth-gel/</ext-link></p><p><sup>c</sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/guidelines/use-progesterone-prevent-preterm-delivery">http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/guidelines/use-progesterone-prevent-preterm-delivery</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>JEN has received research grants from (non commercial) funding agencies for pregnancy related conditions &#x02013; full list available on request, was a paid consultant to a small drug company (Preglem) with an interest in obstetric /gynaecological drugs -&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x000a3;5,000 2010 &#x02013; 2012, and an unpaid consultant to Hologic (who manufacture fibronectin amongst others).</p><p>ST has received research grants from commercial and non-commercial funding agencies for pregnancy-related research.
