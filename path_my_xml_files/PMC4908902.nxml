<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and increased risk of operative birth<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;10</xref> and of caesarean section.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Use of epidural analgesia and obstetric interventions, for example, vacuum extraction and caesarean section also have economic impacts on the health system.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Women who are anxious during labour may be at increased risk of use of epidural analgesia as pain relief due to several mechanisms; they often seek admission to the labour ward at an earlier phase of labour;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> anxiety and fear increase the risk of a longer active labour phase due to inhibited uterine contractility;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and anxious women perceive labour as more painful<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and therefore receive more pain relief.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Also, childbirth self-efficacy may play an important role in the risk of receiving pain relief. Women with higher levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability to cope with birth report lower levels of anxiety,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> perceive pain as less intensive,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and use less epidural analgesia during labour.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Childbirth self-efficacy may influence the timing of arrival to the labour ward, and it has been suggested that women with increased ability to cope with the early phase of labour will tend to arrive later at the labour ward.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The promotion of self-efficacy beliefs during pregnancy may reduce anxiety, and this could possibly be provided through antenatal education in small classes. Antenatal education in small groups may provide an environment with the possibility for women to hear other pregnant women's experiences and for being encouraged by the other participants and the group facilitator. By these means, antenatal education in small classes may increase the woman's trust in her ability to cope with early labour,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and thereby reduce the likelihood of early admission<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and decrease anxiety<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and experience of labour pain.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This may in turn reduce the use of pain relief and obstetric interventions.</p><p>Antenatal education in small classes may, in addition, increase the women's knowledge uptake due to the possibility of being actively involved in the learning process.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Few randomised trials have examined the effect of attending antenatal education in small groups compared with other forms of education on outcomes such as the use of pain relief or obstetric interventions,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and among these trials conclusions are conflicting.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Owing to the sparse evidence from randomised trials, research about the effects of antenatal education in small classes on birth-related outcomes is still needed.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> We, therefore, conducted a randomised trial to examine the effect of a general antenatal education programme in small classes versus standard education carried out as auditorium-based lectures. In this paper, we report the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome of the trial: use of epidural analgesia as well as the explorative outcomes: other types of pain relief and obstetric interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The NEWBORN trial is an individually randomised trial. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT01672437), and a detailed description is published in our design article<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and in our trial protocol.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>The NEWBORN trial took place at the largest birth site in Denmark, Hvidovre Hospital, situated in the Copenhagen Capital Region. More than 6500 deliveries take place at Hvidovre Hospital each year and the catchment area comprises a diverse population regarding sociodemographic characteristics.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Women were enrolled in the trial from 10+0 to 20+0 weeks of gestation. Inclusion criteria were expectant women, &#x02265;18&#x02005;years old at enrolment, singleton pregnancy, due to give birth at Hvidovre Hospital, and having the ability to speak and understand Danish. Exclusion criterion was not providing signed informed consent. Pregnant women were recruited from August 2012 to May 2014. The women received a written invitation to participate in the trial prior to their first visit to the midwife along with an informed consent form. Invitations were followed up by a phone call from a project employee. Initially, only primiparous women were eligible for participation, but due to slow recruitment also multiparous women were included &#x0223c;6&#x02005;months into the recruitment period in order to ensure adequate statistical power.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This change in the inclusion criteria was reported to ClinicalTrials.gov.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Baseline data were collected using a web-based questionnaire prior to randomisation. A project employee performed individual web-based randomisation at The Copenhagen Trial Unit according to a computer-generated allocation sequence of 1:1 with varying block sizes concealed to the investigators. The allocation was stratified for parity (primiparous or multiparous) and vulnerability (yes or no as defined by their general practitioner at the first pregnancy consultation in gestation week 6&#x02013;10). There were eight criteria listed for vulnerability, for example; former or current psychiatric disorder, adverse psychosocial background, or concerns about parenting skills. The general practitioner categorised the women as vulnerable if she met one or more of these criteria. For non-vulnerable women, the block sizes used for randomisation were 10 and 20, for vulnerable women the block sizes were 4 and 6. These block sizes were used for primiparous as well as multiparous women. All the citizens in Denmark have a unique personal identification (CPR) number and the randomisation programme was set up to confirm the existence of the CPR number.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention group</title><p>Women in the intervention group received an antenatal education programme&#x02014;the NEWBORN programme&#x02014;focused on parental resources important for the birth process and for parenting. In short, the programme aimed at strengthening relationships and improving information and problem-solving skills for expectant parents in order to ease birth and the transition to parenthood. The woman's partner was also invited to participate in the programme. The consulting midwife and the facilitating midwife encouraged participation of the partner. Throughout the programme, there was a focus on increasing self-efficacy in relation to the different topics touched upon, for example, childbirth self-efficacy. Also, the programme aimed at enhancing social network among the participants and highlighted the importance of partner support. The programme was designed based on the recommendations for antenatal care from the Danish Health Authority<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and developed using the Intervention Mapping approach.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A working group consisting of midwifes, health visitors, psychologists and family therapists delivered inputs for the form and content of the programme.</p><p>A detailed description of the programme has been presented elsewhere<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and can be found as online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material</xref>. Briefly, 110 groups of &#x0223c;6&#x02013;8 pregnant women and their partners met three times during pregnancy (gestation weeks 25, 33 and 35) for the duration of 2.5&#x02005;hours per session. The sessions included among other things information and discussions about emotions and expectations related to the birth process, including information on pain relief and obstetric interventions. Accordingly, each woman was exposed to small group education for 7.5&#x02005;hours during pregnancy.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010761.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2015-010761supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>The session in the 33rd week of gestation focused on pain relief and the birth process. The aim of this session was to provide the participants with information, and enhancing their existing knowledge and understanding of the normal course of labour, pain relief, and what might be expected if an obstetric intervention is necessary. For the topic on pain relief, the women were asked to discuss their thoughts and previous experiences with coping with pain and physical and mental strain, and to consider whether they could use any of these strategies during labour. Next, they discussed their thoughts and knowledge on various methods of pain relief. Plenary discussions and summing up thoughts and ideas were used so that participants could learn from and be inspired by one another. These methods were used to enhance the women's childbirth self-efficacy.</p><p>Also, the participants had access to a patient network website specifically developed for the NEWBORN trial to gain further information, communicate with other participants in the trial, and consult online with a midwife and a health visitor. At each session, the participants were encouraged by the instructors to use the website.</p><p>A total of 25 midwives with varying professional seniority and teaching experience facilitated the 110 classes. They enrolled for teaching themselves and were not specifically selected by the trial investigators. The instructors followed a detailed teaching manual developed for the trial.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>In the Copenhagen area, different kinds of birth and parent education offers are provided by private stakeholders. These offers include, for example, mindfulness training, physical exercise training and mental preparation for delivery. Participants in the intervention group were permitted to make use of concomitant birth and parent education.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Control group</title><p>Women in the control group received the standard education offered from Hvidovre Hospital consisting of two antenatal lectures of 2&#x02005;hours, each on birth and breast feeding in an auditorium with participation of up to 250 people. Accordingly, each woman was exposed to large group education for 4&#x02005;hours. The content of the lecture on birth included information on, for example, what to do at home when labour had begun; information on the location of labour ward at the hospital; phases of the labour and information on different types of pain relief. The form was passive information giving from a midwife to the participants in the lectures.</p><p>Midwives conducting the lectures volunteered for the teaching. To avoid contamination of conditions, midwives facilitating the group-based experimental programme were not allowed to teach the antenatal lectures in the control group.</p><p>In addition to participants in the intervention group, participants in the control group were permitted to make use of concomitant birth and parent education.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Blinding</title><p>It was not possible to blind participants or service providers. The outcome assessors; midwives, and physicians at the labour ward were not informed about the women's participation in the trial. Data were blinded by a data manager and the investigators were therefore blinded to participants' intervention category during data assessment and analyses. Participants' intervention category was not revealed to the investigators until the Steering Committee of the trial had drawn two conclusions about intervention effects on outcomes under code.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Variables</title><p>The primary outcome of the trial was the use of epidural analgesia during labour. The use of other types of pain relief and obstetric interventions was examined as explorative outcomes.</p><p>Data on the use of pain relief, obstetric interventions, and other variables related to the birth was assessed from the hospital-based register at Hvidovre Hospital, the Obstetric Database. All births performed at Hvidovre Hospital and two other birth sites in the Capital Region are included in this database and entries are made by CPR number. No information about birth was collected specifically for the NEWBORN trial. In a validation study, we found that the validity of information on epidural analgesia and selected obstetric interventions was high in the obstetric database when using the medical records as the gold standard.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The positive predictive values for epidural analgesia, vacuum extraction and emergency caesarean section were 1.00, and for elective caesarean section the positive predictive value was 0.96.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>The following variables were used for examination of baseline differences: <italic>Educational level</italic> was measured by the question: &#x02018;What is your highest completed education&#x02019;? The educational level was dichotomised into &#x02264;medium tertiary education versus higher tertiary education. <italic>Body mass index</italic> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated using the information on prepregnancy weight and height reported by the woman at the first pregnancy consultation at the general practitioner. <italic>Living with child's father</italic> was self-reported by ticking the response category &#x02018;Living with the child's father&#x02019; in the question: &#x02018;Which grown-ups do you live with&#x02019;? <italic>Planned pregnancy</italic> was self-reported by the question: &#x02018;Is this pregnancy planned, partly planned or not planned&#x02019; and dichotomised into: planned (yes or partly) versus not planned. <italic>Self-rated physical and mental health</italic> was measured by the items: &#x02018;How would you describe your physical/mental health status altogether&#x02019;? Response categories: &#x02018;Excellent, very good, good, poor, very poor&#x02019;. Self-rated physical/mental health was dichotomised into excellent/very good versus good, poor, very poor. <italic>Feeling of stress</italic> was measured by the item: &#x02018;Do you feel stressed&#x02019;? Response categories: &#x02018;no; yes, a little; yes, moderately; yes, a lot&#x02019;. Stress was dichotomised into no versus yes, a little; yes, moderately; yes, a lot. Antenatal depressive symptomatology was measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> posed in the baseline questionnaire. A score of 13 or more were categorised as antenatal depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>In order to give an indication of the quality of the delivery of the programme, we assessed adherence to the programme by tablet-based questionnaires. After each session, the participants were asked whether they had been through the topics of the day. For example, after session 2, the participants were asked: &#x02018;Have you heard about &#x0201c;coping with pain and pain relief&#x0201d; today&#x02019;. Participants could answer &#x02018;yes&#x02019;, &#x02018;no&#x02019;, or &#x02018;don't know&#x02019;.</p><p>Data on use of concomitant birth and parent education were collected by questionnaires at gestation week 37 and 9&#x02005;weeks after birth. We examined the prevalence of antenatal depressive symptomatology among participants as a potential adverse outcome. Participants in the intervention group could potentially have experienced more antenatal depressive symptoms, for example, due to a raised awareness on couple communication and potential relationship problems through the sessions. Antenatal depressive symptomatology was measured by the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> collected by questionnaire in gestation week 37. Although initially developed for measuring depressive symptoms in the postnatal period, the scale has been validated for use during pregnancy as well.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Women with a score of 13 or more were categorised with antenatal depressive symptomatology as recommended in a former Swedish study.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome of the trial, use of epidural analgesia. Previous data from trials<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and hospital registers<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> indicate that the proportion of women who use epidural analgesia is between 23% and 41%. We assumed that 31% in the control group would receive epidural analgesia and that this proportion could be reduced to 25% in the intervention group (a relative risk reduction of 19%). Our original sample size calculation was based on a power of 0.90 and a significance level of 0.05 requiring randomisation of 2350 women to detect significant intervention effects. However, due to slow recruitment power was reduced to 0.80 requiring randomisation of 1756 women.

Use of private birth and parent preparation offers were considerably higher among participants in the control group compared with participants in the intervention group, but also no participation in birth and parent preparation was more frequent in the control group than among participants in the intervention group. We examined the impact of the concomitant education by excluding women that participated in other education and found that this exclusion did not alter our results noticeably.</p><p>We hypothesised that the NEWBORN programme would increase childbirth self-efficacy and by this reduce the use of pain relief. We have examined the effect of the programme on the intermediate trial outcome; childbirth self-efficacy measured by three single items developed for the NEWBORN trial. In the intervention group, 4.1% of the women had low confidence in their own ability to cope with early phase of labour before going to the labour ward compared with 8.0% in the control group. Fewer women in the intervention group (5.0%) felt low confidence in their own ability to handle the birth process no matter how it turns out compared with the control group (7.4%).<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Hence, these results suggest that although the intervention had no effect on the epidural analgesia, the programme may have the potential to enhance the women's childbirth self-efficacy. Former studies have found that women with higher levels of self-efficacy perceive pain as less intensive<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and use less epidural analgesia during labour<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> compared with women with lower levels of self-efficacy. The potential associations between childbirth self-efficacy and experience of pain and use of epidural analgesia have not been investigated in the present study.</p><p>Only three randomised trials have examined the effect of attending antenatal education in small groups compared with other forms of education on outcomes, such as the use of pain relief or obstetric interventions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Two of these trials were performed among women screened positive for fear of childbirth limiting generalisation of results to the general population.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> One former Danish trial<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> examined the effect of antenatal education classes versus no education among 1193 primiparous women recruited among a diverse population group not limited to a high-risk population. This trial by Maimburg <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> is comparable to our NEWBORN trial regarding the included population, but they compared small classes versus no intervention. Maimburg <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported a statistically significant reduced use of epidural analgesia in their experimental group, but not of other types of pain relief and obstetric interventions. The two trials differ regarding the control intervention and we included primiparous and multiparous women, whereas Maimburg <italic>et al</italic> only included primiparous. Furthermore, we used 25 voluntary midwives with varying teaching experience, whereas in the trial by Maimburg <italic>et al</italic> classes were taught by four selected midwives. Also, the midwives in the Maimburg trial may have gained more teaching experience during the trial period compared with the midwives in the NEWBORN trial, as some of the midwives in our trial taught only a few classes.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This randomised trial is to our knowledge the largest trial assessing the effect of antenatal education in small classes versus auditorium-based lectures. The intervention was developed using a systematic framework for health promotion programme planners.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This systematic framework aids effective decision-making at each step in intervention planning, implementation and evaluation. We focused on conducting a trial using standard care as control condition and tested a birth and parent preparation programme that would be feasible to implement in an everyday clinical practice setting if proven effective. We chose a control condition that is relevant to public health; standard care instead of a different antenatal intervention, and the study population was recruited among a diverse population group and not limited to a high-risk population. The attrition was low (3%) and distributed evenly between the intervention and control groups.</p><p>It was not possible to blind participants or educators which may introduce bias. However, using an objective primary outcome, such as epidural analgesia, reduces the risk of bias due to lack of blinding.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The outcome assessors, midwives at the labour ward, were not informed about the women's participation in the trial but it cannot be ruled out that the women informed the midwife about their intervention status. However, we consider it unlikely that the decision to provide pain relief or perform obstetric interventions rely on the intervention status as such decisions are made by the midwives and physicians at the labour ward.</p><p>Initially, only primiparous women were eligible for inclusion in the trial. During the recruitment period, we allowed for inclusion of multiparous women. This was carried out for practical reasons to ensure adequate power in the analyses. Although this change was reported to the clinical trial register, the posterior inclusion of multiparous women must be considered a limitation.</p><p>Of the 8997 pregnant women invited to participate in the trial, only 19.6% were accepted and were randomised. Although we aimed to recruit a diverse population group to the NEWBORN trial, the participants were predominantly primiparous women and women with a higher education level compared to the general population of Copenhagen women in the same age group.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The high proportion of women with a university education in the trial population may imply that the women included in the trial find this teaching form more appealing than the general population. Moreover, the proportion receiving pain relief and obstetric interventions (except elective caesarean section) were higher among the trial population than among the total population of women giving birth at Hvidovre Hospital.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> These discrepancies between the trial population and background population characteristics may limit the generalisability of the trial results, and the intervention might have different effects among multiparous or women of a lower educational level. It may be beneficial to conduct research focusing on the effect of the programme among subgroups, for example, women with lower educational level or vulnerable women.
