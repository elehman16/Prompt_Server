Main inclusion criteria were an ischemic infarct &#x0003e;4 months prior to inclusion, and white matter hyperintensities on MRI. Primary endpoint was number of adverse events. We also explored changes in hand motor function for activities of daily living, motor and verbal learning, and finger tapping speed, over the course of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) were more frequent in the G-CSF group, but were generally graded mild or moderate and from the known side-effect spectrum of G-CSF. Leukocyte count rose after day 2 of G-CSF dosing, reached a maximum on day 8 (mean 42/nl), and returned to baseline 1 week after treatment cessation. No significant effect of treatment was detected for the primary efficacy endpoint, the test of hand motor function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results demonstrate the feasibility, safety and reasonable tolerability of subcutaneous G-CSF in chronic stroke patients.

Two thirds of stroke survivors suffer from residual neurological deficits and have to cope with chronic motor and language dysfunctions. So far, we have very limited effective therapies in spite of intensive research efforts and numerous clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0019767-Donnan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019767-Endres1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Basic science has improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying recovery of function following brain injury, and started to identify strategies to facilitate these mechanisms, an important one being intensive training <xref rid="pone.0019767-Taub1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, training-based interventions have so far provided only partial improvements. Limited improvement with training alone may be due to advanced age <xref rid="pone.0019767-Sawaki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and cerebral white matter lesions that lead to functional disconnection of white matter tracts in the brain <xref rid="pone.0019767-DelanoWood1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Both conditions are common in the stroke population <xref rid="pone.0019767-Basile1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Pharmacological agents seem to be attractive tools to facilitate the beneficial effects of training-based interventions on recovery <xref rid="pone.0019767-Floel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Substances only recently discussed in the context of stroke rehabilitation are neural growth factors like Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF, a glycoprotein known to promote differentiation in the granulocytic lineage, has long been used in the clinic to counteract neutropenia and mobilize hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow in stem cell transplantation <xref rid="pone.0019767-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. New data from cell culture studies and animal models of stroke have shown that G-CSF, systemically given, passes the intact blood-brain barrier and acts on neurons <xref rid="pone.0019767-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Importantly for the recovery phase, G-CSF not only counteracts cell death, but also exerts neuroprotective and neuroplasticity-enhancing properties, even when given at delayed time intervals <xref rid="pone.0019767-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0019767-Schabitz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, GCSF may have the potential to enhance neuroplasticity leading to functional recovery even at long intervals after stroke <xref rid="pone.0019767-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019767-Diederich1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Adverse events (AEs) related to low-dose application of G-CSF in non-oncological individuals generally are only mild to moderate, including bone pain, headache, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, insomnia, and redness at the injection site. However, rare cases of potentially life-threatening conditions like splenic rupture, acute lung injury, vascular events, and exacerbation of autoimmune conditions have been reported <xref rid="pone.0019767-Falanga1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The elevation of leukocytes, intrinsic to G-CSF treatment, may potentially lead to endothelial and blood coagulation activation causing a plugging of the microvasculature close to the infarction with an increased risk for thromboembolic events in stroke patients <xref rid="pone.0019767-Falanga1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. On the other hand, a decrease in platelet count might predispose to hemorrhagic events <xref rid="pone.0019767-Falanga1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, our main aim was therefore to assess the safety of G-CSF in a cohort of chronic stroke patients. Patients were chosen to reflect the stroke population with regard to age, concomitant diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and generalized atherosclerosis, as well as their cerebral disease sequelae, like white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We also explored the impact of G-CSF on hand motor function for activities of daily living, motor and verbal learning, and finger tapping speed, (secondary efficacy endpoints).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019767.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019767.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study, conducted according to ICH GCP guidelines and to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the local ethics committee of the University of M&#x000fc;nster and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Products, and subsequently registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00298597).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patient population</title><p>Fourty-one individuals (48&#x02013;85 years, mean 68&#x000b1;8; 13 women) gave written informed consent and participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized study.

The keypad was connected to a laboratory computer that recorded the frequency of tapping (dependent variable).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was derived from the AXIS I study <xref rid="pone.0019767-Schabitz2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and from similar studies using experimental treatments in chronic stroke patients <xref rid="pone.0019767-Berthier1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019767-Floel3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Primary endpoint was the total number of adverse events (AEs), as a function of group (unpaired t-test). Secondary safety endpoints were number of treatment-related adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs, laboratory parameters including leukocyte, erythrocyte, and platelet count, and vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate). Judgment of causality was conducted by an investigator of the trial (WRS). According to the study protocol, the following points were considered: 1) Known pharmacology of G-CSF; 2) Side effects described in the product information of G-CSF; 3) Side effects described in the literature; 4) Timely relation to treatment with G-CSF. The safety population consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41).</p><p>Additionally, secondary efficacy endpoints were explored, that is, the changes from Day 3 to mean of Day 17 and Day 38 for JTT and finger tapping speed, as well as success in verbal and motor learning during the second week of treatment, as a function of group. Here, the pre-defined primary efficacy endpoint was the JTT. The analyses were performed in the full analysis set according to guideline ICH E9 (FAS) population, which was defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication, had a baseline evaluation, and at least one evaluation after the start of the treatment (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;39). Last observations were carried forward in the endpoint analysis (LOCF). Analysis of covariance with adjustments for age, time since infarction, location, lesion size, and baseline value was performed for the efficacy variables. Significance for all tests was set at p&#x0003c;0.05. All data are expressed as means &#x000b1; SEM, unless stated otherwise.

Thus, 39 subjects remained for the efficacy analyses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019767-g001">Figure 1</xref>, flowchart of patient populations).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Safety analysis: Adverse events</title><p>All patients (n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41) received at least one dose of study medication. In general, the study medication was tolerated well. In three patients receiving verum the dose was halved at day 10 (2) or day 3 (1) due to leukocyte count &#x0003e;50/nl without clinical symptoms. In three patients medication was halted at day 9 (2) or day 8 (1) due to leukocyte count &#x0003e;70/nl without clinical symptoms. In two patients verum medication was stopped at day 3 or day 5 due to bronchitis and headache cum nausea, respectively. One patient received dosing every second day starting at day 4 due to development of bone pain that was manageable under this regimen.</p><p>Three patients in the G-CSF group (3/21) and one patient in the placebo group (1/20) suffered from serious AEs (SAEs), none of which was judged to be related to study medication. These SAEs were: Pons infarction, bronchitis, bone fracture, and infection with unclear source. The number of patients in each group with at least one AE was 17/21 in the G-CSF and 14/20 in the placebo group (Fisher's Exact Test, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.48). The total number of AEs was 58 for verum, and 37 for placebo (Chi Square Test p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.055). AEs in the G-CSF group were more often related to the treatment itself: 33/58 (59&#x00025;) events reported in the G-CSF group were classified as likely related to the treatment, versus 18/37 (49&#x00025;) in the placebo. This effect revealed a strong trend for more related events in the G-CSF group when comparing absolute numbers (Chi Square Test p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.054). All treatment-related events were rated in their severity as mild or moderate, and were within the known side effect profile of G-CSF treatment, most often headache (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9), fatigue (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9), malaise (n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6), back pain (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5), limb discomfort (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3), and abdominal pain (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1). Nausea (n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4), and sleep disorders (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7) were rated as not treatment-related; other side effects occurred with a frequency of&#x0003c;2. Most frequent side effects in the placebo group included headache (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7), fatigue (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8), and dizziness (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5).

Analysis of exploratory motor and cognitive measures did not detect significant effects of treatment in the pre-specified analyses.</p><p>So far, only data on two randomized controlled trials with G-CSF application in stroke patients are available <xref rid="pone.0019767-Shyu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A trial in acute stroke patients (AXIS) demonstrated the safety of a 3-day course of high-dose G-CSF, administered intravenously <xref rid="pone.0019767-Schabitz2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Incidence of thromboembolic events and distribution of AEs were similar between treatment groups, and no negative influence on the development of vessel occlusion or stenosis from baseline to end of treatment was noted. Thus, the concern about harmful effect on vessel walls raised previously <xref rid="pone.0019767-Matsubara1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> was not substantiated. Two previous pilot studies in acute and subacute stroke patients likewise suggested safety of G-CSF treatment <xref rid="pone.0019767-Shyu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019767-Sprigg1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Our study is the first randomized controlled trial that assessed the safety and feasibility of G-CSF in chronic stroke patients, over an extended administration period (10 days). Numbers of all AEs, and of likely related AEs, the primary endpoint aimed at safety, were more frequent in the G-CSF group although this difference failed formal significance. However, this is not unexpected given the known side effect spectrum of G-CSF, especially with the longer time frame of administration in comparison to the recent AXIS trial. Importantly, AEs with likely relationship to study medication were always rated as mild to moderate, and all involved well-known side effects from G-CSF. In two patients, likely related adverse events (bone pain and headache cum nausea) led to intermittent dosing or to discontinuation of study medication.</p><p>A rise in leukocytes is the main expected effect of G-CSF outside the central nervous system. Leukocytes reached an average maximum of 42/nl at day 8, and dropped back to baseline levels less than one week after end of treatment. Although no clinical data exist that ascribe harmful effects to an isolated, G-CSF-triggered rise in leukocytes, we halved dosing at leukocyte counts &#x0003e;50/nl, and halted dosing at values &#x0003e;70/nl.</p><p>Similar to the study in acute stroke (AXIS), the rise in leukocytes did not lead to an increase in thromboembolic events. It is reassuring that so far no clinical evidence suggests a G-CSF treatment-related adverse effect on the cerebral microvasculature assessed in almost hundred stroke patients <xref rid="pone.0019767-Schabitz2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019767-Shyu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019767-Matsubara1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This observation is backed by a recent animal study revealing no evidence for microvascular plugging or thrombembolic adverse events despite a significant rise of white blood cells in the peri-ischemic microcirculation <xref rid="pone.0019767-Sevimli1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Apart from the rise in leukocytes, a lowering in platelets was noted, which is a known side effect of G-CSF treatment also in other patient populations. Thrombocyte counts did rapidly recuperate to normal levels 7 days after end of G-CSF treatment. However, in future studies with chronic G-CSF treatment this parameter needs to be closely monitored, especially in patients receiving anticoagulation or platelet aggregation blockers.</p><p>In summary, the present study suggests safety and reasonable tolerability of G-CSF application over the course of 10 days, even in the vulnerable population of elderly stroke patients with concomitant diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and WMH, known to increase morbidity and mortality <xref rid="pone.0019767-Arsava1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This finding is in line with the data from 20 years of clinical oncological experience with G-CSF that has demonstrated an excellent clinical safety profile for the substance (see <xref rid="pone.0019767-Anderlini1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> for review).</p><p>However, it needs to be clarified if higher elevation of leukocyte count than 50 &#x02013; 70/nl can be tolerated in chronic application, and lowering of platelets needs to be closely monitored.</p><p>We have conducted a broad array of tests in view of demonstrating feasibility of such a trial approach, but also with the aim to explore possible efficacy signals. The tests explored did not show a meaningful difference between G-CSF and placebo, including the Jebsen-Taylor test (JTT), chosen as primary efficacy parameter.</p><p>Several reasons may be responsible for the failure to detect clearer signals of efficacy in our study. First, the current small study is certainly underpowered to show effects in a highly heterogeneous population as the one examined here. This is underlined by a retrospective power analysis: We had a 25&#x00025; chance of detecting a 25&#x00025; effect size in the main outcome parameter, change in JTT from day 3 to mean of day 17 and day 38 (population change&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6.1 points&#x000b1;3.6 SD), and an 8&#x00025; chance to detect an effect size of 10&#x00025;. A sample size of 176 is needed to detect a 25&#x00025; effect size with a power of 80&#x00025;. Second, we chose patients that had almost completely recovered from their initial deficits, and were therefore able to participate in the experimental tasks. However, some patients were more than a year away from their stroke, and larger effects of G-CSF may have been present if G-CSF had been given at an earlier stage <xref rid="pone.0019767-Minnerup1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Third, patients had to perform the task always with their dominant right hand, thus avoiding an interaction of intervention effect with handedness <xref rid="pone.0019767-Rosser1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019767-Baumer1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Fourth, with the primary focus to assess safety of G-CSF in chronic stroke, the study included patients with different lesion sizes (lacunar, small territorial) and sides (right and left) and different time intervals from the stroke event. These particulars of the study design might have contributed to diluting a possible beneficial effect of G-CSF on learning in the verbal or the motor domain, or motor function. Future studies on efficacy should therefore include a more homogeneous patient cohort, and be conducted at an earlier state after stroke. Note also that hand motor function had its &#x0201c;baseline assessment&#x0201d; on day 3 only, and motor and verbal learning were assessed during the second week of treatment, to detect differences in learning ability under G-CSF versus placebo. A significant difference between treatments may have emerged if baseline assessment of hand motor function had been conducted at day 0, or pre-treatment learning had been compared with learning during treatment for both G-CSF and placebo condition, a hypothesis that should be explored in future studies.</p><p>Concomitant white matter lesions might also have complicated benefit assessment in our population: Efficient communication in the human brain relies on the integrity of white matter tracts <xref rid="pone.0019767-JohansenBerg1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019767-Floel4" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and severity of WMH is negatively associated with rehabilitation succession in neurological disease <xref rid="pone.0019767-Guerini1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, possibly due to disconnection of cerebral circuits, reduced vascular density and cerebral blood flow, and impaired synaptic plasticity (see <xref rid="pone.0019767-Guerini1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> for review).</p><p>Apart from particular limitations of the study cohort and power issues, questions of dosing and timing are evident. Higher doses should be included in the next trial, as an increase of effect size seems to occur with dose in acute stroke patients (AXIS). Also, a longer time period or repeated dosing intervals may be needed to see sustained effects.</p><p>In summary, the present study is a further indication that G-CSF administration is safe and reasonably well-tolerated, even in elderly chronic stroke patients with concomitant vascular disease. It has to be kept in mind though that only a small number of patients (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21 in the G-CSF group) were examined. However, this safety analysis is the first step on the road to introducing a novel therapeutic approach to the clinical realm <xref rid="pone.0019767-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>Given the long-time experience with G-CSF in other indications, and the strong rationale for G-CSF as a recovery-enhancing drug it is now the time to initiate adequately powered trials examining the potential efficacy of this drug in improving functional outcome in the subacute or chronic stage after stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0019767.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
