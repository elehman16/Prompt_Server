Less frequent dispensing of ART and community-based ART-delivery models are potential strategies to reduce the load on overburdened healthcare facilities and reduce the barriers for patients to access treatment. However, no large-scale trials have been conducted investigating patient outcomes or evaluating the cost-effectiveness of extended ART-dispensing intervals within community ART-delivery models. This trial will assess the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of providing ART refills on a 3 vs. a 6-monthly basis within community ART-refill groups (CARGs) for stable patients in Zimbabwe.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this pragmatic, three-arm, parallel, unblinded, cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial, 30 clusters (healthcare facilities and associated CARGs) are allocated using stratified randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio to either (1) ART refills supplied 3-monthly from the health facility (control arm), (2) ART refills supplied 3-monthly within CARGs, or (3) ART refills supplied 6-monthly within CARGs. A CARG consists of 6&#x02013;12 stable patients who meet in the community to receive ART refills and who provide support to one another. Stable adult ART patients with a baseline viral load&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1000 copies/ml will be invited to participate (1920 participants per arm). The primary outcome is the proportion of participants alive and retained in care 12&#x000a0;months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes (measured at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months) are the proportions achieving virological suppression, average provider cost per participant, provider cost per participant retained, cost per participant retained with virological suppression, and average patient-level costs to access treatment. Qualitative research will assess the acceptability of extended ART-dispensing intervals within CARGs to both providers and patients, and indicators of potential facility-level decongestion due to the interventions will be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Cost-effective health system models that sustain high levels of patient retention are urgently needed to accommodate the large numbers of stable ART patients in sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) broadened its guidelines to recommend that all identified people living with HIV should initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART) as soon as possible after diagnosis, irrespective of clinical or immunological status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This policy is expected to reduce AIDS-related mortality, morbidity and new HIV infections. It does, however, substantially impact already overburdened health systems in sub-Saharan Africa which need to accommodate substantially increased numbers of ART patients at a time when resources for HIV are constrained globally and there is a severe shortage of professional health workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An important component of the current research agenda is the development of systems that improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery by reducing unnecessary burdens on the healthcare system and better serve the needs of the large numbers of people living with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">To realize the benefits of lifelong ART, high levels of adherence and retention are required. Barriers to adherence and retention include long waiting times at ART clinics, cost of travel to clinics, and life events that cause treatment interruptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Needing to frequently collect ART refills (every 1&#x02013;2 months) may lead to suboptimal adherence and disengagement from care due to the time and cost to patients of frequent clinic visits, particularly for those who have to travel long distances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Frequent clinic visits also place a high demand on the healthcare system due to the costs of providing personnel and infrastructure. Modeling has shown that reducing the frequency of clinic visits for stable patients is expected to be cost-effective in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clinics that are decongested of stable ART patients may also find place to increase the rate of new ART initiations and thus scale up ART coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Observational research in Zambia has shown that 2- and 3-monthly visit intervals were associated with decreased loss to follow-up (LTFU) and decreased visit lateness compared to patients who attended monthly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent systematic review found that reduced frequency of clinic visits and medication pick-up for ART patients may lead to improvements in program retention and patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As a result, the WHO has recommended that stable ART patients require less frequent medication pick-ups and clinic visits (3- to 6-monthly) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the available data is sparse and the quality of evidence is &#x0201c;very low to low due to bias&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A single, pilot cluster-randomized trial that included a comparison of clinic visit frequencies (maximum 3-monthly) for ART patients has been conducted in low-income settings, but included only 96 participants in the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. No larger-scale randomized trials have been conducted, and little cost data is available.</p><p id="Par23">In Zimbabwe, almost 1.5 million people require ART and the country initiated more than 9000 people on ART each month in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) has suggested that innovative strategies are required to achieve ART program goals without overwhelming the health system and to maintain a quality service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Community ART-refill groups (CARGs) are a novel strategy that has been introduced with the intent to reduce barriers to patients accessing regular treatment and to limit health facility congestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. CARGs are groups consisting of 6&#x02013;12 stable ART patients who meet at a community venue to receive ART refills, and who provide mutual support to each other. Retrospective observational studies of community groups receiving monthly ART refills have shown encouraging results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; however, no randomized trials have been conducted investigating prolonged ART-dispensing intervals within CARGs. Implementation research is needed to inform on the expected benefits of differentiated care models for stable ART patients in terms of their clinical and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three models of ART provision for stable ART patients in Zimbabwe, with medication pick-ups extended up to 6&#x000a0;months. The objectives are to measure patient retention, virological suppression, acceptability and provider and patient costs amongst stable patients who receive ART at 3- and 6-monthly intervals within CARGs. These groups will be compared to standard of care, facility-based, 3-monthly ART delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par25">This study is a pragmatic, three-arm, parallel, unblinded, cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial using stratified randomization with 24&#x000a0;months of participant follow-up. This trial is operational research based on the Zimbabwe Operational Service Delivery Manual for HIV prevention, care and treatment which outlines guidelines for differentiated service delivery for stable ART patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The study protocol was developed using the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Checklist (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and adheres to the SPIRIT recommendations. Each arm will consist of 10 clusters (health facilities) as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par26">Control arm: participants will receive ART at 3-month intervals provided at the facility (arm 3MF)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">Intervention arm 1: participants will receive ART at 3-month intervals provided in CARGs (arm 3MC)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">Intervention arm 2: participants will receive ART at 6-month intervals provided in CARGs (arm 6MC)</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outcomes and hypotheses</title><p id="Par29">The rationale for the control arm selection is that provision of ART refills 3-monthly at the facility is the most established standard of care option for stable ART patients in Zimbabwe. All outcomes will be compared between all three arms. The primary outcome is participant retention in care, defined as the proportion of participants remaining in care 12&#x000a0;months after enrollment by intention-to-treat. Retention in HIV care is one of the most important determinants of the overall impact of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Retention in care will also be compared after 24&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par30">The principal hypotheses are that participant retention in both the intervention arms will be non-inferior to retention in the control arm with a non-inferiority margin of&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;3.25% (risk difference). An additional hypothesis is that retention in intervention arm 6MC will be non-inferior to retention in intervention arm 3MC. The rationale for the non-inferiority design is that we anticipate retention to be at least similar in the intervention arms vs. control, and anticipate that provider (and participant-level) costs will be lower in the intervention arms vs. the control due to reduced participant contact with healthcare facilities in the intervention arms. If clinical outcomes in the intervention arms are at least non-inferior compared to the control arm, the interventions are anticipated to show cost savings compared to the control.</p><p id="Par31">The secondary outcomes are:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>I.</label><p id="Par32">The proportion of participants achieving virological suppression 12 and 24&#x000a0;months after study enrollment</p></list-item><list-item><label>II.</label><p id="Par33">The proportion of participants retained in the study model of care after 12 and 24&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><label>III.</label><p id="Par34">Average annual cost per participant from a provider perspective</p></list-item><list-item><label>IV.</label><p id="Par35">Average provider cost per participant retained, and average provider cost per participant retained with virological suppression 12 and 24&#x000a0;months after enrollment</p></list-item><list-item><label>V.</label><p id="Par36">Average annual participant-level expenditure to access treatment</p></list-item><list-item><label>VI.</label><p id="Par37"> Qualitative research to assess the acceptability of multimonth dispensing (MMD) of ART within CARGs from both a participant and healthcare provider perspective</p></list-item><list-item><label>VII.</label><p id="Par38"> Site-level indicators of potential facility-level decongestion during the study.

LTFU will be defined as no facility or ART collection for&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;days after the last missed scheduled ART collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. (Participants not arriving for the 12- or 24-month visit will be considered retained at these time points if collecting ART in person within 90&#x000a0;days of the scheduled appointment date). Participants with documented transfers to another clinic will be considered retained at the next immediate time point (12 or 24&#x000a0;months), and will then be censored. For the secondary outcome of retention in the study model of care, participants will be considered non-retained if transitioning off the study arm for any reason, including death, LTFU, change in ART-dispensing frequency, incident comorbidity requiring more frequent clinic visits, personal preference or withdrawal of consent to participate. Reasons for a change in ART-dispensing frequency include incident opportunistic infections, drug toxicity requiring closer monitoring, provider judgment based on change in clinical status or inadequate adherence, viral load&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1000 copies/ml, or pregnancy. Viral suppression will be defined as a viral load&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1000 copies/ml.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Description of interventions</title><p id="Par43">The study implementing partners employing the CARG model will align to the routine Zimbabwe CARG model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], with adaptations to allow for extended ART-dispensing intervals. CARGs consist of 6&#x02013;12 people, and CARG participants live in a similar geographic location and attend the same health facility. Participants at facilities in the 3MC and 6MC arms will be enrolled from newly formed CARGs (under 3&#x000a0;months) in which members have not had their first CARG-refill meeting. These CARG members will receive a viral-load test to ascertain stability and eligibility for the study. A CARG leader will be nominated, and the CARG will meet on at least a 3-monthly basis at a venue of their choice to access treatment. They may meet more regularly pending the group need for adherence support or to address psychosocial barriers to adherence. Stable study participants will have a clinical consultation and viral-load test at the facility at least annually after enrollment. Thus, after 12&#x000a0;months and 24&#x000a0;months, the entire CARG will be required to report to the facility on the same day. Each CARG member will collect their own ART supply on this day. For the 3MC arm, a single, alternating CARG representative will report to the facility after 3, 6, 9, then 15, 18 and 21&#x000a0;months to collect a 3-month supply of ART for all members of the CARG. This CARG representative will distribute the medicines to the other CARG members at the CARG meeting on the same or the following day. For the 6MC arm, a single CARG representative will report to the facility at 6&#x000a0;months and again after 18&#x000a0;months to collect a 6-month ART supply for all members of the CARG. Each CARG will be supplied with a back pack or small wheeled suitcase to carry medicines. Participants in the control arm (3MF) will receive their own supply of ART collected 3-monthly at the facility, and will receive annual clinical consultations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Setting and site selection</title><p id="Par44">The study facilities are public health facilities located in Chitungwiza municipality, Masvingo and Matebeleland South provinces and Mberengwa district. These areas are representative of high-HIV-burden districts prioritized for scale-up of HIV services with increased support from the US President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and health facilities in these areas have prioritized the implementation of CARGs. Chitungwiza municipality is an urban local authority situated about 25&#x000a0;km south of the capital city, Harare. Masvingo and Matebeleland South are predominantly rural provinces located in the south-eastern and south-western regions of Zimbabwe, respectively, while Mberengwa is a rural district in Midlands province.</p><p id="Par45">We selected 30 facilities from the study districts according to the following site selection criteria: (1) supply-chain procedures for implementation of MMD of ART at the site were deemed to be feasible by the facility managers and MOHCC, (2) implementation of CARGs were deemed to be feasible or had recently been implemented, (3) routine site-data collection systems were adequate and (4) at least 430 adults were receiving ART (to fulfill site sample-size requirements).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Cluster allocation</title><p id="Par46">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the cluster allocation schema. To produce balance in urban and rural facilities as well as hospitals and clinics between the arms, a restricted randomization using three strata has been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], i.e., urban facilities (six facilities); rural hospitals (12 facilities) and rural clinics (12 facilities).

The rationale for this study is to provide evidence regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of extended dispensing intervals for ART patients within CARGs, and whether these are suitable strategies that can be implemented on a larger scale to help overburdened health facilities with the large numbers of patients and reduce the burden and cost to patients of frequent clinic visits. Study results are expected to inform health policy both in Zimbabwe and in the entire sub-Saharan African region.</p><p id="Par73">The trial is implemented through a collaboration between Kheth&#x02019;Impilo AIDS Free Living, EQUIP Innovation for Health, the Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development, FHI 360, the Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention Project Trust and the Zimbabwe MOHCC. Implementation challenges include large distances between facilities, limited access to routine viral-load testing within the country and limited Internet connectivity in rural areas.</p><p id="Par74">The strengths of the study include that a variety of outcome data will be analyzed including clinical effectiveness data, provider- and patient-cost data, qualitative data and site-level impact data. Routine ART facilities from both urban and rural areas are included in a pragmatic design, which is expected to allow study results to be generalizable to other sub-Saharan African settings. The study limitations include that participants in the 3MF arm may not complete 24&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up in this arm as, according to MOHCC operational recommendations, they will be provided the option of forming CARGs after 12&#x000a0;months of study participation. The sample size in the 3MF arm may thus be reduced at the 24&#x000a0;months&#x02019; outcomes assessment, thus comparisons may have reduced power. However, this will not impact the primary outcome ascertainment of patient retention 12&#x000a0;months after enrollment. Participant viral-loads results may not be complete due to limitations in the availability of viral-load testing in the country. Viral suppression is thus a secondary outcome. It will also not be possible for participants or providers to be blinded as to the study group allocation.</p><p id="Par75">Vast scale-up of ART-delivery services are required for sub-Saharan Africa to reach the UNAIDS goals of 90% of people with diagnosed HIV infection receiving sustained ART and 90% of all people receiving ART having viral suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Efficient use of limited resources incorporating community-based service delivery models may be important components of this scale up. This will be the first trial to evaluate extended ART-dispensing intervals within a community-based ART distribution model, and seeks to provide high-quality evidence within programmatic settings of a high-HIV-prevalence region to inform policy regarding efficient health systems models to support the large numbers of people requiring ART.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par76">Protocol version 6.7, 16 July 2017.
