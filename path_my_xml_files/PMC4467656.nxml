The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients undergoing cataract surgery while listening to meditation music experience lower levels of blood pressure and heart rate.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p>Two hundred individuals undergoing cataract surgery participated in the study. Hundred individuals listened to meditation music, through headphones, before and during the operation (intervention group) and 100 individuals received standard care (control group). Patients stress coping skills were measured by the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC Scale). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were defined as outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the SOC Scale, both groups had similar stress coping skills (mean score: 127.6 for the intervention group and 127.3 for the control group). Before entering the operating room (OR) as well as during surgery the rise in systolic and diastolic pressures was significantly lower in the intervention group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Among patients receiving antihypertensive therapy, those in the intervention group presented a lower increase only in systolic pressure (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) at both time recordings. For those patients in the intervention group who did not receive antihypertensive treatment, lower systolic blood pressure at both time recordings was recorded (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) while lower diastolic pressure was observed only during entry to the OR (<italic>P</italic> = 0.021).

The hospital serves a population of one hundred thousand people from the city and surrounding villages.</p><p>The population study sample consisted of the first 200 individuals who underwent 1-day surgery for a cataract in the General Hospital of Livadia (Central Greece). Patients with chronic diseases such as decompensate diabetes, recent myocardial infarction, chronic renal failure, stroke, psychiatric but not psychological problems, and deafness were excluded from the sample. Hypertension was not within the exclusion criteria. Therefore, 76 people (48 in the intervention group and 28 in the control group) diagnosed with hypertension took medication (48 diuretics and 28 ACE inhibitors) as prescribed by their cardiologist. These two categories of hypertension therapy are the most common therapies for hypertension in Greece, based on the Hellenic and European Cardiology Association Guidelines. The patients with hypertension did not interrupt their pharmacological therapy on the day of the surgery.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to both the music group (intervention group) and the nonmusic group (control group), ie, the first person who came in for surgery was included in the intervention group, the second person in the control group, the third in the intervention group, the next one in the control group, and so on.

At that time, researchers informed them about the study, and if they agreed to participate, they signed a written form of consent. Patients were then interviewed using the Antonovsky&#x02019;s SOC questionnaire, which was filled in by the researcher because patients&#x02019; vision was limited. None of the people who were asked to participate in the study denied doing so.</p><p>On the day of the surgery and 20 minutes before the operation, all the patients in the study group agreed to put on headphones and listened to meditation music continuously, until the surgical procedure was completed. The music item was selected by the researchers because of its relaxing qualities. It was Peter Sterling&#x02019;s &#x0201c;The Angels Gift&#x0201d;, its duration was 25 minutes and the instruments used included the harp, the flute, the violin, and background vocals with orchestral strings and soft nature sounds. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before the surgery (15 minutes before initiation of the surgery while patients were lying down in their room), upon entering to the operating room (OR), and during the surgery (exactly before placing the intraocular lens). The usual duration of cataract surgery is about 15 minutes. Local anesthesia started 20 minutes before initiation of the surgery through the use of eye drops (tetracaine hydrochloride 0.5%), and all patients received oxygen therapy during anesthesia. During surgery, all patients received doses of sedatives (alfentanil and midazolam).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed by the Statistical program SPSS for Windows (version 16) statistical software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

In order to overcome the possibility of introducing systematic errors into the research, stratified analysis was performed and the data were analyzed separately for those patients receiving antihypertension medication and for those patients who did not receive any.</p><p>Stress management skills between the two groups did not differ significantly. The mean value of the SOC Scale measuring patients&#x02019; stress coping skills was 127.6 for the intervention and 127.3 for the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.105). Statistical analysis for SOC in stratified patients taking hypertension medication and participants not taking medication was not done, although this comparison would be particularly useful and should have been done.</p><p>As expected, the values of the blood pressure and heart rate in both groups were at their lowest before the surgery, increased upon entering the OR, and peaked during the operating procedure and exactly before the setting of the intraocular lens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-oed-7-2015-007">Table 1</xref>).

To our knowledge, this is the first study on the effects of meditation music on the blood pressure and heart rate of patients undergoing cataract surgery. Our intervention group&#x02019;s patients reported pleasant feelings and relaxing experiences.

It appears that meditation music helped in stabilizing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the music group while heart rate values remained at similar levels for both groups. Other clinical studies indicate that music can lower blood pressure and pulse rate, limit stress levels, and change stress hormone levels in blood.<xref rid="b32-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Many studies advocate the effect of music in preoperative stress reduction.

The distraction that music offers from the surgical procedure has been reported as a favorable effect of music, which becomes even more valuable when patients listen to music of their preference.<xref rid="b17-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This may offer them a sense of personal control and reminds them of a familiar home environment.<xref rid="b19-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>For patients taking antihypertension medication, those in the intervention group had lower increases in systolic blood pressure while diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not influenced by music.

This finding is supported by a study by Allen et al, who investigated the normalization of hypertensive response through music in ambulatory patients without an established resting blood pressure (&#x0003c;140/90 mmHg) who had ophthalmic surgery. The authors point out that both groups (music and nonmusic) presented increased blood pressure and heart rate in preoperative recordings; however, in intraoperative recordings, both parameters of the music group had returned to the baseline data. The authors concluded that stress experienced before an operation by elderly patients is related to a clinical hypertension response, which may be improved by offering the patient a music option to listen to, during the operation.<xref rid="b19-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, a recent review showed that music selected by the researcher is most effective in reducing anxiety through consistent tempo and dynamics, stable rhythms, and smooth melodic lines, as stated by evidence-based studies.<xref rid="b37-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>With regard to pulse rate, no statistical significance was observed between the two groups at any time during the assessment of our study. This statistical result led us to the conclusion that the parameter of heart rate was not influenced by preoperative stress. This finding is controversial to other researchers&#x02019; conclusions. A recent survey indicated lower heart rate and variability in patients who listened to music when the authors evaluated its efficacy in relieving patients&#x02019; anxiety before surgery.<xref rid="b38-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In a review, 43% of the studies examined, investigating the relationship between listening to music and heart rate values, illustrated patterns of decreased heart rates.<xref rid="b32-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Moreover, some researchers have indicated more significant changes in heart rates rather than blood pressure,<xref rid="b39-oed-7-2015-007" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> while in our study there was no change in heart rate.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This is one of the first research papers in Greece investigating the correlation between meditation music and patients undergoing cataract surgery, and this is the main contribution of this study. Patients seemed to enjoy listening to music and the whole process was easy to implement and without any cost.</p><p>Our study also has a number of limitations. The major limitation was that no cortisol and serological tests were applied to patients; these tests are the most reliable indicators of stress measurement, but were impossible to measure as the hospital did not have the required laboratory facilities. Moreover, psychological evaluations were done only with the assessment of SOC, a scale measuring stress coping skills, and its score was not correlated statistically between stratified patients who took antihypertensive medication and those who did not. Another limitation was the generalizability of our findings, which is limited by the relatively small sample size and the inclusion of patients having had only one type of surgery. Also, we did not take into account the fact that the control group was exposed to white noise during the experiment (the level of noise in the OR was not easily controlled), a fact that may have an effect on blood pressure variation. Additionally, the selected piece of music was determined by the researchers but not by the patients themselves. However, an interesting follow-up of this study would be having patients select the pieces of music and comparing the effects of the same variables. Also, the fact that the investigators were not blinded to the experimental conditions may, due to subtle biases, have influenced the effect. Of course, there may be other salient factors that may influence stress and may not have been considered in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications</title><p>These findings add to the many studies on the benefits of music during surgery and our findings could potentially form part of the foundation for the development of specific interventions for preoperative stress management. Health professionals may be educated appropriately in order to address stress reduction through music for their patients and train them accordingly. Music is a nonpharmacological intervention, without side effects, enjoyable and inexpensive for patients and health care services.

Meditation music may be promising for patients who experience preoperative stress and has the potential to reduce blood pressure. Further research is essential, however, to investigate the effects of music therapy to presurgical stress in other types of anesthesia and surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-oed-7-2015-007"><p><bold>ACADEMIC EDITOR:</bold> Joshua Cameron, Editor in Chief</p></fn><fn id="fn2-oed-7-2015-007"><p><bold>FUNDING:</bold> Authors disclose no funding sources.</p></fn><fn id="fn3-oed-7-2015-007"><p><bold>COMPETING INTERESTS:</bold> Authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn id="fn4-oed-7-2015-007"><p>Paper subject to independent expert blind peer review by minimum of two reviewers.
