Forty patients were assigned randomly into two groups (RAI alone and RAI plus lithium) with 20 patients in each group based on lot method. Subjects aged 18 yr or more, who choose RAI as the primary modality of treatment for patients with recent onset hyperthyroidism, those on antithyroid drugs and failed to respond to treatment and now choose radioablation as choice of treatment and those with mild or absent Graves&#x02019; ophthalmopathy were included. Subjects with moderate to severe and sight threatening Graves&#x02019; ophthalmopathy, prior treatment with RAI, prior thyroidectomy, contraindications to lithium therapy, pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study. The severity of ophthalmopathy is classified into mild, moderate to severe and sight-threatening based on European Group on Graves&#x02019; Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) recommendations. Patients with dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) and/or corneal breakdown were classified as sight-threatening Graves&#x02019; Orbitopathy (GO). Patients who have any one or more of the following: Lid retraction &#x02265;2 mm, moderate or severe soft tissue involvement, exophthalmos &#x02265;3 mm above normal for race and gender, inconstant, or constant diplopia were considered as moderate-to-severe GO. Patients who have only one or more of the following: minor lid retraction (&#x0003c; 2 mm), mild soft tissue involvement, exophthalmos &#x0003c; 3 mm above normal for race and gender, transient or no diplopia, and corneal exposure responsive to lubricants were considered as mild GO.</p><p>History and examination was done in all patients. Evaluation was done for thyroid function, thyroid sonography, blood counts, liver function tests, and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO-Abs). Total T3 (T T3), total T4 (T T4), and TSH were measured before giving RAI, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after giving RAI therapy. T T3, T T4, TSH and anti-TPO-abs were assayed by chemiluminescence (Roche, ELECSYS 2010, Hitachi high technology corporation, Tokyo, Japan) (Normal values: Serum T T3: 0.20-2.08 ng/ml, serum TT4: 4.5-12.0 &#x003bc;g/dl, serum TSH: 0.30-5.5 &#x003bc;IU/ml, antiTPO-abs: upto 34 IU/ml). We could not perform TRAb for confirmation of Graves&#x02019; Disease because of economic constrains. A baseline electrocardiography (ECG) was done for all patients and followed up with two dimensional Echo if necessary.</p><p>Thyroid sonography was performed at baseline and at the end of 1 year. All patients were followed for 1 year. Thyroid volume was measured by Ultrasonography (MyLab<sup>TM</sup> classC- Esaote, Italy) using a 7.5 MHz linear transducer and calculated by the ellipsoid model: Width &#x000d7; length &#x000d7; thickness &#x000d7; 0.52 for each lobe.</p><p>Patients were considered cured when they become stably euthyroid or develop permanent hypothyroidism. Stable euthyroidism was defined as serum T T3, T T4 within normal range and confirmed during the following 12 month period. Hypothyroidism was defined as increased TSH concentrations with or without low serum thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism was corrected by giving levothyroxine and the dose of levothyroxine was adjusted based on subsequent thyroid function tests. Patients with persistent hyperthyroidism were managed with carbimazole and followed up for 1 year after RAI therapy.</p><p>RAI therapy was the choice of therapy in all the 40 subjects, the indications being failure of antithyroid drugs in some patients and as primary modality of treatment for hyperthyroidism in others. Out of the 40 patients, 24 patients were toxic and were not treated with any antithyroid drugs, prior to the administration of RAI and remaining 16 patients who were using antithyroid drugs were asked to stop antithyroid drugs for 7 days prior to RAI. Thus all the patients were hyperthyroid prior to the start of RAI therapy. The type of radioactive isotope used for the management of hyperthyroidism in the present study was I<sup>131</sup>. The RAI therapy adopted by our institute is a fixed dose of 5 mCi. However radioactive decay of I<sup>131</sup> occurs during storage until it was administered to the patient. We measured the radioactivity of I<sup>131</sup> prior to the administration by radio active isotope dose calibrator. So, the dose administered to the patient was between 4.5-5mCi. RAI was procured from Bombay Atomic Research Centre (BARC) laboratories. Isolation precautions were followed after RAI therapy and patients were monitored for side effects of RAI therapy. The side effects of RAI monitored in our study were actinic thyroiditis, Sialoadenitis, Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dry mouth, taste changes, headache, worsening of ophthalmopathy. Lithium was administered in a dose of 900 mg per day in three divided doses for 6 days, starting on the day of RAI therapy. Monitored for side effects of lithium therapy, those were broadly categorised into Gastro-intestinal (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), Cardiovascular (cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension), Central Nervous system (tremor, giddiness, ataxia, nystagmus, confusion, slurred speech, hyper reflexia, muscle twitchings, drowsiness, delirium, coma, convulsions) and Renal system (nephrogenic, diabetes insipidus). Follow up was done at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months.

The RAI plus lithium had a cure rate of 90% while the RAI alone had a cure rate of 70% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.11). The small sample size in our study might have precluded statistical significance. Lithium can affect the kinetics of iodine by reducing its release from the thyroid gland and thus increase its retention in the gland.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Addition of lithium to RAI has been associated with an increase in the radiation dose delivered to the thyroid.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Whether this results in higher cure rate of hyperthyroidism is still a matter of argument. Conflicting results have been reported on this issue.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Fausto Bogazzi <italic>et al</italic>., in their study published in 1999 showed a cure rate of 72% in those treated with RAI alone and 83% in those treated with RAI and lithium, which was statistically significant.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In a recent study in 2010 involving a larger cohort, the same authors showed a higher cure rate with RAI plus lithium ((91%) vs RAI alone (85%).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Another study by same author published in 2002 showed higher cure rate in RAI plus lithium (G2, G3 groups) (92%) compared to RAI alone (G1 group) (67%).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a retrospective cohort study by N.M.Martin <italic>et al</italic>. showed a cure rate of 93.1% in RAI plus lithium versus 83.5% in RAI alone.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Thus present study was in agreement with earlier studies. Whereas, a study by Bal <italic>et al</italic>. from India showed a cure rate after the first dose of radioiodine in the control and lithium groups was similar (68.4% and 68.9% respectively).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Similarly a study by Brownie and Turner <italic>et al</italic>. showed that in patients with 35-55 g goitres, addition of lithium to RAI did not produce a higher cure rate after 3 years follow-up period.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The radioiodine dose used by Bogazzi <italic>et al</italic>. was 520-530 millibecquerel (mBq), by N.M. Martin <italic>et al</italic>. was 550-570 mBq, by Bal <italic>et al</italic>. was 230 mBq and our study used around 185 mBq. This suggests that the difference in the cure rate might also depend on the dose of radioiodine used.</p><p>Another important result of our study was that addition of lithium as adjuvant therapy to RAI allowed a prompter control of hyperthyroidism than RAI alone thus confirming results of previous studies. Mean time taken to cure was 4.69 months in RAI plus lithium and 7.12 months in RAI alone (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). RAI plus lithium group cured earlier than RAI alone which was statistically significant. Median time taken to reach cure was 60 days in RAI plus lithium and 90 days in RAI alone in a study by Fausto Bogazzi <italic>et al</italic>. The difference in the time taken to cure between our study and study by Bogazzi <italic>et al</italic>. could be because of high RAI dose used and longer duration of lithium (12 days) compared to our study (6 days). In an another study by N.M. Martin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that there was a significant reduction in the time to cure in the RAI plus lithium group (10.5 weeks) compared with RAI alone (12 weeks) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Prompt control of hyperthyroidism is important in some patients such as elderly or those with underlying cardiac problems like arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease etc., who need rapid cure.</p><p>The third important result of our study was goitre volume reduction. Goitre shrinkage occurred in both the groups significantly compared with baseline. However, the reduction of goitre volume was same in both the groups. So the addition of lithium did not have much effect on the reduction of goitre volume. This observation was in agreement with earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Mean serum T T3, T T4, did not differ in the two groups at baseline and there was a steep fall of T T4 and T T3 in RAI plus lithium within 4 months on follow up. So the addition of lithium to RAI in our study might have contributed for the steep fall in the levels of T T3 and T T4 levels at 4 months. This rapid control may be beneficial in patients with cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease and older people.</p><p>Five patients who had mild ophthalmopathy did not have worsening of ophthalmopathy during follow up. The combined treatment with RAI plus lithium might also be favorable for Graves&#x02019; ophthalmopathy, because of the lower risk of recurrence of hyperthyroidism, which is known to affect negatively the course of eye disease.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>There were no side effects either with RAI or lithium in the present study, thus proving the safety of RAI and lithium therapy in the management of hyperthyroidism.</p><p>The results of present study showed that the addition of lithium was beneficial for hyperthyroid patients treated with RAI. However, we did not measure I<sup>131</sup> radioactivity in the thyroid gland after radio ablation. So we could not confirm the radio retention effect of lithium. Finally, the lithium regimen used was cheap, safe, and may avoid further requirement of RAI therapy. The limitations of the study were small sample size and failure to measure serum lithium concentrations.</p><p>In conclusion RAI therapy combined with lithium showed a trend towards higher cure rate but does not reach statistical significance, probably requires larger sample to confirm. This study also suggests that a short course of lithium was safe and beneficial for patients treated with RAI, increasing the cure rate and shortening the cure time. The addition of lithium did not have much effect on the reduction of goitre volume. There were no side effects of lithium or RAI therapy in our study. Hence RAI therapy combined with lithium may be better option in the management of hyperthyroidism due to Graves&#x02019; disease than RAI alone. Our study used low dose of radioiodine and short course of lithium and showed similar results with earlier studies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENT</sc></title><p>I must express my profound gratitude to my teacher and guide Dr. K.A.V.
