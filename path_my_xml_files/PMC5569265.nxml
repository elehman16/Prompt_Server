Beginning in the mid-1930s, 3%&#x02013;8% of the body&#x02019;s skeletal muscle mass may be lost per decade, and this loss rate even accelerates after the age of 60.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This continuous decline in muscle mass is accompanied by impaired mobility and, consequently, decreased physical activity. Impaired mobility has a medical impact, such as increased risk for falls and fractures, increased morbidity, loss of independence, depression and other adverse consequences, and&#x000a0;is linked to the loss of quality of life. Interestingly enough, people do not link the loss of mobility to the loss of muscle mass and therefore do not take action for prevention. It is plausible that decreased physical mobility is caused by muscle atrophy and&#x000a0;indirectly by decreased joint stability due to sarcopenia in the joint-surrounding muscles. A loss of muscle strength therefore results in a decreased protection of the affected joints from physical stress and a higher risk of joint overload and concomitant disturbance of cartilage homeostasis. As cartilage homeostasis is influenced by ageing anyway,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> loss of muscular protection could have an additional negative effect on joint health, which could lead to an earlier overturn of balance. The complex process of age-related muscle loss is facilitated by multiple factors, including less activity, missing training and a suboptimal diet.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p><p>Although the mechanisms leading to age-related muscle loss are likely numerous, a disproportionate ratio of muscle protein breakdown compared with muscle protein synthesis is believed to have high relevance. There is evidence that an increased availability of protein or amino acids can shift the metabolism towards anabolism and particularly enhance muscle protein synthesis in young and older subjects.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine in particular, may be responsible for the amino-acid-induced stimulation of muscle protein synthesis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Leucine appears to play a key role in the regulation of muscle protein synthesis,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and most notable effects on amino&#x000a0;-acid metabolism in the skeletal muscle have been observed for leucine.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> One site for leucine action is a kinase in the insulin signalling cascade previously identified as the&#x000a0;mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which has a central role in the regulation of protein synthesis. Leucine also stimulates activation of a second initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor&#x000a0;4G through an mTOR-independent kinase.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Additionally, leucine seems to play a role in decreasing the protein degradation rate.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6 8</xref> Strength training and activity are very important in preventing age-related muscle loss due to its influence on muscle mass and protein synthesis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For initiation of muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy, a complementary, appropriate nutrition that is rich in protein, especially BCAAs, is also important to support training&#x000a0;effects and may positively influence the protein synthesis to protein degradation ratio.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The whole-body protein synthesis declines from birth to old age.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> High-protein meals have been shown not to enhance the myofibrillar synthesis<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> but amino acids alone to stimulate muscle protein anabolism in younger and older people<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref>. As skeletal muscle mass is responsive to changes in physical activity, reduced activity in older people participates to the complex progress of sarcopenia.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> If exercise, which positively influences protein homeostasis, is combined with an increased uptake of BCAAs, especially leucine, it&#x000a0;could be beneficial in maintaining muscle mass and muscle function and prevent sarcopenia.</p><p>Little and Phillips proposed three stimulants of protein synthesis: Leucine, Insulin and resistance training.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A combination of resistance exercise with dietary intake of leucine-enriched amino acids should therefore present the most effective strategy to promote a beneficial relation between protein synthesis and degradation. Due to the role of leucine in the protein synthesis pathway and the muscle degradation mechanism, the focus of interest lies in its influence on muscle building&#x000a0;and in its potential for&#x000a0;supporting regeneration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 12-week leucine-rich amino&#x000a0;acid supplementation in combination with moderate training in elderly participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a monocentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study. Prior to trial start, volunteers were informed in detail about the study and signed informed consent before they were screened for eligibility. The nutritional study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee of the Landes&#x000e4;erztekammer Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg, Germany and conducted in orientation to ICH-GCP&#x000a0;(International Council for Harmonisation&#x02019;s Guideline on Good Clinical Practice) and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. At the beginning and at the end of the 12-week supplementation phase, the volunteers performed an eccentric downhill-walking stress test. Directly before each stress test, immediately after (0&#x02009;hour) and 3, 24, 48 and 72&#x02009;hours after the stress test, strength, muscle soreness and biomarker were assessed each. After the first stress test, subjects were randomly assigned to either leucine or the placebo group combined with a special training regimen with Nintendo Wii (Wii Fit Plus and Balance Board). A&#x000a0;randomisation scheme was generated using RandList (Tuebingen, Germany). Study products were labelled with the appropriate subject number. Subjects received subject numbers in consecutive order. The study was performed double blindly.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Subjects</title><p>Sample size calculation was calculated by GPower V.3.1.2.

To&#x000a0;determine MVCs, a leg extension device was used (David Health Solution, Helsinki, Finland).&#x000a0;Each measurement was conducted two times, and the mean value was used. The strength measurement was accomplished by well-trained, strength-measurement-experienced staff and under standardised conditions. The subjects were instructed to gradually contract their muscle to a maximum force during a three-step command. The observer pushed the volunteer verbally until the strength measurement system did not show any augmentation. Usually, the contraction time takes about 4&#x02013;5&#x02009;s. With&#x000a0;regard to the older collective, no electromyostimulation was used to control for MVC due to ethical aspects.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Muscle soreness</title><p>Volunteers were asked to rate their global muscular pain (muscle soreness) on a 10&#x02009;cm visual analogue scale. Volunteers rated their muscle soreness before and at each time point after the stress test (0, 3, 24, 48 and 72&#x02009;hours).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Biomarkers</title><p>The test battery included blood sampling to&#x000a0;determine serum creatine kinase (CK) as a marker for muscle degradation&#x000a0;and C-propeptide of type II procollagen (CP2) and type II collagen collagenase cleavage neoepitope (C2C) to detect potential cartilage synthesis or degradation. All biomarkers were assessed at each point of time (pre stress test, 0, 3, 24, 48 and 72 hours after stress test). Aliquots of serum were taken after centrifugation (3000&#x000a0;g, 4&#x000b0;C, 10&#x02009;min) 30&#x02009;min after blood donation. All samples were analysed batchwise for each subject at the end of the study to avoid interassay variations. CK was determined in the routine laboratory (Synlab, Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany). To&#x000a0;determine CP2 and C2C, a competitive immune assay was used (Ibex Pharmaceutical, Montreal, Canada). The ratio of C2C and CP2 values of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1 indicates higher cartilage synthesis compared&#x000a0;with cartilage degradation. However, values of&#x000a0;&#x0003e;1 reflect predominance of cartilage degradation. The main focus of the study was to observe the influence of the intervention on muscle function and muscle degeneration. The observation of cartilage homeostasis was an incidental question. Therefore, a representative cartilage degradation and synthetis marker was measured. The&#x000a0;C2C/CP2 ratio gives a&#x000a0;good overview of the homeostasis, as it includes cartilage degradation and synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>To assess the safety of the study products, vital signs and blood samples for routine laboratory were determined at all visits. Additionally, adverse events and concomitant medication were documented.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistics</title><p>Analysis and statistics were done using GraphPad Prism V.5.0 (SPSS and Microsoft Excel). For strength assessment, different periods after the stress test were defined: 0&#x02013;3&#x02009;hours was defined as an&#x000a0;acute phase, and 24&#x02013;72&#x02009;hours was defined as a&#x000a0;regeneration phase. To quantify the acute effects before and after intervention, a delta of preintervention to 0&#x02009;hour and a delta of preintervention to 3&#x02009;hours was averaged for each group and visit. Out of these acute-strength reductions, a delta of postintervention to preintervention was calculated. The same was done for the regeneration phase time points. An&#x000a0;unpaired t-test (differences between groups) on individual parameters was used for statistical analysis if parameters were Gaussian distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test). A&#x000a0;Mann-Whitney U&#x000a0;test was used in case of non-normal distributions. The same analysis between groups was done for the&#x000a0;C2C/CP2 ratio. For changes within a&#x000a0;group, one-way repeated measures analyses of variance (rmANOVAs) were assessed. In the case of CK values, extreme outliers were observed. Therefore, data were log transformed prior to analysis. For CK and Visual Analogue Scale, area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and compared between groups using an&#x000a0;unpaired t-test or a&#x000a0;Mann-Whitney U&#x000a0;test, if appropriate. For the&#x000a0;C2C/CP2 ratio, the values were normalised to the pretreatment time point.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Strength assessment</title><p>Before, immediately after and 3, 24, 48 and 72&#x02009;hours after the&#x000a0;stress test, MVC of quadriceps femoris&#x000a0;muscle of the left leg was assessed to document muscular strength loss induced by downhill walking.

To investigate differences between groups, the acute phase and the regeneration phase were analysed separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">figure 8</xref>). In the acute phase, the reduction of C2C/CP2 ratio deflection was significantly increased (p=0.038) due to leucine compared with the placebo. In the regeneration phase, the difference between the&#x000a0;placebo and leucine was not significant but showed the same tendency.</p><fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Reduction of C2C/CP2 deflection after intervention (mean+95% CI).&#x000a0;C2C, type II collagen collagenase cleavage neoepitope; CP2, C propeptide of type II procollagen.&#x000a0;*p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjsem-2016-000156f08"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of a 12-week leucine-rich amino&#x000a0;acid supplementation in combination with moderate training in untrained, healthy elderly. The principal findings show that a leucine-rich amino&#x000a0;acid supplementation can counteract the negative effects of eccentric exercise. The treatment with leucine-rich amino&#x000a0;acids resulted in a reduction of exercise-induced strength loss during the acute phase of regeneration.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Effects of eccentric downhill-walking exercise</title><p>The currently used exercise protocol successfully induced muscle damage, shown by a significant strength reduction, appearance of muscle soreness, increase of CK levels and deflection of cartilage homeostasis (C2C/CP2 ratio). The&#x000a0;C2C/CP2 ratio represents the effects of downhill walking on cartilage homeostasis. This is of interest to clarify whether changes in strength loss after downhill walking could also influence the loading of joints. This supports the efficacy of loaded downhill walking as a model to induce muscle damage in an untrained, healthy collective of elderly. The model represents a realistic load&#x000a0;model close to the everyday life of healthy untrained elderly with normal mobility. The degree of muscle degeneration was comparably high. None of the assessed parameters returned to baseline after 72&#x02009;hours, which was previously observed in several studies but, in most cases, in a trained collective.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>In&#x000a0;addition to the induced muscle damage, downhill walking clearly disturbed cartilage homeostasis in a healthy collective without joint impairment. It can be hypothesised that due to muscular fatigue, the muscular protection of joints might have been reduced, and the mechanical impact of downhill walking could be directly transferred to the joint&#x000a0;complex. In a normal healthy situation, cartilage synthesis and degradation are in balance. If degradation processes are increased, for&#x000a0;example, due to high mechanical load, compensatory mechanisms are upregulating synthesis processes to retrieve homeostasis.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Interestingly, the load induced by downhill walking in the current study triggered the cartilage synthesis to a higher extent than the cartilage degradation. This is in line with the&#x000a0;literature for a healthy situation to achieve a&#x000a0;steady state.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x000a0;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The stress test used in this study seems to also be suitable to investigate changes of joint metabolism in a healthy situation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Training effects</title><p>In the current study, moderate training was either combined with a leucine-enriched amino&#x000a0;acid treatment or a placebo treatment. As expected, training effects could be documented in both intervention groups. As study products supporting muscle mass or muscle structure are supposed to be mostly beneficial in combination with training, it might be challenging to demonstrate the superiority of the product compared&#x000a0;with a placebo. In particular, in an untrained collective, training effects may overlay the supplement effects. The majority of parameters were clearly improved after intervention: muscle soreness after intervention was much lower in both groups, also reflected by decreased muscle degeneration (CK levels). It is worth mentioning that these clear training effects were achieved by training with only moderate intensity, three times a week for 30&#x02009;min, including aerobic, strength and balance training.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Supplement effects</title><p>The strength loss caused by muscular fatigue was less pronounced after 3 months of supplementation in the treatment group compared&#x000a0;with a&#x000a0;placebo. The reduction of strength loss was significant between groups for the acute phase within the first 3 hours after downhill walking. This means that acute strength loss induced by the stress protocol was lower after intervention in the treatment group compared with the placebo. It was hypothesised that a better muscular support could protect the joints against overload due to better active joint stability. To evaluate if reduced strength loss after exercise could also protect the joint complex, biomarkers for cartilage homeostasis were determined during the current study. During the current study, a significant lower acute deflection of the&#x000a0;C2C/CP2 ratio could be found in the treatment group compared with the placebo. The lower deflection of C2C/CP2 could be interpreted as a lower disturbance of joint homeostasis and a&#x000a0;reflection of a higher level of steady state.</p><p>Even if it is speculative, it can be assumed that as a consequence of reduced strength loss in the leucine group, the load of the joint&#x000a0;complex was reduced, which was supported by less disturbance of the&#x000a0;C2C/CP2 ratio.</p><p>Conversely, for muscle soreness and CK levels, no supplementation-specific effects could be observed. This is in conflict with previously published data, where BCAA supplementation including leucine showed effectiveness for muscle strength, muscle soreness and CK levels.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, in that study, the acute reactions were not measured. Furthermore, the collective consisted of resistance-trained young men, with resistance training twice a week. They proceeded with their normal training during the study without additional training. Therefore, it is likely that training effects were lower in the study of Howatson<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> compared with the untrained collective of the current study. Usually, in an untrained collective, even moderate basic training results in high training effects in the first weeks. Presumably, these training effects covered supplement effects for muscle soreness and CK in the presented study.</p><p>Strength loss after exercise seems to be less affected by the moderate training. A possible explanation might be the low training intensity of the performed training using the Nintendo Wii. In this case, a higher intensity can only be achieved by a higher repetition number but not with a higher training load. Therefore, the training effects in the current study were predominantly in the area of basic training and strength endurance.</p><p>However, functional impairment by eccentric downhill-walking exercise is better tolerated if moderate training is combined with a leucine-enriched amino&#x000a0;acid supplementation. Leucine is involved in protein synthesis by influencing the mTOR&#x000a0;pathway<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and&#x000a0;in decreased protein degradation.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The effectiveness of BCAA on the reduction of muscle damage has been shown previously.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The results presented here demonstrate the efficacy of leucine-rich amino&#x000a0;acid supplementation in untrained elderly. The combination with moderate training was sufficient to trigger muscle metabolism in such a way that muscle fatigue was less pronounced after eccentric exercise. In&#x000a0;addition, the reduction of strength loss may contribute to a better muscular protection of the loaded joint&#x000a0;complex. A supplement rich in leucine, combined with moderate training, seems to be a potential intervention in preventing joint overload and muscular fatigue due to eccentric exercise in an older collective. Further studies should clarify if such an intervention could be suitable to prevent from sarcopenia.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> We would like to thank all volunteers who&#x000a0;took part in this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CAR, CSchoen, NB, AS and WWA were responsible for study planning, study realisation, data analysis and reporting.
