                    was applied to a subpopulation of the STRATHE trial, a trial performed according
                    to a parallel group design, with a double-blind, random allocation to either a
                    fixed-dose combination strategy (perindopril/indapamide 2 mg/0.625 mg, with the
                    possibility to increase the dose to 3 mg/0.935 mg, and 4 mg/1.250 mg if needed,
                    n = 118), a sequential monotherapy approach (atenolol 50 mg, followed
                    by losartan 50 mg and amlodipine 5 mg if needed, n = 108), or a
                    stepped-care strategy (valsartan 40 mg, followed by valsartan 80 mg and
                    valsartan 80 mg+ hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg if needed, n
                    = 103). The aim was to lower blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg within
                    a 9-month period. The treatment could be adjusted after 3 and 6 months. Only
                    patients in whom the study protocol was strictly applied were included in this
                    analysis. At completion of the trial the total score averaged 13.1 &#x000b1;
                    70.5 (mean &#x000b1; SD) using the fixed-dose combination strategy, compared
                    with &#x02212;7.2 &#x000b1; 81.0 using the sequential monotherapy approach

                    conclusion, the use of a score system allows the comparison of antihypertensive
                    therapeutic strategies, taking into account at the same time efficacy and
                    tolerability. In the STRATHE trial the best results were observed with the
                    fixed-dose combination containing low doses of an angiotensin enzyme converting
                    inhibitor (perindopril) and a diuretic (indapamide).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antihypertensive therapy</kwd><kwd>tolerability</kwd><kwd>antihypertensive efficacy</kwd><kwd>fixed-dose combination</kwd><kwd>sequential monotherapy</kwd><kwd>stepped-care treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the last few decades numerous clinical trials have been performed in the field
                of hypertension. These trials were required for the development of new
                antihypertensive agents and to demonstrate their efficacy and tolerability in
                comparison with placebo or established blood-pressure-lowering agents.
                Pharmacological treatment of hypertension has been shown over the years to decrease
                significantly morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular and renal diseases
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Staessen et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Turnbull et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Williams 2005</xref>). Today it appears critical to achieve strict
                blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in order to provide maximum benefit
                from blood pressure lowering, and current guidelines recommend bringing blood
                pressure below 140/90 mmHg in every patient, and even below 130/80 mmHg if high
                blood pressure co-exists with diabetes mellitus and/or renal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Chobanian et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Mancia et al 2007</xref>). Different therapeutic strategies are
                available to reach these goal blood pressures, but increasing evidence indicates
                that the combination of two or more drugs is needed in most patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brunner et al 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dusing 2006</xref>). In terms of pharmacological treatment of
                hypertension, the ideal drug regimen should be effective, well tolerated, and easy
                to take every day, thereby facilitating long-term adherence. To what extent a given
                treatment fulfills these criteria remains, however, difficult to assess in clinical
                trials.</p><p>The present study was aimed to evaluate whether a score system integrating the
                evolution of efficacy and tolerability over time would enable a better
                characterization of advantages and disadvantages of antihypertensive drug regimens.
                To this end we created a score system and applied it to the STRATHE trial, a
                parallel group design trial which compared in double-blind fashion different
                therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Mourad et al
            2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The STRATHE study was performed in France by 193 community physicians in 533 patients
                with a mean sitting systolic blood pressure &#x02265;160 mmHg and/or a mean
                diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;95 mmHg after a 4-week single-blind placebo
                run-in. After randomization to a fixed low-dose combination (perindopril/indapamide,
                2 mg/0.625 mg, increased if required first to 3 mg/0.937 mg and later to 4 mg/1.25
                mg) (n = 180 ), sequential monotherapy (atenolol 50 mg, followed as
                needed first by losartan 50 mg, and then by amlodipine 5 mg) (n = 176 ),
                or stepped care (valsartan 40 mg, increased if necessary first to valsartan 80 mg,
                with the possibility to combine then valsartan 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5
                mg (n = 177) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Mourad et al 2004</xref>).
                In each study arm the aim was to lower blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. To this
                end, the treatment could be adjusted as described above after 3 and 6 months of
                therapy. The final visit was planned after 9 months of treatment, or at 6 months if
                target blood pressure was achieved. Upgrading to a superior level was recommended
                when systolic blood pressure was &#x02265;140 and &#x02264;160 mmHg and/or
                diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;90 mmHg, and &#x02264;95 mmHg, but was
                mandatory when systolic pressure was &#x0003e;160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood
                pressure &#x0003c;95 mmHg. There was, however, still the possibility, regardless
                of the blood pressure achieved, to maintain the previous level if the investigators
                were concerned about treatment upgrading, for safety reasons. Blood pressure was
                measured in the sitting position using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Three readings
                were obtained at each visit, with at least a 1-min interval between each reading,
                and were then averaged. All study tablets were encapsulated to conceal their
                identity and had to be taken once a day in the morning.</p><p>The present analysis included patients having still their blood pressure (BP) in whom
                the study protocol was strictly applied, which means that the treatment was modified
                according to the randomized therapeutic strategies each time blood pressure was
                still &#x02265;140/90 mmHg (fixed low-dose combination, n = 118;
                sequential monotherapy, n = 108 ; stepped-care approach, n =
                103). A score system was created to assess the advantages and the disadvantages of
                the treatment approaches. The number of points was attributed in order to give equal
                importance to efficacy and tolerability in comparing the different therapeutic
                strategies as follows:</p><p>

                tolerability of new antihypertensive agents. This has been done, for instance,
                during the developmental phase of the fixed low-dose combination containing the
                angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Laurent 2001</xref>). In addition morbidity and
                mortality trials should be performed whenever possible to define the most
                appropriated indications of each class of antihypertensive drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Williams 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Zanchetti 2005</xref>). During recent years the importance of bringing blood
                pressure below 140 mmHg for systolic and 90 mmHg for diastolic has been emphasized
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Chobanian et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Mancia et al 2007</xref>). To achieve these target
                blood pressures the co-administration of two drugs is often required, accounting for
                the growing interest for fixed-dose combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brunner et al 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dusing 2006</xref>).
                The advantage of combining drugs acting by different mechanisms in a single pill is
                to enhance the antihypertensive efficacy, but not at the expense of reduced
                tolerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Law et al 2003</xref>), and to
                facilitate long-term persistence on treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Van
                    Wijk et al 2005</xref>). There is therefore a strong rationale for the use of
                fixed-dose combinations not only as second-line, but also as first-line therapy
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Elliott 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Welsh and Ferro 2004</xref>), and this view has been supported by
                international experts in hypertension guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Chobanian et al 2003</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Mancia et al
                2007</xref>).</p><p>Beyond combination therapy as first step, the traditional strategies for treating
                hypertension with drugs comprise the stepped-care approach (monotherapy as initial
                treatment, followed if needed by a dose titration or the addition of a second drug)
                and the sequential monotherapy approach (rotation through several monotherapies from
                different classes until blood pressure control is reached) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brunner et al 1990</xref>). The design of the STRATHE trial is original
                as it enabled, under controlled conditions, a direct comparison of different
                therapeutic strategies in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Mourad
                    et al 2004</xref>). A first-line management of essential hypertensive patients
                based on a low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide normalized blood
                pressure (&#x0003c;140/90 mmHg) in significantly more patients (62%) than a
                sequential mono-therapy strategy involving atenolol, losartan, and amlodipine (49%),
                and a stepped-care strategy involving valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (47%),
                without difference, however, between the three groups with regard to the
                tolerability profile. The blood pressure normalization rate observed in the subset
                of patients of the STRATHE trial included in the present analysis is even better
                (72.9% in the fixed low-dose combination group, 59.3% in the sequential monotherapy
                group, and 52.4% in the stepped-care group). These patients were selected as their
                treatment was modified according to the study protocol at each visit if their blood
                pressure was still &#x02265;140/90 mmHg, indicating that it is important to
                adjust antihypertensive treatment if blood pressure remains uncontrolled.</p><p>The choice of the most appropriate strategy to treat hypertensive patients is still
                difficult. To be considered are efficacy or tolerability criteria, as well as the
                presence of target organ damage or associated cardiovascular/renal disorders. Some
                drug regimens may require fewer adjustments than others at initiation of treatment,
                an advantage derived from a better antihypertensive efficacy combined with a
                preserved tolerability. The turbulence resulting from treatment adjustments might
                have important implications. In addition to a negative economic impact, frequent
                drug switches might lead patients to become non-compliant, or even to stop the
                treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hughes and McGuire 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Dusing 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Urquhart 2001</xref>). Notably, prompt blood pressure control now appears
                desirable in order to benefit maximally from the blood pressure lowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Julius et al 2004</xref>). Admittedly, the current way
                to analyze results of clinical trials in the field of hypertension does not enable
                assessment of how difficult or easy it is to normalize blood pressure in the
                individual patient. This prompted us to test whether a score system integrating the
                evolution of efficacy and tolerability over time would facilitate the weighing of
                advantages and disadvantages of different therapeutic strategies, and therefore
                render comparison between them more meaningful. For this purpose we used the
                observations obtained in the STRATHE trial. A better score was seen in the patients
                allocated to the fixed low-dose combination compared with the two other options.
                Notably, the number of points given to efficacy and tolerability criteria could be
                attributed differently in other clinical trials, depending, on the relative
                importance one wants to give to the various criteria to be taken into account.</p><p>In summary, it is possible to analyze the results of trials aimed to compare
                different treatment strategies in the field of hypertension using a score system.
                This approach gives an integrative view on the evolution of efficacy and
                tolerability, and reflects how difficult or easy it is to normalize blood pressure.
                Further studies are, however, needed to test prospectively whether this type of
                analysis is more informative than an analysis based on efficacy and tolerability
                criteria considered separately.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brunner</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Menard</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Waeber</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Treating the individual hypertensive patient: considerations on
