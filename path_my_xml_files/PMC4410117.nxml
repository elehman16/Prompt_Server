Currently, these patients are electively admitted to hospital for initiation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), but it is unknown whether outpatient initiation is as effective as inpatient set-up. We hypothesise that outpatient set-up using an autotitrating NIV device will be more cost-effective than a nurse-led inpatient titration and set-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We will undertake a multinational, multicentre randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to receive the usual inpatient set-up, which will include nurse-led initiation of NIV or outpatient set-up with an automated NIV device. They will be stratified according to the trial site, gender and previous use of NIV or continuous positive airway pressure. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, a total sample of 82 patients will be required. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated using standard treatment costs and health service utilisation as well as health-related quality of life measures (severe respiratory insufficiency (SRI) and EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D)). A change in the SRI questionnaire will be based on the analysis of covariance adjusting for the baseline measurements between the two arms of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the Westminster National Research Ethics Committee (11/LO/0414) and is the trial registered on the UKCRN portfolio.

Financial constraints are driving a clinical practice that is lacking satisfactory evidence. Despite the outpatient approach potentially having financial benefits, these must be balanced against the loss in optimisation of NIV set-up, which could negatively impact on treatment effectiveness. Only one study has compared outpatient and inpatient NIV initiation with similar outcomes observed in both groups.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, this study was performed in a small group of patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disease, and the relevance to the obese group remains uncertain. Such obese patients with chronic respiratory failure will often require much higher inspiratory and expiratory delivered ventilator pressures, which necessitate inpatient titration to gain adequate control of the sleep-disordered breathing. This current trial will investigate the medium-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of outpatient NIV set-up, using an automated titrating device, against standard inpatient nurse-led protocolised initiation with a standard fixed level device.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Primary research objective</title><p>To evaluate the medium-term cost-effectiveness of outpatient NIV set-up with an automated device compared with inpatient nurse-led protocolised fixed level NIV set-up in obese patients with chronic respiratory failure at 3&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Secondary research objectives</title><p>To evaluate the health-related quality of life improvements between outpatient NIV set-up and inpatient set-up at 3&#x02005;months.</p><p>To evaluate the gas exchange improvements between outpatient NIV set-up and inpatient set-up at 3&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study design</title><p>A 1:1 randomised controlled trial design with stratification (gender, previous continuous positive airway pressure or NIV use and recruiting centre) will be employed in order to test the hypothesis that outpatient NIV set-up in obese patients with chronic respiratory failure is more cost-effective in the medium term than inpatient nurse-led protocolised fixed level set-up at 3&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Patient entry</title><p>Obese patients with chronic respiratory failure will be recruited from participating specialist HMV centres.

In an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) study, a sample size of 37 from the intervention group and 37 from the control group achieves 90% power with a 5% significance level to detect differences among the means at 3&#x02005;month follow-up using an F test. The correlation in SRI between baseline and follow-up was assumed to be 0.72, and the size of the variation in the means was represented by their SD estimated from the pilot study.

For each of the variables analysed, univariate descriptive statistics provide an overall picture of the data. Continuous variables will be presented as the median and IQR, unless otherwise stated. For categorical variables, frequency counts and percentages will be presented as summary statistics for the subgroups of interest. Univariate analyses will be performed to compare study groups using appropriate statistical tests according to the type and the distribution of the data: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher's exact test for categorical data and independent t test or Mann-Whitney for continuous variables. Change in SRI will be based on ANCOVA adjusting for the baseline measurements between the two arms of patients. Cost utility analysis will be evaluated using standard treatment costs and health service utilisation (hospital admissions, bed days, nurse interaction time, doctor interaction time, telephone consultations, outpatient consultations, visit frequency to general practitioner) and using both health-related quality of life EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) and SRI. A secondary analysis based on ANCOVA models will also be constructed to isolate the effect of the intervention on each arm after adjusting for any significantly different baseline characteristics between groups. Similar analysis will be used for other secondary outcomes (spirometry, gas exchange, exercise capacity, body composition, physical activity, breathlessness, somnolence, anxiety and depression). Differences will be considered at the 5% significance level.</p></sec><sec id="s4e1d"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>Cost-effectiveness will be investigated by estimating the healthcare costs and quality of life gains of the two treatment options; the differences between each of these; and the incremental cost per unit of quality of life gained. Cost data will be obtained by collecting data on resource use for the two options and converting these to a common monetary base using either locally obtained unit cost data or nationally representative data from sources such as the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) costs of care and English reference costs. Quality of life data will be obtained by collecting EQ-5D data, which will be converted to utility scores using standard EQ-5D value sets. These will in turn be converted into quality adjusted h year (QALY) estimates using survival data. This will enable the estimate of a cost per unit of clinical effectiveness gained and also a cost per QALY gained. These data will be collected by each country, and cost-effectiveness calculated for each country.</p><p>In undertaking statistical analysis of cost and quality of life data, it will be necessary to take into account the fact that there is considerable uncertainty about the distributions of such data. As a result, it will be necessary to approach this with bootstrapping analysis. Moreover, the main method by which the cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted is by constructing an economic appraisal model to account for the uncertainty inherent in the data and the cost-effectiveness estimates. This will include extensive sensitivity analysis.

If the treatment demonstrates parity in terms of clinical effectiveness, as predicted, and enhanced cost-effectiveness over standard inpatient set-up, this will change the current clinical approach to the management of these patients. Indeed, outpatient set-up will be expected to reduce healthcare utilisation costs providing cost savings to healthcare providers. Furthermore, the expectation is that, at the least, this approach will have an equal impact on improving health-related quality of life such that there will be an associated enhancement in cost-effectiveness. A change in the clinical pathway away from inpatient management of these stable obese patients with chronic respiratory failure will increase effectiveness in clinical management by optimising inpatient bed capacity in the local and regional respiratory centres. This will allow inpatient facilities to be better utilised for the care of more acute and complex patients with chronic respiratory failure. Finally, a positive primary outcome for this trial will allow not only the development of a simplified clinical approach, but also will provide the clinical data to support local outpatient set-up as well as avoiding unnecessary expansion of inpatient facilities and the purchase of expensive inpatient respiratory monitoring equipment increasing the potential cost savings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SM, GA, PM, MWE, JPJ, JLP, JFM, AC, MP, DP, AD and NH were involved in development of the trial protocol.
