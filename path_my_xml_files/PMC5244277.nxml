These symptoms can also affect patients' quality of life by reducing sleep quality, increasing irritability and depression, and impacting social activities.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Corticosteroid nasal sprays are the therapeutic mainstay for patients with allergic rhinitis.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, these nasal sprays have sensory attributes, such as scent and/or odor, taste, and aftertaste. Patients' perceptions of these attributes may influence their preference for, and satisfaction with, treatment.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, perceptions of nasal spray attributes have been shown to influence treatment compliance,<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> with unpleasant sensory attributes leading to a reduction in adherence, which, in turn, can lead to poor symptom management.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Results from clinical trials of patients with allergic rhinitis show that clinical efficacy and tolerability are similar for different corticosteroid nasal sprays.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, previous studies of corticosteroid nasal sprays to determine the importance of different attributes in patient preference showed that patients can differentiate between the treatments based on attribute profiles.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These findings highlight the potential role of treatment attributes in adherence and, consequently, in clinical outcomes. Fluticasone furoate (FF) and mometasone furoate (MF) are corticosteroids that are both delivered by using nasal sprays, but with different actuation systems. The FF nasal spray (FFNS) (Avamys GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, UK [U.S. trade name, Veramyst]<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>) is side actuated, whereas the MF nasal spray (MFNS) (Nasonex Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme Limited, Hoddesdon, UK<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>) is top actuated. Furthermore, the FFNS delivery system has a shorter nozzle and lower volume per actuation than other nasal spray devices, which may result in less postnasal runoff.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The FFNS and MFNS were optimized to reduce strong scent and/or odor and irritation because these are characteristics reported as being unfavorable to patients.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>To date, there have been single-dose patient preference studies between FFNS and the fluticasone propionate nasal spray (FPNS) (Flixonase GlaxoSmithKline [U.S. trade name, Flonase]<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>)<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and between MFNS and FPNS.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The only previous direct comparison of patient preferences for FF or MF involved administering each nasal spray for 2 weeks.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In the current single-dose study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://NCT02397915">NCT02397915</ext-link>; GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) study no. 201474) of patients with allergic rhinitis, we examined patient preferences for the FF and MF aqueous corticosteroid nasal sprays, based on the sensory attributes of each. In addition, we evaluated whether the differences between the nasal sprays (<italic>e.g.</italic>, actuation system, volume per actuation, fineness of spray, nozzle length) were reflected in the patient-assessed attribute ratings.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>The patients were men and women, 18&#x02013;65 years of age, with either seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis confirmed by a positive allergen skin test result within 12 months of study treatment. Women who were pregnant or breast-feeding were excluded, as were patients with an infection or structural abnormality of the respiratory system. In addition, patients who used an intranasal corticosteroid within 4 weeks of study participation, other intranasal medications within 1 week of study participation, medications that could disturb taste or smell, significant inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP3A4 within 4 weeks of study participation, or who had a history of sensitivity to the study procedures or drugs were excluded.

The study was carried out at 12 sites across four countries: Argentina (4 sites), Australia (3), Russia (2), and South Korea (3). Patients with allergic rhinitis were randomized 1:1 (by using a computer-generated code) to one of two treatment sequences: either a single dose each of MFNS followed by FFNS, or a single dose each of FFNS followed by MFNS. The FFNS (110 &#x003bc;g) was administered as two sprays of 27.5 &#x003bc;g FF per spray in each nostril, and the MFNS (200 &#x003bc;g) was administered as two sprays of 50 &#x003bc;g MF per spray in each nostril. The primary objective was to determine overall patient preference for FFNS or MFNS by using the Overall Preference Questionnaire (OPQ). Secondary objectives were to determine the patient preference for individual attributes of FFNS or MFNS by using the OPQ and to compare the patient ratings for individual attributes of FFNS and MFNS by using the Immediate Attributes Questionnaire (IAQ) and the Delayed Attributes Questionnaire (DAQ).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Study schema.

During screening, a linguistically validated instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Severity (TNSS) questionnaire was completed by the patient to assess the potential impact of the degree of rhinitis symptomatology at baseline on the patient's assessment of nasal spray attributes. The TNSS assessed the symptoms: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and pruritus. Each of the four symptoms was scored individually on a four-point scale (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe), and the scores were added to obtain the TNSS score (see Supplemental Appendix 1 for full details). The patients were blindfolded, and treatment with FFNS or MFNS was administered by an independent person who was not involved with any protocol-related assessments. The second study treatment was administered 30 minutes after the first treatment. Washout procedures were performed to cleanse the mouth and nasal passage 10 minutes before the first and second nasal spray treatments by using a method established in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Study Questionnaires and Assessments</title><p>Two sets of attribute questionnaires were completed after each medication (FFNS or MFNS); immediate (immediately after dosing) and delayed (&#x0223c;2 minutes after dosing). The OPQ was completed immediately after the DAQ for the second treatment. All questionnaires were linguistically validated and provided in the primary language of the country where the patient was enrolled. The IAQ, DAQ, and OPQ have been used previously.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The OPQ required the patient to state his or her overall preference for treatment with FFNS or MFNS and for each attribute (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>); a &#x0201c;no preference&#x0201d; response was available and was included in the statistical analyses. The IAQ and DAQ each used a seven-point Likert scale, which ranged from 0 to 6, to rate individual attributes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Tables 2</xref> and 3; Supplemental Appendix 1). Safety information was collected by recording adverse events (AE) while at the study site and during follow-up telephone contact with the patients. Follow-up safety assessments took place 24 &#x000b1; 4 hours and 96 &#x000b1; 4 hours after treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Sample size was based on an overall preference for FFNS instead of MFNS in 60% of the patients (as observed as the preference for FFNS instead of FPNS in the study by Meltzer <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>) and a significance level of 0.05. By using a two-sided, one-sample &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, a sample size of 263 patients provided 90% power to show the expected difference in proportions. Approximately 300 patients were randomized to ensure availability of data from at least 263 evaluable patients. The per-protocol population included all patients who were randomized and who received FFNS and MFNS, did not have a significant deviation from the protocol, and completed both treatment periods and the associated questionnaires. The safety population included all patients who were randomized. Overall and individual preference questions were analyzed by using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by country and rhinitis symptomatology. Immediate and delayed attribute ratings were assessed separately in terms of the difference between treatments in mean rating scores. This assessment used analysis of variance mixed models with attribute rating as the response variable; subject as the random effect; and country, treatment, period, baseline rhinitis symptomatology subgroup, and treatment sequence as main effects. The set of attribute preferences and each of the two sets of individual attributes ratings (immediate and delayed) were adjusted for multiple comparisons by using the Hochberg method.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and Good Clinical Practice</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice requirements and the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The treatments were compared based on sensory attributes and assessed by using patient questionnaires. Results from the OPQ showed that patients reported an overall preference for FFNS (110 &#x003bc;g) instead of MFNS (200 &#x003bc;g). Both patients who were symptomatic and patients who were asymptomatic preferred FFNS to MFNS, with a trend for a greater difference in preference in the asymptomatic group. However, this trend could not be tested statistically because there was insufficient statistical power in the individual subgroups. Patients preferred FFNS instead of MFNS based on the individual attributes of &#x0201c;less run down the throat,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;less run out of the nose,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;more soothing,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;less irritating.&#x0201d; These preferences may relate to the lower spray volume of aqueous solution used in FFNS (total volume, 200 &#x003bc;L), compared with MFNS (total volume, 400 &#x003bc;L) as well as differences in nozzle lengths and the fineness and dispersal of the spray. There was little difference in preference for the treatments based on taste- or odor-related attributes, which may be because both FFNS and MFNS were developed to minimize odor, although there was a preference for FFNS based on aftertaste. It should be noted that, although only 12% of the patients indicated that they had no overall preference for FFNS instead of MFNS, between 26 and 72% of the patients expressed no preference for either FFNS or MFNS based on individual attributes.</p><p>Compared with the total per-protocol population, a greater proportion of patients preferred FFNS when it was given first (although it was not possible to test this statistically in this study). However, patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences (FFNS then MFNS or MFNS then FFNS), and the statistical analysis of variance models did take account of the treatment order. The difference in spray volume may also contribute to the possible association between treatment order and preference. Because the MFNS has a larger volume, it may linger longer despite the washout and may lead to blunting of the perception of the second spray (FFNS). This finding was consistent with the study by Shah <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which showed that patients randomized to receive budesonide aqueous nasal spray before FPNS had a stronger preference for budesonide aqueous nasal spray than those who received budesonide aqueous nasal spray second.</p><p>Results of the current study complement previous findings. A study that used a similar methodology to that described here reported that patients preferred MFNS (53%) instead of FPNS (34%).<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In a further single-dose study by the same group, patients preferred FFNS (60%) instead of FPNS (33%).<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A study in Japan also investigated patient preference for FFNS or MFNS by using a crossover design, although over a longer 2-week treatment period per spray.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The results showed that FFNS was overall significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) preferred to MFNS.</p><p>Relationships between nasal spray attributes and treatment compliance and adherence were previously reported.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Results from one study showed that &#x0201c;aftertaste&#x0201d; was the attribute patients indicated would be most likely to affect adherence to treatment; however, &#x0201c;taste,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;run down the throat,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;run out of the nose,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;smell,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;feel of the spray&#x0201d; were also proposed as likely to affect adherence.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Results from a survey carried out in 2006 showed that the majority of patients (61%) who stopped taking a nasal allergy medication did so because of a characteristic of the medication and not because of a change in their condition.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>A strength of the current study was that it was conducted at different sites, in different parts of the world, with a view to representing the global use of these treatments. Ethnic differences in nasal physiology have been suggested to impact nasal spray deposition.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> However, we did not stratify patients for this potential difference in this study. A potential study limitation was that this was a 1-day study, so it is possible that preferences may change over time. In addition, the treatment in this study was administered by a trained health care professional with the patient blindfolded to maintain the blind study. However, regular clinical practice would be for the patient to self-administer the spray.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study we showed that, overall and based on the individual attributes, patients with allergic rhinitis preferred FFNS to MFNS. Greater preference may improve patient adherence and thereby improve symptom management of patient's allergic rhinitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title/><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Tables</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="arh003160185so1.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e651" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="arh003160185so2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e655" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="arh003160185so3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e659" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="arh003160185so4.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e663" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="arh003160185so5.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e667" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="arh003160185so6.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e671" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="arh003160185so7.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e675" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="arh003160185so8.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e679" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tif" xlink:href="arh003160185so9.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e683" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Funded by GSK (GSK study 201474; NCT02397915)</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Medical writing support in the form of development of the draft outline and manuscript first draft in consultation with the authors, editorial suggestions to draft versions of this article, assembling tables and figures, collating author comments, copyediting, referencing, and graphic services was provided by Angela Rogers, Ph.D., Gardiner-Caldwell Communications, Macclesfield, U.K., and was funded by GSK</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>A.
