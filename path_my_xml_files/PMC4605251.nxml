The clinical benefits in the two groups were evaluated using the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale (CGI-S), and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I) at baseline, week 1, week 2, week 4, and week 6. The frequency of adverse events (AEs) was also assessed to determine safety at each follow-up visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During the 6-week study period, 30 patients (38.5%) from the generic escitalopram group and 28 patients (30.0%) from the branded escitalopram group dropped out of the study (<italic>P</italic>=0.727). The MADRS, HDRS, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores significantly decreased in both groups, and there were no significant differences between the groups. At week 6, 28 patients (57.1%) in the generic escitalopram group and 35 patients (67.3%) in the branded escitalopram group had responded to treatment (as indicated by a &#x02265;50% decrease from the baseline MADRS score; <italic>P</italic>=0.126), and the remission rates (MADRS score: &#x02264;10) were 42.9% (n=21) in generic escitalopram group and 53.8% (n=28) in the branded escitalopram group (<italic>P</italic>=0.135). The most frequently reported AEs were nausea (17.9%), sleepiness/somnolence (7.7%), weight gain (3.8%), and dry mouth (2.6%) in the generic escitalopram group and nausea (20.0%), sleepiness/somnolence (3.8%), weight gain (2.5%), and dry mouth (2.5%) in the branded escitalopram group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present non-inferiority study demonstrated that generic escitalopram is a safe and an effective initial treatment for patients with MDD and may also be considered as an additional therapeutic option for this population.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>branded escitalopram</kwd><kwd>Lexapro<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd>generic escitalopram</kwd><kwd>Lexacure<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) has been reported to range from 4.4% to 30%.<xref rid="b1-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, The National Comorbidity Study in the USA found that lifetime prevalence rates of MDD were 15%&#x02013;17%; these results are widely considered to be an accurate estimate of the incidence of this disorder.<xref rid="b2-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> MDD is a disabling disorder that is responsible for the greatest nonfatal burden of disease worldwide, as it accounts for approximately 12% of years lost to disability.<xref rid="b4-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, patients with MDD do not respond well to the treatment, and they frequently progress to recurrent episodes of mood disorders, which make treatment difficult. Thus, the treatment of MDD represents a challenge in terms of reducing individual suffering as well as lowering the social costs associated with the disorder.<xref rid="b5-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a representative first-line treatment option for MDD in many countries.

Accordingly, it is expected that the effects of the generic drug will be analogous to those of the original drug. However, relatively few clinical trials have been conducted to determine whether generic drugs show the same clinical efficacy and safety profile as the original drugs.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnant or lactating women, medical conditions that could interfere with the activities of daily living, the presence of psychotic features, a current primary DSM-IV-TR axis I diagnosis other than MDD, and/or those who were at serious risk of suicide. Eligible patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms (at a 1:1 ratio) on the screening day using a computer-generated randomization list. The treatments were administered in a single-blinded fashion such that only the personnel who performed the MADRS rating evaluations were blind to the study treatment of each participant.</p><p>The doses of generic escitalopram and branded escitalopram were adjusted based on clinical considerations as determined by site investigators; however, it was recommended that ongoing nonpsychiatric treatments were not being modified.

Benzodiazepines (&#x0003c;4 mg/day of lorazepam or &#x0003c;2 mg/day of alprazolam) and hypnotics were allowed.

Response to treatment was defined as a &#x02265;50% decrease in the MADRS or HDRS score, and the remission was defined as an absolute MADRS score &#x02264;10, an HDRS score &#x02264;7, or a CGI-I score &#x02264;2. Tolerability and safety were determined based on the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs). To evaluate therapeutic compliance, the subjective levels of compliance were determined at 1, 2, 4, and 6 week after the initiation of drug administration. Subjective therapeutic compliance was assessed by a question such as &#x0201c;How did you take the prescribed medication?&#x0201d; The patients were divided by the compliance rate as follows: &#x02265;70%, 30%&#x02013;69%, and &#x0003c;30%.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Efficacy and safety were analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis, and the last-observation-carried-forward method was applied for the endpoint analysis.

The therapeutic efficacy and safety of esci-talopram are well known, and it is used worldwide.<xref rid="b5-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A meta-analysis of ten randomized double-blind clinical trials observed a beneficial effect of escitalopram versus placebo or an active comparator in patients with MDD, with reported response and remission rates of 58.1% and 53.8%, respectively.<xref rid="b18-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These results support the findings of the present study and indicate that escitalopram is effective for the treatment of MDD.</p><p>Furthermore, the safety profile of the generic escitalopram group was similar to that of the branded escitalopram group in the present study. Common AEs in both groups included nausea, sleepiness/somnolence, weight gain, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, insomnia, and difficulty in concentrating, which are similar to the AEs reported in the previous trials of escitalopram.<xref rid="b5-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Although a previous multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled study did not find enough evidence to approve the clinical efficacy or safety profile of generic escitalopram, the authors of that study reported that this drug had similar clinical efficacy and safety profile to those of branded escitalopram in patients with MDD.<xref rid="b19-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, because of the various formulations of generic escitalopram produced by different manufacturers typically exhibit a variety of therapeutic efficacies and safety profiles, the findings regarding one specific type of generic escitalopram should not be regarded as representative of all its formulations.</p><p>In 2003, the United States Medicaid Program spent over US$2.3 billion across three categories of antidepressant drugs including SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and others. Many countries have their own set of cost-containment policies with respect to antidepressants and other drugs; these include preferred drug lists, prior authorization policies, copay systems, and drug utilization reviews.<xref rid="b20-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, many cost-containment policies have still not been proven effective. Of course, many of these cost-containment strategies substitute a generic SSRI for a branded SSRI for the treatment of patients with MDD.</p><p>Recent studies have suggested that important differences exist in the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness profiles of different SSRIs.<xref rid="b21-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Thus, patients who respond to and are stable during treatment with one drug may lose their responsiveness and even suffer unnecessary adverse reactions if they are switched to another drug.<xref rid="b23-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Under these circumstances, it is likely that the benefits of switching a patient&#x02019;s current pharmacotherapy for a nonmedical reason to save drug costs may be offset by the increase in total expenditures that would stem from additional hospitalizations and/or emergency department visits and the need for other medical services. Compared with non-switchers, switchers have higher risks for all-cause mental health-related and MDD-related risk for hospitalizations and/or emergency department visits (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, 1.34, and 1.54, respectively; all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) as well as higher risk-adjusted mental health-related and MDD-related medical costs (US$219 and US$222, respectively; both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).<xref rid="b25-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Nonetheless, some have argued that generic SSRIs and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors do not appear to be associated with a higher probability of therapy interruption or significant reductions in health costs.<xref rid="b26-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, a large-scale study<xref rid="b27-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> using the administrative databases of five local health care units (347,073 patients) reported that the clinical outcomes of the study (hospitalizations, mortality, and other health costs) did not significantly differ between generic medicine users and brand medicine users. These findings suggest that generic medicines represent a viable therapy option.</p><p>The comparative dissolution tests of generic escitalopram (Lexacure<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) conducted in the present study revealed that the dissolution of the drug at 2 hours was 96% at a pH of 1.2, 97.7% at a pH of 4.0, and 90.8% at a pH of 6.8. In addition, a bioequivalence study comparing the generic and branded forms of escitalopram found that the mean total area under the curve and maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) values of generic escitalopram and branded escitalopram were similar.<xref rid="b13-ndt-11-2557" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Thus, generic escitalopram (Lexacure<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) has a similar bioequivalence to branded escitalopram (Lexapro<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), and the generic form of escitalopram is likely to have a similar mechanism of action to branded escitalopram.</p><p>Because the total economic burden of MDD, including personal productivity and social costs, is increasing, it is necessary for clinicians and governments to actively manage the treatment of patients with MDD. Not all patients are compelled to use generic medicines, but the availability of generic options is required in some situations. Therefore, well-made and thoroughly studied forms of generic escitalopram could be a viable additional therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with MDD.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The present findings should be interpreted with caution due to several important limitations.</p><p>First, the sample size and statistical powers were not enough in the study. Non-inferiority study usually requires a larger sample size and higher powers than a comparator study, and this may have affected the results. Second, the analysis of the difference between groups on the MADRS demonstrated 1.8 point difference in favor of branded compared with generic escitalopram at both week 4 and 6. This might be suggested that the branded escitalopram would have been able to demonstrate an advantage in large and long-term study; however, further researches are needed. Third, the methodological limitations of the present study include the use of a rater-blinded design; this might have allowed a bias by the patients in favor of the branded product that would have influenced the results. In addition, without the use of a placebo, it is impossible to separate the true effects of escitalopram from any placebo effects. However, the clinical efficacy and safety profile of escitalopram are well known at this point, and there was no ethical rationale for the use of a placebo in the present study. Moreover, the flexible adjustment of the escitalopram dose and the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and hypnotics were permitted, making the control of variables contributing to the improvement of MDD symptoms difficult. Finally, the present study specifically investigated one generic form of escitalopram (Lexacure&#x000ae;), and as a result, the present findings cannot be generalized to other generic forms of the drug because every formulation exhibits different therapeutic efficacies and safety profiles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported and funded by Dong-A
