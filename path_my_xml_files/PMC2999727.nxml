We have evaluated the impact of inflammatory markers on the efficacy of TCZ by comparing the efficacy indicated by the 28-joint disease activity score using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) with that indicated by the clinical and simplified disease activity indexes (CDAI and SDAI, respectively) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria in a double-blind study of TCZ&#x02014;the SATORI study. The Spearman correlation coefficient between DAS28-ESR and CDAI was comparable between that at week 24 and that at baseline [correlation coefficient at baseline and week 24 was 0.823 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) and 0.818 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), respectively]. A large difference between the DAS28 remission rate and CDAI remission rate was observed at week 24. However, these results are comparable to those of a previous study conducted with non-TCZ-treated patients. Moreover, the same results were obtained in the comparison between the DAS28-ESR and SDAI, even though the SDAI includes an inflammatory parameter as a component. These results confirm that the DAS28-ESR has a validity comparable to that of other methods in terms of evaluating the RA treatment efficacy of TCZ, despite its strong inflammatory marker-inhibiting effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Interleukin 6</kwd><kwd>Clinical disease activity index</kwd><kwd>Simplified disease activity index</kwd><kwd>Acute phase protein</kwd><kwd>Inflammatory markers</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Japan College of Rheumatology 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a monoclonal anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody that binds to cell membrane-bound IL-6 receptors and to free soluble IL-6 receptors in the serum, thereby blocking IL-6 signalling into cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

The first patient was enrolled on 27 January 2004, and the last patient exited the study on 15 February 2005. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments for 24&#x000a0;weeks: (1) TCZ (8&#x000a0;mg/kg) once every 4&#x000a0;weeks plus MTX placebo (TCZ group); (2) or TCZ placebo plus MTX 8&#x000a0;mg/week (control group). Randomization was achieved by centralized allocation at a patient enrolment center. The dosage of TCZ used in this study was chosen based on the results of an earlier dose-finding study; the dose of MTX was the maximum dose allowed in Japan. Oral corticosteroids equivalent to &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;mg/day prednisolone were allowed, but the dose could not be increased during the study. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroid (only one joint at one treatment) and hyaluronate preparations were allowed. The use of one nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including switching to another NSAID, was allowed. DMARDs, intravenous or intramuscular corticosteroids, plasmapheresis and surgical treatment were not allowed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Efficacy evaluation</title><p>Efficacy was evaluated every 4&#x000a0;weeks by calculating the DAS28-ESR, CDAI and SDAI scores and the ACR response category.

The CDAI and SDAI remitters (8 and 10 patients, respectively) all achieved ACR70. However, among the 25 DAS28-ESR remitters, 17 (68%) achieved ACR70, three achieved ACR50 and five achieved only ACR20. No patient achieved DAS28-ESR remission without achieving at least ACR20. Among the DAS28-ESR remitters who achieved ACR70, the maximum DAS28-ESR score was 2.43.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p>To compare the validity of methods of evaluating the anti-rheumatic effects of TCZ, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor that significantly reduces the level of inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP, we investigated the correlations between DAS28-ESR and other methods for evaluating RA disease activity, namely, CDAI, SDAI and the ACR core set response category.</p><p>We found that the Spearman coefficient of correlation between DAS28-ESR and CDAI (whose formula does not include any inflammatory markers) at week 24 was &#x0003e;0.8 and that this correlation coefficient was comparable to those determined at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively. There was no decrease in the correlation coefficient related to the rapid improvement of ESR after the introduction of TCZ treatment. The same results were obtained when we compared the Spearman coefficient of correlation between DAS28-ESR and SDAI (whose formula includes the CRP level). The coefficients of correlation between DAS28-ESR and SDAI were also always &#x0003e;0.8. These results suggest that the DAS28-ESR score is not markedly lowered by the sudden decrease in ESR that occurs during the first 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with TCZ.</p><p>Shaver et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] examined the correlation coefficient between DAS28 and CDAI among RA patients in the setting of a community rheumatology practice. Although all of the patients enrolled in their study did not receive TCZ treatment because TCZ had not yet been launched in the USA during the study period, the correlation coefficient obtained between these two indices was quite similar to our result. These researchers also reported that there was a large difference between the remission rate based on the DAS28 and that based on the CDAI and that only about 30% of DAS remitters could attain CDAI remission. The CDAI remitter and DAS remitter rates in our study were comparable with the respective rates in their study. These results suggest that a difference between DAS remission and CDAI remission is not specific to TCZ treatment, i.e., this difference was accrued due to the distinction in the definition of remission criterion in the DAS28-ESR and CDAI. These results also suggest that DAS28-ESR is as useful as CDAI in terms of evaluating the efficacy of TCZ and other anti-rheumatic drugs that have strong inhibiting effects on inflammatory markers.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> provides insight into the factors responsible for the difference in remission rates according to the CDAI and DAS28 scales. Many of our patients who satisfied the DAS28 remission criteria but not the CDAI remission criteria had a high SJC and high PGA score. By nature of the definition of CDAI, CDAI remission patients generally had low scores on all of the incorporated measures. The same results were obtained when the difference in the remission rates according to the SDAI and DAS28 scales was analyzed even though the formula for SDAI includes the CRP level as a component for assessing remission (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p><p>A difference between DAS28-ESR and CDAI or SDAI remission among ACR response rates was also observed. All CDAI and SDAI remitters achieved ACR70, but among the 25 DAS28-ESR remitters, 17 (61%) achieved ACR70 while the others achieved no more than ACR50 or ACR20. Since all SDAI remitters achieved ACR70 even though the formula for SDAI includes an inflammatory marker (CRP), we concluded that the difference between the numbers of DAS28-ESR remitters and ACR70 responders was not caused by the inclusion of ESR in DAS28-ESR, but by the remission criterion used in the DAS28-ESR method. Sokka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] compared the performance of different definitions of remission, including DAS28, CDAI and ACR criteria. They concluded that the use of different definitions of RA remission leads to different results with regard to remission rate and that the rates of remission defined as &#x0201c;DAS28-ESR&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2.6&#x0201d; are higher than those defined by other means. M&#x000e4;kinen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] suggested that a stricter criterion (DAS28-ESR&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2.32) is appropriate for defining DAS28-ESR remission. Using the stricter criterion suggested by M&#x000e4;kinen et al., all patients with DAS28-ESR &#x0003c;2.32 in the SATORI study achieved ACR70.</p><p>In conclusion, our results confirm that DAS28-ESR has a validity comparable to that of other methods in terms of evaluating the RA treatment efficacy of TCZ, even though this drug strongly inhibits inflammatory markers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the members of the MRA clinical study group for RA for treatment of the patients.
