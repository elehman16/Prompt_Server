The recommended starting dose for adults with plaque psoriasis is 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) for 3 months followed by maintenance dose of 50 mg once weekly (QW). Some patients are unable to maintain response after transitioning to maintenance dose and require treatment supplementation. Topical corticosteroid therapies have been used with etanercept for psoriasis,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and addition of clobetasol propionate to etanercept has been shown to increase efficacy compared with etanercept alone.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Further clinical studies are needed to identify effective treatment regimens and provide information on when to initiate treatment with topical medications.</p><p>REFINE, the Randomized, blinded assessor study to Evaluate the efFIcacy and safety of etanercept 50 mg QW plus as Needed topical agent vs. Etanercept 50 mg BIW in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis study, was designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of adding topical corticosteroid therapy when etanercept dosage is reduced from initial dose to maintenance dose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This phase 3b, multicentre, randomized, open-label study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and consent was approved by the institutional review board at each study site. All patients provided written informed consent before initiation of study-related procedures. This study was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01313221.</p><p>All patients received etanercept 50 mg BIW for the first 12 weeks of the study. Patients were then randomized (1:1) to receive etanercept 50 mg BIW for 12 weeks or etanercept 50 mg QW plus topical agent for 12 weeks. Randomization was stratified by body mass index (BMI; &#x02264;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and previous TNF-blocker exposure. Patients receiving topical agents were treated as needed to achieve a target static physician global assessment (sPGA) score of 0 (clear). Topical agent was selected by the investigator from hydrocortisone 2.5%, betamethasone valerate 0.1%, betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%, clobetasol 0.05%, calcitriol, or calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%.

Exclusions included guttate, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis or significant concurrent medical conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change in PASI score from week 12 to week 24.

Some efficacy analyses were also done on the full analysis set of all enrolled patients with &#x02265;1 postbaseline efficacy evaluation. Least squares means and 95% CIs for treatment difference in percentage change in PASI and affected BSA from week 12 were calculated using repeated measures models across weeks 16, 20 and 24 with no imputation for missing data. Secondary endpoints were summarized by mean, standard deviation (SD), 95% CI, or percentage for categorical variables. Last observation carried forward imputation was used for missing data for some secondary endpoints. Multiple imputation was used for sensitivity analyses on summary statistics for primary and some secondary endpoints.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> AEs were summarized and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 15.1.

Only 23% of patients receiving BIW/QW dosing and 28% of patients receiving QW/QW dosing elected to use topical medications through week 24. In contrast, 92% of patients in the etanercept+topical arm of our study used topical medications. This difference in rates of topical medication usage could be related to instructions provided to patients (topical medications were used as needed in PRISTINE, but were used as needed to clear in REFINE) and source of topical medications (provided by patients in PRISTINE and by the sponsor in REFINE).</p><p>Patients in the adalimumab in combination with topical Treatment [Calcipotriol/Betamethasone] in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis and insufficient response to classic systemic treatment (BELIEVE) study received adalimumab with either topical calcipotriol betamethasone or vehicle for 4 weeks and then topical therapies as needed for 12 weeks.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A greater proportion of patients receiving adalimumab plus topical calcipotriol betamethasone achieved PASI 75 response at weeks 2 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and 4 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02), but patients on adalimumab monotherapy showed better clinical responses after week 4 through week 16. In contrast, patients in REFINE did not initiate topical therapy until they had received etanercept for 12 weeks and patients on etanercept monotherapy did not achieve greater clinical benefit than patients using topical medications. Together, these results support the use of topical medications in combination with TNF blocker therapies in patients with psoriasis.</p><p>A limitation of the study was the short duration of treatment (12 weeks of etanercept plus topical therapies), which may not accurately reflect long-term results as adherence with topical therapies may decrease with time.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Treatment responses were similar between patients on etanercept 50 mg BIW and those on 50 mg QW who used topical medications as needed to clear.
