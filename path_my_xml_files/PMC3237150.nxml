It produces comparable intubating conditions to that of succinylcholine, but does not have the short intubation time of the latter.

But, succinylcholine has a number of undesirable side-effects like muscle fasciculation, myalgia, hyperkalaemia,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] bradyarrhythmias,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] increased intra-ocular tension, increased intracranial tension,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] increased intragastric pressure, anaphylaxis, malignant hyperthermia and Masseter spasm. Hence, it is not suitable in situations like neuromuscular disorders, burns, acute head injury, intracranial bleed,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] open eye injury, spinal cord injury,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] cerebrovascular accidents and renal diseases. The above side-effects and contraindications of succinylcholine had prompted the use of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants using various techniques for rapid sequence intubation, such as (1) timing principles,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] (2) combination of relaxant,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] (3) high dose of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] (4) inhalational agents to augment the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] (5) use of intravenous anaesthetic agents with non-depolarizing muscle relaxants to augment neuromuscular blockade[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and (6) priming principle.</p><p>In our study, we have used the priming principle. It is a divided dose technique of neuromuscular blocking drug, capable of producing a rapid onset of neuromuscular block and suitable intubation condition. A small priming dose (10% of intubating dose) is administrated to an awake patient. This dose is large enough to cause moderate inhibition of neuromuscular transmission but small enough to cause any unpleasant side-effects. It occupies 75% of end plate receptors. After 2&#x02013;4 min, the rest of the intubating dose of the drug is administered to produce neuromuscular blockade for rapid sequence intubation.</p><p>Rocuronium bromide has the fastest onset time compared with other non-deploring neuromuscular blocking drugs. We chose rocuronium bromide with an intubating dose of 0.6 mg/kg,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] priming dose of 0.06 mg/kg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] (10% of intubating dose) and priming interval of 3 min[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] for our study. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of the priming principle using rocuronium bromide in reducing the onset time of intubating and also to evaluate the intubating conditions.</p><p>We hypothesized that by using the priming principle on rocuronium bromide, the onset time of the neuromuscular bromide may be hastened as that of the succinylcholine (onset time 54 s)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] so that it can be used in rapid sequence intubation in conditions where contraindications for succinylcholine exists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After &#x0201c;Institute Ethics committee&#x0201d; approval and informed consent, preliminary studies were carried out in 60 patients of ASA I and II aged between 18 and 60 years, of both sexes. It is a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted between February 2007 and November 2007. Patients with neuromuscular diseases, anticipated difficult intubation (obesity, thyromental distance more than 6 cm and Mallampati grade 3 and 4, pregnancy, hepatic, renal diseases, patients receiving drugs interfering with neuromuscular action and history of allergic reaction to rocuronium were excluded from the study.</p><p>The patients were randomized into two groups; namely, group &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; (control group) and group &#x0201c;P&#x0201d; (priming group) by computer-generated randomized numbers.</p><p>In the operation theatre, the intravenous cannula was secured and balanced salt solution was started. Midazolam 0.03 mg/kg was given intravenously to all patients in both groups 10 min prior to the priming dose. Blood pressure cuff was applied to the contralateral upper limb. After explaining about the nerve stimulation technique, the supramaximal stimulus was set with a peripheral nerve stimulator. Total intubating dose of rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg was diluted to 5 ml. In group &#x0201c;C,&#x0201d; 2 ml of normal saline was taken in a 2 ml syringe. In group &#x0201c;P,&#x0201d; 0.5 ml of rocuronium bromide was taken from the 5 ml syringe (containing total dose) and diluted to 2 ml with normal saline, and the remaining 4.5 ml was diluted to 5 ml with normal saline. Drugs were loaded, labelled and administered by another experienced anaesthesiologist. The intubating anaesthesiologist was blinded to the study and diluting protocols.</p><p>After pre-oxygenation, the priming dose of rocuronium bromide 0.06 mg/kg (10% of intubating dose) or normal saline was given 3 min before the intubating dose as per randomization. The patients were enquired about the ptosis, double vision, difficulty in swallowing and difficulty in breathing. Fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight was given intravenously 1 min after the priming dose. Two and half minutes after giving the priming dose, patients were induced with intravenous thiopentone sodium 5 mg/kg body weight given over 20 s. The intubating dose of rocuronium bromide was injected 3 min after the priming or normal saline injection. After giving the intubating dose of rocuronium, a supramaximally set Train of Four (TOF) stimuli was applied over the ulnar nerve at the wrist through surface electrodes and was repeated every 10 s and assessed visually for loss of adduction of thumb and disappearance of T<sub>1</sub> of TOF stimuli. Time interval between the intubating dose and the loss of T<sub>1</sub> of TOF stimuli was considered as &#x0201c;onset time of intubation.&#x0201d;</p><p>After loss of T<sub>1</sub> of TOF stimuli, the trachea was intubated and intubating conditions were noted and intubation score recorded using an intubation scoring system. Intubating conditions were graded[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] as excellent when intubating scores were between 8 and 9, good with 6&#x02013;7, fair with 3&#x02013;5 and poor with 0&#x02013;2 (Cooper <italic>et al</italic>.).</p><p>All patients were monitored with electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure and oxygen saturation with pulse-oximetry.

Rocuronium with priming could be an alternative to succinylcholine. Our study was conducted to compare the onset time of intubation and intubating conditions between rocuronium with priming and without priming. Rocuronium bromide is a steroidal non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that is useful to produce a rapid onset of action. Studies comparing rocuronium and succinylcholine in the onset time and quality of intubation have yielded varying results. McCourt <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] found that rocuronium 1 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg have shown excellent intubating conditions at 60 s. Singh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] had shown that with 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium and 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine, the time to achieve maximum blockade was 87.94 and 65.59 s, respectively. The intubating conditions were comparable in the two groups at 60 s. Naguib <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] had given the priming dose as 0.06 mg/kg rocuronium or 0.015 mg/kg mivacurium followed by an intubating dose of 0.54 mg/kg of rocuronium. On priming with rocuronium and mivacurium, the onset times were 73 and 58 s, respectively. In the other group, 1 mg/kg succinylcholine was administered and the onset time was found to be 54 s. Intubating conditions were similar in all three groups. It was concluded that priming rocuronium with either rocuronium or mivacurium resulted in neuromuscular blockade comparable to that of succinylcholine in both the onset of action and intubating conditions. Griffith <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] compared priming with non-priming by giving a priming dose of 0.06 mg/kg rocuronium followed 2 min later by 0.54 mg/kg rocuronium and another group given directly 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Onset times were compared, which were 34&#x000b1;6 s with priming and 59&#x000b1;14 s without priming. Jose <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] found that the priming interval of 4 min allowed the fastest onset time compared with the 2- and 6-min priming intervals. Yavascaoglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] has proved that priming with the 3-min priming interval was more effective than the 2-min priming interval when rapid tracheal intubation with rocuronium was necessary.</p><p>In our study, using the 2 &#x000d7; ED<sub>95</sub> dose of rocuronium showed that with priming (priming with 10% of the intubating dose with 3-min priming interval), the onset time of intubation (onset of maximum block) was 50.67&#x000b1;7.39 s in the priming group and 94.00&#x000b1;11.62 s in the control group with comparable intubating conditions in both groups at the time of intubation, i.e. after loss of T<sub>1</sub> of TOF.</p><p>One of the major drawbacks of priming dose is the occurrence of adverse effects such as weakness, diplopia, dysphagia, generalized discomfort and breathing difficulties. Aziz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] explained the effects of priming with vecuronium and rocuronium in younger and elderly patients. Total number of patients was 10 in each group in young and elderly in both rocuronium and vecuronium groups. In younger patients, 7 in vecuronium and 6 in rocuronium developed ptosis, 5 in vecuronium and 4 in rocuronium developed difficulty in swallowing, expiratory reserve volume reduced by 20&#x02013;25%, O<sub>2</sub> saturation was decreased but decrease was minimal in younger patients compared with the elderly. In elderly patients, 8 in vecuronium and 7 in rocuronium developed ptosis, 5 in vecuronium and 4 in rocuronium developed difficulty in swallowing, expiratory reserve volume reduced by 30&#x02013;40%, O<sub>2</sub> saturation was decreased but decrease was higher in elderly patients than in younger patients.</p><p>None of the patients in our study had evidence of such adverse effects of priming. The subtle symptoms of adverse effect of priming could not have been felt due to the administration of midazolam 10 min prior to the priming dose and fentanyl 1 min after the priming dose. The priming dose of rocuronium is advantageous in patients where succinylcholine is contraindicated for providing better quality of intubation with faster onset of action.</p><p>The autonomic safety ratio of rocuronium for vagal block is about 10-times less than that of vecuronium. No haemodynamic changes (blood pressure, heart rate) were seen in humans, and there was no increase in plasma histamine concentrations after doses of up to four-times ED<sub>95</sub>. Slight to moderate increase in heart rate may be due to either the fact that recuronium produces pain on injection or to its weak vagolytic effect. The heart rate increase may be controlled by the prior administration of fentanyl.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Heier <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] had given midazolam 0.01 mg/kg, alfentanil 10 &#x003bc;g/kg and thiopentone 4 mg/kg. It was followed by various doses of rocuronium bromide for rapid sequence induction and intubation. He mentioned the cardiovascular changes with doses of rocuronium bromide with intubating doses of 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2 mg/kg, and thereafter the changes in percentage of BP were 30, 24, 29, 22 and 17, respectively, and percentage change in heart rate were 7, 8, 7, 7 and 5, respectively.</p><p>Shorten[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] compared elderly patients given rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg with patients given vecuronium 0.12 mg/kg, and found no significant change in heart rate, arterial blood pressure or plasma epinephrine concentrations in either group.</p><p>In our study, any increase in heart rate or blood pressure after rocuronium administration was not observed, and this may be due to prior administration of fentanyl. Slight increase in heart rate and mean arterial pressure at 1 min post-intubation may be due to stress response to intubation.</p><p>Naguib <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] had given priming dose as 0.06 mg/kg rocuronium or 0.015 mg/kg mivacurium followed by intubating dose of 0.54 mg/kg rocuronium. On priming with rocuronium and mivacurium, the onset times were 73 and 58 s, respectively. In another group, succinylcholine 1 mg/kg was given and the onset time was found to be 54 s. Intubating conditions were similar in all groups. It was concluded that priming a rocuronium with either rocuronium or mivacurium resulted in a neuromuscular block comparable to that of succinylcholine in both the onset of action and intubating conditions.</p><p>In our study, it was observed that onset time of intubation (using priming principle on rocuronium) was 50.67&#x000b1;7.39 s.</p><p>In scenarios where anticipated difficult intubation and contraindication of succinylcholine co-exist, due to its own adverse effects, rocuronium with priming principle can be safely used. Therefore, rocuronium with priming principle can be an alternative to succinylcholine for rapid sequence intubation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
