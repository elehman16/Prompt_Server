training can improve spinal alignment in young adults. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-six
subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly allocated into high-,
moderate-, and low-velocity mechanical horseback-riding training groups. All participants
completed one 20-minute session per day, 3 days per week, for 6 weeks. The evaluation was
performed before and 6 weeks after the training intervention. The spinal alignment was
measured by a Formetric III device. The measurement items were kyphotic angle, lordotic
angle, trunk inclination, pelvic torsion, pelvic rotation, and lateral deviation. The data
were analyzed using analysis of covariance to determine the statistical significance.
[Results] The kyphotic angle and trunk inclination were significantly different among the
groups. The kyphotic angles of the high- and moderate-velocity groups were significantly
lower than that of the low-velocity group after the intervention. The trunk inclination of
the high-velocity group was significantly lower than that of the low-velocity group after
intervention. [Conclusion] Higher-velocity mechanical horseback-riding training is more
effective than lower-velocity mechanical horseback-riding training for improving spinal
alignment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Horseback-riding</kwd><kwd>Horseback-riding velocity</kwd><kwd>Spinal alignment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Horseback riding has been used in children with intellectual disability, stroke, and
cerebral palsy and has been applied widely as a rehabilitation approach for individuals of
all ages with disabilities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A horse&#x02019;s
movements are rhythmic and repetitive and appear to be similar to the human gait<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, horseback riding can have
walking-related treatment effects due to its emulation of human pelvis movements while
walking<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Depending on the horse&#x02019;s
movement, the rider experiences a wide range of motion of 500 to 1,000 times over a
10-minute period. Such movements help improve the rider&#x02019;s posture, muscle strength, balance,
and coordination<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although rehabilitation using horses has many benefits, problems such as high economic cost
and labor shortages due to insufficient infrastructure and a lack of rehabilitation
horseback-riding therapists persist. Therefore, its implementation is difficult<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the largest problem of
horse-based rehabilitation is the potential accidents caused by falling, for which there is
no practical prevention<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. To overcome
these problems, attempts have been made to use a machine to mimic a horse&#x02019;s movements.
Horseback riding using machines and appliances for horseback riding therapy appears to have
similar effectiveness in rehabilitation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reported mechanical horseback-riding
training (MHRT) has physical effects similar to the movement trajectory of an actual
horse<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus far, horseback-riding training with machines has focused on children with cerebral
palsy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and stroke patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, elderly people<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and research to verify the effects of exercise have been
reported. Although MHRT effectively improves muscle strength, posture, and symmetry<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, little research has investigated velocity-based differences.
Therefore, this study examined the differences specific to MHRT velocity on spinal alignment
to determine whether MHRT can be considered as a therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-six young adults participated in this study. The adults were recruited from S
university in Namwon, Korea and were randomly allocated to the high-velocity MHRT (HV-HRST;
n=12), moderate-velocity MHRT (MV-HRST; n=12), and low-velocity MHRT (LV-HRST; n=12) groups.
The subjects in all groups performed 18 sessions (3 times a day for 20 minutes each day for
6 weeks). All subjects read and signed informed consent forms in accordance with the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The horseback-riding equipment (FORTIS 101, Daewon, Korea) was similar in size (width,
580&#x02005;mm; length, 1900&#x02005;mm), height (1,700&#x02005;mm), and weight (315&#x02005;kg) to an actual horse. The
experiment was performed using 71&#x02013;80 of 100 courses in the main exercise area for the neck,
shoulders, torso, abdomen, waist, hips, and thighs. Each course was applied for 2 minutes; a
total of 10 courses were performed over 20 minutes. The participants were wearing an
automatic stop device to prevent falls. If the participants were afraid of falling, safety
bars were placed on either side. If they were not anxious, the reins were taken. The first
time they climbed into the saddle riding, they were encouraged to use a wooden staircase to
relieve any psychological anxiety. In addition, a full description was given to help the
participants understand the MHRT. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

III was used to analyze spinal alignment in three dimensions. The Formetric III can
automatically detect certain areas of the body for imaging, such as a subject&#x02019;s back,
without the need for manually attached anatomical markers. In addition, there is no exposure
to radiation, such as X-rays, because spinal deformations can be measured quickly using a
halogen lamp, a white light system. DICAM basic software was used for the analysis. The
length and width of the space was 3.0, 3.5 m, and 1.5m, respectively, and the time was
0.04&#x02013;60 seconds. The results obtained with the equipment were compared with the radiation
measurements, and high accuracy and reliability was observed<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The parameters measured were the kyphotic angle, lordotic angle,
trunk inclination, pelvic torsion, pelvic rotation, and lateral deviation.</p><p>This study used SPSS for MAC (21.0 version). All measurements are reported as the mean &#x000b1;
standard deviation. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the general
characteristics of the subjects, such as age, height, and weight among the three groups. A
comparison with all groups in spinal alignment was analyzed by ANCOVA. The pre-test values
of each group were used as covariates for adjustment. A post-hoc multiple comparison was
performed using the least significant difference (LSD). The statistical significance level

the walking step and in the movement of the horse, depending on horse&#x02019;s velocity, which can
lead to changes in the rider&#x02019;s movement. Reacting to the rider&#x02019;s center of gravity according
to the horse&#x02019;s movement can have an effect on the posture alignment and can reorganize the
rider&#x02019;s balance strategy<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the rider
responds to changes in the speed of a horse in a sitting position, the feedforward of the
unexpected movement of the horse and feedback will appear, which determines the postural
adjustment needed to perform the selected task. As the speed of horse riding increases, the
actual type of horse walking and the movement of horse riding also appears to be different.
The aim of this study was to determine if MHRT depending on velocity could affect the spinal
alignment in young adults by using Formetric III device.</p><p>The results showed a significant difference in trunk inclination and kyphotic angle among
the groups. The post-hoc results showed that the kyphotic angle of the HV-MHRT and MV-MHRT
groups was significantly lower than that of the LV-MHRT group. The trunk inclination of the
HV-MHRT group was significantly lower than that of the LV-MHRT group. The more reduced the
trunk inclination, the greater the increase in trunk extension. That is, the angle is
reduced from tipping forward in the sagittal plane. The HV-MHRT group would see the trunk
extension as helpful. In a study that investigated the kinematic changes in the rider&#x02019;s
movement during riding, the high speed of horseback-riding was maintained 2.46&#x02005;cm larger
than the width in the vertical direction of normal speed riding<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the elbow joint was more flexed from moving
at high speed, and the shoulder joint was more in extension. The shoulder joint due to
extension can be viewed as making a greater contribution to the extension of the thoracic
area.</p><p>The results of a study of the effects of horseback-riding on trunk posture in mentally
retarded children revealed a decrease in trunk inclination after 16 weeks of
horseback-riding, indicating a beneficial effect on the trunk posture correction<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The decreased kyphosis was attributed to
thoracic extensor strengthening. The results of the back muscle cross-sectional area of
patients with scoliosis, who underwent mechanical movement, showed an increase in the right
and left back muscle area from 4.87&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> to 5.50&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>, and from
4.43&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> to 4.83&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</p><p>The MVIC of the back muscles also increased from 3.73&#x02005;kg to 6.70&#x02005;kg<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study comparing the effectiveness of Kendall
exercise and MHRT on the forward head posture suggested that MHRT more effective than
Kendall exercise<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The forward head
posture is primarily a forward posture of the neck that naturally increases when the
kyphosis is increased by round shoulders and scapular protraction. Therefore, the results of
the present study shows some agreement with that study in that it helps to improve the
forward head posture.</p><p>In contrast, MHRT had no significant effect on posture in 9 frail elderly people, and there
was no significant difference in the thoracic kyphosis angle<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the 12 week period, individuals with limited functional
physical activity in the horseback-riding group showed a gradual increase in speed,
particularly at 1, 4, and 8 weeks. In the present study, subjects were consistently at the
fastest speed in HV-MHRT over the 6-week period, while each subject was at the speed and
rate at which the seniors could adapt. In addition, the fastest MHRT movement speed was a
rate 3.6 times per second; the slowest was proceeded at a rate of 1.7 times per second. The
velocity difference showed different results.</p><p>Although kyphosis was significantly different, the lordosis angle in the HV-MHRT group
showed no significant differences. This is because the HV-MHRT group is a fixed set of both
legs through the pelvis to the static contractions of the pelvic muscle contraction and the
action to extend both arms holding the reins occurred more strongly. The lateral deviation,
pelvic torsion, and pelvic rotation did not show a significant difference. In particular,
the lateral deviation was significantly more effective in the LV-MHRT. The lateral deviation
means symmetry close to zero. Because LV-MHRT showed a lower value than the HV-MHRT and
MV-MHRT group, the left and right body symmetry was effective in low velocity.</p><p>Although the HV-MHRT group had more power in the hands on the reins than in both legs and
pelvis because reactive posture control moves at a faster speed, the LV-MHRT helped balance
the body with relatively anticipatory postural adjustments in response to the movement of
the moving saddle, which is expected to contribute more to the symmetry of the body<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has some limitations. The physical ability of the individual was not considered
as including it was difficult because of the small sample size. In addition, one-handed and
both handed subjects were not selected considering the dominant hand because it affects the
reporting spinal symmetry. Future research will compare the difference according to the
horseback-riding speed targeting people with scoliosis or deficiencies in spinal
alignment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Tseng</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name><name><surname>Tam</surname><given-names>KW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of
