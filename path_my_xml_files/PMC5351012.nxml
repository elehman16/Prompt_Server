The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of acebilustat, a leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, and its effect on inflammation biomarkers in patients with cystic fibrosis. Seventeen patients with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis were enrolled and randomized into groups receiving placebo or doses of 50 mg or 100 mg acebilustat administered orally, once daily for 15 days. Sputum neutrophil counts were reduced by 65% over baseline values in patients treated with 100 mg acebilustat. A modestly significant 58% reduction vs. placebo in sputum elastase was observed with acebilustat treatment. Favorable trends were observed for reduction of serum C&#x02010;reactive protein and sputum neutrophil DNA in acebilustat&#x02010;treated patients. No changes in pulmonary function were observed. Acebilustat was safe and well tolerated. The results of this study support further clinical development of acebilustat for treatment of cystic fibrosis.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="6137"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>cts12428</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January 2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:5.0.8 mode:remove_FC converted:10.03.2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="cts12428-note-0001"><p>

</p><p>A logical approach to treating CF lung inflammation is to reduce the excessive migration of neutrophils into the lungs, thereby reducing release of both neutrophil&#x02010;derived DNA and elastase in the airways. Identifying the primary drivers of neutrophil influx and activation in the CF lung is the subject of much current research.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> One such candidate is leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent lipid mediator of neutrophil migration and activation.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> LTB4 is produced by the action of the enzyme leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) on the intermediate arachidonic acid product leukotriene A4.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> LTB4 has recently been identified as a requisite mediator of neutrophil swarming behavior and serves as a neutrophil&#x02010;to&#x02010;neutrophil relay signal in order to amplify an initial inciting inflammatory signal, such as formyl peptides.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> LTB4 signaling from neutrophils also initiates a cascade of cytokines and chemokines that further amplify and sustain inflammation as well as perpetuate further neutrophil recruitment.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Furthermore, LTB4 has been shown to stimulate neutrophils to release elastase, and conversely elastase can stimulate accumulation of LTB4.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Consistent with these findings, generation of LTB4 is increased in the lungs of patients with CF and correlates with disease severity.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> Taken together, these findings suggest that, once incited, neutrophils may form a self&#x02010;sustaining inflammatory cycle of LTB4 generation and neutrophil recruitment that results in persistent and excessive release of neutrophilic DNA and elastase into the airways of patients with CF. Breaking this cycle by intervening in the production of LTB4 is an attractive target for treatment of CF airway inflammation.</p><p>We hypothesized that reducing LTB4 production via selective inhibition of LTA4H would provide measurable and potentially beneficial anti&#x02010;inflammatory effects. Acebilustat (CTX&#x02010;4430) is a direct and selective inhibitor of LTA4H in development as a once&#x02010;daily oral anti&#x02010;inflammatory treatment for CF. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of acebilustat in healthy volunteers and patients with CF, reported separately, indicate that 50 mg and 100 mg once&#x02010;daily oral doses of acebilustat significantly reduce LTB4 production, and, thus, are potentially effective doses for anti&#x02010;inflammatory treatment of CF. Here, we report the results for biomarkers and safety from a first&#x02010;in&#x02010;human phase I clinical study in patients with CF treated for 15 days with 50 mg or 100 mg once&#x02010;daily oral acebilustat or matched placebo. The aim of this study was to assess tolerability and safety as well as to generate initial data on potential anti&#x02010;inflammatory effects of acebilustat using a range of biomarkers related to inflammation, infection, and immune system status.</p><sec id="cts12428-sec-0070"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="cts12428-sec-0080"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was carried out using a randomized, double&#x02010;blind, placebo&#x02010;controlled dose escalation design, with study treatment administered orally once daily for 15 days.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> Adult male and female patients with CF aged 18&#x02013;55 years and having percent predicted forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) &#x02265; 50% and &#x02264; 90% as well as body mass index of least 17.0 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> were eligible to participate in this study.

These data are presented as percentage change from baseline for each individual patient, then compared as the combined group of all patients receiving acebilustat (treated, including both the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups) vs. placebo and also by individual treatment groups (placebo, 50 mg acebilustat, and 100 mg acebilustat). Samples for sputum microbiology were examined from study days &#x02010;1 (baseline), 2 (day after first dose), 9 (interim), 16 (end of treatment), and 22 (follow&#x02010;up), and analyzed longitudinally or by comparing colony&#x02010;forming units (CFUs) at the end of treatment (day after final treatment) to baseline (day before first treatment).</p><p>Two systemic markers of inflammation were studied; serum C&#x02010;reactive protein (CRP) and circulating neutrophil count. Blood samples collected on study day 14 (day before final treatment) were compared with specimens taken at baseline (day prior to first treatment). Treatment was stopped early for one patient in the placebo group due to increased CRP on study day 8.

The study patients ranged in age from 21&#x02013;39 years old, in body weight from 51.0&#x02013;98.3 kg, and in body mass index from 19.60&#x02013;27.90 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. A total of 16 patients completed the study. One patient in the placebo group discontinued participation in the study prior to dosing on day 8 due to an adverse event of elevated serum CRP. Therefore, this patient was excluded from the analyses other than safety, resulting in a placebo group size of four. Hematology measures were not taken for one patient in the 100 mg acebilustat dose group on day 14, therefore, this patient is excluded from the analysis of peripheral blood neutrophils resulting in a 100 mg dose group of 5 and a combined treated group size of 11 for analysis of peripheral blood neutrophil count. In some cases, such as for sputum WBC and neutrophil cell counts, data for specific samples were missing or not obtainable and the group size reflects the lack of analyzable data for these samples.</p><sec id="cts12428-sec-0120"><title>Inflammation biomarkers</title><p>Decreases were observed in all sputum inflammation biomarkers for the acebilustat&#x02010;treated patients compared with their own baselines and to the placebo group.

Treatment of patients with CF with acebilustat for 15 days resulted in apparent reductions in lung and systemic markers of inflammation without adversely affecting pulmonary infection status. For all inflammatory biomarkers examined in blood (CRP) and sputum (WBC, neutrophils, DNA, and elastase), acebilustat treatment showed a reduction compared with placebo. Reductions from baseline values were observed for sputum measures of WBC, neutrophils, DNA, and elastase. Additionally, dose&#x02010;dependent trends either in mean values of reduction from baseline (sputum WBC and neutrophils) or in number of patients showing a reduction from baseline (sputum DNA and elastase) provide additional evidence for an anti&#x02010;inflammatory effect in the lungs of patients with CF treated with once daily oral acebilustat for 15 days.</p><p>Although not statistically significant, the reduction in serum CRP in patients with CF treated with acebilustat when compared with baseline (&#x02010;1.2 mg/L) or to placebo (&#x02010;3.9 mg/L) suggests a potential systemic anti&#x02010;inflammatory effect of acebilustat treatment in patients with CF. This is notable because serum CRP is strongly correlated with systemic inflammatory status and risk for pulmonary exacerbations in CF.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> WBC and neutrophil counts in sputum provide an overall indication of lung inflammation status. Sputum DNA and elastase are important markers of neutrophilic inflammation in CF. Moreover, they are important active contributors to CF lung disease. Neutrophil&#x02010;derived DNA is a significant contributor to mucus viscosity and airway obstruction.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> Elastase is a key mediator of lung tissue degradation, bacterial clearance deficiency and ion transport dysfunction that is highly correlated with lung disease and functional decline.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>
</p><p>Recent reports have suggested that direct inhibition of LTA4H in mice may lead to increased inflammation. This effect is thought to result from decreased clearance of the proinflammatory tripeptide proline&#x02010;glycine&#x02010;proline, which is generated from breakdown of interstitial matrix proteins and eliminated via hydrolysis at the Pro&#x02010;Gly bond by the aminopeptidase function of LTA4H.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> Although proline&#x02010;glycine&#x02010;proline levels in the lung were not measured in this study, it is worth noting that all acebilustat&#x02010;treated patients in this study were colonized with hemophilus and most with pseudomonas, staphylococcus, and streptococcus as well. In spite of the prevalent pulmonary colonization status of the acebilustat&#x02010;treated patients, there was a consistent decrease in all measures of inflammation, including decreases in sputum WBC and neutrophils with correlated decreases in inflammatory neutrophil products (DNA and elastase) and no signs of increased pulmonary infection or systemic inflammation (CRP). The reason for the difference in these outcomes remains to be determined, but could potentially be explained by differences in the level of inhibition of LTA4H aminopeptidase function in the lung, as well as differences between human CF disease and animal model systems. Whatever the source of the disparity in outcomes, the results of this study clearly demonstrate that acebilustat treatment does not seem to increase lung inflammation and, in contrast, provide strong evidence that acebilustat reduces lung and systemic inflammation in patients with CF.</p><p>Previous attempts to intervene in LTB4 signaling and its consequent neutrophilic inflammation in CF have met with mixed outcomes. Konstan <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> and VanDevanter <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> showed that high&#x02010;dose ibuprofen was able to reduce the decline of lung function over time and to improve survival in patients with CF. The likely mechanism of the high&#x02010;dose ibuprofen therapeutic effect in patients with CF has been attributed to a secondary pharmacology of reducing LTB4 production based on nonclinical and clinical studies.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> In contrast, a large phase II clinical trial of the LTB4 receptor antagonist amelubant (BIIL&#x02010;284) in patients with CF showed an increase in acute pulmonary exacerbations, leading to early termination of the study and discontinuation of the program.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> No cause for the increased pulmonary exacerbations could be attributed from the clinical studies of amelubant, however, in subsequent nonclinical studies, the increase in pulmonary exacerbations was attributed to increased infection with amelubant treatment.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> Whether this effect is unique to LTB4 receptor blockade or resulted from too great a level of pathway inhibition remains unknown, however, pharmacodynamic data suggest that the dosages and exposures of amelubant in the terminated phase II trial were in excess of that required for complete inhibition of BLT receptor signaling.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> Regardless of the origin of the increased pulmonary exacerbations observed in the phase II study, the experience with amelubant urges caution in development of anti&#x02010;inflammatory treatments for CF. In contrast, the clinical experience with high&#x02010;dose ibuprofen suggests that the effect seen with amelubant is not a general feature of intervention in LTB4 signaling.</p><p>Acebilustat was safe and well tolerated in this study. Adverse events were generally characterized as mild to moderate in severity and were characterized by the investigators as unlikely or not related to the study drug. In addition to the clinical safety assessments, circulating neutrophil counts and sputum microbiology were monitored during the course of the study. No treatment&#x02010;related changes were observed in these measures. For circulating neutrophils, there was no difference from placebo or change from baseline for the acebilustat&#x02010;treated patients with CF. Conversely, the lack of a trend toward increase in circulating neutrophil counts after 15 days of acebilustat treatment suggests that acebilustat is unlikely to increase circulating neutrophils, as was observed for amelubant after 28 days of treatment.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> Sputum microbiology did not show any longitudinal pattern of increase in total bacterial load, individual genera, or total genera in acebilustat&#x02010;treated patients with CF. There was also no increase in total bacterial load compared with placebo, and no dose&#x02010;dependent change from baseline was observed. Together, these results provide further evidence that treatment with 50 mg or 100 mg acebilustat is not generally immunosuppressive and is not likely to increase susceptibility to pulmonary infection in patients with CF.</p><p>In spite of the encouraging reductions in markers of lung inflammation observed in patients with CF in this study, no change was observed for spirometry measures or lung clearance index with 15 days of acebilustat treatment. Because clearance of preexisting neutrophilic material is slow in patients with CF due to thickened mucus, stifled ciliary beat, and dysfunctional lung clearance is exacerbated by neutrophilic DNA, sputum DNA and elastase values can be expected to change more slowly than neutrophil counts.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> It is therefore likely that the trends toward reduction in these important disease effectors observed in this study will continue to accrue over time with continued treatment. Consequently, an even slower change in clinical outcomes, such as FEV1, is reasonably anticipated with treatments that primarily act by reducing lung inflammation in CF. This effect is in contrast to that observed for treatments that improve CF transmembrane conductance regulator function, such as oral ivacaftor, treatments that actively degrade preexisting DNA, such as inhaled dornase alpha, or treatments that reduce bacterial infection, such as inhaled aztreonam, which act in a matter of days to weeks.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> However, the lack of effect on lung function measures in trials of short duration, even in the presence of effects on inflammatory biomarkers, is consistent with prior experience for anti&#x02010;inflammatory treatments in CF.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>, <xref rid="cts12428-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> Conversely, even though high&#x02010;dose ibuprofen has demonstrated meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes in trials of long duration, it exhibited minimal effects on inflammatory biomarkers in the short term.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref> Taken together, these findings indicate that a longer treatment period is required to observe a change in clinical outcomes for anti&#x02010;inflammatory treatments in CF.</p><p>In conclusion, treatment of patients with CF with 50 mg or 100 mg oral acebilustat once daily for 15 days was safe and well tolerated. Although no improvements in lung function were observed in this study, acebilustat treatment showed promising signs of reduced lung and systemic inflammation without signs of increased lung infection or systemic immunosuppression. The results of this study support further development of acebilustat as a new once daily oral anti&#x02010;inflammatory for treatment of CF. A phase II study assessing clinical outcomes in patients with CF after 48 weeks of acebilustat treatment is currently in progress.<xref rid="cts12428-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref>
