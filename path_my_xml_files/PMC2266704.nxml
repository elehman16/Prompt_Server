It is one of several Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapies that have been used for thousands of years in the treatment of a variety of health problems. Today, acupuncture therapy is commonly used for pain control throughout the world, although the putative mechanisms still are unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>TCM is a complete system of healthcare delivery including Qi Gong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], herbal medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and syndrome specific diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Therefore, a discussion of the efficacy of acupuncture must be prefaced with an understanding of the problems that occur when researchers attempt to evaluate treatments from one diagnostic paradigm (i.e., TCM) to diagnoses made with a different paradigm (i.e., allopathic medicine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Many studies have evaluated the use of acupuncture for symptoms that are either side effects of biomedical treatment (e.g., pain, fatigue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] or related to a specific disease process (e.g., OA). TCM syndromes, however, are not equivalent to either of these side effect types as defined by biomedical models. One must therefore use caution when interpreting results from studies that apply a TCM treatment to anything other than a TCM-related diagnosis or syndrome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>TCM syndromes, such as yin/yang deficiencies or qi stagnation, are unique symptom complexes that result from imbalances between the body's various functional systems. Since TCM is based on functional relationships and TCM diagnoses involve syndromes not diseases, no one-to-one correlation of signs and symptoms between TCM diagnoses and biomedical diseases exists. The diagnostic symptom complexes used in TCM differ from an allopathic model, and treatment is given according to individual patterns of system imbalances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Hundreds of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture for various conditions have been conducted and recently RCT studies have been published on pain syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Many studies, however, were poorly designed and few included treatment protocols as applied in actual clinical practice. Nevertheless, in some areas related to pain management, reviews provide sufficient evidence of efficacy to draw clear conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Since the early 1970s, the efficacy of acupuncture for treating clinical conditions has been evaluated in several hundred randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Results from these trials have been synthesized in systematic reviews. However considerable methodological diversity exists in the comprehensiveness of database searches for Cochrane systematic reviews on acupuncture. This diversity makes the reviews prone to bias and adds another layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Also the German GERAC committee has published various studies about the effect of acupuncture in disorders like low back pain, Osteoarthritis of the knee and Migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>We have used acupucture during Scoliosis In-patient Rehabilitation (SIR) regularly for 7 years now for the treatment of back pain and we were wondering as to whether acupuncture could also be helpful in treating the deformity itself.</p><p>A Pub Med search for the key words "Acupuncture" and "Scoliosis"reveals 3 papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] not containing results of studies especially designed for the treatment of scoliosis with the help of acupucture.

After that all patients had to lie down on the left side for 25 min. without any treatment. Thereafter the patients again have been scanned with the Formetric<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>system in order to detect the effect of just lying. Then the patients have been divided into two groups. One group underwent real acupuncture on the first day of the study and the patients of this group were distributed to the equal couch numbers, the others received sham acupuncture and the patients of this group were distributed to the unequal couch numbers. After either treatment lasting 25 min. the patients have been scanned another time with the Formetric<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>system. The patients did not know as to whether they received a real treatment or sham acupuncture.</p><p>The next day the groups have been changed to allow every patient to receive one session with real acupuncture and one session with sham acupuncture.

Left and right of the spine the bladder meridian is located in a double layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The central channel (meridian) on the back is the Du Mai channel (DU). This is why these channels have to be addressed in first place in the treatment of scoliosis with acupuncture.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Location of the Bladder meridian</bold>.

The application of heat on certain acupuncture points did not lead to a spherical spreading of the heat around the spot, but to a longitudinal spreading along meridian-like pathways (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These findings speak for the existence of meridian like channels. However, in the scientific acupuncture community the existence of channels is not regarded as proven. This paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] is discussed heavily and has not been published in a Medline listed journal and has not been replicated.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Thermographical representation of the Bladder meridian</bold>.

Until now no acupuncture concept of treatment has been worked out for the treatment of the deformity itself. Having found some effect of acupuncture (significant improvement of surface rotation) in patients with curvatures on no more than 35 degrees in only one session has been surprising. In bigger patient samples significant results would have been expected for lateral deviation as well.</p><p>This finding has encouraged us to start a controlled study with scoliosis patients receiving a series of 6 acupuncture sessions during Scoliosis In-patient Rehabilitation (SIR).</p><p>Of course we have to take into account the technical error of the Formetric<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-system which is bigger than the average changes after the individual sessions. However we have differences that are at least in part statistically significant comparing the different interventions (L, S and R) and also medically relevant differences justifying preliminary conclusions. We have of course to accept that there are limitations of this study due to the relatively big technical error of the measuring system (15 &#x02013; 20% for Lateral Deviation and Surface Rotation; 5% for Kyphosis Angle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]), however postural sway cannot be regarded as a systematic error and therefore we would expect small changes not to be registered with the help of this device whereas clear tendencies or significant changes erase from the general variability and so are medically relevant. On the other hand there is no other device to measure the effects of exercises in short-term objectively other than x-rays not applicable for a study of this design because of the exposition to radiation.</p><p>When postural sway is not regarded as a systematic error all significant changes may be interpreted as being of medical relevance, while in the individual case the changes cannot be interpreted just by the values. The picture printed out on the Formetric<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-sheet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) therefore gives additional information, which however is also subject to postural sway.</p><p>There was a slight improvement of lateral deviation in the side lying intervention without any influence on surface rotation. This might be due to the fact that most of the curves were right thoracic and lying on the concavity unloads the curve without an influence on the deformity in 3D.</p><p>It has to be discussed why the changes seem relevant in the subgroup of patients with curvature of no more than 35 degrees while in the whole group of patients no relevant changes have been detected. As we know from certain brace studies bigger curves can be corrected not as easily as smaller curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The reason therefore might be stiffness increasing with curve size and age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore it might be possible that also patients with curvatures bigger than 35 degrees profit from a series of acupuncture.</p><p>In the very end it has to be discussed, as pointed out by Bunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], that it has become apparent from many reports that, although there is a significant correlation between clinical deformity and radiographic measurement, the standard deviation is so high that it is not possible to reliably predict the degree of curvature from surface topography in any given patient by any technique" Bunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] also states that, in general, clinical deformity is disproportionately greater than expected for the degree of Cobb angle in the early stages of the development of scoliosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>One session with real (verum) acupuncture seems to have an influence on the deformity of scoliosis patients with no more than 35 degrees. The findings during verum acupuncture clearly are different to sham acupuncture or just lying, while in the whole group of patients also including patients with curvatures of more than 35 degrees no obvious changes have been found. The results of this study justify further investigation of the effect of acupuncture in the treatment of patients with scoliosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HRW: Study design, performance of treatments, manuscript writing.</p><p>SB, AJ and SP: Patient acquisition, patient grouping, organization.</p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>All participants and their parents signed an informed concent stating that they would take part in a randomized trial receiving either chinese or non chinese acupuncture points and omitting bracing for three days.</p><p>The first author is thankful to Christine Botens-Helmus for providing fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of the photographs taken during the study.
