Before the beginning measurements all the patients were separated to 2 groups according to simple random table. Standard physical therapy and PNF were given to the Group I (n=20); and Standard physical therapy and Mulligan Concept were added to the Group II (n=20). In the evaluation process the demographic data of the patients, pain severity (VAS), functional level (Constant shoulder score) and quality of life (SF-36) measurement were done. The measurements were done before treatment, after treatment and 3 month later.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Before treatment, VAS score, Constant shoulder score and quality of life scores were similar and there were no statistically differences between two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). After treatment and 3 month later, VAS score decreased, Constant Shoulder score increased in both groups(p&#x0003c;0.05). For Group I, SF-36 physical component and mental component scores increased after treatment (p&#x0003c;0.05), but mental component score was not change in Group II (p&#x0003e;0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in the VAS score, Constant Shoulder Score, and mental health score between Groups I and II after treatment and 3 month (p &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The results of our study suggested that PNF and Mulligan concept could influence positively on shoulder pain, functional level of upper extremity and quality of life in patients with SIS and these effects were similar.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
