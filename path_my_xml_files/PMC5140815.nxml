support insoles in order to improve the medial longitudinal arch of flatfoot and compare
the results to identify the effects of the foregoing exercises on the dynamic balance of
the feet and the lower limbs. [Subjects and Methods] Fourteen university students with
flexible flatfoot were selected by conducting navicular drop tests and randomly assigned
to a short foot exercise group of seven subjects and an arch support insoles group of
seven subjects. The intervention in the experiment was implemented for 30 minutes per
time, three times per week for five weeks in total. [Results] In inter-group comparison
conducted through navicular drop tests and Y-balance tests, the short foot exercise group
showed significant differences. Among intra-group comparisons, in navicular drop tests,
the short foot exercise group showed significant decreases. In Y-balance tests, both the
short foot exercise group and the arch support insoles group showed significant increases.
[Conclusion] In the present study, it could be seen that to improve flatfoot, applying
short foot exercises was more effective than applying arch support insoles in terms of
medial longitudinal arch improvement and dynamic balance ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Short foot exercise</kwd><kwd>Arch support insoles</kwd><kwd>Flatfoot</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although the feet occupy only 5% of the areas of the human body, they control postures
through afferent information obtained through the sense of the soles, provide stability for
maintenance of balance, and absorb impacts<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The deformation into flatfoot is induced when the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) has
descended because the arch had been excessively relaxed to the extent that the arch cannot
be maintained and causes the feet to be excessively pronated compared to normal feet so that
heel eversion appears and the weight load is shifted inward to compress the MLA<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When the MLA has descended or has been completely lost leading to structural or functional
deformation, the ability to absorb impacts will decrease and the sense of balance will be
lost so that stability decreases during walking or running leading to walking difficulties
and endurance decreases<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Foot wedges are clinically applied for correction of diverse foot diseases and for
maintenance of balance<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and customized
insoles are used for correction of pronated feet<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Insoles widen the contact surface of the sole to improve stability
during weight bearing, reduce turning actions when the foot has been pronated or supinated,
and can be applied to the medial longitudinal arch of the foot to increase the sensory
inputs of the sole<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Study results have
been reported indicating that the conservative intervention methods of foot orthotics using
support for the arch of the foot improve malformations of the foot, are effective for leg
alignment and pain control, and improve gaits to become normal<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The previous reported that sole stimulation could improve the motor sensation and postural
movements to maintain proper postures<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Sensory-motor training applies the proprioceptive feedback of the body to activate the
abductor pollicis muscle and the flexor hallucis brevis muscle, which are the intrinsic
muscles of the feet important for maintenance of the MLA, to help the formation of the arch
and the maintenance of the balance of the body<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, sensory-motor training delivers proprioceptive
sensory signals to the sensory cortex area of the brain and affects even the motor area to
improve the asymmetric muscle tone of the sole and draw appropriate new movements thereby
improving the motor sensation and postural disturbance to help maintaining the balance and
stability of the body<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fiolkowski et al. reported that sensory stimulation
training was helpful for flatfoot patients to form and support the arch<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among exercise methods to improve flatfoot, toe bending exercises or towel-curl exercises
mainly mobilize the extrinsic muscles of the foot such as the flexor digitorum longus
muscle<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, short foot exercises
(SFE) are sensory-motor training that activates the intrinsic muscles of the foot and
actively forms the longitudinal arch and the horizontal arch<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although studies
utilizing foot orthotics such as therapeutic footwear, wedges, and insoles to improve the
MLA of flatfoot have been mainly conducted, studies for improvement of flatfoot that
compared foot orthotics with sensory-motor training such as SFE are insufficient.</p><p>Therefore, the present study is intended to improve the MLA of flatfoot and investigate the
effects of the improvement on the dynamic balance of the feet and the lower limbs to
identify effective application methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the present study were 14 university students (males 10, females 4) aged 21
to 26&#x02005;years sampled from among students in the health college of S University in Asan-si,
Chungcheongnam-do and the experiments were conducted from October to December 2015. Before
the experiments, the overall details of the purpose and procedure of the present study were
explained to all subjects pursuant to the ethical standard of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the subject voluntarily agreed to participate in the experiments. The subjects that
participated in the experiments were randomly assigned to an SFE group of seven subjects and
an arch support insoles (ASI) group of seven subjects.</p><p>The selection criteria for participating subjects regarded the foot used to kick balls as
the dominant foot to select subjects with flatfoot. Navicular drop tests (NDT) were
conducted to select those that had flexible flatfoot with a 10&#x02005;cm or larger difference in
the navicular tuberosity heights and those that were performing lower limb exercises
separately, or had any foot hypoesthesia, fracture, dislocation, skin disease, or vascular
disease were excluded. The dominant foot of all subjects was the right foot. The subjects&#x02019;
general characteristics are as shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

&#x000b1; 6.9&#x02005;cm, and 68.2 &#x000b1; 12.9&#x02005;kg respectively. The ASI group&#x02019;s mean age, height, and weight were
24.1 &#x000b1; 1.5&#x02005;years, 167.0 &#x000b1; 6.7&#x02005;cm, and 63.3 &#x000b1; 17.6&#x02005;kg respectively.</p><p>SFE was implemented as sensory-motor training for improvement in the flatfoot of the
experimental group. Before the intervention, the researcher demonstrated the short foot
exercises while giving verbal instructions. Thereafter, each subject was instructed to sit
on a height-adjustable chair and bend the hip joint, knee joints, and ankle joints to 90&#x000b0;
and a towel was placed below the feet. Thereafter, the subject was instructed to pull the
head of the first metatarsal bone toward the heel without bending the toes and maintain the
state for 20 sec to form the MLA. During the exercise, to prevent the forefoot and the heel
from being lifted off the ground and smoothly induce the flexion of the head of the
metatarsal bone, the measurer gently held the instep and the heel<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The posture was maintained for 10 sec followed by 5 sec
and this process was implemented for 30 minutes per time, three times per week for a total
of five weeks.</p><p>As a method for improvement in the flatfoot of the control group, insoles were applied as
medial arch support structures. To make the insoles, the foot shape of each subject was
sketched on 3.2&#x02005;mm thick Aquaplast-T<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Sammons Preston Rolyan, USA), which is a
thermoplastic material. Thereafter, the Aquaplast-T<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was cut out using scissors,
wetted with 100&#x02005;&#x000b0;C water, and attached to the sole of the subject to copy the foot and the
height of the arch. Thereafter, the MLA was made with a shore value of 20&#x000b0; and a height of
at least 15 mm<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The insoles made as
such were given to the subjects and the subjects were instructed to put the insoles into
their running shoes and walk on flatlands for 30 minutes per time, three times per week for
a total of five weeks.</p><p>NDTs were conducted to measure changes in the height of the MLA. In the NDT, each subject
was instructed to sit on a chair with the knee joint bent to 90&#x000b0; and align the second toe
and the knee so that the subtalar joint was placed on the neutral position and under a
non-weight bearing condition, the distance from the ground to the navicular tuberosity was
measured and marked. Thereafter, the distance from the ground to the navicular tuberosity
was measured in a standing position with the feet place at shoulder width and weight bearing
by the two feet. Using a plastic ruler and a 3&#x000d7;5 index card, the difference in the height of
the navicular tuberosity between the non-weight bearing(sitting position) position and the
weight bearing (standing position) position was measured three times repeatedly and the
average value was used.</p><p>Y-balance tests (YBT) (Move2Perform, Evansville, IN, USA) were conducted to measure the
dynamic balance ability of the leg. The Y-balance test (YBT) kit consists of three
directional (anterior, posteromedial, posterolateral) PVC pipe graduated rulers. Each
subject stood on the platform located on the center on the YBT kit with the bare foot of the
leg to be measured and pushed the reach indicator placed on the PVC pipe graduated ruler
with the other leg and the maximum reached distance was measured. The PVC pipe graduated
ruler has 0.5&#x02005;cm grades and thus the distance was recorded in 0.5&#x02005;cm units. During the
measurement, considering the reaching ability depending on leg lengths, the leg length of
each subject was measured and normalized and to minimize learning effects on measurement,
reaching was practiced two times in each direction before measurement. The measurement was
performed in the same order of directions and each distance was measured two times and the
average value was calculated. Normalized composite reach distance was computed for each leg
as the sum of the maximum reach distances (in centimeter) in the 3 directions, divided by 3
times the limb length, and then multiplied by 100<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The measured data were statistically processed using PASW Statistics ver. 18.0. The general
characteristics of the subjects were presented as means and standard deviations using
descriptive statistics (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Independent
t-tests were conducted to compare the amounts of changes between the two groups and Paired
t-tests were used to measure differences before and after experiment in each group. The
statistical significance level was set to &#x003b1;=0.05 for all data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes in the NDT and YBT of the SFE group and the ASI group are as shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of changes in navicular drop height and dynamic balance between the

and the ASI group showed significant increases (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the case of flatfoot, as the pronated state of the heel is maintained, the talus bone is
moved to the inside of the sole leading to the disappearance of the medial longitudinal arch
so that the ability to accommodate and distribute the weight is reduced compared to normal
persons<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Structural deformation of the
feet leads to lesions in the ankle joint and the feet and problems in lower limb joints,
results in early fatigue and pain due to the excessive compensating actions of the intrinsic
muscles and the extrinsic muscles, and causes problems in the stability and balance of the
feet during gaits<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. To improve these
flatfoot conditions, methods that correct the MLA using foot orthotics or therapeutic
footwear are universally used<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other
intervention methods include SFE for strengthening the intrinsic muscles and extrinsic
muscles of the foot through sensory-motor training. Synder et al. presented SFE as the most
positive method among methods of correcting the eversion of the subtalar articulation<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SFE induces the head of the
metatarsal bone to approach the heel without bending the toes in a state where the weight is
borne<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, attempts were made to improve flatfoot conditions through changes in
the height of the MLA by applying SFE for six weeks. According to the results of measurement
using NDT, the descending distance of the navicular bone decreased from 11.4 &#x000b1; 1.6&#x02005;mm before
intervention to 7.7 &#x000b1; 1.1&#x02005;mm after intervention indicating that SFE was effective. However,
in the ASI group, changes in the medial longitudinal arch were not significant. In a study
conducted by Allen &#x00026; Glasoe, the mean descending distance of the MLA was shown to be 7.3
&#x000b1; 3.8&#x02005;mm<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. This indicates that a
flexible flatfoot can form ab arch close to that of normal feet through exercise through SFE
for six weeks. Lynn et al. reported that towel-curl exercises implemented for four weeks as
foot intrinsic muscle strengthening exercises were effective<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and Jung et al. reported that when toe curl exercises and arch
formation exercises were applied, the rear foot angle significantly decreased while foot
intrinsic muscle strength was improved<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Telfer et al. reported that changes in the structure of the arch of the sole affected
balance ability and gait ability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
present study, when dynamic balance was measured using YBT, both the SFE group and the ASI
group showed significant improvement between before and after intervention within each
group. This is considered attributable to the fact that short foot exercises improved the
functions and activity of the abductor pollicis muscle that plays the role of bearing the
weight and pushing the body forward during push off in gaits and the flexor hallucis brevis
muscle that maintains the MLA during the terminal stance in gaits to maintain foot
stability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reason why dynamic
balance ability was significantly improved in the group applied with arch support insoles is
considered to be the fact that the support for the medial longitudinal arch reduced maximum
load reactions to improve leg stability thereby brining about dynamic biomechanical
effects<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, short foot exercises and arch support insoles were applied to improve
flatfoot conditions and it could be seen that as the medial longitudinal arch was improved,
dynamic balance ability was improved. In addition, it could be seen that sensory-motor
training such as short foot exercises was more effective than conservative treatment methods
such as arch support insoles. In addition, it could be seen that the intervention period of
six weeks was not sufficient to improve the medial longitudinal arch using arch support
insoles. Detailed comparison studies combining sensory-motor training of the foot and arch
support insoles with more sufficient intervention periods are necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hillstrom</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kraszewski</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Foot type biomechanics part 1: structure and function of
