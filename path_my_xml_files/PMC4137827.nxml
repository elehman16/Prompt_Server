Parenteral anticoagulants (e.g. heparins) are used mostly as short-term therapies, whereas vitamin&#x02009;K antagonists (VKAs, e.g. warfarin) have, until recently, been the only oral agents available for long-term anticoagulant therapy. The anticoagulant effect of the VKAs is produced by interference with the cyclic interconversion of vitamin&#x02009;K and its 2,3 epoxide, leading to the hepatic production of coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X with reduced coagulant activity <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Although effective, the VKAs have a narrow therapeutic window, variable responses, and multiple food and drug interactions, which necessitate regular coagulation monitoring and dose titration. The anticoagulation intensity of the VKAs is determined by the prothrombin time (PT), expressed as the international normalized ratio (INR) <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Novel oral anticoagulants that directly target single coagulation factors (i.e. factor&#x02009;Xa or factor&#x02009;IIa) have been developed to overcome some of the limitations associated with the traditional anticoagulants, and some of these agents have already been approved for clinical use in specific indications. Owing to their mode of action, these novel agents also affect coagulation tests (such as PT) <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>The PT is a global clotting test that can be used to assess the extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade; the test is sensitive for deficiencies in factors II, V, VII and X <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct factor&#x02009;Xa inhibitor. Dose-dependent prolongation of PT by rivaroxaban was observed in phase&#x02009;I studies in healthy subjects and phase&#x02009;II studies in the prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery of the hip or knee, when Neoplastin was used for the assay <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. However, the PT responses vary markedly between reagents and, as with other direct factor&#x02009;Xa inhibitors, the INR system used for monitoring the VKAs does not correct for the variations observed with rivaroxaban when different PT reagents are used <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Rivaroxaban has been investigated extensively for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders, including thromboprophylaxis after major orthopaedic surgery <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, and secondary prevention in patients with acute coronary syndrome <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. In the phase&#x02009;III ROCKET AF study for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban 20&#x02009;mg once daily (od; 15&#x02009;mg for patients with creatinine clearance 30&#x02013;49&#x02009;ml&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) was compared with INR-adjusted warfarin (target range 2.0&#x02013;3.0). The study enrolled not only VKA-na&#x000ef;ve patients, but also patients who were receiving warfarin and then transitioned to rivaroxaban. The transition took place when the INR was below 3.0 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. It is anticipated that, in clinical practice, some patients who require long-term anticoagulation and receive warfarin may be transitioned to rivaroxaban therapy. The main objective of the present study was to examine changes in a set of relevant pharmacodynamic parameters during the transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban. Such changes would be expected in similar transition settings (such as for some patients in ROCKET AF). This study was conducted in healthy individuals who were suitable for the required frequent study procedures, which might not be practical in an elderly patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants and study design</title><p>This multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study enrolled 96 healthy men, aged 18&#x02013;45 years, with a body mass index of 18&#x02013;29&#x02009;kg m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. Randomization was carried out after a prestudy examination. The listed subjects were assigned to random numbers, starting with 01 in ascending order as they were listed. The treatment was determined by the randomization list. The study centres were as follows: ClinPharmCologne &#x02013; MEDA Manufacturing GmbH, K&#x000f6;ln, Germany; and Clinical Research Services M&#x000f6;nchengladbach GmbH, M&#x000f6;nchengladbach, Germany.</p><p>Variants of the enzyme that metabolizes warfarin, cytochrome P450 2C9, and of a key pharmacological target of warfarin, vitamin&#x02009;K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), contribute to differences in patients' responses to warfarin <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Therefore, genotyping was carried out to minimize potential genetic influence that may lead to changes in exposure in this phase&#x02009;I setting. Only individuals homozygous for the wild-type allele <italic>CYP2C9*1</italic> and homozygous or heterozygous carriers of the C-allele at positions 6484 and 7566 of the <italic>VKORC1</italic> gene, respectively, were randomized. A sample for the pharmacogenetic analysis was taken at a separate examination visit before the prestudy examination. Subjects were required to have a resting heart rate of 45&#x02013;90&#x02009;beats&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, systolic blood pressure of 100&#x02013;140&#x02009;mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &#x0003c;85&#x02009;mmHg and no relevant pathological changes in their electrocardiograms. Exclusion criteria included any clinically relevant condition or medical history that could affect the study results, such as known coagulation disorders (e.g. von Willebrand's disease, haemophilia), known disorders with increased risks of bleeding (e.g. periodontitis, haemorrhoids, acute gastritis, peptic ulcer) or a tendency to common causes of bleeding (e.g. nasal bleeding).</p><p>All subjects provided written, informed consent prior to enrolment. Study documentation was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the North Rhine Medical Council (D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany).

A randomization list was set up by Global Biostatistics, Bayer HealthCare (Wuppertal, Germany). In treatment group&#x02009;A, warfarin (Coumadin&#x000ae;; BMS, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany) was administered in varying doses from day &#x02212;6 to &#x02212;1 (10&#x02009;mg od or lower on days &#x02212;6 and &#x02212;5; and 2.5, 5, 10, 12.5 or 15&#x02009;mg od from day &#x02212;4 to &#x02212;1, depending on INR levels), to achieve a steady state of warfarin (INR 2.0&#x02013;3.0); rivaroxaban 20&#x02009;mg od was given for 4 days (days 0&#x02013;3) starting 24&#x02009;h after warfarin was stopped. In treatment group&#x02009;B, the same warfarin regimens as treatment group&#x02009;A were used to achieve an INR of 2.0&#x02013;3.0, followed by placebo od for 4 days (days 0&#x02013;3) starting 24&#x02009;h after warfarin was discontinued. The pretreatment period with warfarin could be prolonged for each individual until the target INR of 2.0&#x02013;3.0 was reached. On day&#x02009;5, 10&#x02009;mg vitamin&#x02009;K (Konakion&#x000ae;; Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was administered to subjects receiving treatments A and B, prior to discharge. In treatment group&#x02009;C, rivaroxaban 20&#x02009;mg od was given for 4 days (days 0&#x02013;3) without prior warfarin treatment. The study design was single blinded for treatment groups A and B, and open label for treatment group&#x02009;C. In all treatment groups, the study drug was administered in the morning after a standard breakfast with &#x0223c;240&#x02009;ml of water.

The following pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed: anti-factor&#x02009;Xa activity, inhibition of factor&#x02009;Xa activity, PT, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), HepTest, prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT), factor&#x02009;VIIa activity, factor&#x02009;IIa activity and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP).</p><p>Anti-factor Xa activity was determined using a spectrophotometric method based on a two-step assay procedure (Berichrom Heparin; Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). A defined quantity of factor&#x02009;Xa was added to the plasma sample and incubated for 1&#x02009;min at 37&#x000b0;C, allowing for inactivation of the exogenous factor&#x02009;Xa activity by inhibitors in the sample, followed by addition of a chromogenic substrate (Z-D-Leu-Gly-Arg-ANBA-methyl amide) and further incubation for 1&#x02009;min at 37&#x000b0;C, to quantify the residual factor&#x02009;Xa activity. The absorbance was determined by spectrophotometry at 405&#x02009;nm, and the amount of anti-factor&#x02009;Xa activity in the sample was read from a calibration curve produced from a set of calibration samples with known low-molecular-weight heparin concentrations. Inhibition of factor&#x02009;Xa activity, PT (using Neoplastin&#x000ae; as a reagent; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), aPTT and HepTest were determined as described previously <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The PiCT was performed as a one-step measurement (Pefakit PiCT reagent kit; Pentapharm Ltd, Potters Bar, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p><sec><title>Endogenous thrombin potential</title><p>Endogenous thrombin potential was measured using the calibrated automated thrombogram integrated ETP assay platform of Thrombinoscope (Maastricht, The Netherlands) in platelet-poor plasma samples after the addition of recombinant tissue factor (final concentration 1&#x02009;p<sc>m</sc>). A fluorogenic thrombin substrate was added, and the formation of thrombin in the sample was quantified using a microtitre plate reader (FluoroScan; ThermoFisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany). The amount of thrombin formed per time interval was determined from the slope of the fluorescence curve and quantified <italic>vs</italic>. the calibrators. The parameters determined were as follows: lag time; peak thrombin generation rate; time to peak thrombin generation rate; and area under the effect&#x02013;time curve (AUC).</p></sec><sec><title>Factor VIIa and factor IIa activities</title><p>Factor VIIa and factor IIa activities were determined using optical coagulometric assays. Standard human plasma, control plasma samples, and factor&#x02009;II- and factor&#x02009;VII-deficient plasma were used in conjunction with the Dade Innovin Reagent kit (all obtained from Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) in the thromboplastin time assay. The results were obtained using a reference curve generated with standard human plasma or pooled normal plasma mixed with the deficient plasma. Partial inhibition of the specific coagulation factor in the plasma samples to be analysed reduces its ability to compensate for the absence of the factor in the corresponding factor-deficient plasma included in the assay mixture, resulting in a prolonged thromboplastin assay time.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Blood samples were collected at predetermined intervals, and the plasma samples were stored at &#x02212;15&#x000b0;C or lower until analysis at the DMPK Bioanalytics Laboratory of Bayer Pharma AG (Wuppertal, Germany).

Baseline was defined as the last measurement before the first warfarin dose in the warfarin followed by rivaroxaban group (A) and the warfarin followed by placebo group (B). In the rivaroxaban alone group (C), baseline was defined as the measurement immediately before first dose of rivaroxaban. The kinetic characteristics [including AUC from time&#x02009;0 to the last data point (AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;<italic>tn</italic>)</sub>) and maximal effect (<italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub>)] of PT prolongation were analysed in an explorative manner.

The first visit occurred on 11 November 2008 and the last visit was on 10 November 2009; the study was completed on 9 April 2010. Thirteen subjects discontinued the study prematurely; among these, five did not receive any study medication, a further seven received only warfarin prior to discontinuation, and a single subject had elevated alanine aminotransferase levels after warfarin administration before the first dose of rivaroxaban. Subjects were valid for inclusion in the safety analysis (91 subjects) if they received at least one dose of study medication.

Most adverse events were of mild intensity, a few were moderate and none was severe; all were resolved by the end of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given that the mode of actions and the pharmacodynamics of warfarin and rivaroxaban are different, it is important to understand fully the impact on coagulation parameters of a transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban therapy. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the changes in pharmacodynamic parameters during transitioning from warfarin at therapeutic anticoagulation level (INR 2.0&#x02013;3.0) to rivaroxaban 20&#x02009;mg od; a regimen that was used in the phase&#x02009;III ROCKET AF study <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [a reduced dose (15&#x02009;mg od) was used for patients with moderate renal impairment]. The dose of rivaroxaban selected in this study reflects the most common therapeutic dose in clinical settings when a transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban therapy may be indicated.</p><p>Guidelines recommend a therapeutic INR range of 2.0&#x02013;3.0 for long-term anticoagulant therapy, such as for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (in combination with a parenteral anticoagulant during the initial treatment period) and long-term prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. This target range is usually maintained with a daily warfarin dose between 2.5 and 10&#x02009;mg. In the present study, warfarin was given for &#x0223c;6&#x02009;days until the INR range was 2.0&#x02013;3.0 before transitioning to rivaroxaban. Immediately before the transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban or placebo, median INR values were 2.2 in the warfarin followed by rivaroxaban group (treatment&#x02009;A) and 2.3 in the warfarin followed by placebo group (treatment&#x02009;B).</p><p>Given that PT is the most sensitive clotting assay for both rivaroxaban and warfarin, this assay displayed the largest degree of interaction, with supra-additive effects. Individual absolute INR values in the range of 4.19&#x02013;10.29 were reached at 27&#x02009;h after the last dose of warfarin and 3&#x02009;h after the first dose of rivaroxaban. The INR values during the first 3 days after switching displayed time profiles known for rivaroxaban. The effect of rivaroxaban was added to the residual effect of warfarin on the INR profiles. The peak INR values declined over the first 3 days after switching from warfarin to rivaroxaban. The effects of warfarin followed by rivaroxaban were more than additive but not exponential compared with the effects of warfarin followed by placebo and rivaroxaban alone. As expected, the PT assay picked up the effects of both warfarin and rivaroxaban. However, when PT/INR was measured at the trough level of rivaroxaban, it was capable of detecting the warfarin effect with minimal impact from rivaroxaban, suggesting that if therapy transitioning from rivaroxaban to warfarin is required in certain circumstances, INR monitoring of the warfarin effect should be performed at the trough concentration of rivaroxaban during the co-administration period.</p><p>Inhibition of factor&#x02009;Xa activity, aPTT and ETP were also enhanced during the transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban in the present study; these assays are expected to be influenced by both agents. Combined effects were additive for inhibition of factor&#x02009;Xa activity, and a small additive effect was observed for ETP and aPTT. However, the rivaroxaban-induced changes recovered to baseline levels within 24&#x02009;h, whereas recovery of warfarin-induced changes took &#x0223c;4 days after the last warfarin dose. In contrast, the effects of rivaroxaban on anti-factor&#x02009;Xa activity, HepTest and PiCT were not affected by pretreatment with warfarin; thus, these tests were capable of detecting the effects of rivaroxaban in the presence of warfarin. Treatment with rivaroxaban caused a small reduction of factor&#x02009;VIIa, but the effect was considered to be a result of the assay used. As expected, rivaroxaban had no relevant additional effect on warfarin-induced factor&#x02009;IIa activity.</p><p>In general, it was expected that all pharmacodynamic parameters would display different results depending on the assay set-up. All tests that rely on endogenous factor&#x02009;Xa were affected both by rivaroxaban and warfarin and would, therefore, show a pharmacodynamic interaction. This was the case for inhibition of factor&#x02009;Xa activity, PT (both in seconds and INR), aPTT and ETP. In contrast, assays where activated factor&#x02009;X is added to the sample such as anti-factor&#x02009;Xa, HepTest and PiCT assays, were capable of detecting the effect of rivaroxaban but not warfarin and were, therefore, able to detect the effect of rivaroxaban independent of warfarin during the switching period. Therefore, the effect depended on the types of tests used to measure the magnitude of the pharmacodynamic changes during the switching period from warfarin to rivaroxaban when supra-additive (INR), additive (inhibition of factor&#x02009;Xa, aPTT, ETP) or non-additive (anti-factor&#x02009;Xa activity, Heptest, PiCT) effects were observed. However, the pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban were not influenced by warfarin, and vice versa.</p><p>Studies have indicated that the anti-factor&#x02009;Xa chromogenic method is the best test for assessing rivaroxaban exposure when used in conjunction with rivaroxaban calibrators and controls <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, if a quantitative assessment of rivaroxaban exposure is required in certain clinical situations. It should be emphasized that, although rivaroxaban affects the PT/INR, this system is not suitable for assessing the anticoagulant intensity of rivaroxaban <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. However, the conventional PT/INR is essential for monitoring the residual anticoagulant effect after the cessation of warfarin. As a result of the time frame required for newly produced fully functional coagulation factors, there is a delay in the recovery of coagulation activity after warfarin cessation. Conversely, if a transition from rivaroxaban to a VKA is planned, INR measurement of VKA activity using blood samples taken 24&#x02009;h after rivaroxaban administration can be used as guidance for dose titration of the VKA, because the effect of rivaroxaban on the PT/INR is minimal at this time point.</p><p>Pretreatment with warfarin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban after transitioning from warfarin (INR 2.0&#x02013;3.0) to rivaroxaban 20&#x02009;mg od. Pharmacokinetic parameters on the first day of rivaroxaban treatment after warfarin were similar to those for treatment with rivaroxaban alone. In addition, rivaroxaban did not influence the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of warfarin during transitioning from warfarin to rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban was safe and well tolerated; however, this was a mechanistic study in healthy subjects and safety was not the main focus. One limitation of the present study is that rivaroxaban 20&#x02009;mg od was administered for a period of only 4 days in highly selected, healthy subjects. The focus of the study was to investigate mechanistically the effects of warfarin and rivaroxaban on different coagulation tests during a transition period. The present study is not able to take into account for effects of age, comorbidities and concomitant medications which will most probably modify the individual response in a real-world patient population. Nevertheless, the data describe, in principle, which pharmacodynamic changes might be expected during transition from warfarin (INR 2.0&#x02013;3.0) to rivaroxaban 20&#x02009;mg od <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that the pharmacodynamic profiles during the transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban vary and depend on the type of test used. An expected supra-additive effect was observed on the prolongation of PT/INR during the initial transitioning period, with very limited influence of rivaroxaban on the PT/INR at 24&#x02009;h after dosing. Based on these data, INR monitoring should be stopped once rivaroxaban is initiated during the transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban. Conversely, when switching from rivaroxaban to warfarin, INR monitoring of warfarin therapy should be performed at trough rivaroxaban levels during the co-administration period.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>All authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf">http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</ext-link> (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: DK, MB, WM and JK had editorial support from Yong-Ling Liu for the submitted work; DK, MB, WM and JK have been employees of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals in the previous 3 years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by Bayer HealthCare AG.
