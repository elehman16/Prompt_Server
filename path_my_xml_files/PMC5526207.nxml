Research notes that caring for a person with dementia poses numerous challenges due to continued advancement of the disease and eventually, may contribute to decreased caregiver health. Dementia caregivers, compared to non-caregivers, have reported fair to poor general health, that caregiving has made their health worse and that they became more frail prior to their care recipient&#x02019;s death [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The physical and emotional impact of dementia caregiving has been associated with $9.7 billion in health care costs in the United States [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Caregiving is a complex process that is affected by the care recipient&#x02019;s dementia severity, caregiver&#x02019;s perceptions of care-related challenges and responsibilities, and caregiver&#x02019;s personality and available resources. These complex factors must be considered when addressing the health impact of caregiving responsibilities and developing interventions designed to protect caregiver health [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Over the past 30 years, more than 200 effective psychoeducational randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted with dementia family caregivers [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The majority of these interventions, however, have focused on psychoeducational, counseling and psychotherapeutic interventions, as well as skill building, case management, support groups, respite care, training of the person with dementia and other multicomponent approaches [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These interventions have focused on the caregiving process, including understanding dementia, managing behavioral symptoms of dementia, providing personal care, reducing caregiver stress, and finding and using community-based services. Nearly 15 years ago, researchers suggested [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that more family caregiver interventions should be placed in a public health context, thus positioning these interventions to have a greater impact on promoting caregiver health and wellness.</p><p id="P7">Physical activity has been identified as one of the best approaches for improving physical and mental health [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, few known family caregiver physical activity interventions have been conducted. The first known 12 month randomized controlled trial (RCT) with dementia family caregivers examined health and quality-of-life effects of moderate-intensity exercise compared to a nutrition intervention in 100 sedentary older female family caregivers [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The intervention resulted in improved sleep quality, total energy expenditure and stress-induced blood-pressure reactivity, as well as improved caregiver perceived stress, burden and depression. A total of 74% of treatment-group caregivers adhered to the three weekly exercise sessions for an average of 35 min/ session [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A second 12 month multicomponent intervention tested a telephone-based physical activity intervention with 137 female spousal caregivers. Outcomes included increased physical activity and exercise self-efficacy, and decreased perceived stress at 6 and 12 months [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Competing caregiver demands and depressive symptoms were barriers to program retention and adherence. A limitation of these studies was that they focused on older White women. More recently, a small international study (N=31) built further upon this work. This RCT reported that treatment group caregivers compared to controls, were able to increase MVPA (&#x02265; 3 Metabolic equivalents [METS]) to 3 times/ week for 12 weeks and also reported significant reductions in caregiver burden, frequency of caregiver fatigue and improvement in sleep quality [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A fourth caregiver physical activity RCT, recently completed by our research team, used the same database reported in this manuscript, but focused on secondary mental health outcomes including: subjective burden, depressive symptoms and positive affect. The treatment group significantly increased caregiver total and total moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and showed greater positive affect at both six (<italic>p</italic>=0.01) and 12 months (<italic>p</italic>=0.03); improved burden at 3 months (<italic>p</italic> 0.03); but had no significant effect on depressive symptoms [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Three other family caregiver-related physical activity studies were excluded from this review for noted differences [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]: Hill et al. did not specify care recipient diagnosis [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; Mardsen et al., focused on stroke survivors [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Teri et al., included a physical activity intervention delivered <italic>by</italic> family caregivers <italic>to</italic> persons with dementia [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="P8">These caregiver physical activity interventions demonstrated that caregivers were able to increase total and total moderate-intensity physical activity; make positive changes in stressors and caregiver resources; and improve some aspects of mental health [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Implications of these studies suggested that (a) individualized home-based telephone interventions are preferred over groups; and (b) caregivers prefer moderate-intensity programs that are simple, non-competitive and consist of shorter bouts of activity. Assisting older caregivers to increase moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA)-known to positively impact physical function, mental and physical health-may offer protective effects for stressed caregivers and enable them to better maintain their caregiving role and their own health for a longer period of time [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="P9">The purpose of this study was to: (1) Examine the context of dementia family caregiving at Baseline and 12-months concerning caregiver and care recipient socio-demographic characteristics; and caregiver stressors, resources and background health to determine if there were differences between the EPAI and CSBI at baseline and 12 months; and (2) Test the hypotheses that the EPAI, compared to the CSBI, will: H1: Attain higher MVPA adherence (&#x02265; 150 min/week); and H2: Attain greater physical function using two <italic>Senior Fitness Tests</italic> (i.e., 2 min Step Test and 30 s Chair Stand).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><p id="P10">This study tested the effectiveness of a 12-month multi-component individualized physical activity intervention. This RCT recruited a community-based sample of strained family caregivers of persons with ADRD on an ongoing basis and assigned them to either the EPAI treatment or CSBI control group. Individualized MVPA was defined as any leisure, ongoing, or planned physical activity that was &#x02265; 150 min/ week (&#x02265; 3 Metabolic Equivalents [METS]) and adapted to caregiver abilities [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The EPAI, a behavior-change intervention, combined content on increasing physical activity with attention to caregiving concerns that might impede such an increase [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, the CSBI control was designed to minimize treatment exposure to physical activity by restricting any reference or focus on physical activity and instead, was tailored after usual-care interventions that focused on care-related education and support, thus being unlikely to have an impact on physical activity [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><sec id="S7"><title>Participants and procedures</title><p id="P11">Detailed participant recruitment methods were previously described [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

This 41-item self-report measure assessed both total and total moderate physical activity, including the range of specific physical activities across all levels of intensity or physical exertion, typically performed by older adults over a one-month time frame. Psychometric properties are well-established and the measure is sensitive to physical activity change in older adults [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Findings supported both study hypotheses. First, a significantly higher percentage of EPAI than CSBI caregivers, demonstrated adherence to MVPA. A major contribution of this study was that the EPAI was more effective in increasing MVPA than the control group- 63% versus 37%; which places EPAI participants amongst the 60&#x02013;63% of older adults in the United States, age 60&#x02013;69 years, who met recommendations for increasing MVPA. Meeting this recommendation has potential positive implications for caregiver health, as this level of physical activity has been associated with reduced risk of chronic disease, premature mortality, and improved functional abilities [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These findings also highlighted the ability of caregivers to balance their own health-related and functional needs alongside their care recipient needs [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p id="P48">The second hypothesis, improving caregiver physical function, was supported by the 2 min Step Test but not the 30 s Chair Stand. These findings highlighted the importance of family caregivers needing to maintain physical function, so as to safely implement care for their impaired family member, as well as maintaining their own health and safety. However qualitative findings, which suggested that nearly one-half of the caregivers had difficulty completing the 2 min Step Test, due either to their own high blood pressure or cardiovascular limitations, highlights the potentially dangerous situations that selected caregivers and care recipients face. This level of aerobic endurance is very important for caregivers&#x02019; physical activities, including stair climbing, walking, transferring their impaired relative from bed to chair or even turning and moving a bed-bound relative [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Of note, is that the overall average of 60&#x02013;62 steps reported at baseline and 12 months for the Step Test, is more similar to persons who would be classified as inactive older adults, ranging from 85&#x02013;89 years, suggesting that numerous caregivers were considerably less active and more impaired than other persons their own age. This same line of reasoning holds true for the Chair Stand test where TRAC caregivers&#x02019; mean number of Chair Stands was slightly lower than what is reported for 80&#x02013;89 year olds [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p id="P49">Other background health-related information noted that caregivers&#x02019; average BMI and weight classified them as being within the range of 43&#x02013;45% of men and women, respectively, between 65&#x02013;74 years, who would be classified as being obese [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Obesity creates greater risk for caregiver physical strain, and also places greater demands upon caregivers when implementing care-related activities such as ambulating and/or transferring care recipients from bed to chair, or moving them in bed.

It is also possible that caregivers initially underestimated their physical activity involvement, but when they were assessed using the CHAMPS, they became more aware of moderate/vigorous types of physical activities in which they were engaging. An earlier pilot study also supported validity between objective and self-report physical activity data [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="P56">Recommendations for the future studies to improve family caregiver physical activity research should emphasize understanding inactivity and the synergy between physical activity and other health behaviors [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A large European cohort study of older adults noted that greatest reductions in mortality risk were observed in the two <italic>lowest</italic> activity groups across levels of general and abdominal adiposity. Researchers suggested that: (1)&#x0201d;efforts to encourage even small increases in activity in inactive individuals may be beneficial to public health&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, p.620]; (2) research also suggests that including self-report and objective measures of physical function assists in characterizing activity patterns and physical functional abilities, and increases understanding of how physical activity and physical function are interrelated; and types of physical activities that may assist older adults in making small physical activity changes [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; (3) further refining program-based components including recruitment and intervention procedures to identify and support caregivers who are most likely to participate, increase physical activity, and remain in, and benefit from a physical activity study; (4) tailoring physical interventions to individual caregiver needs and understanding the minimum level of physical activity needed to produce health effects; (5) recruiting more multicultural family caregivers, considering their needs and specifically tailoring interventions to meet these needs [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and (6) considering technologically-based methods for delivering physical activity interventions to this time-pressured, harder-to-reach population [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S33"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P57">A major contribution of this study was that it used a combination of self-report physical activity and objective physical function outcome data, which may help caregivers to more readily experience how increased physical activity may improve physical function. Limitations included that some caregivers had greater physical function impairment than originally expected. These limitations may have influenced differential attrition between the EPAI and CSBI and may have affected the magnitude of changes seen in MVPA [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Recommendations for future caregiver physical activity studies include: (1) Further develop interdisciplinary research teams prepared to address the combination of caregiver education and support, as well as improvement of physical activity and physical function, as a broader approach to maintaining caregiver health; (2) Design studies that tailor physical activity interventions to caregiver abilities and functional limitations, and further address underlying reasons for caregiver attrition; (3) Expand use of internet-based modalities to increase reach and flexibility of caregiver physical activity studies [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]; and (4) Translate effective physical activity interventions for greater dissemination to family caregivers [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p id="P72"><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p id="P73">C Farran, O Paun, C Etkin, K Rajan and A Eisenstein were authors of a prior publication that used data from this study.
