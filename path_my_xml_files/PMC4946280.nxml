All 101 clinicians-in-training at the Eye and Ear were invited to participate, including 66 junior medical staff (ophthalmology registrars and fellows, ear nose and throat registrars and fellows, and Hospital Medical Officers) and 35 orthoptists in training.</p><p>The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and the design, methods and protocol were approved by the Eye and Ear Human Research and Ethics Committee. Informed written consent was obtained prior to participation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Education program</title><p>The intervention education program was informed by a cross-sectional study of the experiences of Eye and Ear patients. One researcher observed the visit of 51 patients from across 28 outpatient clinics and administered a patient satisfaction questionnaire (based on the Victorian Patient Satisfaction Monitor Survey[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the National Health Service Outpatients Core Questionnaire[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). A Steering Committee of 13, including three consumers reviewed the results and prioritized themes for an education program on patient-centered care. Eight broad themes emerged from the data on patient-centered care: Information, doctor/patient communication, professionalism of the staff, patient fear/anxiety, and delivery of news. Using these concepts, a consumer representative, and qualified educator developed the learning objectives and outcomes for the program. The broad learning outcome was to improve the knowledge, attitude and practice of clinicians-in-training when communicating with patients. Specific learning objectives included the ability to introduce self and role, acknowledge waiting time, provide clear information and explanations, use appropriate questioning techniques, listen actively, use appropriate body language, and develop awareness of inappropriate behavior.</p><p>The intervention program was a 1-h interactive workshop on patient-centered care and communication mainly using patient stories. Presentations were delivered by the parent of an Eye and Ear patient and a practicing medical specialist. At the commencement, participants were invited to describe what &#x0201c;patient-centered care&#x0201d; meant to them and at the conclusion to write down on a post-it-note one thing they would do differently because of the workshop. Participants were also provided with resources such as information sheets on the core concepts of patient-centered care, verbal and nonverbal communication, a journal article on patient participation[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and a list of relevant websites.</p><p>The control program comprised the independent reading of a journal article on patient participation[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and an information sheet on verbal and nonverbal communication, identical to those provided in the intervention program as additional resources. These learning materials were not informed by patients or consumers.</p><p>The workshop was arranged and all trainees who had been scheduled to work at the main clinical site on this day were allocated to the intervention group. Trainees who had been scheduled to work at a satellite clinical site were allocated to the control group. The workshop was held during a lunch hour and the control program was circulated via E-mail on the same day.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Demographic data, knowledge, attitude, communication skills and program evaluation data were collected using a series of questionnaires.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Knowledge, attitude and practice</title><p>Knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) was evaluated using a questionnaire tailored to the specific goals of the education program. The questionnaire included two items asking participants to rate their confidence in understanding patient-centered care and communicating with patients and families (five-level scale from (1) very low confidence to (5) very high confidence). It also included six items on how well prepared they felt to introduce themselves, acknowledge waiting time, provide clear information, ask questions, listen actively and use appropriate body language (five-level rating scale from (1) poorly prepared to (5) extremely well prepared).

Trainees who received the intervention program were more prepared to introduce themselves and their role to patients and acknowledge waiting time. Similarly, there was a small increase in self-perceived overall communication skills following the intervention program.</p><p>The initial higher level of confidence in communication with patients and families reported by junior medical staff may be a reflection of their experience, as they were 10 years older than the trainee orthoptists. Confidence with respect to understanding patient-centered care was not significantly different between the intervention and control groups with all participants remaining only moderately confident with the concept. However, participants in both groups were able to articulate what could go wrong as a result of poor patient communication. This supports other research that health professionals are aware of the consequences of not involving patients, yet struggle with the delivery of patient-centered care.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Krupat <italic>et al</italic>. found patients were more satisfied when their doctors were more patient-centered (PPOS score of &#x02265;4.57).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Given the doctors in the current study were young and educated, we did not expect PPOS scores to reflect a doctor-centered approach (intervention mean = 3.72, control mean = 3.84). It is possible that because the majority of Eye and Ear patients are elderly, doctors shaped their interactions around the common perception that, &#x0201c;older patients prefer a relationship that is doctor-centered.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In this respect, it is more important for common ground to be reached between doctors and patients when responding to patient needs.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The CAT focused on how well junior medical staff and orthoptic students rated themselves on key communication tasks.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Mean scores after the program were clustered around the middle of the scale for both groups (intervention = 3.43 and control = 3.49) indicating participants thought they were &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; at communicating with patients and families. Analysis of these scores before and after the program found no significant differences by type of intervention or professional group suggesting that participants believed they had basic communication skills but acknowledged they could still improve. The small improvement in the mean CAT score after the program for the intervention group suggests the content and delivery of the intervention program was effective in improving self-perceived communication skills with patients. In future, it would be useful to evaluate whether or not patients also perceived an improvement in the communication skills of medical staff following the education program.</p><p>As this was a consumer driven program, comprehensive consultation with trainee clinicians was not undertaken prior to developing the intervention. However, participants were asked how future training and education could be improved. Intervention participants reported that the range of speakers and real-life and personal examples worked well, reconfirming Burns&#x02019; findings that patient stories are an important and invaluable component of training.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The topics identified for further modules (how to deal with and deliver bad news, dealing with difficult patients, body language, and cultural sensitivities) were consistent with obstacles to patient-centred care identified by Longtin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The suggestion by participants in this study for senior staff to attend reiterates the importance of having programs endorsed by leaders.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The findings indicate the intervention was only somewhat successful in changing knowledge and behavior of trainee clinicians toward patients and families. It is not surprising that a greater change was not seen, as changes in attitudes usually evolve over time.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>This study was limited by a small sample size and low completion rate. Furthermore, the number of participants who completed the intervention was approximately double that of the control group, possibly due to the face-to-face delivery and interactivity of the intervention program. Another limitation was reliance on self-report. However, given the positive results from this study, we suggest a larger controlled trial is warranted, including measures of patient satisfaction with communication and the level of patient-centered care provided by clinicians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The benefits of involving consumers in developing education programs on patient-centered care and communication include improved self-perceived knowledge and attitudes, and improved communication skills for hospital clinicians.
