Among the lactobacilli, many produce <sc>d</sc>-lactic acid either via the <sc>d</sc>-lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reduction of pyruvate to <sc>d</sc>-lactic acid or by the isomerization of <sc>l</sc>-lactic acid to <sc>d</sc>-lactic acid by <sc>dl</sc>-lactate racemase. This has led to concerns about <sc>d</sc>-lactic acid accumulation in the blood. The occurrence of <sc>d</sc>-lactic acidosis in humans is caused by the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by bacteria in the colon, although this has been reported almost exclusively in patients with short bowel syndrome.

The study was performed in Athens, Greece between May 2010 and July 2011.

The study was explained to infants&#x02019; parents/legal representatives, who signed a written informed consent document before their infants were randomized into the two formula groups.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Study participants were recruited from mothers admitted and delivered in the two study centers. Only infants whose parents/legal guardians had decided to exclusively feed them formula at the time of recruitment and had signed the informed consent document were assessed for eligibility to enter the trial. Those fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and having none of the exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were being healthy, being born at term (&#x02265;37 weeks), being &#x02264;72 hours old at the time of enrollment, being under the care of a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare professional, and having had &#x02265;1 post-natal visit with a healthcare provider. Infants were excluded from the study if they had any chromosomal or any other major congenital abnormality, had any significant pre- or post-natal disease, had been treated with antibiotics, or were participating in another study. Additionally, infants were excluded from the study if their mothers had taken probiotic supplements during the last trimester of pregnancy or had taken any antibiotics during the last 14 days of pregnancy, or if their families were not expected to be able to comply with the study protocol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study formula</title><p>The control and probiotic formulae used in the study were based on the same commercially available starter infant formula intended for infants up to six months of age. They contained protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals in quantities suitable for infants in the target age group.

The study formulae had similar taste and color, and were packaged in similar cans that were coded by the manufacturer.

The first urine samples were taken at the hospital during the first 72 hours following birth before any study formula intake had commenced. Infants were randomly assigned to receive one of the two study formulae, and their caretakers were provided with cans of their assigned formulas along with instructions on their preparation. Infants were to be exclusively fed their assigned formulas <italic>ad libitum</italic> from the time of enrollment until 28 days of age.</p><p>Follow-up visits to the study site took place at 7, 14, 28, 112, and 168 &#x000b1; 3 days of age. At enrollment, caregivers were given instructions on keeping a diary where they recorded daily volume of formula intake (and intake of any other nutrition or medication); stool frequency and consistency; frequency of spitting up, vomiting, or flatulence; sleeping and crying patterns; and the occurrence of AEs. Daily diaries were completed for the three days preceding each visit up to the 112-day visit. The study investigators evaluated the records kept in diaries at each visit.</p><p>Protocol deviations were defined as attending visits outside of the three-day window of the scheduled visit, use of antibiotics during the first 28 days of life, and consumption of any non-study formula for more than two consecutive days during the first 28 days.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis of urine samples</title><p>Urine samples were collected at each visit except the last.

V123 forward primers 1, 2, 3, and 4 were combined in 4:1:1:1 ratio. Each PCR amplification reaction contained 2 &#x003bc;L of DNA extract, 50 &#x003bc;M dNTPs, 200 nM forward primer (mix of forward primers for the V123 region), 200 nM reverse primer, 1 &#x000d7; expand high fidelity reaction buffer, and 2.5 U of expand high fidelity enzyme blend (Roche Applied Science, Switzerland). PCR conditions were 94&#x000b0;C for two minutes followed by 25 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 49&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for one minute, and a final elongation at 72&#x000b0;C for seven minutes. Amplification products were purified, pooled in equimolar amounts, and sequenced using a 454 FLX Titanium technology (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland). Raw data were analyzed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software package<xref rid="b12-nmi-7-2014-019" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with default parameter settings, except that no barcode correction was allowed, and reverse primers were removed if present. Chimera detection and removal was performed using ChimeraSlayer based on reference alignment from Greengenes (as provided in QIIME 1.2) and default parameters. Samples described by less than 200 sequencing reads were excluded from the analysis. Quality-filtered sequencing reads were analyzed using the Uclust method at a similarity threshold of 97% identity for operational taxonomic units (OTUs) clustering. OTUs were assigned into the Bergey&#x02019;s bacterial taxonomy using RDP Classifier with a confidence value threshold of 60%. Total bacterial counts were determined by the FISH method.</p></sec><sec><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>At each visit, weight, length, and head circumference measurements were recorded. Infants were weighed to the nearest 10 g. Recumbent length was measured using length boards with at least two clinical staff present to ensure body was fully extended and feet flexed. Head circumference was measured using a non-elastic, plastic-coated measuring tape approximately 2.5 cm above the eye brows, at the largest measurement of the head circumference. Both length and head circumference measurements were taken repeatedly to the nearest 1 mm until consecutive measurements were within 5 mm, and the medians of the two consecutive measurements were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of digestive tolerance</title><p>Spitting up was defined as non-projectile emission of small volumes of milk shortly after feeding, and vomiting was defined as projectile or non-projectile emission of relatively large volumes of stomach content. Each was assessed by the frequency of occurrence. Stool characteristics were assessed by stool frequency (number of outputs during a 24-hour period) and the predominant consistency (hard/lumpy, formed, soft/creamy, or loose/watery), and the occurrence of flatulence was assessed by its presence or absence. Sleep patterns were assessed by the duration of sleep and the frequency of awakenings at night, and crying was assessed by its duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Sample size was calculated using data on urinary <sc>d</sc>-lactate concentrations in healthy infants reported by Haschke-Becher et al.<xref rid="b13-nmi-7-2014-019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As data were skewed, they were log-transformed and the mean and standard deviation (SD) values estimated from the three groups in the study.

In the study aimed at establishing normal urinary <sc>d</sc>-lactate concentrations in healthy infants and children, Haschke and colleagues reported a median urinary <sc>d</sc>-lactate concentration of 6.4 mmol/mol creatinine, and a concentration of 33.9 mmol/mol creatinine at the 95th percentile in infants zero to six months old.<xref rid="b10-nmi-7-2014-019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The figures were higher among a different population (in the same study) of 1 month&#x02013;2.5 years olds, where the median was 39.9 mmol/mol creatinine and the 95th percentile 40.8 mmol/mol creatinine. The maximum concentration for the 95th percentile observed in our study was 40.8 mmol/mol creatinine, which occurred in the probiotics group on day 7. Although our study was designed based on this study and the empirical choice of detecting a two-fold increase in urinary <sc>d</sc>-lactate concentration, the clinical relevance for the non-inferiority margin remains to be established.</p><p>In a more recent study of <sc>d</sc>-lactate concentrations in healthy six-month-old infants fed a formula containing <italic>Lactobacillus johnsonii</italic>, baseline urinary <sc>d</sc>-lactate ranged from 0.7 to 99.4 mmol/mol creatinine in the <italic>L. johnsonii</italic> group and 0.6 to 218.4 mmol/mol creatinine in the control group.<xref rid="b13-nmi-7-2014-019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> After four weeks of study formula intake, <sc>d</sc>-lactate concentrations ranged from 5.6 to 77.6 mmol/mol creatinine in those fed the <italic>L. johnsonii</italic> formula and 1.8 to 127.6 mmol/mol creatinine in those fed the control formula.
