Programs promoting healthy lifestyles for rural women are urgently needed; however, participant engagement is challenging. In the context of a large randomized controlled trial targeting the prevention of weight gain in rural women, we explored successful recruitment strategies and aimed to understand participants&#x02019; barriers, enablers and reasons for program participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We recruited women (aged 18&#x02013;55 years) from the general rural Australian population. A mixed-methods approach was applied to explore factors that influenced program participation, including quantitative questionnaires for all participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;649) and qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted for a subgroup of participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45). Data were collected at three time points: baseline, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post program commencement.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We recruited 649 rural women through a community communication and partnering strategy, a program marketing campaign and mobilization of social networks. Program participants were diverse across education and income levels and were representative of the wider Australian regional population. Factors that influenced program engagement were divided into personal (perceived program benefits and program accessibility) and social (peer persuasion and support). Identified enablers included convenience of the program location, perceived program utility, such as weight management and optimization of lifestyle choices, as well as attending the program with peer support. Barriers to engagement, which are likely exacerbated in rural communities included lack of anonymity, self-consciousness and segregated social networks in rural settings. Participants reported that eliciting local support and maximizing publicity is fundamental to improving future program engagement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Multiple program promotion strategies including communication, marketing and partnering, as well as mobilization of social networks and peer persuasion, enabled engagement of rural women into a healthy lifestyle program. These recruitment strategies are consistent with successful strategies utilized previously to recruit urban-dwelling women into lifestyle programs. Future engagement efforts in rural settings could be enhanced by hosting multiple sessions within existing socio-cultural networks and assuring participants that they will not need to share their personal health information with others in their community.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia &#x00026; New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry.

Socially disadvantaged populations such as those living in rural areas are at an increased risk of being overweight or obese compared with the general population. Higher rates of obesity in rural settings are associated with lower income and education levels, higher rates of unemployment and living in disadvantaged neighborhoods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, women living in rural settings are at the greatest risk of obesity in comparison to their urban counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with longitudinal data revealing reduced rates of physical activity and multiple barriers to achieving healthy lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the disproportionately high rates of obesity in rural populations, disadvantaged groups remain underrepresented in healthy lifestyle programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Efforts that encourage a healthy lifestyle are needed to address both the prevention and management of obesity in rural women.</p><p>The efficacy of healthy lifestyle weight gain prevention programs has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The potential advantages of prevention programs are that they may be more feasible to implement and require fewer resources and less funding with greater potential for population level impacts compared with the treatment of established obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In support of obesity prevention, the World Health Organization (WHO) has named the prevention of weight gain as an international health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. WHO estimates that effective implementation of national-scale healthy lifestyle preventive programs has the potential to increase individual life expectancy by an additional 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The Australian Government has recognized the need to refocus health policies on prevention and established the National Preventative Health Taskforce (2009) to fund the implementation of healthy lifestyle programs. These healthy lifestyle programs have been implemented in community-based settings to promote physical activity and healthy eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To maximize the benefits of community-based healthy lifestyle programs, rigorous evaluation is vital and yet currently rarely completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Comprehensive program evaluation is required to inform scale-up through the exploration of implementation strategies and sharing of learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Assessment of program recruitment success and engagement is important in community evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] as recruitment and engagement can be challenging, especially within socially disadvantaged groups including those living in rural settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Low engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and retention rates are more pronounced among socially disadvantaged populations, resulting in labels such as &#x0201c;hard to reach&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Barriers to rural healthy lifestyle program engagement at the systems level include difficulty accessing the population, time constraints, cultural differences and limited knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Barriers at the participant level include multiple competing interests, distrust of researchers, lack of awareness of the research program and minimal public transport access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Of the limited literature available, motivators for program engagement of disadvantaged populations include perceived personal benefits, minimal time commitments and program flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Social influences also have been reported to play a key role in engaging women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the relationship between personal and social motivators in maximizing program participation remains unclear. To date, most literature exploring optimization of engagement has been conducted in populations with chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and few trials have been conducted in healthier populations or in rural areas. There is also a dearth of qualitative methods exploring engagement of healthy populations into lifestyle programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, most research in this area is based on researcher&#x02019;s perceptions and experiences, rather than on those of participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, consumer-driven evaluations are warranted. To address these identified gaps in the literature, we aimed to explore engagement, including strategies used to recruit women from small rural communities and their motivation for participation in a weight gain prevention program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The HeLP-her Rural program</title><p>The Healthy Lifestyle Program (HeLP-her) is an evidence-based healthy lifestyle weight gain prevention program for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The program has recently been implemented in rural communities (HeLP-her Rural) in an integrated community cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This RCT aimed to prevent weight gain in a population of reproductive-aged women living in rural Victorian communities in Australia. The program was designed to be low intensity, low cost and non-prescriptive and focused on participants making small, long-termsustainable lifestyle changes. In this RCT 41 rural communities were randomized to the intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21) or control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Program inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Communities selected had a population size between 1500&#x02013;10,000 people and were located 100&#x02013;400&#x000a0;km from the capital city, Melbourne. Women aged 18&#x02013;55 years of any BMI and residing in or close to participating communities were invited to participate. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, or serious medical condition impacting program participation. The detailed study design methodology is comprehensively reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This study was approved by the Monash Health Research Ethics Committee for research involving humans (project no.12034B). All participants signed informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment strategies</title><p>Participant recruitment commenced in September 2012 and was completed in April 2013. A comprehensive communication and engagement protocol was developed to promote effective recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The recruitment strategy was deliberately simple and low cost to reflect usual practice and did not differ between the control and intervention communities. Women aged 18&#x02013;55 living within each of the 41 selected communities were invited by letter and flyers to participate in this program. We engaged multiple levels of the community including: local government departments, health services, primary schools and kindergartens as well as community sectors (sports clubs, neighborhood houses and women&#x02019;s groups) and community leaders.</p><p>Specific recruitment strategies incorporated:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Development of a multilevel partnering strategy across all local communities;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Flyers distributed to all families though partnership with the local primary schools, pre-schools and kindergartens within each town;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Staff presence and visits within the local towns promoting the program;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Media releases (newspaper and local radio);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Flyers distributed at additional locations (such as general practice and maternal child health clinics, pharmacies, community groups and town notice boards);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mobilization of social networks through (a) encouraging women who had expressed interest and registered for the program to bring friends and family along to the program and (b) identifying community champions to promote the program to their community, workplace and social networks and accessing partners databases for email contacts.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Women expressed interest in study involvement by sending SMS text messages, phone, email or return of an expression of interest form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Program setting</title><p>The program was delivered predominately within each community&#x02019;s local primary schools, and session times were scheduled to align with school drop off and pick up. In addition community locations such as local town halls, community centers and sports clubs were utilized for evening sessions to ensure multiple opportunities to participate. Sessions were able to accommodate young children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measures of program engagement</title><p>We applied a mixed-methods approach to explore factors that influenced healthy lifestyle program recruitment and engagement. Here, we have defined engagement as factors that motivated, encouraged and enabled program participation, extending our definition beyond recruitment to include completion of the early phase of the HeLP-her Rural program (0&#x02013;6 months). This phase included attending a single group education session, receiving SMS text messages, completing phone coaching and utilizing the program manual, described in detail in the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We also highlight that a comprehensive process evaluation of the HeLP-her Rural program measuring reach, dose delivered and received at the individual level and program contextual influences has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data sources</title><p>Data were collected at three time points.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Baseline</p><p>The baseline questionnaire included demographic, nutrition, physical activity information and a brief devised questionnaire exploring factors influencing healthy lifestyle program participation.

Purposeful sampling techniques were applied to obtain a representative sub-sample from the larger RCT. Women from 10 randomly selected communities (6 interventions and 4 control communities) were invited to participate in the semi-structured interviews and 65 women volunteered. Interviews were conducted until a point of data saturation, determined when no new ideas emerged from the interviews, as per standard methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. One staff member conducted all interviews. The interview schedule topics included: (1) motivation for program enrollment, (2) speculated barriers preventing other community members from participating in this program and (3) recommendations to improve future healthy lifestyle program engagement. All qualitative semi-interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Twelve-months post program commencement</p><p>The results of our semi-structured interviews informed the questions included in the 12-month questionnaire relating to potential community barriers to program engagement such as competing commitments, disinterest in health, self-consciousness and inconvenience of the program location and time. This enabled an opportunity to conduct data triangulation.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 12 for Windows (STATA, Texas, USA) and descriptive statistics used to explore participant demographic and anthropometric data at baseline (recruitment data). Continuous variables are presented as mean (SD) and categorical data as relative frequencies. Program retention data were assessed via Student&#x02019;s t-test to determine whether there were differences in characteristics between participants that remained in the study (completers) compared to those that did not remain in the study (non-completers) at 12&#x000a0;months. However, categorical data (income, education and employment status) were compared between completers and non-completers using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test because of the reduced numbers of participants within each category. Therefore, the categorical tests need to be interpreted with caution, as applying more robust statistical measures was not possible.</p><p>Qualitative transcripts were analyzed independently by two investigators via thematic analysis and key themes and patterns in the data identified.

Reported reasons for missed data were censoring due to pregnancy, onset of a serious illness, relocation interstate, withdrawal and loss to contact. Overall, program attrition rates were higher among women with a heavier baseline BMI (BMI 31.7&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> versus 28.4&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and a greater age (46.8&#x000a0;years versus 35.9&#x000a0;years).

Successful recruitment strategies included implementation of a community communication and partnering strategy, the use of several channels of program advertising and the mobilization of social networks. Our evaluation revealed factors that influenced program engagement could be grouped into two categories, personal and social factors. Personal factors related to perceived program benefits and program accessibility (logistics) and social factors were associated with peer support and persuasion. Additional social factors included the lack of anonymity in small rural communities, which may result in some women feeling apprehensive and too self-conscious to join a weight-related programs.</p><p>While the motivators for healthy lifestyle program enrollment have previously been established in obese women, which include improvements in physical appearance, self-esteem and confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], there are no available qualitative studies exploring engagement in general rural populations. We addressed this research gap by conducting qualitative interviews in a population of healthy rural women as part of a consumer-driven evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Consistent with previous literature, we report that perceived program utility such as educational benefits improved the likelihood of program participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, other drivers of HeLP-her Rural program engagement were weight management and optimization of lifestyle choices. We note that while we were able to recruit women across all BMI levels, obese women were more likely to enroll in the HeLP-her Rural program for weight management reasons, and lean women were more interested in lifestyle optimization. This provides a unique opportunity to understand the generalizability of the program and is important as current trends reveal that 20&#x000a0;% of healthy weight women will become overweight within 5&#x000a0;years, revealing a clear need to target women across the BMI spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Likely exacerbated in rural settings, our results indicated that social influences have an important role in both promoting and discouraging program participation in rural settings. Consistent with previous literature, we report that group-based programs promote opportunities for social contact and interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and that peer persuasion and encouragement improve healthy lifestyle program engagement. However, the lack of anonymity described in rural settings by our interviewees, defined as reduced opportunities for persons to have private and confidential areas of their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], can discourage program engagement, particularly among overweight and obese women. Lack of anonymity issues are less likely to exist in urban settings as women have greater opportunities to participate in a wider range of weight-related programs and are unlikely to know everyone living within close proximity of their primary residence. To improve future healthy lifestyle engagement strategies in rural communities, we recommend emphasizing to potential participants that they will not be required to share their sensitive health information with other community members. This is hard to communicate via promotional flyers but could be achieved through verbal interactions or potentially through social media forums. Ultimately, the most feasible way to address lack of anonymity in small rural communities is to deliver a healthy lifestyle program remotely. However, the majority of participants here indicated they would not take part in a computer-based program with most preferring face-to-face delivery despite the associated limitations. Weight management programs utilizing face-to-face methods have also been found to be superior in preventing weight gain compared to web-based and correspondence programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, both our quantitative and qualitative results revealed that the greatest barrier to healthy lifestyle engagement was a lack of program awareness, despite the utilization of a multi-strategy communication and engagement approach. We report that participants required multiple personal verbal (peer persuasion) and non-personal visual (program marketing material) prompts prior to engaging with this program. Participants frequently reported that personal peer persuasion and word of mouth comprise the most valuable avenue to engaging rural women. Our results add to the findings of a recent systematic review indicating that increased awareness of a healthy lifestyle program among potential participants improves the likelihood of program engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Further exploration on the number of times women need to view or hear about an upcoming healthy lifestyle program prior to enrollment is warranted. Additionally, exploration of the role of social media in engaging rural women into healthy lifestyle programs is needed as this low-cost strategy has been successful in urban populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Here, we focused our recruitment efforts on distributing promotional flyers via local schools and kindergartens and reached women with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. However, some sections of the community such as the socially isolated disengaged community members may require more intensive engagement strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Another important consideration when implementing healthy lifestyle programs in rural communities is the selection of an appropriate venue. As noted in other studies, the importance of ensuring cultural community sensitivity when attempting to gain entry for healthy lifestyle programs is vital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In rural communities particularly, there appears to be a strong sense of place associated with various community venues such as the local government primary school, religious-based schools, and churches and/or specific sports clubs. For example, young people are not always familiar with hospitals or health venues, single women are not familiar with schools or kindergartens, and non-religious community members may feel uncomfortable attending a program held within local churches. The importance of coordinating health programs within a familiar environment has been shown to optimize engagement rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Thus, we recommend hosting multiple group sessions within a variety of community structures even in small rural communities in order to reach diverse social networks. However, we acknowledge that this may increase total program costs, resources and staff time.</p><p>Despite young women being notoriously difficult to retain in healthy lifestyle programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], we retained 76&#x000a0;% of program participants at 12&#x000a0;months, which is comparable with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Program retention strategies used within the HeLP-her Rural program focused on minimizing the participant burden via scheduling reviews at accessible locations and appropriate times in relation to the target audience. Building strong communication with partners, ensuring a skilled team, persistence and flexibility of review times improved our program retention consistent with a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, the low intensity nature of the HeLP-her Rural program supported greater program retention in comparison to an intensive weight gain prevention trial, which reported a reduced program attendance rate of 50&#x000a0;% across multiple group meetings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Thus, the utility and feasibility of intensive weight loss and weight gain prevention programs in young women appear poor with elevated attrition rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>We also report lower retention rates in women with heavier baseline BMIs, and this has been previously attributed to unrealistic weight loss expectations, leading to early disappointment and subsequent program drop out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Our findings highlight the need to continually assess participant&#x02019;s program expectations and to determine at baseline whether participants are indeed ready to commit to a lifestyle program to achieve weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We further speculate that women with a higher age (47&#x000a0;years) were less likely to complete the HeLP-her Rural program as they may have had more intensive work commitment in comparison to the younger women (36&#x000a0;years) who likely had young children to care for at home. Future retention strategies may need to focus on older women with higher baseline BMIs.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strength and limitations</title><p>Strengths of the current study included the application of a mixed-methods approach to a rigorously designed healthy lifestyle prevention RCT. We also applied robust qualitative data analysis using a theoretical framework and utilized two independent staff for data analysis. Moreover, the purposeful sample utilized increases the generalisability of the qualitative results to the wider RCT cohort. In addition, it is unlikely that our results were influenced by differential recall bias at 12&#x000a0;months between intervention and controls as no statistical difference was reported between groups. Limitations include a lack of specific information regarding the impact and effectiveness of each individual recruitment strategy; therefore, we are unable to identify which engagement strategy was most effective in recruiting women from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, the barriers to engagement identified were speculative based on enrolled program participant&#x02019;s views as we were unable to interview women who did not participate in this program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The HeLP-her Rural program provided a unique opportunity to explore participant engagement including recruitment and participation in a healthy lifestyle program specifically targeting rural-dwelling women. We engaged communities and rural women through multiple channels of communication (verbal and visual) in order to reach program recruitment targets. Our findings suggest that factors that need to be considered when engaging rural women into a healthy lifestyle program include using existing community social networks to deliver programs, promoting the program multiple times through local community networks, maximizing program awareness and understanding community social dynamics. Future program engagement would be enhanced by hosting multiple programs within existing socio-cultural networks and assuring participants that they will not be required to share personal health information with other women living in their community. Ultimately, the learning and practical implications reported in this study can be applied to future prevention programs more broadly, enhancing program engagement.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_860_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
