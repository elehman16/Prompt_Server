The pulmonary component of the disease is characterized by airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible and is associated with symptoms of breathlessness, cough, and reduced physical exercise capacity resulting from inflammatory and destructive changes in the lungs. Exacerbations are common, particularly in severe stages of the disease, and frequently lead to hospitalization and can be life-threatening.</p><p>Bronchodilator therapy is the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for COPD with treatment with short-acting bronchodilators being recommended in patients with mild COPD, while long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABAs) and anticholinergics are added for patients with moderate to severe COPD. Despite an underlying inflammatory component to the disease, the use of LABAs for the treatment of COPD is generally advocated without concomitant inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. ICS monotherapy for COPD has shown only limited benefit in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], while improvements in symptom control, lung function and all-cause mortality has been reported with the combination of ICS/LABA budesonide/formoterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Consequently, COPD guidelines (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD]) include bronchodilator therapy as the primary treatment in COPD without mandating concomitant use of anti-inflammatory therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Some concerns have existed in the past regarding the safety of LABAs in patients with airway disease, fueled by a meta-analysis conducted by Salpeter et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that suggested there was a doubling of the risk of respiratory death in COPD with the use of a LABA compared with placebo. In a more recent meta-analysis, Rodrigo and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] came to a different conclusion to those of Salpeter and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], reporting no increased risk of mortality in COPD patients using LABAs. The difference in these findings may partly relate to differences in trial selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of the LABA formoterol, 4.5 and 9 &#x003bc;g twice daily (bid), in Japanese and European patients with COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational (Japan, Romania, Russia and Ukraine) phase III study (Study code: D5122C00001; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00628862">NCT00628862</ext-link>) conducted at 65 centers in Japan and Europe. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee at all participating sites and the study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the AstraZeneca policy on Bioethics and Human Biological Samples. All patients provided written informed consent prior to enrolment into the study.</p><p>The primary objective was to show that formoterol 4.5 and 9 &#x003bc;g bid for 12 weeks were superior to placebo in Japanese and European patients with COPD using forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) 60-min post-dose as the primary outcome variable.</p><p>The study consisted of an enrolment period for withdrawal of pre-study medication, a 2-week run-in period and a 12-week treatment period. Clinic visits took place at baseline (on completion of the 2-week run-in period), and at weeks 4, 8, and 12 of the treatment period.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Male and female patients &#x02265; 40 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>&#x0003c; 80% of predicted normal, and post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity [FVC] &#x0003c; 70%) and current COPD symptoms were eligible for inclusion. Patients were also required to have a current or previous smoking history of &#x02265; 10 pack-years and a symptom score of at least 2 points (combination of breathlessness, cough, and/or night time awakenings due to symptoms; each assessed by the patients on a scale of 0-4 where 0 = no symptoms and 4 = severe symptoms) on at least 6 of the last 10 days of the run-in period.</p><p>Patients with a history and/or current clinical diagnosis of asthma were excluded from participating, as were those with a history and/or current clinical diagnosis of atopic disease such as allergic rhinitis. Additional exclusion criteria included use of an ICS within 4 weeks of the run-in period, COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization and/or a course of antibiotics and/or systemic steroid therapy within 4 weeks of the run-in period, significant or unstable ischemic heart disease, or other relevant cardiovascular conditions, any other respiratory tract disorders or significant disease likely to place the patient at risk during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study treatments</title><p>Patients received inhaled formoterol 4.5 or 9 &#x003bc;g twice daily (bid) via Turbuhaler<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Study treatments were taken at approximately the same time every morning and evening and immediately after measuring peak expiratory flow (PEF).</p><p>Salbutamol 100 &#x003bc;g/actuation via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) was available to relieve symptoms throughout the study period and patients could continue to take short-acting anticholinergics. Patients previously receiving long-acting anticholinergics were switched to short-acting anticholinergics at the start of the enrolment period. Glucocorticosteroid treatment was not permitted at any time during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome variable was change (ratio) from baseline to the end of treatment period in FEV<sub>1 </sub>60-min post-dose. Secondary outcome variables included spirometry, diary variables, and assessment of health-related quality-of-life (HRQL). Spirometry endpoints were FVC 60-min post-dose, FEV<sub>1 </sub>and FVC pre-dose and 5-min post-dose. Diary variables were morning and evening PEF, COPD symptom scores (night-time awakenings due to symptoms, breathlessness, and cough), and use of salbutamol as reliever medication (measured as inhalations/day). HRQL was assessed using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).</p><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed by evaluation of the nature, incidence and severity of adverse events, clinical laboratory variables including clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure and pulse rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample size selection was based on clinical data derived from a published 6-month study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. With a two-sided test at level 0.05 and 176 patients per treatment group, the study was determined to have 80% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups of at least 0.06 L in the change from baseline FEV<sub>1 </sub>value.</p><p>A last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach was used to account for any missing week 6 data. The comparison of formoterol 4.5 and 9 &#x003bc;g bid with placebo was performed on the primary endpoint, mean change from baseline in FEV<sub>1 </sub>60-min post-dose, using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including country and treatment as fixed factors and the baseline value as covariate. A two-sided 5% significance level was used and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean difference between each dose of formoterol and placebo were calculated. The multiplicity of statistical tests was adjusted by a "closed testing procedure" under which the null hypothesis that 9 &#x003bc;g bid was equal to placebo was tested; if this null hypothesis was rejected then the 4.5 &#x003bc;g bid dose versus placebo was tested.</p><p>As for FEV<sub>1</sub>, the comparison of active treatments (formoterol 4.5 &#x003bc;g and 9 &#x003bc;g bid) with placebo for the secondary variables was performed using an ANCOVA model including country and treatment as fixed factors and the baseline value as covariate. The ANCOVA model used in the analysis was multiplicative. A two-sided 5% significance level was used and the "closed testing procedure" was applied.</p><p>The incidence of adverse events was calculated, and results from laboratory safety measurements, vital signs, and ECG, were analyzed primarily by means of descriptive statistics.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 613 patients were randomized to treatment (formoterol 4.5 &#x003bc;g bid n = 206; 9 &#x003bc;g bid n = 199; placebo n = 208); 539 (87.9%) patients were male; 324 (52.9%) patients were Japanese and 289 (47.1%) were European.

The results of the secondary variables, both those related to lung function (for example, morning and evening PEF) and those related to daily diary card data (for example, COPD symptom score, and reliever medication use) and health-related quality-of-life (SGRQ total score) support the findings observed with the primary study endpoint. It is noteworthy that a clinically relevant benefit for formoterol 9 &#x003bc;g bid compared with 4.5 &#x003bc;g bid was demonstrated for the secondary endpoint of improved SGRQ score and also a statistically significant improvement for formoterol 9 &#x003bc;g bid vs. 4.5 &#x003bc;g bid for use of reliever medication. The use of reliever medication was significantly lower in the formoterol 9 &#x003bc;g bid group compared with 4.5 &#x003bc;g bid, and the proportion of patients with a clinically relevant improvement in SGRQ total score of &#x0003e; 4 units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] was statistically significantly greater for formoterol 9 &#x003bc;g bid vs. placebo but not formoterol 4.5 &#x003bc;g bid vs. placebo. While these results might not be that surprising, the additional reduction in reliever medication use and increase in the proportion of patients with a clinically relevant improvement in SGRQ score might suggest that there is some additional benefit of formoterol 9 &#x003bc;g bid over 4.5 &#x003bc;g bid in this COPD patient population.</p><p>Both formoterol 4.5 and 9 &#x003bc;g bid for 12 weeks were well tolerated in Japanese and European patients with COPD. No clinically important safety differences between the formoterol 4.5 and 9 &#x003bc;g bid doses were observed. Concerns were raised regarding the ongoing safety of LABA therapy in patients with COPD following the publication of a meta-analysis of 22 studies of at least 3-month duration that suggested an increased risk of death with LABA therapy compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, this analysis has been countered by a more recent meta-analysis which applied more rigorous study selection criteria and excluded studies with duplicate data; it also included studies of at least 1-month duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This latter meta-analysis found that LABAs reduced severe exacerbations compared with placebo (relative risk 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67-2.64) and that there was no significant difference between LABA and placebo with regard to the risk of respiratory death (relative risk 1.09; 95% CI: 0.45-2.64) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The results of the current 12-week study are consistent with the latter meta-analysis; two deaths did occur in the study and although both patients had been randomized to formoterol 4.5 &#x003bc;g bid, neither death was considered to be related to study treatment.</p><p>Bronchodilator therapy represents the mainstay of treatment for patients with COPD. The place of LABA therapy as a bronchodilator for COPD has been revisited in recent years. LABA monotherapy is more commonly used in the management of COPD than it is in the management of asthma where LABA therapy is combined with concomitant ICS and is regarded with caution following the results of the Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which demonstrated an increased risk of death in the salmeterol treatment arm. These data led to a black box warning being applied to both salmeterol and formoterol by the US Food and Drug Administration. Clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of formoterol for bronchodilation in COPD in terms of improved lung function, symptoms, exacerbations, and HRQL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, formoterol has been shown to exert a faster onset of bronchodilatory effect compared with salmeterol in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These data, combined with the results of the current study and the encouraging efficacy meta-analysis data described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], support the role of formoterol bronchodilator therapy in patients with COPD, with the potential caveat of excluding patients with an asthma component, as recommended in the current GOLD guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the current study confirm that formoterol at doses of 4.5 and 9 &#x003bc;g bid is an effective and well tolerated first-line treatment option in the management of COPD, with additional benefits evident at the higher dose in terms of a reduced need for reliever medication and improved health-related quality-of-life.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>ANCOVA: analysis of covariance; bid: twice daily; CI: confidence interval; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ECG: electrocardiogram; FEV<sub>1</sub>: forced expiratory volume in 1 second; FVC: forced vital capacity; GOLD: Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; HRQL: health-related quality-of-life; ICS: inhaled corticosteroid; LABA: long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist; LOCF: last-observation-carried-forward; PEF: peak expiratory flow; pMDI: pressurized metered-dose inhaler; SGRQ: St George's Respiratory Questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Professor Miron Bogdan has received honoraria over the past year from Glaxo SmithKline, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Actelion.
