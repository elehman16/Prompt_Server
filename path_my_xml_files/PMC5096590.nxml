This added burden may be mitigated by reduction of dietary sodium intake. The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommends 2400&#x000a0;mg of dietary sodium daily for patients on HD, and the American Heart Association (AHA) suggests 1500&#x000a0;mg, evidence is lacking, however, to support these recommendations in HD. Moreover, little is known about the relationship of specific levels of dietary sodium intake and the severity of symptoms and signs during ultrafiltration. Our goal will be to determine the effects of carefully-monitored levels of sodium-intake as set forth by the NKF and AHA on symptoms and signs in patients undergoing (HD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We designed a three-group (2400&#x000a0;mg, 1500&#x000a0;mg, unrestricted), double blinded randomized controlled trial with a sample of 42 HD participants to determine whether 1. Symptom profiles and interdialytic weight gains vary among three sodium intake groups; 2. The effect of HD-specific variables on the symptom profiles among the three groups and 3. Whether total body water extracellular volume and intracellular volume measured with bioimpedance varies across the three groups. We will also examine the feasibility of recruitment, enrollment, and retention of participants for the five-day inpatient stay.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Curbing dietary sodium intake may lead to improvement in intradialytic symptom amelioration and potential for better long-term outcomes. Generating empirical support will be critical to ascertain, and espouse, the appropriate level of sodium intake for patients receiving HD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Kidney failure</kwd><kwd>Chronic</kwd><kwd>Hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>Left ventricular</kwd><kwd>Renal dialysis</kwd><kwd>Sodium</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p id="p0010">Over 636,000 people in the United States suffer from end stage renal disease (ESRD) and many of these require thrice weekly hemodialysis (HD) treatments to remove kidney wastes, re-establish electrolyte balance, and remove excess volume <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for ESRD patients. Extrapolating from the benefits of salt restriction in studies conducted on hypertensive and diabetic patients (the leading causes of ESRD) it has been theorized that restricting dietary sodium intake in the ESRD patient population will improve the health, survival, and quality of life for many HD patients.</p><p id="p0020">The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) suggests a total of 2400&#x000a0;mg of dietary sodium a day.

ESRD patients are twice as likely as members of the general Medicare population to be rehospitalized. In this regard 38% of the ESRD Medicare expenditure was spent on in-patient care. Over a third of the all-cause rehospitalizations among HD patients occurs among patients between 20 and 44 years of age. For ESRD patients that are hospitalized for cardiovascular-related events over half of rehospitalizations are due to ESRD and the highest rates for rehospitalization are acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.

Weinberger and Fineberg <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> demonstrated stability in responses to changes in sodium intake with a three-day protocol. We surmised from this that three full days of controlling diet would yield similar results. One group will be randomized to consume 1500&#x000a0;mg of sodium a day, a second group 2400&#x000a0;mg of sodium a day and control group will consume an unrestricted amount of sodium per day (these participants will select off of a restaurant style menu and their sodium intake calculated based on consumption). All meals and snacks will be controlled and provided by the metabolic kitchen at the research unit, and uneaten remnants are accounted for by the nutrition staff. Only the sodium content of the food differed between participants.</p><p id="p0065">Admission data will include a medical history, a review of current medications, food and medication allergies, baseline vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, orthostatic blood pressures, heart rate, oxygenation by pulse oximetry, and respiratory rate), height, weight, body composition by bioimpedance spectrometry (BIS), the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 (KDQOL-36), a dietary habits survey, and baseline deuterium oxide measurement.</p><p id="p0070">Patients will attend their regular HD sessions on days 1, 3 and 5 of the study period.

Similarly, multiple regression analyses will be conducted to determine if dialysis specific procedures (ultrafiltration rate, total volume removed) and intradialytic symptoms are related to sodium intake; and to determine the variation of body composition based on sodium intake.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Methodological considerations and limitations</title><p id="p0090">This will be the first study of its kind, therefore there are no other studies to benchmark against. Empirical data to determine the optimal length of stay in the controlled environment of the research unit is unavailable, thus, we chose a convenience duration of 5 days to ensure a reasonable sodium steady-state has been achieved. Furthermore, the admission was not truly a complete 5-day stay. Day 1 and Day 5 were partial days and so there may need to be an extension of length of stay to adequately achieve steady-state.</p><p id="p0095">Although measures will be taken to minimize errors associated with dietary sodium intake, not all human error can be completely eradicated. Participants may request items or attempt to consume items not in their daily allotment of food; nursing staff may want to oblige participants' desires, and therefore ongoing education and reeducation will certainly be necessary. Food preparation will be challenging and require nutritionists to prepare handmade meals ahead of time and thus obtaining dietary preferences/needs required coordination and we will institute a &#x0201c;preadmission&#x0201d; visit to this end and to address any other dietary concerns; i.e. diabetes. Similarly, the extended admission hours present unique issues for staffing and ensuring that study protocol requirements will be met consistently. Study staff will work in shifts, however, overnight and early morning hours will not be covered requiring nursing staff to be vigilant about the study protocol and the study PI to be vigilant about spot checks, and the integrity of data collected.</p><p id="p0100">The study design might have been simplified to the inclusion of only two groups. The current dietary sodium intake recommendations set forth by two influential agencies, along with the IOM report, predicated that the intake recommendations with the most controversy be included in the trial. Additionally, the literature repeatedly suggests that HD patients are consuming, along with the general American population far more sodium than recommended. In order to maintain rigor, demonstrate a full picture of symptoms experienced at various of levels of sodium intake, and a change in those symptom profiles with or without reduction in sodium intake and to what degree of reduction, the inclusion of a &#x0201c;free-range&#x0201d; control group was also warranted.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0105">This is the first RCT, to our knowledge, to be conducted controlling for sodium intake in ESRD patients.
