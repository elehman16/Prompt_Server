The effects of morning versus evening administration of ONO-5334 were investigated by measuring bone turnover marker levels in healthy postmenopausal women. Morning administration of ONO-5334 showed a more consistent suppressive effect on bone resorption than evening administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone turnover is thought to be subject to circadian variation, and the efficacy of osteoporosis treatments may be optimized by regulating the time of dosing. This study assessed whether evening administration of the cathepsin K inhibitor, ONO-5334, had a differential effect on the bone turnover marker, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), compared with morning administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a single-center, single blind crossover study. Fourteen healthy postmenopausal women were assigned to receive ONO-5334 150 mg once daily for 5 days in each period; they were randomized to receive either evening doses in the first period and morning doses in the second or vice versa. Serum and urinary levels of CTX-I were measured throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both regimens showed similar patterns of reduction in serum and urinary CTX-I; however, CTX-I suppression was more consistently &#x0003e;60% over 24 h following morning administration. Morning administration led to 6% greater suppression of 24-h serum CTX-I area under the effect curve (AUE; 69 vs 63%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) and 7% greater suppression of urinary CTX-I/creatinine AUE (93 vs 86%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) than evening administration. Higher plasma ONO-5334 concentrations were observed between 12 and 24 h postdose following morning administration, with mean trough concentrations for the morning and evening regimens at 9.4 and 4.0 ng/mL, respectively. There were no safety findings of concern.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Morning dosing of ONO-5334 is more efficacious at reducing markers of bone turnover in healthy postmenopausal women than evening dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01384188">NCT01384188</ext-link>, registered on June 27, 2011</p><p>EudraCT: 2008-006284-37</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00198-015-3342-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anti-resorptive</kwd><kwd>Bone resorption</kwd><kwd>Menopause</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis mainly arises in postmenopausal women and affects &#x0003e;10 million people in the USA; the incidence is set to increase as the population ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass disordered bone architecture, leading to an increased risk of vertebral and other fractures. Osteoporosis is associated with significant morbidity, and hip fractures as sequelae confer a 1-year mortality risk of 8.4&#x02013;36% primarily due to thromboembolic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>An important contributory factor to low bone mass in osteoporosis is increased bone resorption. Antiresorptive drugs such as the bisphosphonates reduce bone resorption and are the current drug class of choice for the prevention of fractures in patients with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, bisphosphonates are not well tolerated by many patients, may cause abdominal discomfort or dyspepsia and are difficult to administer. Furthermore, chronic bisphosphonate therapy may enhance the risk of atypical femur fractures, although the overall incidence of fractures is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hence, there is a need to develop novel, safe and efficacious treatments for osteoporosis.</p><p>Cathepsin K inhibitors including odanacatib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and ONO-5334 are a new class of drugs against osteoporosis which are undergoing clinical development. ONO-5334 improved bone strength by preferentially increasing cortical bone mass in ovariectomized rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and significantly improved cortical and trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis following 24 months of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In healthy postmenopausal women, ONO-5334 100 mg sustained-release tablet (SRT) administered in the morning exhibited a median time to maximum plasma concentration (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) of 4 h and mean half-life of 15 h following repeat administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], suggesting the feasibility of once-daily dosing.</p><p>Serum and urinary bone turnover markers such as C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) peak in the early morning hours and reach nadir in the afternoon, demonstrating that bone resorption is highest at night in healthy and osteoporotic postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Thus, evening administration of antiresorptive drugs such as ONO-5334, in contrast to the more conventional morning administration, is of interest because plasma drug levels may be higher at the time when bone resorption is greatest.</p><p>The influence of administration time of anti-osteoporosis drugs on efficacy varies. For instance, Blumsohn and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] administered elemental calcium 1000 mg at bedtime, which suppressed nighttime increases of bone resorption and reduced 24&#x000a0;h of excretion of bone resorption markers in premenopausal women, whereas morning administration had no effect. In addition, Karsdal and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] showed that oral calcitonin given between 17:00 and 22:00 exerted greater reductions of bone turnover markers compared with administration at 08:00. Odanacatib is administered once weekly, so the effects of administration time on efficacy would be of little value; however, ONO-5334 is intended as a once-daily medication</p><p>This study investigated healthy postmenopausal women as a representative potential patient population with similar predominant features of gender, age and hormonal milieu of patients with osteoporosis, without the attendant concomitant treatments that might confound the results. The aim of this randomized, single blind, two-part crossover study was to investigate the effects of morning versus evening administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of ONO-5334 150-mg SRT in healthy postmenopausal women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>Healthy female subjects aged 55&#x02013;75 years with a body mass index of 19&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were enrolled.

Subjects had a sleep history (for &#x02265;1 month before screening) of regular bedtime and sleep duration, did not awake more than twice nightly for micturition, had no habit of daytime naps &#x0003e;1 h and experienced no sleep complaint as determined by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] score&#x000a0;of &#x0003e;5. Subjects were in good health at both screening visits between 41 and 10 days before the first dose.</p><p>To minimize possible confounding factors of exercise and sleep/wake (circadian) on bone turnover, exercise was restricted, and a regular sleep/wake cycle was scheduled. Subjects maintained bedtime at 22:30 and wake-up time at 06:30 throughout the study period. This applied at home from the second screening visit until admission to the clinical unit and during the entire 10-day residential period. A subjective sleep diary incorporating the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and actigraphy (as monitored by Actiwatch AW4; Cambridge Neurotechnology, Cambridge, UK) confirmed compliance to the sleep/wake schedule and limited exercise regimen.</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

Three subjects withdrew prematurely, two because of adverse events and one withdrew consent after 5 days of evening administration. Two of the three subjects withdrawn from the study were in the morning group, and the remaining subject was in the evening group.

The rash on the eyelids was reported following 5 days of morning administration and resolved without further treatment after 11 days. Following investigation, this subject had a positive anti-nuclear antibody test, suggesting a possible autoimmune disorder. The case of aquagenic urticaria occurred 2 days after completion of 5 days&#x02019; evening drug administration and resolved without further treatment after 1.5 h. There were no clinically relevant laboratory safety data, vital signs, electrocardiogram or physical examinations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study explored whether 5 days&#x02019; administration of the novel cathepsin K inhibitor ONO-5334 150-mg SRT in the evening, when osteoclast activity begins to rise, resulted in a differential effect on pharmacodynamic markers of bone resorption compared with morning administration. Morning administration of ONO-5334 resulted in greater suppression of bone resorption markers over a 24-h period than the same treatment given in the evening. These findings relate to the fed state and with ONO-5334 150-mg administered in sustained-release tablet formulation.</p><p>Markers of bone turnover such as serum CTX show distinct circadian patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In women with osteoporosis, nocturnal serum calcium levels are sustained by increased bone resorption, in contrast to healthy postmenopausal women who display decreased serum calcium and lower urinary calcium excretion during nighttime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Evening administration of antiresorptive drugs might enhance their efficacy because drug levels may be higher when resorption is greatest. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of ONO-5334 morning versus evening administration on pharmacodynamic parameters including serum and urinary CTX-I.</p><p>Although evening administration of ONO-5334 for 5 days initially had a greater suppressive effect on serum CTX-I than morning administration, this was not protracted and began to diminish 12 h postdose (evening administration). The reduction of serum CTX-I after morning administration was more consistent across all time-points. The urinary CTX-I profile showed more consistent suppression across all collection time-points following morning administration of ONO-5334. Following evening administration, suppression of urinary CTX-I was less apparent in urine collected &#x02265;14 h postdose. Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that morning administration had significantly greater suppression of serum CTX-I and urinary CTX-I/creatinine than evening administration (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01 and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001, respectively). The effect of oral calcitonin administered in the morning, pre-dinner and in the evening on serum CTX-I in healthy postmenopausal women was reported by Karsdal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This showed a reduction in CTX-I, but the results differed in two ways from the present study. The first difference was that pre-dinner and evening doses of calcitonin resulted in greater CTX-I suppression than morning dosing. Secondly, the impact on bone resorption after oral calcitonin lasted for about 12 h, in contrast to 24 h (or more) for ONO-5334.</p><p>The difference between morning and evening administration was less marked in AUE analyses across the 24-h period, although significant differences were observed. Morning administration led to 6% greater suppression of derived total 24-h serum CTX-I AUE and 7% greater suppression of derived total 24-h urinary CTX-I/creatinine AUE than evening administration. Variation between samples was low; however, evening CTX-I levels showed highest variation, which has been observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Standard deviations for the CTX-I assay employed in this study were comparable to references of intra-individual variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We considered that there may be an interaction between the effect of feeding and the effect of the drug, but we did not find the large decreases in CTX that are usually reported after meals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This is likely due to the large suppression of CTX-I by the drug.</p><p>Reductions from baseline in derived total 24-h serum CTX-I AUE were consistent with previous reports on cathepsin K inhibitors, balicatib and odanacatib. In postmenopausal women, serum CTX was reduced by 61% in a 1-year study on balicatib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and by 62&#x02013;66% following single or repeated doses of odanacatib for 3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In postmenopausal women with low BMD, once-weekly odanacatib elicited &#x0003e;60% reductions of serum CTX-I for most of the first year of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and continuous 55% reductions were reported following 5 years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the OCEAN Study, bisphonate alendronate and ONO-5334 both exerted similar suppressive effects on bone resorption markers in women with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Serum CTX-I decreases of 67&#x02013;70% were reported following 30&#x02013;36 months of alendronate therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and urinary CTX-I was reduced by 53% following 12 weeks of alendronate treatment in healthy postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Reduction in fracture rate is the goal for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. An increase in BMD and suppression of bone resorption markers may achieve this. CTX-I is the reference marker of bone resorption used to evaluate experimental osteoporosis treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Odanacatib has shown similar suppression of serum CTX-I to that observed with ONO-5334 (approximately 60%), and both show clear increases in BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Other antiresorptive agents show similar magnitudes of serum CTX-I suppression of approximately 60&#x02013;70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. From a clinical standpoint, 60% suppression of serum CTX-I for as long as possible following ONO-5334 administration seems beneficial. ONO-5334 300-mg IRT increased BMD in women with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and has shown &#x0003e;60% reduction from baseline in serum CTX-I in healthy postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the difference in the proportion of the day when the suppressive effect of ONO-5334 on serum CTX-I exceeded approximately 60% in the present study (that is, across the entire 24-h period following morning administration versus around half that after evening dosing) may be clinically important.</p><p>Differences in pharmacodynamic effects between the regimens in the present study were paralleled by differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. Higher plasma ONO-5334 concentrations were observed between 12- and 24-h postdose following 5 days of morning administration. This sustained plasma concentration may explain the increased serum and urinary CTX-I suppression observed toward the end of the 24-h period. The significantly (<italic>P</italic> = .002) later <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> observed on day 5 after evening compared with morning dosing was considered attributable to delayed gastric emptying in the evening compared with morning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The disappearance rate of drug appeared to be more rapid following evening administration; we speculate that there may be diurnal changes in the clearance rate of ONO-5334.</p><p>In the present study, we observed a correlation between plasma ONO-5334 levels and the extent of CTX-I suppression; our data indicate that a plasma ONO-5334 concentration &#x02265;10 ng/mL is required to produce &#x0003e;60% reduction of serum CTX-I at any given time-point.</p><p>Subjects randomized to morning administration in the first period had significantly higher serum CTX-I before dosing in the second period (following washout period) compared with subjects randomized to the evening regimen in the first period. This carryover effect may be attributed to greater suppression during the first period, followed by a rebound effect where CTX-I levels increased to above baseline after dosing was stopped. Odanacatib and denosumab also show rebound effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. To account for baseline differences, morning versus evening comparisons were performed with (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and without (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) adjustment for baseline, and the results were similar. It should also be noted that baseline bone turnover has been demonstrated to have no effect on the efficacy of ONO-5334 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Treatment-related adverse events were more frequent after morning administration&#x02014;particularly nausea, which occurred in three of 12 subjects and one of 13 subjects following morning and evening administration. However, the sample size was small, and the study was not powered to compare adverse event frequency. Following 12 months of evening dosing in 285 subjects in the OCEAN Study, the adverse event profile of ONO-5334, including nausea, was similar to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Procedural site reactions observed in eight subjects were related to insertion of the intravenous cannula and not to ONO-5334 treatment per se. Two subjects were withdrawn from treatment as a result of mild rash and aquagenic urticaria that were considered as possibly related to ONO-5334; these did not resemble the morphea reported with balicatib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The safety profile of ONO-5334 as regards to derangements of connective tissue will be closely monitored in future studies.</p><p>One limitation of the study concerned blinding; the more intensive blood and urinary sampling may have allowed subjects to suspect whether they had received active study medication in the morning or the evening. However, subjects were not explicitly informed what treatments they were receiving at the time of dosing; therefore, the study may be considered single blind.</p><p>Women with osteoporosis have decreased bone density and higher CTX-I levels than otherwise healthy women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We have previously shown that baseline CTX-I levels are not predictive of how patients with osteoporosis respond to antiresorptive therapy with ONO-5334 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the same study, we found no association between baseline BMD (in the spine or hip) on ONO-5334 plasma levels or suppression of bone resorption by ONO-5334 (data unpublished). This suggests that the results of the current study on healthy postmenopausal women may also be applied to postmenopausal osteoporotic patients. However, one limitation is the established alteration of circadian rhythm of bone resorption in women with osteoporosis, who demonstrate an approximately 15% increase bone resorption at night relative to healthy postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, the findings in this study relate to the 150-mg sustained-release tablet formulation administered in the fed state, with standardized, nutritionally matched meals. The results may be different with other doses, formulations and administration times of ONO-5334 and also with varied diets.</p><p>In conclusion, morning administration of ONO-5334 150-mg SRT for 5 days conferred &#x0003e;60% suppression of CTX-I sustained across 24 h, compared with 12 h after evening administration. Morning administration achieved 6% greater suppression of serum CTX-I 24-h AUE (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) and 7% greater suppression of urinary CTX-I/creatinine 24-h AUE (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) compared with evening administration. Despite these differences, evening administration also appeared efficacious in suppressing markers of bone resorption. Future studies will clarify whether morning dosing would show increased efficacy with regard to BMD and whether the morning-versus-evening effect is observed with higher doses of ONO-5334.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="198_2015_3342_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 14 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUC<sub>24h</sub></term><def><p>Area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve during the dosing interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUE</term><def><p>Area under the effect curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMD</term><def><p>Bone mineral density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub></term><def><p>Maximum observed concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTX-I</term><def><p>C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRT</term><def><p>Immediate-release tablet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRT</term><def><p>Sustained-release tablet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub></term><def><p>Time to maximum plasma concentration</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the subjects and staff who participated in the study and Helen Lambert and Susan Lanham-New for their valuable work on the nutritional aspects of the study.
