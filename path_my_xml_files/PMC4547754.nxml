This fast duration, depending on the geographical location and the season, may be as long as 18 hours per day in the summer of temperate regions. During latter years, Ramadan arrived in summer while many sport events coincided with the holy month (e.g., London 2012 Olympics, Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup). As a result, Muslim athletes have to deal with a strong dehydration&#x02015;induced by daytime fasting and a higher sweat-loss rate caused by hot climatic conditions&#x02015;that may alter their sport performance [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that short-term maximal performance (STMP) was lower during Ramadan than out-of-Ramadan control period when test sessions were conducted in the afternoon [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Using repeated sprint tests (<italic>5 &#x000d7; 6-s maximal sprints</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; 6 &#x000d7; <italic>15-m maximal sprints</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), authors found that peak power was lower during Ramadan than before Ramadan, suggesting that Ramadan may have negative effects on STMP. Although sport events usually take place after sunset during Ramadan in Muslim-majority countries, most of international sport events are rather dependent on television schedules, and cannot take into account Ramadan constraints. Therefore, to cope with Ramadan fasting, Muslim athletes have to find strategies. Because many studies revealed that listening to music might facilitate sport performance [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the present study focused on the link between music, affects, and STMP during Ramadan.</p><p>Most studies have used music during the ongoing performance and showed that listening to music might increase motivation [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], arousal [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], motor coordination [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and improve maximal [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and sub-maximal performance [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was also found that music might enhance positive affects (e.g., vigor, happiness) and reduce negative affects (e.g., anger, anxiety, depression) as well as perceptions of effort, fatigue, or pain [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, a few studies focused on the impact of listening to music during warming-up on subsequent exercise performance and showed beneficial effects on STMP [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, given that athletes are not allowed to listen to music during competitions due to the sport-specific rules, examining the effects of listening to music during warming-up on sport performance would be helpful for fasters during Ramadan. As a result, the present study sought to examine the effects of listening to music during warming-up on STMP and affects.</p><p>Cognitive anxiety (i.e., worry or negative concerns about performance), self-confidence (i.e., degree of certainty about one&#x02019;s ability to succeed a task), and enjoyment (i.e., enthusiasm for achieving a task) are important performance-related affects in sport [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sport psychologists brought many evidences concerning the positive relationship between self-confidence and performance, and the negative relationship between cognitive anxiety and performance [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Likewise, positive links between enjoyment and performance were found [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, there was no empirical research on how music can influence cognitive anxiety, self-confidence, and enjoyment. Therefore, the present study aimed to provide insight into the effect of listening to music on these performance-related affects and STMP during Ramadan.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Study Overview</title><p>The literature reveals that the link between music and STMP in the context of Ramadan intermittent fasting, as well as its affective and motivational underlying mechanisms, still needs to be explored. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether music might impact STMP (during a 5-m shuttle run test), cognitive anxiety, self-confidence, and enjoyment during Ramadan, and whether these affects might predict STMP. Three hypotheses were formulated. First, given that music was found to be positively related to positive affects and performance [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but negatively related to negative affects [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], it was predicted that self-confidence, enjoyment, and STMP would be higher in the music condition than in the no-music condition, while cognitive anxiety would display a reverse pattern. Second, given that Ramadan was found to decrease performance [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and given the relationships between affects and performance [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], it was predicted that self-confidence, enjoyment, and STMP would be lower during Ramadan than before Ramadan, while cognitive anxiety would be higher in the former condition than in the latter condition. Third, and consistent with our expected findings, it was predicted that self-confidence and enjoyment would be positively related to STMP, whereas cognitive anxiety would be negatively related to STMP.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>Nine male physical education students (age: 21 &#x000b1; 1.1 years; height: 1.8 &#x000b1; 0.04 m; body mass: 83 &#x000b1; 5 kg) volunteered to contribute to the present study. They were recruited because they declared that they were willing to fast the whole month of Ramadan, they were untrained, and that they had no current musculoskeletal injury.</p></sec><sec id="sec009" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the National Center of Medicine and Sciences in Sport of Tunis approved the experimental design of the present study. The study used a within-subjects design consisting of four experimental sessions: Two sessions occurred one week before Ramadan and two others at the mid-point of Ramadan. Before and during Ramadan, the two sessions were scheduled at 05:00 p.m. and were separated by a recovery period of 48 hours. In each period, the experimental task was preceded by either a warm-up period with listening to music (i.e., music condition) or a warm-up period without listening to music (i.e., no-music condition); technically, the use of a randomizer allowed us to compute our randomizations. When a participant was exposed to one music condition during the first session, he was exposed to the other one during the second session.</p><p>The month of Ramadan during which the present study was carried out was that of the year 2013. The elapsed time from dawn to sunset was from 03:28 a.m. to 07:33 p.m. at the beginning of Ramadan, and from 03:58 a.m. to 07:14 p.m. at the end of Ramadan. During that Ramadan, the participants took their last meal approximately at 02:00 a.m. and they fasted from that time until sunset.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Procedure</title><p>Before the beginning of the experiment, the participants were familiarized with the experimental protocol, but received no information about the purposes of the present study until they fully completed the experiment. They were assured that their responses would remain confidential and signed an informed consent form. During each experimental session, and according to his assigned condition, each participant carried out a 10-minute warm-up either with or without listening to music, and performed a 5-m multiple shuttle run test [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Right after finishing his efforts, he was asked to answer items intended to assess his affective state during the experimental task (see <xref rid="sec013" ref-type="sec">Measures</xref> section below). When an experimental session was terminated, the participants were thanked; and when the entire experiment was terminated, they were fully debriefed and thanked for their participation.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Music conditions</title><p>In the music condition, the music played for each participant was self-selected. Indeed, the participants were asked to download their own music and to specifically select music on which they feel more inclined to do high intensity exercise. This procedure was based on studies that have shown that allowing participants to choose their own music had greater benefits on their performance than assigning pre-selected music to participants [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Given the high intensity of the experimental task, all participants have chosen high tempo music (from 120 to 140 bpm) [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Music was played from an mp3 player through personal headphones, and was switched off after the 10-minute warm-up period. In the no-music condition, headphones were worn but no music was played.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Experimental task</title><p>The experimental task consisted in a 5-m multiple shuttle run test [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Six beacons were placed 5 m apart in a straight line to cover a total distance of 25 m. Each participant began the test in line with the first beacon (A); then, upon an auditory signal, he sprinted 5 m to a second beacon (B), touched the ground adjacent to that beacon with his hand, and returned back to (A), touching down on the ground adjacent to the beacon with his hand again. Then, he sprinted 10 m to a third beacon (C) and back to (A), etc., until 30 s of exercise had been completed. He was then allowed 35 s of recovery, during which he walked back to beacon (A). The 30-s run was performed six times [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The participants were instructed to perform maximally throughout the test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Measures</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Physical Performance</title><p>The distance covered by each participant was recorded to the nearest 2.5 m during each 30-s run.

Three hypotheses were formulated. First, it was expected that self-confidence, enjoyment, and STMP would be higher in the music condition than in the no-music condition, while cognitive anxiety would be lower in the music condition than in the no-music condition. Second, it was expected that self-confidence, enjoyment, and STMP would be lower during Ramadan than before Ramadan, while cognitive anxiety would be higher during the holy month. Third, it was expected that enjoyment and self-confidence would positively predict STMP, while cognitive anxiety would negatively predict STMP.</p><p>With regard to the first hypothesis, our findings revealed that cognitive anxiety was lower in the music condition than in the no-music condition before Ramadan, supporting previous studies that have evidenced a beneficial influence of music on affects and mood [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, before Ramadan, enjoyment, self-confidence, and STMP did not change as a function of the music conditions, running counter to previous studies showing that listening to music might enhance STMP [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The absence of a music effect on these variables could be due to the fact that the participants listened to music while warming-up and not while performing the task. In accordance with this suggestion, authors [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have recently shown that the greater the time interval after the use of a mental strategy, the lower the impact of this strategy on STMP.</p><p>Regarding the second hypothesis, the findings revealed that STMP was lower during Ramadan than before Ramadan in the no-music condition. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies showing that STMP was reduced during Ramadan [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136400.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. More specifically, these studies suggested that Ramadan observance would deplete physiological resources, thereby leading to a decrease in performance. Our findings also showed that enjoyment was lower during Ramadan than before this month in the music condition, suggesting that Ramadan would reduce the beneficial impact of listening to music on affects. Moreover, our findings revealed that: (a) during Ramadan, STMP was higher in the music condition than in the no-music condition, and (b) in the music condition, STMP measured before Ramadan did not differ from that measured during Ramadan. Taken together, these findings suggest that listening to music during warming-up would counteract the negative effects of Ramadan observance on STMP in fasters.</p><p>Correlation analyses revealed no significant relationships between affects and STMP, thus did not enable us to provide evidence for motivational mechanism (even if enjoyment was positively and slightly related to STMP).</p><p>This study is not without limitations. Indeed, this study was conducted on a relatively small number of participants, and this could explain the absence of some significant results. Consequently, further studies should use larger samples to test the robustness of findings with greater power, and to examine whether affects would mediate the relationship between listening to music and STMP during Ramadan. Moreover, caution should be taken when generalizing our conclusions since the sample used in this study included untrained participants only. In this context, it has been shown that untrained participants were more inclined to benefit from positive effects of listening to music than trained participants (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0136400.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Thus, further studies should test the moderating effect of the training status of participants using music in the context of Ramadan observance. Finally, further studies should take into account additional measures, such as physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, <inline-formula id="pone.0136400.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0136400.e001.jpg" id="pone.0136400.e001g" position="anchor" mimetype="image" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x002d9;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mtext>peak</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study represents a first attempt to examine the effects of listening to music during warming-up on STMP during Ramadan. The findings showed that music might be beneficial for STMP during Ramadan, and might counteract the negative effects of Ramadan observance on STMP. Thus, from a practical standpoint, listening to music during warming-up seems to be an effective strategy to counteract the negative effects of Ramadan observance on sport performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0136400.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Data of the study.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0136400.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the volunteer participants for their valuable time and contribution.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0136400.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
