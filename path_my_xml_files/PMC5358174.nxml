ECG interpretation forms a core investigative skill of the physician [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is essential for undergraduate and postgraduate trainees to become competent in this skill [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. British postgraduate training lists ECG interpretation as a core skill and one where competence needs to be achieved within the first year of practice. The Foundation Curriculum 2010 (FC 2010) used by all British foundation doctors stipulates that they must be able to &#x0201c;recognize and interpret ECGs&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are specific abnormalities on 12-lead ECGs and rhythm strips that should be interpretable to be deemed competent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Foundation Curriculum 2010.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cr-05-051-g001"/></fig><p>Despite the emphasis put on ECG interpretation in the FC 2010, many do not achieve the desired standard [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Multiple studies demonstrate that many foundation year one (FY1) doctors, senior house officers and attending physicians interpreted ECGs incorrectly [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2000, a British study of 46 graduated final year medical students were tested on recognition of several, common ECG findings including those in the FC 2010 [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; 9% rated themselves as &#x0201c;comfortable&#x0201d; with ECG interpretation [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Complete heart block, atrial fibrillation and inferior myocardial infarction were only identified correctly in 67%, 54% and 61% respectively. This study did not include a clinical history with the ECG and this can improve interpretation by 4-12% [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A retrospective analysis of 1,000 emergency department cases and ECGs found that 38 patients had been discharged with &#x0201c;abnormalities that could potentially alter case management&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Undergraduate and postgraduate training does not consistently deliver satisfactory competency in ECG interpretation. Traditional learning strategies alone are not achieving curriculum objectives. Mahler et al considered whether ECG interpretation was better taught through self-directed learning (SDL), lectures or workshops for American medical students [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two hundred and twenty-three students were randomized to one of these three learning strategies [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All formats demonstrated some improvement in educational scores. However lectures and workshops improved scores significantly more than SDL format alone [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Current learning strategies may not be not succeeding in producing undergraduate or postgraduate medical trainees competent in ECG interpretation. There may be an overreliance on SDL, and alone this may not always allow medical trainees to achieve competence. Alternative learning strategies should be evaluated and analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims</title><p>1) To assess the effect of two different learning strategies (focused teaching program (FTP) and SDL) on confidence in ECG interpretation for undergraduate and postgraduate medical trainees.</p><p>2) To assess the effect of two different learning strategies (FTP and SDL) on competence in ECG interpretation for undergraduate and postgraduate medical trainees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Method</title><p>A prospective randomized study was carried out over a 1-month period comparing two learning strategies in two cohorts: undergraduate third year medical students (first clinical rotations) and postgraduate FY1 doctors. Both cohorts had blinded randomization to one of these learning strategies: FTP and SDL. All participants volunteered prior to randomization. The study took place between October and November 2012. Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes. All groups were instructed to continue with their normal educational programs during the period of learning strategy implementation. The FTP was designed and delivered by one author (CM), who was blinded to randomization.</p><p>Prior to undergoing either learning strategy, all participants were invited to complete a questionnaire on confidence and competence. The questionnaire was online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">www.surveymonkey.com</ext-link>) to increase response rate. Following completion of the assigned learning strategy, participants completed a repeat confidence and competence questionnaire. Additionally under examination conditions, the volunteers were asked to complete a multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ) on ECG recognition for objective assessment of competence. The MCQ was set by two independent consultant cardiologists aware of the FC 2010. The MCQ difficulty was altered to an appropriate standard for each cohort.</p><p>The FTP groups (one per cohort) undertook a series of seminars focusing on becoming competent on ECG interpretation to the FC 2010 standard [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The FY1 group had three 1-h sessions, the third year medical students had four 1-h sessions. Topic areas covered were &#x0201c;ECG basics&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;ischemia&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;arrhythmias&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;special circumstances&#x0201d;. There was a workbook used in support of the arrhythmia seminar. SDL groups were provided with objectives but had no formal teaching. All participants were told to continue with their educational routine and attend the normal educational programme.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Involvement in the study was on a voluntary basis.

interpretation is a core clinical skill required as a doctor. Junior doctor&#x02019;s confidence and competence has been demonstrated to be unsatisfactory, with potential poor diagnostic and management skills as a result [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Undergraduates do not always receive teaching on ECG interpretation and this can impact confidence [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The effectiveness of formal teaching is better than SDL alone [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This problem is recognized in the UK. The FC 2010 emphasizes the importance of obtaining this core skill at an early stage in postgraduate training [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In a UK district general hospital, we have demonstrated a low level of confidence in ECG interpretation at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. The low level of confidence in the undergraduates at the start of their first clinical rotation could be expected as there may have been limited prior teaching on ECG interpretation. The postgraduate participant&#x02019;s low level of confidence in ECG interpretation is a greater concern. Postgraduates were more confident at recognizing life-threatening ECG rhythms (ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation) than other common ECG rhythms (complete heart block, atrial flutter). A possible explanation for this could be the recent attendance at the advanced life support course. FY1s achieved a high level of correct interpretation on the MCQ reflecting the improved self-rated confidence for life-threatening rhythms. Other rhythms outlined in the FC 2010 (right and left bundle branch block) were not interpreted correctly by many FY1 participants.</p><p>Overall confidence improved for all participants, with a greater improvement in the undergraduate group. The FTP cohort demonstrated a small improvement in confidence in the postgraduate group and a larger improvement in the undergraduate group. The undergraduate FTP cohort demonstrated a greater improvement in confidence for recognition of all ECGs and rhythms (except atrial flutter) than the SDL cohort. Postgraduate cohorts demonstrate no difference in confidence for specific ECG recognition.</p><p>The MCQ performance for the undergraduates demonstrated a difference between both cohorts in their level of successful ECG interpretation. The FTP cohort achieved better marks for several ECGs including significantly better for ventricular tachycardia and regular narrow complex tachycardia. The workbook covers these ECGs in detail and may offer an explanation to the reason why the FTP group obtained higher scores. The postgraduates achieved similar success rates of correct interpretation on the MCQ irrelevant of which learning strategy they were assigned to. Both cohorts achieved a high correct interpretation rate for life-threatening rhythms. However, both cohorts had a lower interpretation rate for left bundle branch block and second degree heart block.</p><p>The study is limited due to low numbers of participants involved. Additionally attendance rates at all sessions were variable due to other factors. A further study on a larger scale would minimize these factors.</p><p>The study demonstrates baseline levels of confidence and competence in ECG interpretation stands in a modern cohort of undergraduates at the start of their clinical experience and postgraduates. The level of perceived confidence amongst postgraduate doctors (FY1) may be of concern. The objective assessment of competence is greater than perceived confidence for most specific ECGs. Undergraduates demonstrated the greatest improvement in confidence and competence having undergone an FTP. A focused teaching strategy benefits undergraduates with less experience than postgraduates. SDL alone for undergraduates does not maximize the potential benefits in achieving learning objectives. Postgraduates seem to benefit less from FTP, but there is a confidence improvement that should not be underestimated. A cost neutral FTP strategy offers the potential for doctors to achieve the acquired standard in ECG interpretation in both undergraduate and postgraduate training. </p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhoble</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferenchick</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><article-title>Puzzle based teaching versus traditional instruction in electrocardiogram interpretation for medical students&#x02014;a pilot study</article-title><source>BMC Med Educ</source><year>2009</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>4</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1186/1472-6920-9-4</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19144134</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R02"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Raupach</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanneforth</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Anders</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pukrop</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Th J ten Cate</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Harendza</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><article-title>Impact of teaching and assessment format on electrocardiogram interpretation skills</article-title><source>Med Educ</source><year>2010</year><volume>44</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>731</fpage><lpage>740</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03687.x</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20528994</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R03"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Baranchuk</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><article-title>Electrocardiography teaching in Canadian family medicine residency programs: a national survey</article-title><source>Fam Med</source><year>2011</year><volume>43</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>267</fpage><lpage>271</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21500000</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R04"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="web"><collab>UK Foundation Programme Office</collab><comment>The UK Foundation Program Curriculum 2010.
