With the introduction of a new pediatric tracheal tube with an ultrathin (10 &#x003bc;m) polyurethane high volume-low pressure (HVLP) cuff (Microcuff pediatric tracheal tube), as well as, mechanical ventilation became a common practice,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] cuffed tracheal tubes in neonates and smaller children have become more popular in pediatric anesthesia during the last decade.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Although the design and tracheal sealing characteristics of newer pediatric cuffed tracheal tubes have been markedly improved,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] the risk of inadvertent cuff hyperinflation remains a matter of concern as a potential cause of airway damage in children. The upper limit of safety for cuff pressure in adults is 25-30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, but there is no data in children and it is speculated that a lower cuff pressure (20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) would possibly be safe.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and reliability of the cuff sealing pressure of the Micro-cuff pediatric tracheal tube in the prevention of the post-intubation airway morbidity compared with the other inflation techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval from local Research and Ethics Committee and written informed consents, 60 children with age between 6 and 12 years old and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II were enrolled in this prospective controlled, randomized, blinded study. All patients were scheduled for elective dental surgery under N<sub>2</sub>O free general anesthesia with expected duration of 120 min or more. Any patients who had a recent attack of upper respiratory tract infection, history of bronchial asthma, or in whom intubation was difficult (two or more attempts) were excluded from the study.</p><p>All the patients were pre-medicated with 0.2 mg/kg oral diazepam 90 min before anesthesia induction. After fixation of routine monitors (pulse oximetry, blood pressure, electrocardiogram) and pre-oxygenation for 2-3 min, a standard anesthetic technique was conducted by consultant anesthesiologist who was blind to the study design. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and propofol 2.5 mg/kg. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg, using oral Microcuff pediatric endotracheal tube (ETT) (Microcuff GmbH, Weinheim, Germany) with HVLP cuff [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>] and with an inner diameter calculated according to the Khine's <italic>et al</italic>. formula (ID = age/4 + 3).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Microcuff endotracheal tube with deflated cuff</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-8-484-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Microcuff endotracheal tube with inflated cuff</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-8-484-g002"/></fig><p>Patients were randomly assigned, by opening a sealed envelope, to one of three groups. In the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 20), the ETT cuff was aspirated as much as possible and then inflated with air to achieve a cuff pressure of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. In the sealing group (<italic>n</italic> = 20), the ETT cuff was aspirated as much as possible and then inflated with air to prevent air leaks during the inspiratory phase of mechanical ventilation of the patient when peak airway pressure was 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. In the finger group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) the ETT cuff was aspirated as much as possible and then inflated to a suitable pressure using finger estimation. The volume used to fill the cuff and the cuff pressure were recorded in each group using the hand-held cuff pressure gauge (Mallinckrodt Medical Athlone, Ireland) by an Anesthesiologist who was blind to the studied group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The same anesthesiologist assessed tracheal leak by both audible technique and by observing the difference between inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume. Mechanical ventilation was controlled and adapted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide at 30-35 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (1-2% end-tidal) and 30% oxygen in the air. Additional boluses of Fentanyl (1-2 &#x003bc;g/kg/body weight) were administered to maintain surgical analgesia. At the end of the surgery, sevoflurane was discontinued, the lungs were ventilated with 100% O<sub>2</sub> and the pharynx was gently suctioned. The residual muscle paralysis was reversed by neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. The tracheas of the patients were extubated when they fulfilled the following criteria; (1) efficient spontaneous respiration (2) ability to follow the verbal commands and ability to do purposeful movement (attempting self-extubation) (3) full reversal of neuromuscular block (ulnar nerve T4/T1 ratio = 1). The duration of the surgery and intubation as well as post-extubation stridor, were recorded. Post-extubation coughing was graded and recorded based on the modified four points scale as follows; Grade 0 = No cough; Grade 1 = (Mild) single bout of cough; Grade 2 = (Moderate) more than one episodes of unsustained (&#x02264;5 s) coughing and Grade 3 = (Severe) sustained (&#x0003e;5 s) bouts of coughing. Paracetamol suppository (15 mg/kg) was inserted for post-operative analgesia. The same blinded anesthesiologist recorded coughing as above grading and recorded sore throat and hoarseness using visual analog scale score (VAS: 0-10 cm) before discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and 24 h after tracheal extubation.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Mallinckrodit cuff pressure gauge connected to Microcuff endotracheal tube inflated to a pressure 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-8-484-g003"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>To calculate the sample size, we estimated that using sealing pressure inflation technique would decrease the incidence of post-operative sore throat by 50-60% than the finger estimation technique as evaluated by the pilot study.

Demographic data, duration of surgery and intubation, dose of fentanyl, the volume of air injected in the cuff and intracuff pressure were analyzed by one-way ANOVA-test with Bonferroni correction. Unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the previous data between the control group and the other two groups.

This was expected as the cuff pressure in the control group was in the safe recommended range (20-25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), which unlikely to impair tracheal capillary mucosal perfusion in children.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] On the other hand, the mean cuff pressure in the finger group (57.55 &#x000b1; 11.02 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) greatly exceeded the critical value, which could explain the higher significant incidence and severity of sore throat in this group compared to the sealing and control groups.</p><p>In our present study, the incidence of sore throat in the finger group was 65%, which is comparable to the result of Holzki[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] study who reported 82% incidence of airway trauma in children with CETT. This could be explained by the <italic>in vitro</italic> study of Bernet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who found that the external diameter of pediatric CETTs can expand to more than twice the age-corresponding tracheal internal diameter when overinflated, leading to considerable increases in cuff pressure above the perfusion pressures of the tracheal mucous membrane. This indicates that palpation of the external balloon (contiguous with the cuff) after intubation as a rough estimation of the intracuff pressure is unreliable unsafe technique for ETT cuff inflation.</p><p>In the present study, nevertheless the incidence of sore throat, was significantly higher in the finger group compared to both sealing and control group, the incidences of post-extubation stridor, cough and hoarseness were similar in the three groups.</p><p>This finding have been supported by our and other studies on the adult population.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This could be explained by the direct relation between the tracheal cuff pressure and the development of tracheal mucosal ulcerations, which correlate with the incidence of post-operative sore throat. While the other post-operative symptoms principally correlated with tracheal intubation and airway management, explaining their similar incidence in all groups. On the other hand, although the severity of sore throat was comparable in the three groups in similar adult studies,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] one of the interesting difference in this study is the significant high severity of sore throat in the finger group than both control and sealing groups. This could be explained by the delicate and tiny structure of the children tracheal mucosa, which might be deeply injured by high cuff pressure than adult mucosa resulting in more severe sore throat.</p><p>Our present study showed that Microcuff pediatric tracheal tube with an ultrathin HVLP cuff membrane allows an effective tracheal sealing at very low mean cuff pressures. This confirm the preliminary study of Dullenkopf <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who reported a significant low sealing pressure (11 cm H<sub>2</sub>O)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] of the new Microcuff pediatric tracheal tube compared with three conventional pediatric cuffed tracheal tubes. This was explained by the ability of the ultrathin polyurethane cuff membrane of the Microcuff tracheal tube to avoids the formation of longitudinal folds and provides &#x0201c;all-around&#x0201d; surface contact with the tracheal mucosa. This allows tracheal sealing by filling the tracheal lumen and not by pressure against the tracheal wall, producing low sealing pressure.</p><p>Although, the mean cuff pressure in the control group (20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) was significantly higher than the mean cuff pressure of the sealing group (17.1 &#x000b1; 2.53 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), three patients in the control group developed air leak around the cuff. This could be explained by the individual variation in the age related size and length of the pediatric trachea as well as the site of cuff placement. This finding pointed out the reliability of the sealing cuff pressure as a cuff inflation technique than cuff inflation to a recommended low pressure in prevention of the air leak.</p><p>The limitation of this study is that, we did not compare the pediatric Microcuff tracheal tube with the conventional pediatric cuffed tracheal tubes regarding the post-extubation morbidity. However, the present study and Dullenkopf <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported a lower sealing cuff pressure with the use of Microcuff tracheal tube, which would predict a lower stress exerted on the airway mucosa and hereafter, a lower incidence of post-extubation morbidity than with the use of conventional tracheal tube.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In anesthesia in which N<sub>2</sub>O is not used, inflation of the cuff of the pediatric Micro-cuff tracheal tube to a sealing pressure is safer than finger palpation technique regarding post-extubation laryngotracheal morbidity. Moreover, it is more convenient and reliable than inflation of the cuff to a safe lower pressure (20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) regarding prevention of the air leak.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
