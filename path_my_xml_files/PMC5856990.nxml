Rebleeding in patients with gastric ulcer bleeding can decrease the survival rate of patients.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> If treatment is delayed, the life of patients will be severely threatened. Therefore, it is important to select a scientific treatment for patients with gastric ulcer induced bleeding.</p><p>The pathogenesis of gastric ulcer has not been studied thoroughly; however, weakening of protection effect caused by Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and excessive secretion of gastric acid has been agreed.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Treatment with drugs such as acid inhibitors (prilosec and lansoprazole), anti-inflammatory drugs (levofloxacin and amoxicillin) and gastric mucosal protective agents (bismuth potassium citrate) were the main therapy for gastric ulcer induced bleeding previously. Though drug treatment has certain efficacy, it fails to control rebleeding.</p><p>In recent years, the efficacy of endoscopy in the treatment of gastric ulcer induced bleeding has been extensively recognized. Using therapeutic endoscopy can identify the cause of bleeding; then surgery can be performed to stop bleeding if needed.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Few studies focus on the treatment of gastric ulcer with therapeutic endoscopy in combination with quadruple therapy.

All the patients were diagnosed to have gastric ulcer by gastroscopy and had positive histopathological examination result of HP.

Treatment was considered as effective if bleeding was relieved 72h after treatment and area of gastric ulcer narrowed for no less than 50%. Treatment was determined as ineffective if bleeding did not stop 72 hour after treatment and area of gastric ulcer narrowed for less than 50%. The calculation formula for overall effective rate was overall effective rate=effective rate + significantly effective rate.</p><p>The incidences of adverse reactions including dizziness, nausea and fever and rehaemorrhagia were compared between the two groups. The Hp clearance rate of the two groups was also compared. Negative result in HP rapid urase test after treatment indicated absolute clearance.

Rebleeding within two weeks after treatment and amount of bleeding exceeded 1000 mL in two days were defined as rebleeding.

Therapeutic endoscopy can help find out pathogenesis in short term and bleeding spots; as a result, doctors can timely stop bleeding under therapeutic endoscopy to reduce frequency of hemostasis, relieve pain of patients and prevent and reduce the occurrence of adverse events.
