Treatment with TNF&#x003b1; inhibitors reduces disease activity and improves outcomes for patients with RA. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol 400 mg, a novel, poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG)ylated, Fc-free TNF&#x003b1; inhibitor, as monotherapy in patients with active RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this 24-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 220 patients previously failing &#x02a7e;1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) were randomised 1:1 to receive subcutaneous certolizumab pegol 400 mg (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;111) or placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;109) every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was 20% improvement according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) at week 24. Secondary endpoints included ACR50/70 response, ACR component scores, 28-joint Disease Activity Score Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate 3 (DAS28(ESR)3), patient-reported outcomes (including physical function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pain and fatigue) and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At week 24, the ACR20 response rates were 45.5% for certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks vs 9.3% for placebo (p&#x0003c;0.001). Differences for certolizumab pegol vs placebo in the ACR20 response were statistically significant as early as week 1 through to week 24 (p&#x0003c;0.001). Significant improvements in ACR50, ACR components, DAS28(ESR)3 and all patient-reported outcomes were also observed early with certolizumab pegol and were sustained throughout the study.

Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as occurring after the first administration of study drug and up to 12 weeks post final dose. Serious AEs (SAEs) and serious infections were also calculated (post hoc) as the number of new cases per 100 patient years (censored at the time of the first event by preferred term). Laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical examination and autoantibody levels were monitored according to predefined assessment schedules. Plasma concentrations of anti-certolizumab pegol antibodies for all patient samples were measured at a central laboratory (Covance, Chantilly, Virginia, USA) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at each safety assessment; samples were considered positive if the level was &#x0003e;2.4 units/ml (lower and upper limits of quantitation were 0.412 and 33.3 &#x000b5;g/ml). Patients who were antibody positive were assessed for neutralising antibodies in a cell-based bioassay (Alta Analytical, San Diego, California, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The sample size was based on the expected percent of ACR20 responders; 25% of patients treated with placebo and 50% of patients treated with certolizumab pegol were expected to achieve an ACR20 response at week 24. A sample size of 100 patients per treatment group was estimated to have &#x02a7e;90% power to detect a treatment difference of 25% in the ACR20 response rate between the treatment groups at a 5%, 2-sided significance level.</p><p>All efficacy analyses were performed on the modified intent to treat (mITT) population (all randomised patients who had taken &#x02a7e;1 dose of study medication). The actual number of subjects in the summaries varies slightly from the mITT numbers due to non-imputable missing data for each parameter. For the primary analysis, patients were considered &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; if they achieved an ACR20 response vs baseline at week 24. Patients who withdrew for any reason were considered non-responders. The proportion of ACR20 responders/non-responders at each visit was compared using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by country. Several sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable were conducted, including last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis. Analyses of ACR50 and ACR70 responders were carried out in the same way. Changes from baseline in categorical variables were analysed using the CMH method stratified by country. Actual values and change from baseline at each visit were summarised for continuous variables. Differences in continuous variables between treatment groups were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with country and treatment group as factors and baseline score as a covariate. Missing efficacy measurements were imputed using LOCF where available.</p><p>As part of the post hoc analyses, the proportions of patients reporting improvements &#x02a7e;MCID in patient-reported outcome measures (HAQ-DI, pain VAS, SF-36 and FAS) were compared between treatment groups at each visit using a logistic regression model with treatment as factor and baseline score, age and gender as covariates. The between-group differences in the number of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were tested using a CMH test stratified by country.</p><p>Safety was analysed in the safety population (all randomised patients who received &#x02a7e;1 dose of study drug). Analysis of AEs included summaries per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 5.1) coding terms for system organ class, higher level and preferred terms; intensity and relationship to study medication; and by classification as serious or non-serious. AEs leading to death and withdrawal were also assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 220 patients with active RA were randomised to certolizumab pegol 400 mg (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;111) or placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;109), with 76 (68.5%) and 28 (25.7%) patients in each group, respectively, completing treatment at week 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ard-68-06-0805-f01">fig 1</xref>).
