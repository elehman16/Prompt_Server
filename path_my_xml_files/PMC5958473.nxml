Combining pharmacotherapy with behavioral support increases smoking cessation success rates. In addition, hospitalized smokers have increased motivation to quit. We investigated the efficacy on smoking cessation, of varenicline in combination with behavioral support, in smokers hospitalized due to (a) acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or (b) bronchial asthma attack, or (c) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The method used is prospective, open-label, preference-based, parallel group, 52-week trial. Patients chose the smoking cessation intervention they preferred: a standard regimen of varenicline combined with post-discharge advanced behavioral support (group A) or one private consultation session during hospitalization (group B). Follow-up phone calls were scheduled in weeks 1, 2, and 4 and months 3, 6, and 9. The final hospital visit was performed in week 52. Primary outcome was success rate defined as the percentage (%) of smoking abstinence at week 52 and secondary outcomes were (a) changes in quality of life (QoL) indicated by the scores on the Short Form 36 (SF36) questionnaire and (b) predictors of smoking abstinence investigated with multiple binary logistic regression. One hundred one patients were enrolled, 44 (43.6%) in group A and 57 (56.4%) in group B. Respective abstinence rates were 54.5% and 15.8% at week 12 and 52.3% and 14.0% at week 52. Scores on SF36 were statistically significantly increased in both groups. Predictors of smoking abstinence were varenicline (odds ratio (OR) 7.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.15, 24.77; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), age (OR 1.07; 95%CI 1.00, 1.15; <italic>p</italic> = 0.042), Fagerstrom score (OR 0.37; 95%CI 0.20, 0.68; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), SF36 domains &#x0201c;vitality&#x0201d; (OR 1.12; 95%CI 1.04, 1.21; <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), and &#x0201c;social functioning&#x0201d; (OR 0.95; 95%CI 0.90, 1.00; <italic>p</italic> = 0.041). Varenicline in combination with behavioral support resulted in high abstinence rates inpatients hospitalized for exacerbation of COPD, asthma attack, or CAP, and improved QoL.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cessation</kwd><kwd>smoking</kwd><kwd>varenicline</kwd><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>pneumonia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1479972317740128"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tobacco smoking kills six million people around the world every year and is therefore the leading cause of preventable death.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Greece has one of the highest prevalence rates for smoking, with 53.8% of men and 33.5% of women according to the WHO age-standardized estimate for 2013 in people older than 15 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Every year, tobacco kills more than 25,400 people in Greece, and in 2010, 29.5% of deaths in men and 11.2% in women were caused by tobacco, the highest rates among other high-income countries.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>

Eligible patients, who agreed to participate and provided written informed consent, were assigned to two groups: those who wished to follow the &#x0201c;pharmacotherapy and behavioural support&#x0201d; (group A) and those who denied pharmacotherapy and agreed to participate in one consultation/advice session (group B).

Following this interview, patients decided whether they wanted to participate in group A or B and then gave written informed consent. All patients were advised to quit smoking on the next day to derive maximum benefit from the motivational interview, because they were still in hospital where smoking was not allowed. The schedule and type of the follow-up contacts and support was explained to the patients in detail.</p><p>The next day, patients in group A started varenicline treatment while still in hospital and they continued after their discharge. Follow-up phone calls with a minimum duration of 10 minutes were scheduled in weeks 1, 2, and 4 and months 3,6, and 9 following smoking cessation.

Behavioral support in combination with nicotine replacement resulted in a continuous abstinence rate of 14% (months 2&#x02013;12).<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Bupropion resulted in 16% (weeks 7&#x02013;26)<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and 28.6% (weeks 4&#x02013;26) abstinence rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In a further randomized, placebo-controlled trial, Tashkin and colleagues (2011) administered varenicline standard treatment, brief counseling sessions, and telephone calls in nonhospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COPD. However, patients did not immediately quit smoking, as ours did. Instead, a target quit date on day 8 of treatment was scheduled. Continuous abstinence rates were 42.3%, for weeks 9&#x02013;12, 25.8% for weeks 9&#x02013;24, and 18.6% for weeks 9&#x02013;52.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Success rates in the study of Tashkin et al. are similar to those reported in healthy smokers, and the authors concluded that COPD patients respond as well as healthy smokers to effective pharmacotherapy, despite a higher assumed nicotine dependence that predisposes to less success in quitting.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Our patients had more severe disease, since they were hospitalized for exacerbation of pulmonary diseases, but our higher success rates show that hospitalization is a &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; that can be exploited to reinforce the motivation to quit.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A teachable moment occurs when health events motivate individuals to adopt risk-reducing health behaviors.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In the case of our smokers hospitalized due to a worsening of their pulmonary disease, the heuristic model for a teachable moment is fully satisfied because three components come together at the same time: an increased perceived risk, redefinition of self-concept/social role, and increased emotion.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr46-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> In support of this notion, findings from the Framingham Heart Study showed that hospitalization in the previous 2 years increased the likelihood of smoking cessation by 30&#x02013;40%.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> In addition, even without following a formal smoking cessation intervention, in a review of 20 controlled studies on inpatient hospital-based smoking cessation interventions, success rates of post-hospitalization at week 52 were between 15% and 78%, where the lower scores were more frequent in general admissions and the higher scores in cardiac and cancer admissions.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr48-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>

The main predictors of success (OR) were sudden smoking cessation (7.19), low nicotine dependence score (Fagerstrom score &#x0003c; 5; 2.30), and first hospitalization (6.37).<sup><xref rid="bibr52-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec id="section20-1479972317740128"><title>Limitations and strengths of the study</title><p>Our study&#x02019;s main limitations are the lack of randomization, the absence of placebo control, and the open design. Because of nonrandomization, we cannot rule out the possibility that some patients who were more willing to quit chose the varenicline group or that others with fear or reluctance in taking another pill chose group B&#x02014;both these possibilities are introducing bias to the interpretation of our results. However, preference-based design adds to existing evidence, the potential impact of patients&#x02019;view toward their treatment, whereas an intention-to-treat analysis in randomized patients would underestimate the treatment effect in compliant patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> In addition, preference-based design by favoring compliance provides estimates on treatment benefit that might interest other patients willing and committed to adhere to a smoking cessation treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Such evidence would interest our future patients in search for an effective method to quit smoking. As Walter et al. have pointed out, &#x0201c;many physicians and patients want to know the expected benefit if they adhere to the therapy.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr53-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Furthermore, because we wanted to assess real-life outcomes in our patients, we were obliged to opt for a pragmatic design that did not alter routine clinical practice, and we therefore also did not exclude any patients who volunteered. These limitations do not allow for cause and effect conclusions, but certainly the results provide useful information for physicians and patients on smoking cessation practices.<sup><xref rid="bibr54-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> While a randomized trial can tell us whether a treatment is effective or better that another in ideal conditions, the pragmatic trial can tell us if this treatment will continue to work in normal settings.<sup><xref rid="bibr55-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="bibr56-1479972317740128" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> At last, the present results could serve as a starting point for the development of a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients like ours, that is, hospitalized with severe pulmonary disease. A further limitation is that varenicline was administered free of charge to the participants, which might have influenced their decision to participate. This needs to be addressed in an appropriately designed study. If medication costs prove to be a consideration that prevents smokers from taking smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, then medical care professionals should press for free of charge administration of anti-smoking medications for obvious reasons: reduction in healthcare costs as a result of improved health in the general population, and reduced lost activity and working days, to name but two. Another important limitation is that group B received only one consultation session and not the behavioral support provided to group A. This again is in accordance with our standard routine clinical practice; however, a behavioral support like this provided in group A might have lowered the high dropout rates.</p><p>Among study&#x02019;s strengths is the advantage of exploiting the &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; of hospitalization, and the secondary effect of this, that is, having to quit smoking from day 1 of varenicline administration, as patients were not allowed to smoke on hospital premises. Our study adds new findings to the very limited information available on smoking cessation success rates and QoL in patients with asthma or pneumonia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section21-1479972317740128"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Varenicline in combination with behavioral support can result in a seven fold increase in the probability of remaining smoking abstinent for at least 12 months.
