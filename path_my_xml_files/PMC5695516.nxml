Currently, no Chinese patent medicine (CPM) is previously reported to cure each of these symptoms primarily, and thus, there are no relevant instructions for the use of CPM. This study presents a new approach based on comparative effectiveness research to distinguish the curative effects of three CPMs that are often used in stroke convalescence to determine the ideal medicine for the treatment of each symptom.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>In this multicentre and double-blind clinical trial, stratified randomisation is used to group the patients according to their primary symptoms (hemiplegia, dysphasia and facial paralysis). Three strata will be enrolled, with 80 eligible participants included in each stratum. Each stratum will be randomly and equally divided into four groups, and each group will receive one of the following treatments: Naoxuekang, Xinnaoshutong (XNST), Xuesaitong (XST) or placebo. This study will include two stages: the initial treatment period (30 days) and a follow-up period (180 days). Three replicates for each data point will be completed during this trial. The first visit will occur on day 0 after enrolment, the second visit on day 30&#x000b1;2 and the third visit on day 210&#x000b1;5. The Delphi technique is adopted to achieve index weighting, which ensures that the evaluation outcome is patient oriented. The weighted index value will be computed as the final measurement index of the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (registration number TJUTCM-EC20160007).

Because 70% to 80% of the patients who survive stroke experience various degrees of disability and suffer from cognitive handicaps, they require assistance in performing activities of daily life, which severely affects their quality of life and places a heavy burden on their families as well as society.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>For the current treatment in the convalescence of stroke, clinical trials have shown that Chinese patent medicine (CPM) has a significant curative effect.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Many patients in the convalescent or sequelae stage voluntarily take CPMs to treat this disease and prevent recurrence (many CPMs for patients with stroke are over the counter).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There are various kinds of CPMs with similar instructions for the treatment of stroke, such as Naoxuekang (NXK), Xinnaoshutong (XNST) and Xuesaitong (XST) capsules. These three CPMs have been on the market for many years and have received positive clinical feedback. NXK capsules<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> are manufactured by Shandong HaoFu Pharmaceutical. The main ingredient of NXK is leech, and NXK has been proven to be effective and to cause minor adverse reactions according to clinical observation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> According to the Pharmacopoeia of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China, pregnant women and individuals with bleeding disorders should never be treated with NXK.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x000a0;XNST<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> capsules are manufactured by Jilin Aodong Taonan Pharmaceutical. The main ingredient of XNST is steroidal saponins of <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic>, and XNST has not elicited obvious adverse reactions in clinical trials.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> According to the Pharmacopoeia of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China, XNST occasionally leads to mild adverse reactions, such as dry mouth and upset stomach. Patients who have intracranial haemorrhage should not be treated with XNST, while patients with a history of bleeding or blood-low-viscosity-syndrome should be treated with XNST, although with caution.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> XST capsules<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> are manufactured by Kunming Shenghuo Pharmaceutical (Group). The main ingredient of XST is <italic>Panax notoginseng</italic> saponins, and according to the results of clinical trials, only minor adverse reactions have been reported; thus, it can be given to all patients without restriction.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, according to the Pharmacopoeia of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China, XST should not be given to pregnant women or people with allergies.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These three CPMs are frequently used for the treatment of stroke, hemiplegia, facial distortion, dysphasia, dark purplish tongue with ecchymosis, cephalophyma or cerebral thrombosis with symptoms caused by encephalorrhagia with high blood pressure.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 11 14</xref></p><p>In addition, because CPM interprets an illness based on syndrome theories, medical practitioners who are not well educated in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theories or those with little clinical experience are often unable to prescribe appropriate CPMs. Therefore, providing instructions on how to use CPMs based on symptoms is more easily understood and accepted by both doctors and patients.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>The feasibility of comparative effectiveness research in the evaluation of a CPM</title><p>The concept of comparative effectiveness research (CER) was introduced in the 1990s by Mark Boutin, the deputy executive president and chief operating officer of the US National Health Council.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality defined CER as follows: &#x0201c;Comparative effectiveness research is designed to inform healthcare decisions by providing evidence on the effectiveness, benefits, and harms of different treatment options&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The evidence was generated from research studies that compare drugs, medical devices, tests, surgeries or healthcare delivery methods.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In the following years, CER was introduced into the field of clinical research in numerous countries.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In May 2011, CER was introduced into TCM research at the Sixth Annual Meeting of the International Society of Complementary Medicine Research by Claudia M Witt (Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit&#x000e9; University Medical Centre, Berlin, Germany).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The outcome of CER focuses on solving the most important problems facing patients.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Thus, CER is concerned with answering questions about the overall effectiveness of interventions rather than efficacy of interventions.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It is more patient oriented, which means it respects the patients&#x02019; will, focuses on both the quality of life and psychological well-being of patients, aligns with TCM clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Effectiveness evaluation based on a patient-oriented theory</title><p>During the convalescent period after stroke, patients suffer from various clinical symptoms and&#x000a0;from an inability to perform certain activities of daily living and a lower quality of life.

Randomisation of the patients will be completed using an independent data centre with an interactive voice response system, and a random number will be generated by this data centre for each patient. Original copies of the blind codes will be sealed in a light-proof envelope; one copy will be retained by the major research unit, and another copy will be kept by the applicant of the trial. The envelopes will not be opened prior to formal statistical analysis. If a patient is eligible, that patient number will be allocated by the doctors. These patient numbers are merely serial numbers for labelling patients. The test medicine will be coded first, and then it will be placed in indistinguishable containers by specially assigned personnel who will not participate in this trial. In addition, medicine assignments will be in opaque envelopes and kept confidential by the trial management board. The original capsule shells of NXK, XNST and XST will be&#x000a0;exchanged for new uniform capsule shells provided by the pharmaceutical factory of Tianjin University of TCM. The placebo amylum will be placed into capsule shells that are identical to the shells of the experimental drugs. Therefore, the volunteers, doctors, participating nurses, trial coordinators, statisticians and outcome assessors will be blinded to the treatment assignments.</p><p>If emergencies occur or treatments are needed, the person responsible for the participating units will immediately report to CRA and the major investigators, and patient unblinding will be performed only with their approval.
