Thus, there was a need to explore strategies for painless injection techniques during LA administration, and to fulfill this, many forms of topical anesthetics, vibrotactile devices, jet injectors, and new electromagnetic and computer-controlled LA delivery systems were introduced in practice.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] A constant search for methods to avoid the invasive and often painful nature of the injection led to the invention of comfortable and pleasant means of achieving LA, which has become a research continuum.</p><p>The key to the development of computer systems was based on the fact that delivering the anesthetic solution at a continual rate, pressure, and volume can reduce the pain of injection. However, these cannot be controlled manually; hence, many systems that allow the LA solution to be administered comfortably to the patient in different areas of the oral cavity at a continuous pressure and flow, irrespective of the tissue resistance were introduced into the clinical practice.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Studies showed the reduction in pain and increased comfort during injection with these systems,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the clinical benefit ascribed the success of the computer systems to low pressure and slow delivery of the solution.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] On the other hand, the reported disadvantages with these systems are the cost, extra time taken for LA administration, space occupied by the equipment, and complexity of the equipment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although these systems provide an array of options for the practitioners to manage the pain associated with dental procedures effectively, the dental community is slow in adopting this technology and is satisfied with the traditional methods due to the demerits of the system. However, the most important and challenging aspect for pediatric dentistry, the pain control, i.e., minimizing during dental treatment, is being ignored.</p><p>Over the years, computer systems such as Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (subsequent versions named as Wand Plus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and CompuDent<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), Quick sleeper&#x02122;, Sleeper One&#x02122;, and Comfort Control Syringe&#x02122; were studied frequently and compared with traditional methods.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Gauge of the needle is reported to influence the pain of an injection;[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] however, dissimilar needle gauges were selected in some of the studies reported till date,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which can bias the results.

Therefore, the present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the pain perception in children during mandibular infiltrations using a new auto-controlled injection system (EJOA painless dental anesthetic injection) and the traditional syringe (TS), with 30-gauge, 10 mm needles during dental extractions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a superiority, open trial with parallel design and allocation ratio of 1:1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Setting</title><p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee, and the study was conducted at the department from March 2014 to September 2014.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Participants</title><p>Children attending the department who fulfilled the following criteria were included:</p><p>

Many computer anesthetic systems are marketed, of which much of the reported studies are on Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Quick Sleeper&#x02122;, Sleeper One&#x02122;, and Comfort Control Syringe&#x02122;.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has gained popularity; however, clinically the major disadvantages projected with this system are the time taken for LA administration and cost and complexity of the equipment.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Hence, the EJOA painless dental anesthetic system (designated as CCIS) was selected as an alternative to Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, in the present study, because due to its cost-effectiveness and being user-friendly with reduced complexity. CCIS is a pen-like instrument; however, hand unit itself has the total operating control unlike Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> that has foot control. This device resembles Comfort Control Syringe&#x02122;, which has five preprogrammed speeds for different injection techniques, a digital display for time elapsed, and rate and volume of the solution.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the CCIS selected for the study, there are two preprogrammed controls, and in addition, the speed and quantity of the injecting solution can be manually adjusted either in the base unit or handpiece (five levels in both speed and quantity, which can either be increased or decreased) adding a clinical advantage. As the studies with a standard protocol on these simplified versions of Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> are meager, the present study was performed to assess the effect of this new system in reducing the pain experience of children during LA administration.</p><p>As an alternative to IANB, PDL injection with Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has been suggested in one study.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Further, it was also reported that local infiltration is sufficient for procedures such as restorations and crowns whereas insufficient for lengthy procedures such as pulpotomy in children.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Hence, infiltration has been suggested as an alternative to IANB, for the restoration of primary teeth in the mandibular arch.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] There is insufficient literature on mandibular infiltrations as an effective alternative to IANBs during extractions. Hence, the present study is an attempt to determine the efficacy of local infiltrations when given using both CCIS and TS. No anesthetic failures or repetition of the LA procedure was observed in either group, which can be attributed to the time spent on injection that is directly proportional to the diffusion of LA solution. Thus, slow injection and short length of the procedure selected might be responsible for the high success rate of the local infiltrations in the present study, as observed by Jones and coworkers.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Pain and anxiety are correlated; highly anxious children can report greater pain and display increased pain-associated behavior to LA injections.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] To overcome this influence, the present study was restricted to children whose anxiety scores were &#x02264;24 in the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale-faces version simplified (MCDAS<sub>(f)</sub>), reported by the children before starting the treatment. This scale was selected due to its proven authentic measure of dental anxiety in children, with good reliability and validity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The simplified version, used in previous studies,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was applied to obviate some complex questions that were difficult for a child to understand, with an additional advantage of reducing the time taken to record. Before commencing the treatment, a difference in the reported anxiety values was observed between the two groups, with children in CCIS showing higher values. This difference was observed in young children (age range of 6&#x02013;8 years) and among girls. Thus, girls in the age range of 6&#x02013;8 years randomized to the computer group showed higher anxiety. A significant further reduction in anxiety was observed in children randomized to CCIS whereas those in TS group showed an increase in the MCDAS<sub>(f)</sub> values after the procedure. This signifies the lasting positive effect of painless anesthetic system, compared to traditional pricks. A coincidental increase in anxiety was observed, indicated by the elevated values of physiological parameter, pulse rate, in TS group children.</p><p>Pain during LA administration was assessed using self-report and observational measures; FLACC scale, a proven valid observational measure in children, was considered due to its simplicity of application in clinical settings, which comprises five behavioral categories: Facial expression, Leg movement, Bodily activity, Cry or verbalization, and Consolability; each rated on a scale of 0&#x02013;2 to provide a maximum overall pain score of 10.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] To achieve self-report of pain possible on comparable 0&#x02013;10 metric, FPS-R adapted from the FPS was employed,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] due to ease of administration and absence of smiles and tears in the faces. A statistically significant reduction of pain perception during mandibular infiltration was observed in children randomized to CCIS as evident in both self-report and observational scales, compared to TS. The positivity of painless system was clearly evident in the self-report scale, FPS-R (the mode was 0 in CCIS whereas 6 in TS group), showing the superiority of CCIS in reducing the injection pain. No significant difference in this transcend was observed among different age groups, as well as the gender. This reduction in pain with computer anesthetic systems can be ascribed to the constant flow and slow injection of the solution with the system used. Influence of two different flow rates (slow versus fast) with computer system alone also proved that slow injection rate has significantly less pain, compared to the increased velocity.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] The solution deposited ahead of the needle tip also might have anesthetized the access path of the needle for injection and the pen grasp of the injector increased preciseness and accuracy of injection. The superiority of computer system observed in the present study is in accordance with other studies related to maxillary buccal and palatal infiltrations, PDL injections, and inferior alveolar blocks using Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which was evident in both self-report and observational scales.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, the results are in contrast to the findings observed in other studies with no difference reported in the pain experienced on using these computer systems.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The beneficial aspect of painless system was also noted in the Frankl ratings of the present study. Most of the children were rated as positive initially in both groups; however, the behavior remained positive during and after treatment only in CCIS. This can be ascribed to the physical appearance of the injector, to which children pay more attention. The handpieces of these systems are not syringe shaped and, hence, might have been readily accepted by young patients.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Reduction in disruptive behavior of children was also observed in other studies conducted on Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, but the potential drawback reported has been prolonged injection time, demanding the cooperation of children. In the present study, the TOA is almost 0.5 times higher in CCIS group than the traditional infiltrations. Although a significant difference in the TOA was observed between CCIS and TS, the mean difference is less, compared to other studies.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The most convincing part of the present study is that similar gauge needles were selected for both TS and CCIS, whereas in most of the previous studies, dissimilar gauges were used or gauge was not considered, which could have influenced their results.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The present study also highlighted mandibular infiltration as a potent alternative to IANB. However, the major limitation of the present study is the study design; a split mouth study and comparison with Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> might have revealed more important findings. Considering only single-needle gauge and excluding children with negative behavior are other limitations. Hence, while generalizing the finding to population, these aspects need consideration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>The primary objective of instilling a positive attitude in children toward dentistry had been attained with painless anesthetic system in the present study. Computer system created a positive experience not only for the child but also for the practitioner due to the comfort. It acted as a good tool for building positive dentist&#x02013;child relationship. The study also eliminated the influence of needle gauge as a confounding factor influencing the pain in the studies pertaining to computer-controlled LA systems. The study also demonstrated the possibility of using buccal infiltration instead of IANB in children; however, further research is needed to understand the duration of anesthetic effect and the sufficiency of single injection for lengthier procedures.</p><p>Although the present system is cost-effective compared to the Wand<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, the usage of it is possible only in commercial setup. For the clinicians, this may be an extra burden and, hence, is not being used in individual clinics. Manufacturers should try to introduce simpler and economical alternatives in the equipment so that these painless anesthetic systems are utilized in clinical setting on a larger scale.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Oosterink</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><name><surname>de Jongh</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Aartman</surname><given-names>IH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What are people afraid of during dental treatment?
