Although PVB has not been studied previously for outpatient urologic surgery, only single case report is available.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] We assume that paravertebral block will provide a proper analgesia during and after ESWL. ESWL represents first-line therapy for the majority of urinary tract calculi. Renal and ureteral calculi are crushed into small fragments by shock waves and then pass spontaneously as small fragments. ESWL is a noninvasive procedure and requires anesthesia less than other treatment modalities. Majority of patients undergoing lithotripsy are outpatients and discharged on the same day of procedure.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] During the procedure patients experience sharp, stinging pain produced by the impact of the shock waves at the cutaneous entry site. Due to this sharp pain, patient may move leading to the need of repeated radiographic localization of the stone(s) for an effective lithotripsy. Effective ESWL requires a cooperative patient who should remain immobile on the lithotripsy table till the end of procedure.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining the institutional ethics committee's approval, 50 patients of ASA physical status I and II; aged 20-60 years, with radiopaque, single kidney stones smaller than 20 mm, detected by X-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, abdominal ultrasonography, and intravenous (I.V.) urography; were included in this study. The stone size was determined according to the maximal stone diameter, scheduled to undergo elective ESWL. The exclusion criteria were Patients&#x02019; refusal, obesity with body mass index &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, coagulopathy and significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, or metabolic disease. Patients with a history of substance abuse, psychiatric problem, and who were unable to cooperate with the investigation, active gastrointestinal reflux, chronic analgesic use, and allergy to local anesthetics were also excluded.</p><p>After application of standard monitoring including electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry, an I.V. ringer lactate infusion (10 mL/kg/h) was started. Patients were given oxygen by facemask and premedicated by 1 mg midazolam and 50 mcg fentanyl to decrease anxiety and discomfort during the procedure. Before premedication, each patient was instructed on the use of standard 10 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain before the procedure to enable understanding and cooperation of this investigation during and after the procedure. The procedure was well-explained to all the patients, and they were advised not to move during the procedure, they were instructed to ask for analgesic drugs for intolerable pain or discomfort.</p><p>Patients were randomized, following a sealed envelope method, to receive either a unilateral paravertebral block (group-P, no = 25) or local anesthetic infiltration (group-L, no = 25). Intra-and postoperative data were recorded by physician not participating in the study.</p><p>In group P, The unilateral PVB was performed in a sitting position. (T8 through L1) with the patient in the sitting position. The needle entry sites were marked 2.5 cm lateral to each spinous process, the skin was cleansed with chlorhexidine, and the injection sites were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. At each level, a 22-gauge, 50-mm insulated stimulating needle (Stimuplex; B Braun Medical, Inc, Bethlehem, PA) connected to a nerve stimulator (initial current 2 mA, 0.1 ms, 2 Hz) was advanced anteriorly into the parasagittal plane until it contacted the transverse process. The needle was then withdrawn and redirected caudally approximately 0.5 cm past the transverse process until an intercostal motor response was elicited or a subjective sensation of muscle contraction was reported. The stimulating current was reduced to below 0.8 mA; then 5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine was injected at each level.</p><p>Before surgery, the patient had decreased sensation to pinprick in the appropriate dermatomal levels unilaterally.</p><p>In group L, the patients received a local infiltration by bupivacaine 0.25% with maximum dose (2 mg/kg) into the 30 cm<sup>2</sup> area in diameter, around the posterior axillary line, beginning just above the last rib downward and including intradermal, subcutaneous, muscular and periosteal infiltration, which was performed with a single needle entry, after localizing the stones site and size. ESWL was started 10 min after the infiltration after examine sensation in that area by pinprick. Shockwave lithotripsy was performed by ESWL machine (BMA-MOBITRIP-MT-1RX), with ellipsoid reflector with shockwave coupling of water cushion (electrohydraulic lithotripsy) with C-arm (Philips BV25). Patients who had pain during the procedure with VAS &#x0003e;3 received 0.25 mcg/kg I.V. fentanyl as a rescue analgesia, which was repeated on demand and was recorded.</p><p>The visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed every 10 min till the end of ESWL, then every 15 min in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).</p><p>All patients were asked to report and were interrogated continuously for early symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity including light-headedness, lip or tongue numbness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>At the end of the procedure, the number of shockwaves, their power, and the total duration of shockwave treatment were recorded. After completion of the procedure, the patients were discharged with routine therapy and instructions if they fulfilled our local discharge criteria which mandate that the patient is fully conscious; he can walk to the bathroom and void, has no nausea or vomiting, and is hemodynamically stable.</p><p>Postoperatively, the patient was assessed for pain and nausea in the PACU using the VAS. Ondansetron (4 mg) I.V. was used as the rescue antiemetic. If patient required no opioids or antiemetics for 1 h, then he will be discharged to home and time interval between end of the procedure till discharge to home will be recorded. Patient's satisfaction with their anesthetic technique was assessed using a 10-point VAS, with 0 = highly dissatisfied to 10 = completely satisfied at first hours postoperatively.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The findings of the two groups were statistically compared using SPSS version 12 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Paravertebral block is advantageous in providing segmental anesthesia, early ambulation, and prolonged pain relief. In the hands of experts, paravertebral block can be a safe alternative to unilateral spinal anesthesia for unilateral inguinal hernia repair.</p><p>Elganainy <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] studied the efficacy and safety of local infiltration of lidocaine 1% as a monotherapy in ESWL and their study contained 100 patients with renal stones, which were randomly allocated into two groups to either received intramuscular injection of 20 mg ketorolac or to received lidocaine 1% by local infiltration and their conclusion was lidocaine 1% by local infiltration is considered an effective and inexpensive agent that can be applied with minimal morbidity during renal ESWL, but it could not be used as a monotherapy but it effectively reduced the need for analgesia. Which also correlated to our results, as local infiltration group were in significant higher in need for more rescue analgesia.</p><p>Intrathecal anesthesia for ESWL was studied before by Lau <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] who was comparing intrathecal sufentanil with intrathecal lidocaine and patients were assessed for intraoperative and postoperative pain and recovery profile and their conclusion was intrathecal sufentanil safe and effective alternative drug for ESWL.</p><p>Comparing general anesthesia versus epidural anesthesia studied by Richardson and his colleagues at 1998,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and their conclusion suggests that opioid-free general anesthesia using propofol, nitric oxide, and laryngeal mask airway is effective and is associated with rapid recovery and minimal side effects. General anesthesia obviates concerns regarding neuraxial anesthetic-associated postdural puncture headache, transient neurologic symptoms, urinary retention, and pruritus. In our study with multiple level paravertebral blocks none of the previous neuroaxial complications happen due to different technique and no opioid was injected into paravertebral space.</p><p>To our knowledge, this the first study which studies the efficacy of paravertebral block as effective anesthetic technique for patients undergoing for ESWL procedure, only one case report by Jamieson and Mariano[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] has reported that left PVB (T8 through L1) for patient with upper pole renal calculus with sedation by low-dose propofol infusion 25-50 mcg/kg/min without opioids and find that patient not complaining from any episodes of pain or nausea, and she was discharged from PACU to home after 72 min, and patient reported no pain despite passing multiple small stones overnight for the first 24 h. In contrast, in our study patient was satisfied by paravertebral technique as sole anesthetic technique during ESWL without using sedation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Paravertebral block is an effective alternative anesthesia for outpatient lithotripsy; multiple level paravertebral blocks provide an optimal anesthetic condition, with acceptable adverse events for ESWL. PVB is advantageous in providing proper analgesia during the procedure and in first hour after finishing of the procedure, early discharge to home and providing better patient's satisfactions.</p><p>The limitations of this study were the relatively small number of patients included, we did not follow-up patients for the first 24 h at least. The strengths of this study are the first study that confirms multiple level unilateral paravertebral block is effective as a single anesthetic technique for ESWL procedure without clinically significant side effects; in addition to better patient satisfaction. Further studies are needed with prolonged patients&#x02019; follow-up and on larger numbers of patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
