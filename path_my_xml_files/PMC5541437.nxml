Online school canteen ordering systems, where students order and pay for their lunch online, provide an avenue to improve healthy canteen purchases through the application of consumer behaviour strategies that impact on purchasing decisions. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a consumer behaviour intervention implemented in an online school canteen ordering system in reducing the kilojoule, saturated fat, sugar and sodium content of primary student lunch orders.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study will employ a cluster randomised controlled trial design. Approximately 1040 students (aged 5&#x02013;12&#x02005;years) from 10 primary schools in New South Wales, Australia, currently using an online canteen ordering system will be invited to participate. Schools will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the intervention (enhanced system) or control (standard online ordering only). The intervention will include evidence-based strategies shown to influence healthy food purchasing (strategies targeting availability, menu labelling, placement and prompting). The primary outcomes of the trial will be the mean content per student online lunch order of (1) energy (kJ), (2) saturated fat (g), (3) sugar (g) and (4) sodium (mg). The impact of the intervention will be determined by between-group assessment of the nutritional content of lunch purchases over a 2-month period postintervention initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee, University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee and New South Wales Department of Education and School Communities. Study findings will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications and relevant presentations in international conferences and to stakeholders.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12616000499482.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PUBLIC HEALTH</kwd><kwd>Public health nutrition</kwd><kwd>child diet</kwd><kwd>school canteen</kwd><kwd>consumer behaviour</kwd><kwd>NUTRITION &#x00026; DIETETICS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The trial uses the most internally valid research design (randomised controlled trial), includes objective measures of trial outcomes, central randomisation to groups and has been powered to detect small but meaningful population-level intervention effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The analysis of trial outcomes will be conducted by a statistician blinded to group allocation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The external validity of the findings may be limited, given the convenience sampling procedure and as the trial will be conducted in 10 schools from 1 Australian state.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Globally, poor diet (including excess intake of foods high in energy, saturated fat, added sugars and salt) is one of the leading causes of non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Given that dietary behaviours in childhood track into adulthood and are predictive of future non-communicable disease risk,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> improving child nutrition is a public health priority in Australia and internationally.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Schools are a promising setting to improve child nutrition<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> as they provide prolonged, centralised access to almost every child in high-income countries. Australian children consume almost 40% of their recommended energy intake while at school,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> with up to 72% of primary school-aged children purchasing their lunch from school canteens at least weekly.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The foods ordered from such canteens however are typically high in energy, fat, sugar and salt, from products such as pies and sausage rolls (consumed regularly by 54% of students), pizza products (30%), processed chicken (29%) and hot dogs (18%).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, interventions to improve the nutritional quality of foods purchased at school canteens are a key opportunity to improve child nutrition.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Findings of a recent systematic review of 18 school food environment studies suggest that modifying the relative availability of food for sale from school food services is associated with improvements in the purchase or consumption of healthy foods by students.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Similarly, school-based research in the USA has found that a number of point of purchase strategies to influence consumer behaviour such as nutrition labelling,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> prompting<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and the placement of menu items (including the order, prominence and access of items)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> are associated with the selection, purchase or consumption of healthier foods by students.</p><p>Online school ordering systems, which enable student school lunches to be ordered and paid for via the web, are becoming increasingly common in countries, including Australia (Personal communication with CEO Flexischools, March 2016)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the USA.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Such systems provide a platform to implement evidence-based consumer behaviour change strategies to support healthy purchasing choices by students and parents. Specifically, the online environment of these systems provides a controlled but dynamic infrastructure that enables implementation of a range of strategies that can reach large numbers of individuals at a relatively low cost.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> For example, point of purchase nutrition labelling, product placement and prompts, strategies that are routinely used by online food retailers to influence purchase decisions of consumers<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> can be readily deployed to influence the purchase choices of a large number of students and parents. Despite the potential benefits of implementing these strategies to promote healthy online school canteen purchases, there have been no previous trials of their application to online school canteen ordering systems.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Study aim</title><p>In this context, the purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a consumer behaviour intervention implemented in an online school canteen ordering system in reducing the kilojoule, saturated fat, sugar and sodium content of primary student lunch orders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>The cohort study will employ a parallel group, cluster randomised trial design. Ten primary schools located in New South Wales, Australia, with an existing online canteen ordering system will be randomised to receive either a 2-month consumer behaviour intervention (enhanced system) or control (standard online ordering only). The efficacy of the intervention will be determined by assessing between-group differences at follow-up in the average (1) energy (kJ), (2) saturated fat (g), (3) sugar (g) and (4) sodium (mg) content of a cohort of students who had made an online lunch order during the baseline period. Student purchase data will be automatically collected by the online canteen system. Outcome data will be assessed at baseline and for the 2-month period following introduction of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting</title><p>The study will take place in the state of New South Wales, Australia, a geographically large state including large metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas with a demographically and socioeconomically diverse population of &#x0223c;455&#x02005;000 primary aged children and 1600 government primary schools.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Children attend primary school from the age of 5 to the age of 12, with government schools being the major provider of school education (65.2%).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Schools</title><p>To be eligible, schools must be a government primary school in New South Wales with an operational canteen that has been using the online canteen ordering system supplied by a single specific provider (services &#x0223c;11% of New South Wales government school canteens (unpublished data) and henceforth referred to as &#x02018;the provider&#x02019;) for at least 6&#x02005;months. In addition, schools must process a minimum of 50 student online lunch orders per month. Special purpose schools that exclusively enrol students with special needs, juvenile justice schools, schools serving hospitalised children or schools with externally licenced canteens will be excluded due to the potential differences in the provision of foods in these settings. A research assistant will screen the school's online menu, and any school already employing point of purchase nutrition labelling strategies (same as that of intervention) will be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Students</title><p>All users of the online school canteen ordering system (eg, children or parents ordering on behalf of their children) who place an online lunch order during the 2-month baseline data collection period will be eligible for study inclusion. Other users of the school's online canteen ordering system such as teaching staff, as identified by the online provider, will be excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p>A list of schools will be supplied by the provider and screened for eligibility by the research team. A convenience sample of &#x0223c;50 schools currently using the online providers system will be invited to participate via mail and telephone with recruitment continuing until the required sample of schools (N=10) consent to participate. Schools that had been invited but were not within the first 10 schools to consent will not participate in the trial. The recruitment strategy will employ effective recruitment practices within the school setting.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Specifically, one member of the research team will act as a dedicated recruitment coordinator. The coordinator will manage the recruitment of schools into the trial and monitor consent rates. Schools will be provided with the direct phone number of the trial manager for any enquiries regarding the research. Study information statements will be mailed to school Principals inviting study participation. Specifically, consent will be sought from the Principal for permission for the research team to access deidentified data regarding canteen lunch order purchases, user demographics and usage characteristics of the online ordering system. As deidentified student purchase data are accessed via a school-controlled database, all data will be used and individual student consent will not be sought. Two weeks after sending the information statements, a research assistant will make multiple attempts to contact schools via the phone to confirm eligibility, answer any questions regarding the trial and invite participation. Following consent, the online provider will supply baseline lunch order purchase data (the 2-month operational period immediately preceding intervention initiation) of students, in a non-identifiable format, to the research team to assess the primary trial outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Following school recruitment, an independent statistician will use a computerised random number function in Microsoft Excel to randomise schools to either an intervention or a control group. Randomisation will occur at the unit of the school in a 1:1 (intervention:control) ratio in randomly sequenced blocks of two and four to ensure the number of schools allocated to each group remains approximately equal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016014569F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> Given evidence that socioeconomic status of the locality may be associated with the relative healthiness of student purchasing patterns,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> randomisation will be stratified by the socioeconomic status of a school locality based on school postcode.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Owing to the difficulty in blinding the users of the online system to the changes introduced, the study will be conducted as an open trial; however, parent and student users will not specifically be informed of the experimental manipulation of the study. Furthermore, the study statistician undertaking the primary analyses will be blinded to group allocation.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016014569F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Estimated participant flow through trial.

Online canteen ordering systems allow users (students, or a parent on behalf of a student) to login to a website to access their school's lunch menu. Users are then able to select, order and pay for lunch items which are then processed by the canteen and supplied to students during their meal break. Research in food service settings suggests that decisions regarding food ordered for school-aged children are typically made jointly by parents and children.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> As such, the intervention seeks to encourage consumer (parent or child) purchase of healthier foods and beverages for school lunch orders, that is, food items lower in energy, saturated fat, sugar and/or sodium. All users of the online canteen ordering system at intervention schools will be exposed to the intervention. Contamination of intervention components between groups will be minimised by randomisation at the school level, and by the provider preventing user access to the intervention by control group schools.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Intervention development and theoretical framework</title><p>The intervention draws on the principles of choice architecture.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This approach posits that consumer behaviour is influenced by social and physical environments through conscious (eg, reflective) and unconscious (automatic) processes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Choice architecture strategies alter the environments in which decisions are made, in this case, to cue healthier purchasing choices. Consumer behaviour interventions, based on choice architecture, typically require minimal conscious engagement by the consumer and can include: the provision of information (prompting, labelling, feedback); altering of the physical environment (eg, altering the placement of products including accessibility, position or proximity, lighting, d&#x000e9;cor, etc) or the properties of products or stimuli within an environment (packaging, presentation, functionality) to cue desirable behaviour.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The intervention component selection for this study was guided by the choice architecture typology proposed by Hollands <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Intervention selection was developed in consultation with a multidisciplinary team of experts, including health behaviour scientists, dietitians, canteen staff, parents, software providers and developers.

After the menu is uploaded but prior to being operationalised, the research team will be able to view the redesigned menu in order to confirm that the strategies have been applied and uploaded correctly. In order to monitor and manage intervention integrity, once the redesigned menu is operational, the provider will supply the research team with two reports (start and midintervention) listing any changes that have been made to the online menu by the school.

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Specifically, a dietitian will contact the canteen manager over the phone to obtain nutrition information of canteen menu items available online. For prepackaged menu items, the canteen manager will be asked to specify brand name, product name and serve size. The nutritional profile of each prepackaged item will be obtained by searching the &#x02018;brand&#x02019;, &#x02018;product name&#x02019; and &#x02018;serve size&#x02019; in a canteen product database consisting of over 1300 commonly stocked school canteen items developed by the research team.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> If the menu item is not listed in the canteen product database, the dietitian will use a publicly available database of commercial items (Foodswitch) to obtain the nutrition information panel.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> If the item cannot be located in either database, the dietitian will contact the manufacturer to obtain the nutrition information panel. If the dietitian cannot obtain the nutrition information panel from the manufacturer, a &#x02018;generic&#x02019; nutrient profile will be assigned using a commercial equivalent found in the canteen product database.</p><p>For menu items that are not packaged (eg, freshly made foods such as sandwiches, canteen made hot foods and snacks), dietitians will request a copy of the recipe from the canteen manager, including recipe yield, ingredients and serve size.

The mixed model will account for repeated measures of the trial outcome at the student and school level. Adjusting for baseline will control for known and unknown potential confounders as any differences in prognostic factors at baseline will be captured in the baseline values for energy, fat, sugar and sodium. All students that place an order during the baseline period will be included in the primary analysis.

First, the trial uses convenience sampling methods, and is conducted using one provider of online school canteen ordering systems in Australia, limiting the external validity of trial findings. Furthermore, the trial tests a complex public health intervention and is not designed to assess the independent effects of individual strategies used in the intervention. Future research using factorial designs would be warranted if the intervention is found to improve child diet in order to understand intervention mechanisms and to design more efficient interventions in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Dissemination</title><p>Modifications to the trial protocol will be made via the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and outlined in the final publication.
