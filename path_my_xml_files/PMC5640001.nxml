The 0 to 10 verbal NRS-11 is a tool that enjoys widespread clinical use due to its ease of administration. When using the NRS-11 patients are asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 represents &#x0201c;the worst pain possible,&#x0201d; using whole numbers (11 integers including zero). Often the value of &#x0201c;4&#x0201d; is used to confirm clinical nursing judgment as to the need for further intervention or documentation that the patient&#x02019;s goals for analgesia have been achieved.</p><p>The secondary study parameter was Global Perceived Effect (GPE).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The type of rating of perceived effect is a &#x0201c;transition scale&#x0201d; or GPE scale. The GPE scale asks the patient to rate, on a numerical scale, how much their condition has improved or deteriorated at some predefined timepoint. The GPE has several qualities that make it an appealing tool for use in clinical practice and research; being a single question, it is easy and quick to administer and the results are seemingly simple to interpret. Such scales have been recommended for use as a core outcome measure for chronic pain trials and been advocated to increase the relevance of information from clinical trials to clinical practice.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>The results of the crossover group were analyzed separately, and compared with those who received the actual treatment in the first case.

The Monte Carlo experiments have shown that for sample size 3 or 5 it is still possible to analyze leptokurtic, rectangular, J-shaped, moderately, and markedly skewed distributions.

Instead of using &#x0201c;sciatica (often S1)&#x0201d; as inclusion criterion it would have been better to use &#x0201c;pain predominantly below L5.&#x0201d; As stated the whole diagnostic cascade should be taken into account and not a single item. Another limitation of this study is the fact that we used only 1 diagnostic test block instead of using a double diagnostic test block. Having considered the daily practice in pain management, this sham RCT was completed with 1 diagnostic test block.</p><p>Regarding the internal validity of this study: (1) Because of the anatomy of the sacrum, we sometimes did not reach the S4 branch with the RF probe with 3 independent active electrodes, performing a L5 to S3 RF procedure. How much does the S4 branch attribute to SI joint pain? The size of the lesion by the RF probe with 3 independent active electrodes might be smaller than the one from the cooled RF treatment variant<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> but, again, what is the (exact) influence of that? (2) Age was non-normally (bimodally) distributed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>); this might reflect differences in disease type, encompassing different structures (anatomic changes, disorders of the capsuloligamentous structures, and diastasis from pregnancy and childbirth and disorders from the vascular plexus or complex neural network), and operative procedures.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (3) Pain scores were measured during follow-up at specific time periods (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Using average pain scores over certain time periods (ie, past month), based on pain diaries might have led to a different result.
