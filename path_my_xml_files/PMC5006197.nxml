Since 1980, treatment of OCD has dramatically improved with both the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) into clinical practice and the adoption of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Although SSRIs are effective in the treatment of OCD, a large number of patients remain refractory to drugs or are reluctant to take them because of side effects or discomfort with long-term pharmacological treatments (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Pallanti and Quercioli, 2006</xref>). Similarly, CBT is neither always practicable nor always effective (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). For these reasons, alternatives to classical therapies would be very helpful, and neuromodulation techniques offer very promising perspectives for OCD treatment, as they do for depression (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Gaynes et al., 2014</xref>). Deep brain stimulation has shown very encouraging results in refractory patients, but this invasive method is not appropriate for larger scale use because of significant surgical risks. As a noninvasive technique, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been explored in several clinical trials with various targets and stimulation protocols (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Saba et al., 2015</xref>). The majority of these studies focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with low or high frequencies. According to several reviews of these controlled trials, there is no convincing evidence for the efficacy of rTMS to either the left or right DLPFC in the treatment of OCD (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Jaafari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Saba et al., 2015</xref>). Two controlled studies have also explored the effects of low frequency rTMS on the orbitofrontal cortex with moderately positive effects but only in the short term (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Ruffini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Nauczyciel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Initially based on the observation of a defective inhibition and an excessive excitability of motor cortical regions in OCD patients, rTMS to the presupplementary motor area (SMA) has also been tried as a new target. After a first encouraging open-label study in patients with OCD or Tourette&#x02019;s syndrome (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al., 2006</xref>), <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al. (2010a)</xref> conducted a controlled double-blind trial in 21 medication-resistant OCD patients assigned to 4 weeks of either active 1-Hz or sham rTMS to the pre-SMA bilaterally. Differences among groups were not significant by the end of treatment based on the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS), but a trend in favor of rTMS was observed: a decrease of 6.6 points (25.4%) vs 3.2 points (12.0%) in the sham group. Moreover, a significant improvement was shown by the self-rated Y-BOCS and the Clinician Global Impression (CGI-S) scale, and the abnormal hemispheric laterality found in the group randomized to active rTMS normalized. In a similar vein, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Gomes et al. (2012)</xref> published the results of a sham-controlled study that did show significant benefits of 10-session pre-SMA rTMS (2 weeks) of low frequency (1-Hz) rTMS in 12 patients with OCD. A mean Y-BOCS reduction of 35% (7 responders in 12 patients) was obtained at 14 weeks follow-up, which was significantly larger compared to the sham TMS group&#x02019;s Y-BOCS mean reduction of 6% (1 responder in 10 patients). Another controlled study (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2009</xref>) investigated possible therapeutic effects of sequentially combined low-frequency rTMS to the right DLPFC and the pre-SMA, each stimulation lasting 20 minutes for a total of 10 sessions. There were no significant differences at the end of treatment between the active and sham groups on the YBOCS.</p><p content-type="indent">Due to conflicting and uncertain results, and in the absence of other clearly effective rTMS targets to treat OCD patients, it seems important to obtain more conclusive information on the efficacy of the pre-SMA target. Thus, the goal of the present study was to explore the efficacy of low-frequency rTMS to the pre-SMA in a large sample of OCD drug-refractory patients, with a 2-month follow-up, in a randomized, sham-controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty outpatients (23 women and 17 men), ages 19 to 63 years (mean 41.5, SD 10.7), with DSM-IV-TR OCD diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan et al., 1998</xref>) were enrolled in the study in 3 hospital centers in France. To be eligible, these patients had to have a total Y-BOCS score of 15 or more, a total duration of the disease of at least 2 years, and received at least two 8-week adequate sequences of treatment with SSRIs without satisfying results. All patients gave written informed consent, and the protocol was approved by the Piti&#x000e9;-Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ratings</title><p>Patients were assessed by a researcher who did not participate in the rTMS sessions and who was blind to the subjects&#x02019; treatment group allocations. Clinical evaluation performed at inclusion, end of treatment (week 4), and follow-up (week 12) included Y-BOCS, CGI-S, CGI-Improvement, Maudsley Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Obsessive Thoughts List, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Beck Anxiety Rating scale (BAS), and Global Assessment of Functioning. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0.0 was used at inclusion to assess DSM-IV-TR OCD and main psychiatric comorbidity.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Protocol</title><p>Patients were randomly administered either active or sham rTMS once a day 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated schedule. Only the rTMS administrator was aware of group allocation, whereas patients and scale-rater clinicians were blind to treatment status of subjects.</p><p content-type="indent">All patients underwent a baseline evaluation of the motor cortex excitability in both hemispheres by measuring the resting motor threshold (RMT). RMT was defined as the minimum magnetic flux needed to elicit a threshold EMG response (50 mV in peak-to-peak amplitude) in a resting target muscle (Abductor pollicis brevis) in 5/10 trials using single-pulse TMS administered to the contralateral primary motor cortex.</p><p content-type="indent">The real rTMS was administered with the Magstim Rapid2 biphasic stimulator (Magstim Company Ltd, UK) using a 70-mm figure-of-eight coil. Stimulation parameters were 1 Hz, 26-minute sessions (four 5-minute trains with an inter-train interval of 2 minutes, 1500 pulses/d), at 100% of RMT, using the lowest value of right or left hemisphere.</p><p content-type="indent">The sham rTMS was administered using the Magstim sham coil, which contains a mu-metal shield that diverts the majority of the magnetic flux such that a minimal (&#x0003c;3%) magnetic field is delivered to the cortex (Rossi et al., 2007). This coil looks and sounds like an active coil; however, it does not generate the same tapping sensation on the scalp like active rTMS. To maintain the blind conditions, we excluded patients who received TMS before. We also maintained the separation between the rating clinicians and the personnel performing the stimulations.</p><p content-type="indent">The coil was positioned to target the pre-SMA using neuronavigation (Brainsight, Rogue Resolution Ltd, Cardiff, UK; Eximia NBS, Nexstim Ltd, Helsinki, Finland) the T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of each participant. We considered the reference limit separating SMA proper from pre-SMA, the plane perpendicular on the bi-commissural line at the anterior commissure. The coil was placed with the handle along the sagittal midline, 2cm anterior to the reference, to stimulate the pre-SMA bilaterally and simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Baseline characteristics of both groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and &#x003c7;2 or Fisher&#x02019;s-exact test for categorical variables. The main analysis was the comparison of changes in Y-BOCS total score between baseline and W4 in rTMS and sham groups. This analysis was performed using the modified intent-to-treat population (defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 stimulation). The primary criterion was missing for 2 patients (one in each group). According to the protocol, missing data was replaced with the mean variation of the group for the patient within the sham group, whereas the patient in the active group was considered a failure (no improvement). Comparison of changes between baseline and W4 in Y-BOCS subscores and other symptomatic scales was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Responder rates at W4 (25% Y-BOCS score reduction between inclusion and W4) were compared using the Fisher&#x02019;s-exact test. Evolution of Y-BOCS scores over 12 weeks were compared using a linear mixed model for repeated measures including terms for baseline scores, group, time, and time by group interaction. We used compound symmetry for the covariance structure. The alpha level was set at 0.05 (2-sided). Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Inc.).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-three patients completed the study, 36 were included in the main analyses (see flow chart <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Contrary to <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al. (2010a)</xref> trial, a lack of statistical power cannot be a plausible explanation for these negative findings, because the samples sizes were superior to those of previous studies and becayse all trends are rather in favor of the sham group, for example, a higher responder rate in sham when compared with rTMS. The absence of efficacy of rTMS can neither be explained by methodological nor technical limitations. Indeed, the 4-week duration of treatment is the same or even longer than in previous studies, and we used a parallel sham-controlled design. Furthermore, this study is the first to use a MRI-based neuronavigation system to target precisely the pre-SMA in OCD treatment. In comparison with previous studies, it is not sure that the stimulated targets were exactly the same, because other authors did not use a neuronavigation system but only cranial anatomical coordinates (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Gomes et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The total response rates (10&#x02013;20%) and improvement levels (0&#x02013;2.8 Y-BOCS points) were surprisingly low in both groups. However, we know that OCD patients have a global poor placebo response (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Huppert et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, a majority of the subjects included within the present study presented severe or very severe features. They had high baseline Y-BOCS median scores (31 and 28 in the rTMS and sham groups, respectively) compared with a <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al. (2010a)</xref> study, where mean Y-BOCS scores were 26 to 27. Nevertheless, this explanation is not totally satisfactory, because mean Y-BOCS scores (32&#x02013;36) were also high in the <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Gomes et al. (2012)</xref> study.</p><p content-type="indent">Though, when our study is compared with <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani&#x02019;s (2010a)</xref> and <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Gomes&#x02019;s (2012)</xref> in terms of design and of subjects recruited, there are main differences that might shed some light onto the negative results we have found. First, after an initial double-blind sham-controlled phase, when 4 additional weeks of active rTMS were performed in <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani&#x02019;s study (2010a)</xref>, a decrease of 49% at the Y-BOCS was found among those who received active rTMS during the initial phase. These results were statistically different from the results of those who received 4 weeks of sham rTMS and 4 additional weeks of active rTMS. Although applied in an open label phase, a longer duration of active rTMS might bring additional efficiency. Second, the use of baseline electrophysiological studies might help better predict responders that benefit from treatment. In fact, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al. (2013)</xref> found a normalization of the RMT and an increased right hemisphere intracortical inhibition, whose change correlated with Y-BOCS scores. Third, as suggested by <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Gomes et al. (2012)</xref>, their positive results compared with the other studies targeting the same area might be mainly due to the characteristics of the sample. Their sample was composed of patients with fewer years of disease whose current episode was of a shorter duration. These factors could influence the therapeutic response, explaining higher treatment effectiveness in their study.</p><p content-type="indent">Patients enrolled in the present study are highly refractory with other indicators of clinical severity and treatment resistance, such as long duration of the disease (19&#x02013;25 years) and high rate of depressive comorbidity (75%). The latter is higher than that found within other OCD clinical samples, and depressive comorbidity is known to affect treatment outcome negatively (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Overbeek et al., 2002</xref>). As in previous studies, the patients included in our trial had to have failed adequate pharmacological trials for at least 2 anti-OCD drugs. But the fact that a majority of patients had received clomipramine is an indicator of higher severity and resistance, like the fact that 50% of included subjects had a current augmentation treatment (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Pallanti and Quercioli, 2006</xref>). In <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al. (2010a)</xref> study, patients were excluded if they were treatment-refractory, defined as nonresponse to clomipramine, at least 2 selective SRIs at adequate dose and duration, plus CBT in the last year. We can thus hypothesize that the patients involved in the present study have severe and refractory OCD and that these features can partially explain the lack of efficacy of rTMS.</p><p content-type="indent">Further studies should also investigate the optimal way to enhance the effect of rTMS in the treatment of OCD. As an example, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al. (2010b)</xref> obtained very significant improvements in 2 OCD cases treated with fMRI-guided rTMS to a functionally localized pre-SMA target. New targets and novel paradigms have been designed such as alpha-electroencephalogram-guided rTMS or theta-burst stimulation. <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2010)</xref> showed that low intensity of theta-burst rTMS at 50 Hz had a consistent and long-lasting effect, while alpha-electroencephalogram-guided rTMS (adjusting the frequency to the &#x003b1; frequency, which was found to be abnormal in left and right frontal regions and temporal lobes) improved obsessions but not compulsions (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). The combination of rTMS with CBT could be also a new strategy for refractory OCD, as suggested by a recent case report (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Grassi et al., 2015</xref>). Another region of interest in the treatment of OCD is the orbito-frontal cortex, with 2 positive controlled studies needing larger confirmations (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Ruffini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Nauczyciel et al., 2014</xref>). Lastly, a recently published open study showed an interesting effect of 1-Hz rTMS over the medial prefrontal cortex in 10 patients with OCD (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Modirrousta et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">To summarize, low-frequency rTMS applied to the pre-SMA remains a promising area of study in the treatment of OCD-related symptoms, but the optimum protocol for OCD has yet to be determined, identifying a more clinically relevant design and finding appropriate inclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Gwenael Lebreton for her very helpful work on this research.
