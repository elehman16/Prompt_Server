This study aimed to determine if a new school-based, &#x02018;Go2Play Active Play&#x02019; intervention improved school day physical activity and FMS. This was a pragmatic evaluation conducted in Scotland during 2015&#x02013;16. Participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;172; mean age&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;years) were recruited from seven primary schools taking part in the 5-month intervention, plus 24 participants not receiving the intervention were recruited to act as a comparison group.189 participants had physical activity measured using an Actigraph GT3X accelerometer at baseline and again at follow-up 5&#x000a0;months later. A sub-sample of participants from the intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;102) and comparison (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21) groups had their FMS assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD-2) at baseline and follow-up.

However, most children in western societies are not reaching the recommended 60&#x000a0;min of MVPA per day, with serious consequences on their health in later life (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Basterfield et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Healthy Behaviours in School Children (HBSC), 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2016a</xref>).

Active play involves children using large muscle groups to expend energy in physical activity which is unstructured, freely chosen and fun (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Truelove et al., 2016</xref>). It has the potential for population-wide gains in habitual physical activity and MVPA levels if engagement is increased (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Janssen, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Tremblay et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Active play often takes place in outdoor settings, and outdoor time is associated with increased habitual physical activity and MVPA levels compared to time spent indoors (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2011</xref>). However, contemporary children are engaging in less outdoor active play, probably due to parental safety concerns and the increasing use of screen-based activities (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Veitch et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al., 2006</xref>). Active play may generate higher levels of MVPA compared to other domains of physical activity such as physical education (PE), recess, active transportation and other sports and physical activities, which have been the subject of more research effort (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Hollis et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Brazendale et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Brockman et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>Recent intervention studies have also suggested that active play may improve fundamental movement skills (FMS) (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adamo et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2014</xref>). FMS are important, as they are associated with increased physical activity and MVPA levels; however, FMS are typically poor in contemporary children (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Lubans et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">O'Brien et al., 2015</xref>).

Schools have access to all children, including those from at-risk groups, who would otherwise not attend a community-based intervention (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Story et al., 2009</xref>). A new school-based intervention called &#x02018;Go2Play Active Play&#x02019; was facilitated by play workers, delivered weekly and lasted one-hour in duration. It used a combination of free play and active play to increase children's physical activity levels and improve their FMS. Therefore, the primary aim of this research was to determine if participation in the Go2Play Active Play intervention improved (a) school day physical activity and (b) FMS. A secondary aim was to estimate the intensity of activity during the Go2Play Active Play intervention compared to traditional PE in a comparison group.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> presents an overview of the recruitment process and data analysed.

A pragmatic evaluation involves conducting research in &#x02018;real world&#x02019; scenarios where decisions need to be made on how to best conduct the evaluation with the limited amount of time and resources the researchers may have. In relation to the present study, this meant that we could not control when the intervention began, the number of schools involved or how many Go2Play Active Play sessions and PE classes children engaged in at either baseline or follow-up. We were also unable to randomise schools or classes to the intervention or comparison group. Recruitment of the comparison group was based on convenience sampling as two schools already participating in the intervention offered an additional two classes who did not participate in Go2Play Active Play. Participants were similar in age, BMI z-score and socio-economic status (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Procedure</title><p>Once consent was provided, 189 participants (165&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;intervention; 24&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;comparison) were asked to wear an ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer for four school days (09:00&#x02013;15:00) during September and October 2015. Due to a lack of time and resources, it was not possible to assess FMS of all consenting children, therefore a sub-sample of 123 children (102&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;intervention; 21&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;comparison) were randomly selected from the seven schools to have their FMS assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD-2) (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich, 2000</xref>). Most children in the subsample had their baseline FMS assessed within one month of the intervention beginning. The participants in the intervention group continued their participation in the Go2Play Active Play intervention (comparison group continued their usual course of PE). At 5-months, the intervention and comparison groups had their physical activity and FMS re-assessed just before the intervention finished during February and March 2016. FMS were not assessed while participants were wearing their ActiGraph accelerometer as the FMS assessment may have affected their physical activity levels The mean duration at which FMS was measured at baseline and follow-up was 4&#x000a0;months (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.4).</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Intervention</title><p>Agile CIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agilecic.com" id="ir0005">www.agilecic.com</ext-link>) and Inspiring Scotland (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inspiringscotland.org.uk" id="ir0010">www.inspiringscotland.org.uk</ext-link>) designed the Go2Play Active Play intervention collaboratively and conducted pilot work in 2014 before the independent evaluation began in 2015. The Go2Play Active Play intervention was underpinned by Whitehead's concept of physical literacy (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Whitehead, 2001</xref>). Physical literacy is the development of physical competencies, motivation and confidence to be physically active throughout an individual's lifespan (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Whitehead, 2001</xref>). Key to developing physical literacy and therefore increasing physical activity levels is creating an environment that fosters an enjoyment of physical activity from an early age while developing key movement skills. Evidence has suggested that active play achieves both enjoyment and development of FMS thus providing an evidence-based justification as to why active play was the type of physical activity selected for the intervention (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adamo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The Go2Play Active Play intervention was outdoors, lasted one-hour in duration, was facilitated by local play workers (trained by Agile CIC), and combined structured games and free play (30&#x000a0;min each). The first half of the session aimed to introduce children to a variety of FMS by delivering fun, inclusive and active games focussed on improving a specific FMS area (for example locomotor or object control). Each session focussed on one FMS area so that a broad range of skills were covered over the 5-month intervention period. For example, if the first half of the session focused on object control, the play workers would facilitate games to develop children's catching or throwing ability (examples of the games played can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.activeplay.org.uk" id="ir0015">www.activeplay.org.uk</ext-link>). The second half was free play, which allowed children to practise what they learned in the first half of the session and/or to create and play their own games using a variety of traditional equipment such as balls, beanbags, cones, hoops etc. Additional information on the Go2Play Active Play programme can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inspiringscotland.org.uk/our-funds/go2play" id="ir0020">www.inspiringscotland.org.uk/our-funds/go2play</ext-link>.</p><p>During the intervention, four classes participated in two; one-hour Go2Play Active Play sessions per week and the remaining seven classes participated in one, one-hour session per week for 5-months.

However, since this was a pragmatic evaluation, it was not possible to randomly allocate classes to intervention and comparison groups and the size of the comparison group was small.</p><p>Recent research has suggested that children's physical activity levels decline around the age they start school (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Reilly, 2016</xref>). School hours are often very physically inactive periods of the day; and therefore, a critical time where improvements need to be made (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">van Stralen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Nettlefold et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Belton et al., 2016</xref>). Much of the research aimed at increasing physical activity levels during school has focussed on PE, recess and active transportation, all of which have shown limited improvements (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Hollis et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2016b</xref>). School-based interventions utilising active play are limited and tend to focus on recess interventions (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Verstraete et al., 2006</xref>). These studies have shown limited improvements compared to the findings in the present study where percent time spent in light physical activity and MVPA during the school day improved by 15.7% and 2.8%, respectively.</p><p>After-school is an important period of the day where children engage in even less physical activity than during school hours (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Brockman et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Belton et al., 2016</xref>). Although the present study only focussed on the effect of the intervention during the school day, it highlights the need to objectively measure physical activity after school to determine the true effect of the intervention. The influence on physical activity may be greater in the present study because children are learning to play with limited involvement from adults, and equipment that is readily available in most homes.</p><p>It is thought that active play has the potential to generate higher levels of MVPA compared to other types of physical activity (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Janssen, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Brazendale et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, children spent, on average, 30.1% of the Go2Play Active Play session in MVPA compared to the comparison group who spent 21.1% of their PE class in MVPA. Brazendale and colleagues found the MVPA content of an hour of free play was 35%, which is similar to Go2Play Active Play (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Brazendale et al., 2015</xref>). International recommendations suggest that children should spend 50% of their time in MVPA during PE (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Association for Physical Education, 2008</xref>). Although the MVPA content of Go2Play Active Play sessions did not achieve the 50% recommended time in MVPA, it appears that active play in the present study may generate higher levels of MVPA compared to traditional PE.</p><p>FMS need to be improved as they are low in children from western nations and are associated with increased physical activity and MVPA levels (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al., 2012</xref>). Interventions aimed at improving children's FMS have been successful in a range of settings including, early years, school and community-based studies (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Logan et al., 2012</xref>). Two school-based interventions, which focused on sports, provided improvements in some FMS skills but in general, the overall improvements in these studies were small compared to the present study (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Barnett et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Salmon et al., 2008</xref>). However, recent interventions that utilised active play to improve FMS have shown improvements in pre-school aged children and are more consistent with findings in the present study (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adamo et al., 2016</xref>). The mean GMQ score at baseline in our study was 83.2 (18.9th percentile) and significantly improved to 93.3 (36.1st percentile) in the intervention group. These scores, even at follow-up, are lower than the norm-referenced value of 100 presented by Ulrich (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich, 2000</xref>). In fact, it is widely thought that FMS are generally poor in contemporary children and worse in those with low socioeconomic status (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">O'Brien et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, 76% of the participants in the intervention group were from Scotland's most socio-economically deprived areas. While the present study had some limitations, discussed below, it tentatively suggests that the Go2Play Active Play intervention may be effective improving FMS. The mix of facilitated FMS games and child-led free play may create an environment that fosters natural curiosity in a child to practise FMS by themselves in an enjoyable way.</p><p>The present study was a pragmatic evaluation of a school-based active play intervention delivered by three local charities in central Scotland. Despite potentially promising findings, and this study being a novel attempt to evaluate an active play intervention as a means of improving both FMS and physical activity, it had some important limitations. Firstly, this study was a pragmatic evaluation meaning certain important elements of study design were out with the researcher's control. These included: when the Go2Play Active Play intervention began, the number of schools who participated in the intervention and how many active play sessions and PE classes they engaged in at both baseline and follow-up. The sample size was determined by the number of participating schools; therefore, a power calculation was not carried out and our ability to detect any change in the comparison group (e.g. in FMS) was probably limited due to the small number of children in this group. Second, the schools could not be randomised to the intervention or control group as schools were already selected before the research was underway. Third, the effect of active play on habitual physical activity (i.e. including time spent out of school) needs further exploration to determine the true potential of active play on increasing overall physical activity. Results obtained should be helpful in developing a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to provide a more definitive evaluation of Go2Play Active Play in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><title>Role of funding source</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source id="gts0005">Inspiring Scotland</funding-source>; 502 Gorgie Road, Edinburgh, EH11 3AF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inspiringscotland.org.uk" id="ir0025">www.inspiringscotland.org.uk</ext-link>).
