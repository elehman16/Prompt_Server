The classical fear conditioning/extinction/extinction retention paradigm is a well-known method for assessing emotional learning. The present study tested the impact of mindfulness training on fear conditioning and extinction memory and further investigated whether changes in white matter fiber tracts might support such changes. The uncinate fasciculus (UNC) was of particular interest in the context of emotional learning. In this pilot study, 46 healthy participants were quasi-randomized to a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR, <italic>N</italic> = 23) or waitlist control (<italic>N</italic> = 23) group and underwent a two-day fear conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction memory protocol before and after the course or control period. Skin conductance response (SCR) data served to measure the physiological response during conditioning and extinction memory phases. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed with probabilistic tractography and analyzed for changes of fractional anisotropy in the UNC. During conditioning, participants were able to maintain a differential response to conditioned vs. not conditioned stimuli following the MBSR course (i.e., higher sensitivity to the conditioned stimuli), while controls dropped the response. Extinction memory results were not interpretable due to baseline differences. MBSR participants showed a significant increase in fractional anisotropy in the UNC, while controls did not (group by time interaction missed significance). Pre-post changes in UNC were correlated with changes in the response to the conditioned stimuli. The findings suggest effects of mindfulness practice on the maintenance of sensitivity of emotional responses and suggest underlying neural plasticity.

Mindfulness is defined as the awareness that emerges through deliberately and non-judgmentally paying attention to present moment experiences, such as emotions, body sensations, and thoughts (Kabat-Zinn, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). While numerous reports have documented the beneficial effects of mindfulness practice on variables of mental and physical health (Keng et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gotink et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the working mechanisms of mindfulness meditation are poorly understood (Vago and Silbersweig, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lutz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). One of the mechanisms that appears crucial in the process of promoting mental health is the modification of emotional responses (Grecucci et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Through mindfulness training, practitioners learn to encounter emotional experiences with a distinct internal attitude. They let themselves be affected by whatever experience is present in the field of awareness, refraining from engaging in avoidance or internal reactivity towards it, and instead bring acceptance to bodily and affective responses (Hart, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Practitioners are instructed to meet even unpleasant emotions by turning towards them, rather than turning away (Santorelli, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>Several theoretical accounts have argued that through this particular internal attitude (i.e., exposure to emotional experiences without reactivity), mindfulness practice might influence basic conditioning and/or extinction processes (Baer, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Brown et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; H&#x000f6;lzel et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>; Vago and Silbersweig, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Brewer et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Tang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Such processes are typically investigated through classical fear conditioning and extinction protocols. Fear conditioning is a learning process in which a neutral stimulus [such as a light or a tone, conditioned stimulus (CS)] is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US, such as an aversive electric shock). After a few pairings, the presentation of the CS comes to elicit various conditioned fear responses, such as enhanced skin conductance response (SCR) in humans. Repeated presentations of the CS in the absence of the US result in the extinction of all conditioned responses. Extinction is thought to form a new memory trace (Rescorla, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Quirk, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), or reconsolidate the old memory with new contextual associations (Nader and Einarsson, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Rossato et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Inda et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>); extinction memory is thought to compete with conditioned memory for control of fear expression (Myers and Davis, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Recent research has shown that successful extinction memory reliably differentiates healthy from pathological conditions (Milad et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Holt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Graham and Milad, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Extinction memory may thus be a critical process in the transformation of maladaptive states.</p><p>The conceptual similarity of mindfulness with an exposure situation might suggest that mindfulness meditation could enhance extinction memory processes. Through enhanced attentional skills and non-judgmental awareness, it is also conceivable that mindfulness impacts the process of learning of emotional responses, i.e., that it impacts the conditioning of emotional responses (Brewer et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To our knowledge, no research has been published to date that has empirically tested such claims.</p><p>Studies that have examined mindfulness meditation-induced structural and functional changes in the brain have identified a number of implicated brain areas (H&#x000f6;lzel et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>; Fox et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Tang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), including limbic regions (e.g., H&#x000f6;lzel et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>), and regions in the orbitofrontal cortex (e.g., H&#x000f6;lzel et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). These brain regions have been identified as critical for the acquisition as well as the extinction of conditioned fear responses, and for the retention of fear extinction memory (Milad et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Sehlmeyer et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Milad and Quirk, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). More broadly, the interplay between prefrontal regions and the limbic system supports the regulation of emotions (Banks et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>It has previously been shown in cross-sectional research that in meditators compared to controls, structural connectivity is pronounced within multiple white matter pathways throughout the entire brain, including the uncinate fasciculus (UNC; Luders et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It has also been demonstrated in one longitudinal study that changes can occur in the integrity of white matter tracts in the brain following a relatively brief meditation training Integrative Body Mind Training (IBMT; Tang et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While the described neuroplastic changes are intriguing and might potentially underlie the benefits ascribed to the practice of mindfulness meditation, it has often been neglected to actually test the relationship between neuroplastic processes and changes in behavior. The UNC is the long-range association fiber that connects the orbito-frontal cortex with limbic structures within the anterior temporal lobe (Von Der Heide et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). While its exact function is currently not clear (Von Der Heide et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), it is likely that it is involved in processes of emotion regulation and emotional learning, based on the brain regions that it connects (Kim et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>We conducted a pilot quasi-randomized controlled longitudinal study to investigate the impact of an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course on the physiological response (SCR) in an emotional learning paradigm, i.e., a 2-day fear conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction retention experiment. We hypothesized that participation in the MBSR course would lead to facilitated extinction memory and also investigated the impact on the conditioning phase. The study further tested for plasticity of white matter integrity in the UNC, and investigated a potential relationship between changes in structural connectivity and changes in emotional learning. In order to ensure that the MBSR course had the typical beneficial effects on well-being in participants, self-report measures of perceived stress, mindfulness, and difficulties in emotion regulation (DER) were included.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from the Boston area (MA, USA) through newspaper and online advertisements, seeking volunteers that were feeling stressed.

Differential Aversive Conditioning Software (DAVCOND) controlled and timed the monitor with the images for the protocol and the finger stimulator while recording SCR-data simultaneously. Visual stimuli were rear-projected on a screen at the head of the scanner and could be seen by the participant through an adjustable mirror mounted to the head coil.</p><p>In the Conditioning phase (day 1), two CS, e.g., a red and a blue light, were paired with the US (an electric stimulation, selected by participants to be highly annoying but not painful) at a partial reinforcement rate of 62.5%. One CS was extinguished during the subsequent extinction phase on day 1 (CS+ E), whereas the other was not (CS+ U). A third CS (e.g., a yellow light) was presented during the conditioning phase and never paired with the US (CS&#x02212;). The US was delivered immediately following CS+ offset, with no delay between the CS+ offset and the US onset.

TRACULA is based on the global probabilistic approach (Jbabdi et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and utilizes prior anatomical information from Freesurfer analyses (Yendiki et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). DTI data processing was performed using the standard procedures for TRACULA software. Preprocessing and reconstruction of the T1 anatomical data was done using the FreeSurfer longitudinal stream<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref> Software package version 5.3, as this procedure is unbiased by the number of time points and more robust when multiple time points are available (Reuter et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Preprocessing of the DTI data included image corrections for eddy currents and simple head motions with FSL&#x02019;s eddy correct, B0 distortion correction using the field map data, and computation of the diffusion tensor. The affine intra-subject registration with the T1-weighted images was done using Freesurfer&#x02019;s &#x0201c;bbregister&#x0201d; (Greve and Fischl, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Inter-subject registration was done using the affine inter-subject registration to MNI152 space. The TRACULA standard procedures were then performed to fit the ball-and-stick model of diffusion to the diffusion-weighted images and for probabilistic tracking and track segmentation. For each tract, TRACULA computes a summary FA measure by averaging the FA in each voxel along the tract, where each voxel is weighted by the likelihood that the voxel was in the given tract. We examined the effects of mindfulness training on this measure of the UNC FA to test our study hypothesis. For completeness we also tested the other tracts that were not part of our primary hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Effects of condition and time on the dependent variables were assessed by conducting repeated measures analysis of variance (rmANOVA), with time as repeated measure, and group as between-subjects factor.

In regard to conditioning, MBSR participants were able to maintain the initial response to the conditioned stimuli, while controls dropped from pre to post. MBSR participants further showed an increase in FA in the UNC, while controls showed no change. The change in fractional anisotropy in the UNC was positively correlated with the SCR to the CS during the conditioning phase. Due to a relatively small sample size, this study only has the status of a pilot trial, and therefore findings are to be taken as suggestive.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Effects on Self-Report Measures</title><p>Self-report questionnaires assessed effects on participants&#x02019; PSS, MAAS, and DERS. The MBSR group reported improvements in mindfulness and in DER, which were significantly stronger compared to the control group, where no changes occurred. These findings are in line with previous studies (Robins et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Garland et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Omidi and Zargar, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). While baseline differences between the control and MBSR groups were not statistically significant, small changes existed and might have worked in favor of our hypotheses through regression to mean effects. However, the present study also suggested that the amount of home practice in the MBSR group predicted scores of the three questionnaires at post, further corroborating the impact of the mindfulness practice on the self-report effects. These findings demonstrate that participants perceived beneficial effects from the MBSR course.</p><p>Interestingly, the DERS score at pre negatively predicted the amount of home practice. This finding suggests that difficulties in the capacity to regulate one&#x02019;s emotions make it harder for participants to engage in mindfulness home practice. Mindfulness programs that have been developed for patient populations with particular DER address this problem by employing specific ways to support patients in taking up an individual home practice (Deckersbach et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Effects on Fear Conditioning</title><p>Results demonstrated an effect of the MBSR course on the acquisition of conditioned fear. While the SCR to the CS+ (and consequently also the differential response) dropped significantly in the control group from pre to post, it remained high following the MBSR course. A previous study that had investigated test&#x02014;retest reliability of responses in the fear conditioning, extinction, and extinction memory paradigm did not find significant changes over time (Zeidan et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), however, small decreases in SCR were noted for baseline values, response to the UCS, and responses to the CS+ during conditioning. This prior study did not relate changes in SCR to changes in stress. Higher SCR to the CS+ is indicative of successful fear learning and is adaptive for healthy functioning. In contrast, response to the CS+ during fear acquisition can be diminished during anxiety states (Vriends et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) or in dissociative states (Ebner-Priemer et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>While we had no directed hypothesis regarding the effect on the acquisition of conditioned fear, a preservation of the sensitivity to the conditioning process makes sense in the light of what is being trained by mindfulness practice: mindfulness training teaches to remain open, non-judgmental, and curious to what is occurring from moment to moment and refrain from engaging in internal avoidance. Consequently, previous studies have reported decreased habituation in experienced meditation practitioners; i.e., they maintain the freshness of attention for each incoming stimulus (Kasamatsu and Hirai, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; Antonova et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The literature, however, is mixed, and enhanced habituation has also been reported in beginning meditators relative to controls (Antonova et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we found a correlation between the change in the reaction to the CS+ (and differential conditioning) and the change in perceived stress, i.e., remaining sensitive to the CS+ was associated with diminished stress. This finding further supports the idea that the preservation of the response to the CS+ is adaptive. As an alternative interpretation, maintained sensitivity to the CS+ might have been caused by enhanced study commitment in the MBSR group, who had more contact with lab personnel. Such an effect could equally influence questionnaire scores. This effect could be controlled through the inclusion of an active control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Effects on Extinction Memory</title><p>Successful extinction memory differentiates healthy from pathological conditions (Milad et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Holt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Graham and Milad, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Extinction learning and its retention may thus be a critical process in the transformation of maladaptive states. It allows individuals to learn not to have a fear response to neutral stimuli when there is no adaptive function for the fear response. Therefore, fear extinction brings individuals in a position where they experience a sense of safety and can flexibly elicit other emotional and behavioral reactions. Based on conceptual considerations, as well as based on the overlap of involved brain regions, we have argued that mindfulness might work by enhancing extinction memory processes (H&#x000f6;lzel et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>; Tang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and have tested this hypothesis in the present study. While we found the expected group by time interaction and a significant increase in the MBSR group regarding extinction memory, the strong influence of baseline differences precludes the interpretation of this finding. Future research will need to employ larger sample sizes, and might consider stratifying participants to the groups based on baseline values of extinction retention.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Change in Fractional Anisotropy in the Uncinate Fasciculus Following MBSR</title><p>Here, we investigated changes in fractional anisotropy in the UNC following the MBSR course and aimed to relate potential changes to the effects on behavioral parameters. Previous research had reported that experienced meditators show greater white matter integrity within multiple white matter pathways throughout the entire brain (Luders et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and changes can occur following a relatively brief meditation training (Tang et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These previous studies, however, did not test for the behavioral relevance of such modifications.</p><p>In the present study, we were particularly interested in the UNC, due to its potential role for emotion regulation and emotional learning. In a review of literature on the UNC, Von Der Heide et al. (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) suggest that one role is to transmit salience-laden stimulus representations stored in anterior-medial aspects of the temporal lobe to the lateral orbital frontal cortex. The lateral orbital frontal cortex has been shown to be related to assigning rewards and punishments to behaviors, especially in the context of associative learning (Noonan et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The role of the UNC might thus be to allow decisions to be made based on the emotional tone or incentive value of the stimuli in order to alter behavior&#x02014;i.e., approaching or avoiding stimuli based on the reward and punishment history (Von Der Heide et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This description of the role of the UNC is well in line with the present finding that UNC plasticity is related to effects on the differential response to a conditioned vs. not CS.</p><p>The present study revealed a significant increase in fractional anisotropy in the right UNC following MBSR, and no significant change in the control group. However, the group by time interaction missed significance, and data therefore can&#x02019;t be taken to support the study hypothesis. Our sample sizes are relatively small though, so it will be worthwhile for future research to pursue this hypothesis further, and employ greater sample sizes. An impact of MBSR on UNC plasticity could have important implications, given that DTI studies have suggested that the structural integrity of this pathway is negatively correlated with trait anxiety levels (Kim and Whalen, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Baur et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Modi et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder and hyperarousal symptoms (Costanzo et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and findings of decreased integrity have also been reported in patients suffering from anxiety disorders (Phan et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Baur et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Furthermore, integrity of the UNC plays a role in emotional empathy (Oishi et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Relevance of enhanced UNC integrity for the reported improvement in anxiety symptoms (Hoge et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and enhancement in empathic behaviors (Shapiro et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) following MBSR should therefore also be tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Suggestions for Future Studies and Conclusion</title><p>The findings of the present study come with several limitations and therefore can only be taken as suggestive in nature. Future studies that investigate the impact of mindfulness practice on emotional learning and white matter plasticity should include larger sample sizes and employ an active control intervention (e.g., the Stress Management Education (Hoge et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) or Health Enhancement Program (MacCoon et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) that were specifically developed as active control interventions for MBSR to test mindfulness as an active ingredient). Future studies might also consider including clinical populations, such as patients suffering from anxiety disorders. If confirmed by future research, the findings described here might have great relevance for the better understanding of the mechanisms of mindfulness, and might potentially elucidate one way through which mindfulness exerts its beneficial effects on mental health and well-being.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Designed the study: BKH, TG, DNG, SWL, MRM.
