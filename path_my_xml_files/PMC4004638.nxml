The new 2013 recommendations state that EFV should be the first choice as NNRTI and ART should be started when CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count is below 500&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/arv2013">http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/arv2013</ext-link>). However, in countries where NVP remains the first choice, the later criteria will be an issue owing to its contraindication for women with CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count above 250&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l and men with more than 400&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l.</p><p>In RLS, three key problems are of concern with the use of NNRTI-based ART. First, there is evidence for an increasing baseline resistance to N(t)RTIs and NNRTIs among treatment-naive patients, which may compromise the efficacy of these treatments <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where the estimated prevalence of primary NNRTI resistance reached 3.4% in 2009 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Second, due to limited or no monitoring for plasma HIV RNA during therapy, treatment failures remain undetected for months or years and drug resistance mutations (DRMs) accumulate precluding a successful switch to a second-line therapy, and third, patients developing NNRTI/NRTI drug resistance may transmit resistant virus to sexual partners <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. Therefore, in RLS, the need to maximize the effectiveness of available first-line regimens and to sustain reduced morbidity and mortality remains a major challenge for ART programmes <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. When compared with NNRTIs, bPI regimens are more forgiving when adherence is relatively low <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and protect against emergence of resistance of NRTIs in long-term failing patients <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, even in settings with low or absent virologic monitoring <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. NVP being the NNRTI of choice in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2008, the Lubumbashi trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of initial ART with NVP compared with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with two backbones recommended by WHO, either tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or zidovudine/lamivudine (ZDV/3TC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design and individuals</title><p>Patients were randomized in an open-label, multicentre, parallel group superiority study conducted in Lubumbashi (DRC), the capital of the Katanga region, a city of one million inhabitants and an estimated HIV prevalence of 6% in adults in 2006. Eligible participants were adults, recruited through advertisements, who were ART-naive (previous single NVP dose for prevention of mother-to-child transmission was allowed) with an indication to start ART according to the Congolese National HIV treatment guidelines (WHO clinical stage 3 and CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count &#x0003c;350&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l, or clinical stage 4 or a CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count &#x0003c;200&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l regardless of WHO clinical stage). Main exclusion criteria were active tuberculosis, haemoglobin less than 8.5&#x0200a;g/dl in women and less than 9.0&#x0200a;g/dl in men, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase more than three times the upper limit of normal and creatinine clearance less than 50&#x0200a;ml/min.</p><p>Eligible individuals were randomized (1&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;1) with a simple randomization procedure based on computerized random numbers to receive: LPV/r (Aluvia; Abbott Laboratories) 800/200&#x0200a;mg/day [taken daily (q.d.) or twice daily (b.i.d.) at the patient choice] or NVP 200&#x0200a;mg b.i.d. combined with either TDF/FTC (300/200&#x0200a;mg) fixed-dose combination (FDC) (Truvada; Gilead Sciences Inc.) or ZDV/3TC, 300/150&#x0200a;mg generic fixed-dose combination. TDF/FTC replacing ZDV/3TC in individuals with positive hepatitis B surface antigen. These two backbones are recommended by the WHO and are available through the National Programme in DRC. Therefore, the allocated backbone was also randomly chosen with no <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis about their respective therapeutic effect. Patients treated with NVP started with a 2-week lead-in period at 200&#x0200a;mg daily. Nevirapine was chosen because in 2008 it was the first choice in association with ZDV and 3TC in the national guidelines in DRC. Following the new recommendations of the WHO, EFV is now the preferred NNRTI. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80/400&#x0200a;mg) daily prophylaxis was systematically given. Patients failing on NVP or LPV/r were allowed to switch to the other arm on the basis of the genotypic analysis. In case of treatment-limiting toxicity to the randomized dual N(t)RTI or to NVP or LPV/r, a switch to the alternate drug(s) was allowed.</p><p>Patients who developed active tuberculosis were discontinued from the study and switched to an efavirenz and rifampin-based treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Study oversight</title><p>The study was approved by the National Ethical Committee in DRC and by the Ethical Committees of Saint-Pierre University Hospital, Brussels and the University of Li&#x000e8;ge in Belgium. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. An independent data and safety monitoring committee blindly reviewed the efficacy and safety data after all patients have completed 24 weeks in the study. LPV/r and TDF/FTC, respectively, were donated by Abbott and Gilead Laboratories who played no role in the final design decisions of the study, the analysis of data or preparation of the manuscript. All others drugs were available through the National AIDS Program in DRC.</p></sec><sec><title>Study assessments</title><p>Clinical assessments were performed at screening, baseline, week 2, 4, 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter for 96 weeks. The treating physician assessed patient's adherence at each visit on the basis of pill counts and patients self-administered questionnaires. Counselling and support were given in case of adherence difficulties and detectable HIV-1 viral load.</p><p>Laboratory safety assessments were performed every 12 weeks. Hepatitis B and C serologies were assessed at baseline.</p><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> cell counts and plasma HIV-1 RNA (Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor assay, 1.5; F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd) were done at baseline, week 12 and every 24 weeks thereafter by a central local university laboratory. Virologic failure was defined as two consecutive (taken 15&#x02013;30 days apart) plasma HIV-1 viral load at least 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml after week 24 after starting therapy. We used a threshold of 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml because it is commonly used in most routine laboratory for genotypic determination. Since 2013, this limit is considered by WHO as an early site-based warning indicator of treatment failure in developing countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/arv2013">http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/arv2013</ext-link>), with the goal of ART remaining to achieve and sustain viral suppression. For all individuals with confirmed virologic failure, genotype sequencing was performed centrally on baseline sample and on sample taken at the time of VF, using the TRUGENE HIV-1 genotyping kit (Global Siemens Healthcare) and OpenGene DNA sequencing system. DRMs and HIV clades were interpreted using the HIVdb Program, 2011, from Stanford (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hivdb.stanford.edu/">http://hivdb.stanford.edu</ext-link>). For minority variant determination, DNA sequencing clonal analysis of the reverse transcriptase and protease amplified products sequencing at least 200 clones per sample was performed. Antiretroviral plasma levels were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in samples collected at the time of virologic failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to assess whether lopinavir/ritonavir is superior to nevirapine at week 48 when both are combined with one of the WHO-recommended NRTI backbones (TFD/FTC or ZDV/3TC). Follow-up was made until week 96. The primary endpoint was the number of patients who have reached a therapeutic failure endpoint, a composite of clinical or virologic failure.</p><p>Clinical failure was defined as the occurrence of a WHO stage 4 or WHO stage 3 event or death after at least 24 weeks of therapy, or a discontinuation of study drugs for toxicity at any time. Virologic failure was defined as confirmed plasma HIV-1 viral load of at least 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml after week 24 after starting therapy.</p><p>Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml, CD4<sup>+</sup> cell counts changes from baseline, HIV-1 resistance mutations, adherence and safety of the four regimens. The proportion of patients with a viral load below a threshold of 400&#x0200a;copies/ml was also assessed (exploratory analysis). A separate analysis between patients with baseline viral load above 100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml was also performed (exploratory analysis).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Assuming a rate of 15% of patients with clinical or virological failure in the LPV/r arm and 30% in the NVP arm at week 48, a sample size of at least 174 evaluable patients by arm was considered necessary to detect a difference of 15% with a 90% power and a significant alpha level of 0.05 using a Fisher's exact two-sided test. Assuming a rate of 25% of loss to follow-up, a proportional oversampling was made.</p><p>The rate of therapeutic failure defined as a composite of clinical and virological endpoint in randomized treatment groups was compared for superiority using a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis, which included data for all patients who were assigned to a treatment group and who have taken at least one dose of study medication regardless of any reason of discontinuation. In this analysis, patients who died before week 24 had tuberculosis before week 24, withdrew their consent, had a protocol violation or were lost to follow-up were counted as failure. Missing HIV-1 RNA viral load data were imputed as failure irrespective of the reason of absence.</p><p>We also did a per-protocol analysis on all the individuals who received study drugs up to 48 and 96 weeks and who did not discontinue the study treatment for another reason than therapeutic failure as defined above.</p><p>The differences between treatment groups (nevirapine-lopinavir/ritonavir) are presented in terms of risk difference and associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals. We used the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test to assess virologic and overall therapeutic responses adjusted according to the backbones of the patients. All other <italic>P</italic>-values are unadjusted.</p><p>Simple descriptive statistics were used for summarizing characteristics of patients by arm at baseline using median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous data, and frequencies and percentages for categorical data.</p><p>Other analyses of efficacy or safety between groups of patients were performed at considered week with the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test if the data were continuous and Fisher's exact test if the data were categorical.</p><p>Clinical and laboratory-associated adverse events occurring when the patients were still on the treatment assigned at the randomization were included in the safety analyses. Adverse events were recorded as drug-related if they were judged by the investigator to be definitely, probably or possibly related to any of the study drugs. Intensity grading was based on the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity guidelines for adults (2004).</p><p>The comparison between the backbones was only exploratory and focused on the safety data.</p><p>A posthoc analysis was performed to assess the sexual difference outcomes between treatment groups. Breslow&#x02013;Day test for homogeneity of odds ratio was used to verify the existence of an interaction between sex, treatment groups and endpoints.

Per-protocol analysis demonstrated more virologic failures and DRMs among patients who received a NNRTI-based regimen than those who received a bPI-based regimen. Although discontinuation for severe adverse events was similar in both groups, NVP-based regimen was better tolerated than LPV/r regimen. No difference in outcomes was seen in relation with the NRTI backbones.</p><p>Few randomized trials have been conducted in RLS to compare NNRTI vs. bPI-based regimen as first-line ART in adults <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref>. Among 500 African women who had no prior exposure to single-dose NVP, initial NVP-TDF/FTC was as effective as LPV/r-TDF/FTC in terms of virologic failure and death <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In a South African trial, no differences in virological outcome were found between LPV/r and EFV treatment arms <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The apparent discrepancy in rate of virologic failure between the above-mentioned trials and our trial may be related to a different definition of virologic failure <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Virologic failure rates are highly sensitive to thresholds and the choice of HIV RNA cut-off to define viral failure may lead to an underestimation of the prevalence of resistance <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the above-mentioned studies, a cut-off of 400&#x0200a;copies/ml was used to define virologic failure. With a threshold of 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml, our failure rate of 12.9% among patients treated with NVP-based regimens for 24 months is consistent with the results of observational studies. In 2008, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 14.6% of patients had a plasma viral load more than 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml after a median time on NNRTI regimen of 25 months <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In the systematic review by Barth <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> of 89 studies with 13&#x0200a;288 patients with a median duration of treatment of 10 months, the prevalence of virologic failure after 24 months was 33%.</p><p>In our study, virologic failure was not driven by pretreatment transmitted drug resistance. Indeed, only three out of 27 individuals who failed on NVP had NNRTI resistance at baseline. We found no minority resistance mutation at baseline in the remaining individuals. Our pharmacokinetic data and adherence measures are consistent with previous observations that suboptimal adherence is associated with an increased risk of emergence of DRMs in case of NNRTI-based therapy in contrast with bPI-based therapy <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">[6,15]</xref>.</p><p>No protease inhibitor mutations and only minimal NRTI resistance being found among LPV/r failing patients, our study also confirms that bPI-based regimens have a more &#x02018;forgiving&#x02019; profile in terms of emergence of resistance <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">[6&#x02013;11,16,17]</xref>. Of those patients with virologic failure, 86% had drug-resistant mutation to NNRTI and 50% were predicted to harbour HIV strains with reduced susceptibility or drug resistance to etravirine or rilpivirine, a relevant finding if these drugs would be considered for future salvage therapy in RLS <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. High frequency of NRTI mutations and dual resistance to NNRTI-NRTI were also found that limit the choice and response to a second-line therapy. Mutations associated with cross-resistance to NRTIs comprised multiple thymidine-associated mutations (18%) or K65R (32%). This high level of K65R in patients failing on TDF confirms the association with subtype C clades as compared with subtypes B and is consistent with a meta-analysis showing that genotypic resistance to NRTIs appears far greater in RLS <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">[19&#x02013;21]</xref>.</p><p>Because our participants were evaluated for viral load every 6 months after week 24, it is not surprising that observed resistant patterns were more extensive for this trial than for cohorts that received intensive virologic monitoring <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">[16,18]</xref>. In the absence of viral load monitoring, similar high frequencies of DRM (70&#x02013;93%) were reported in persons with prolonged ART failure <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">[22&#x02013;26]</xref>. In most sub-Saharan countries, the diagnosis of therapeutic failure is still based on clinical and immunological criteria that are not sensitive or specific enough leading to late or inappropriate switch to second-line regimen <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A recent editorial has stressed the public health priority in RLS to implement viral load testing as a standard monitoring tool <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Although this study was not designed to evaluate differences between men and women, our results suggest also that men had a poorer clinical and immunological outcome in response to ART. In RLS, poorer outcomes have been constantly observed in men, including a higher risk of opportunistic infections, mortality and virologic failure <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">[29,30]</xref>. So far, late access to care, differences in behaviour and lower adherence to therapy have been advocated to explain these sexual differences <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Our study has some limitations; we used NVP as NNRTI-based regimen. One cannot exclude that with an EFV-based regimen, rates of virologic failure would be lower <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, in case of virologic failure, NNRTI resistance mutations have been shown to remain significantly higher with EFV than with bPI and our conclusions on the robustness of bPI regimen would not change <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">[10,33]</xref>.</p><p>This study was not designed to see differences in outcomes between backbone and no definitive conclusions could be driven from our results.</p><p>This trial was conducted at clinics in a large city and does not reflect the routine of care in smaller cities and rural healthcare facilities. Public health decisions cannot be solely based on randomized clinical trials in settings with fewer constraints and optimal follow-up.</p><p>Although resistance considerations need to be balanced against other factors, such as cost, coformulation as fixed-dose combinations, short and longer-term toxicity, administration of ART with tuberculosis medication and lack of second-line availability following protease inhibitor use as a first-line regimen, it remains that particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, important gaps in service delivery and programme performance affecting a considerable proportion of ART programmes contribute to substandard antiretroviral regimen and acquired drug resistance <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This worrying situation reinforces the need, among other public health interventions, to maximize the effectiveness of available first-line regimen taking into account unplanned treatment interruptions and patients with a risk of poor adherence particularly in the absence of baseline genotypic determination and viral load monitoring. This is even more important since the implementation of the 2013 WHO guidelines, which will substantially increase the number of patients on ART and in the current settings of suboptimal therapies and lack of viral load monitoring may critically increase the level of resistance development. In such a setting, bPI-containing regimen might be a better suited first-line ART option in RLS that might improve rates of viral suppression and reduce treatment-emergent drug resistance. In case of virologic failure with bPI, due to the absence of major protease inhibitor mutations and infrequent minority variant resistant mutations <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, bPI could possibly be reused with a different antiretroviral backbone including integrase inhibitors <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In the next years, availability of other classes for second-line regimens, decreased prices and development of new drug formulation, following WHO prequalification and FDA approval of atazanavir/ritonavir FDC in late 2011, should facilitate strategic decisions regarding future switch of first-line combination ART to bPI.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Andrew Hill and St&#x000e9;phane de Wit for reviewing the manuscript.
