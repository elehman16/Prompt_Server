The articulations of this joint complex are primarily between the dome of the talus and the tibial plafond, which forms highly congruent saddle-shaped weight-bearing surfaces. The talus has a medial facet, which articulates with the medial malleolus of the distal aspect of the tibia, and a lateral facet, which articulates with the lateral malleolus. Ankle fractures are among the most common musculoskeletal injuries. These injuries span a spectrum from simple closed fractures to complex open injuries. As a result, the orthopedic management is varied and can range from nonoperative casting to staged surgery with a primary focus on damage control procedures followed by definitive fixation. These fractures typically result from a low-energy indirect rotational force in which the ankle is twisted &#x00026; the talus tilts &#x00026;/or rotate forcefully in the mortise, causing a low-energy fracture of one or both malleoli, with or without associated ligament injuries, but can also present as a more complex, high energy injury (Solomon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>).</p><p>Nondisplaced fractures of the medial malleolus usually can be treated with cast immobilization; however, in individuals with high functional demands, internal fixation may be appropriate to hasten healing and rehabilitation. Displaced fractures of the medial malleolus should be treated surgically because persistent displacement allows the talus to tilt into varus (Michelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>From January 2010 to January 2015 at our Teaching Hospitals, we randomized 20 consecutive patients with displaced closed fractures of medial malleolus, which were isolated medial malleolus fractures or part of bi-malleolar fractures. All were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with either malleolar screw or with tension-band wiring and the choice of mode of fixation were on alternate basis. They were then allocated to one of two treatment groups:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group1 (10 patients) had malleolar screw fixation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group2 (10 patients) had tension-band wiring.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The populations were similar in age group (median 37&#x000a0;years), gender, fracture type (Weber type B and C), and aetiology (twisting injury, fall, or motor vehicle accident) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Details of 20 patients with medial malleolar fractures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Group1 (malleolar screw)</th><th align="left">Group2 (tension-band)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Median age in years</td><td align="left">37 (24&#x02013;50)</td><td align="left">37 (21&#x02013;53)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Male:female</td><td align="left">4:6</td><td align="left">4:6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Right:left</td><td align="left">5:5</td><td align="left">6:4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Weber B:Weber C</td><td align="left">7:3</td><td align="left">7:3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3">Causes of the fracture</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Twisting</td><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Fall</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Motor cycle accident</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The fractures were classified according to the Danis&#x02013;Weber classification.

Radiographic evaluation includes anteroposterior, mortise, and lateral views of the ankle. The surgery was performed before the ankle swells up or when the swelling subsided, which was usually after 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days of elevation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>All the patients in this study were operated upon under general anesthesia. The patient was positioned supine and an Esmarch or a pneumatic tourniquet was applied to the mid thigh. After routine skin preparation and draping, we made an anteromedial incision that began approximately 2&#x000a0;cm proximal to the fracture line, extended distally and slightly posteriorly, and ended approximately 2&#x000a0;cm distal to the tip of the medial malleolus. We prefer this incision for two reasons: first, the tibialis posterior tendon and its sheath are less likely to be damaged, and second, the surgeon able to see the articular surfaces, especially the anteromedial aspect of the joint, which permits accurate alignment of the fracture. Handling the skin with care and reflecting the flap intact with its underlying subcutaneous tissue. The blood supply to the skin of this area is poor, and careful handling is necessary to prevent skin sloughing. We protect the great saphenous vein and its accompanying nerve. A small fold of periosteum commonly is interposed between the fracture surfaces. We removed this fold from the fracture site with a curet or periosteal elevator, exposing the small serrations of the fracture. We debrided small, loose osseous or chondral fragments; large osteochondral fragments were preserved. With a small bone-holding clamp, the displaced malleolus was brought into normal position and, while holding it there, internally fixed with either malleolar screw or tension-band wiring.</p><p>In <italic>group1</italic> patients a 3.2-mm hole was drilled in a superior posterior direction while distal fragment was held reduced with a pointed clamp or with two Kirschner wires bent to stay out of way as temporary fixation devices. Length of hole was measured, and a malleolar screw was inserted without tapping till it reached the other cortex. Kirschner wires were removed after screw was tightened. In two cases the fragments were large and tend to rotate, so we used additional point of fixation (a second screw or Kirschner wire).</p><p>In <italic>group2</italic> patients the fracture was internally fixed with two 2-mm smooth Kirschner wires drilled perpendicular to the fracture line. The Kirschner wires should be parallel, and their ends were bent at 90&#x000b0; angles. This will eventually prevent the figure-of-eight wire from slipping over the exposed ends of the Kirschner wires. A stainless steel 1.2-mm AO wire was passed through the previously drilled hole and around the bent ends of the Kirschner wires in a figure-of-eight configuration. The wire was then tightened.</p><p>We were carefully inspected the interior of the joint, particularly at the superomedial corner, to make sure that Kirschner wires or the screw had not crossed the articular surfaces. In conditions were image intensifier was available, we made roentgenograms to verify the position of the screw or the Kirschner wires and any faulty insertion could be avoided. Screen control was used in 3 cases only in our study. At the end of operation we deflated the tourniquet, obtained haemostasis, and closed the wound with interrupted suture. We avoided tight stitches to prevent necrosis of the skin edges. We applied thick padding and a posterior plaster splint with the ankle in neutral position.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>After treatment</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The ankle is immobilized in a posterior plaster splint with the ankle in neutral position and elevated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Postoperative X-ray was taken with anterior, lateral, and mortise views.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Follow up</title><p>All the patients were reviewed at 10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;days, 6&#x000a0;weeks, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months after operation.

This agrees with the results of Sang-Hanko and Young-Junpark who was achieved excellent and good results in about 78&#x000a0;% of cases treated with malleolar screws and 89&#x000a0;% of cases treated with tension-band wiring (Sang-Hanko and Young-JunPark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>).</p><p>In our study the mean time for radiologic bone union was 11.8&#x000a0;weeks (ranging from 8 to 18&#x000a0;weeks) for group1 patients and 9.4&#x000a0;weeks (ranging from 6 to 12&#x000a0;weeks) for group2 patients (significant difference P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03). This is similar to SK. Nurul Alam study that was reported a meantime of 12&#x000a0;weeks for malleolar screws and 9&#x000a0;weeks for tension-band wiring (Nurul Alam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>).</p><p>We have experienced only one case of delayed union (5&#x000a0;%) out of 20 cases of the study and no non-union developed. This case was a 50&#x000a0;years old female treated with malleolar screw fixation and the fracture took around 18&#x000a0;weeks to unite. This result slightly differs from the results of SK. Nuru Alam who was achieved 100&#x000a0;% union rate in both groups without any case of delayed union (Nurul Alam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>).</p><p>The low incidence of delayed union and non-union in our study might be attributed to stable anatomic reduction and limited soft tissue stripping, or due to small number of cases. Some authors reported loss of reduction with the use of tension-band technique as a result of K. wires become loose end and migrate proximally (Mack and Szabo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>). On the other hand many authors did not agree with the frequency of this complication and reported that with the proper surgical techniques, wire migration was not a problem (Kinik and Mergen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1999</xref>). In our study we did not see any wire migration or loss of reduction. Tension-band fixation of the medial malleolar fractures has been described or referred to previously by many authors (Muller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>; Finsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1989</xref>). Ostrum and Litski recently demonstrated the biomechanics advantages of the tension-band over other fixation techniques for medial malleolus. When resisting pronation forces and applying compression force tension-band were four times stronger than malleolar screw (Ostrum and Listsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>). This might explain the faster union rate we were achieved in group2 patients (mean of 9.4&#x000a0;weeks) as compared with group1 patients (mean of 11.8&#x000a0;weeks). Rovinsky in his study showed that the tension-band is more technically advantageous over other types of fixation for fixation of small fragment fracture of medial malleolus and is not recommended for the fixation of vertical fracture (Rovinsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>). We agree with these results as in our study we fixed few vertical fractures with horizontally directed malleolar screws but we excluded them from the comparison groups. Screw fixation alone may provide poor stability against torsion forces (Savage et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>). This may requires an additional point of fixation, which may be a second screw or a Kirschner wire. Dr. Jones in his study disagrees with these results and showed that single screw fixation had similar results to double screw fixation (Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>). In the current study we use additional point of fixation (second screw and K wire) in two cases in which the fragment was large and tend to rotate as screw fixation alone may provide poor stability against torsion forces.</p><p>Limitation of movements and swelling of the ankle are usually the result of neglect in treatment of soft tissue. Although better range of motion was noticed in group1 patients (80&#x000a0;%) as compared with group2 (70&#x000a0;%), it did not reach significance (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.628). This could be attributed to wide soft tissue dissection that was needed with the use of tension-band. These results may show similarity with the results of SK. Nurul Alam who reported in his study that the group treated with malleolar screw showed better range of motion (Nurul Alam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>).</p><p>During surgical fixation of medial malleolar fractures excessive pressure with bone clamps to hold the fracture reduction must be avoided to prevent crushing of the fragment particularly if the bone is osteoporotic. The fracture reduction instead can hold temporarily with K wire. Careful and meticulous soft tissue handling is important for prevention of postoperative wound complications, delayed union, and, joint stiffness. We did not face any case of osteoarthritis during the follow-up period. The reason could be explained by the fact that the anatomic reduction was stable and no non-union or it may be due to short follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The tension-band wiring is more technically advantageous for small fragment fixation of medial malleolar fractures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The tension-band wiring may be more available and its usage could translate into over all cost saving when applied to the large number of ankle fractures treated surgically in our country.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The faster radiological union which was achieved with the use of tension-band wiring as compared with malleolar screw could be added to the over all advantages of using this technique.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recommendations</title><p>These findings will have to be supported by a randomized clinical trial of larger number of cases and longer follow-up duration before recommending the tension-band wiring over malleolar screw for fixation of medial malleolar fractures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AAM wrote and designed the manuscript, and checked the accuracy or integrity of all parts of the work and propriety.
