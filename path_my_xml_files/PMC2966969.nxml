Efficacy variables were change in TMI by AECG, exercise ischaemia, angina diary data, and inflammatory biomarkers at Week 26. There was a comparable, highly significant decrease in TMI with amlodipine and atorvastatin, but no additional benefit for the combination. More than 50% of patients became TMI-free in all three groups and this was accompanied by a comparable, marked reduction in angina and nitroglycerin consumption. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein fell by 40% in patients receiving atorvastatin but there was no change with amlodipine. Adverse events were comparable among groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Atorvastatin was as potent an anti-ischaemic agent as amlodipine.

Atorvastatin was as effective as the well-established anti-anginal therapy, amlodipine. Because of the powerful effect of each agent alone, it was not possible to test whether combination therapy with both amlodipine and atorvastatin offered additional effectiveness over the individual agents. However, the impact of atorvastatin and amlodipine on the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein differed, suggesting that the anti-ischaemic effects were not achieved by the same mechanisms.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Vascular effects of amlodipine and statins</title><p>We have previously demonstrated reduction in TMI in patients with stable CAD using amlodipine monotherapy and in combination with other agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C6">6</xref></sup> This is most likely due to direct arterial vasodilatation with improved coronary flow and systemic after-load reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C13">13</xref></sup> There is increasing interest, however, in targeting further the dysfunctional vascular biology of atherosclerosis, as this may underlie both the disturbances of coronary blood flow in myocardial ischaemia and more serious adverse clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C15">15</xref></sup> Statins show a variety of vascular effects in addition to LDL-C lowering, but the clinical relevance of these &#x02018;pleiotropic&#x02019; actions has been controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C17">17</xref></sup> We now show, in a large randomized trial, that atorvastatin reduces one of the most common clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, TMI with and without accompanying angina pectoris, in association with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein lowering. Our objective measurements of TMI, based on ST-segment depression during AECG monitoring, were mirrored by similar reductions in both angina and nitroglycerin use recorded in independent patient diary data. These rapid changes are unlikely to be due solely to beneficial remodelling of the underlying arterial stenoses and, furthermore, were not related to degree of LDL-C lowering. The substantial reductions in ischaemic activity achieved by the treatments provide mechanistic support for the findings of the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial, in which angina and myocardial ischaemia are significantly reduced from baseline in the medically managed groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C1">1</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Effects of atorvastatin</title><p>Previous studies in patients with acute coronary syndromes or after MI have shown similar rapid benefits in ischaemic events or mortality using high-dose atorvastatin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C10">10</xref></sup> Patients were titrated rapidly to the maximum dose of 80 mg so that we were unable to determine whether a lower dose would have been effective in reducing myocardial ischaemia, as has been reported for clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C19">19</xref></sup> We included a combination arm to explore the potential benefit for dual therapy with amlodipine and atorvastatin and powered our study on the basis of a modest anti-ischaemic effect from atorvastatin. The unexpectedly large reduction in TMI observed with atorvastatin (52% of patients were rendered ischaemia-free), however, precluded the possibility of investigating potential additive or synergistic actions of the two drugs in combination.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Mechanisms of action</title><p>Although the benefit on TMI was seen with both amlodipine and atorvastatin, the underlying mechanisms are likely to differ. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was reduced only in the atorvastatin arms (as previously recorded in other populations), and no change was seen accompanying TMI reduction with amlodipine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C20">20</xref></sup> This clearly does not imply a causal role for C-reactive protein in the pathogenesis of TMI or angina.</p><p>Statins are known to reduce vascular inflammation and oxidative stress and improve endothelial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C7">7</xref></sup> All of these processes may contribute to disturbances in coronary flow regulation during normal daily life and lead to TMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C21">21</xref></sup> Our study was not designed to examine the quantitative relation between the degree of LDL-C lowering or inflammatory markers and change in activity of TMI. We cannot therefore draw conclusions about the relative contribution of cholesterol lowering and &#x02018;pleiotropic&#x02019; effects on the substantial improvement in ischemia seen with atorvastatin therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Patient population and study design</title><p>Our trial included patients similar to those frequently encountered by physicians in clinical practice. They were aged 39&#x02013;82 years, most were already receiving standard anti-anginal and anti-platelet medications, and had well-controlled blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C6">6</xref></sup> We designed our study to compare the effects of two drugs with different actions and their combination. We did not include a placebo arm for comparison with the active therapies, as it was considered unethical by the investigator sites. Previous studies have reported substantial reduction in ischaemia and angina in placebo groups of patients experiencing angina and coronary disease due in part to &#x02018;regression to the mean&#x02019;. We set the threshold for ischaemic activity required for inclusion in the study at a lower level than in previous studies using AECG monitoring to reduce the likelihood of the improvements being due to this phenomenon.</p><p>All ECG analyses were conducted by core lab staff who were blinded to therapy assignment and treatment phase. Patients were recruited on the basis of TMI in normal daily life, which was also the primary outcome measure. As in our previous studies, interpretable data were obtained on episodes of ST depression from the majority of patients, with only 9.3% of randomized subjects excluded for technical reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C6">6</xref></sup> We also undertook bicycle tests as a secondary measure, but this proved difficult to standardize and interpret largely due to the patients' good total exercise time at baseline and the variations between centres in the quality of records and conduct of the test.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Future studies</title><p>Medical therapy strategies are now moving towards concurrent reduction in multiple risk factors, such as blood pressure and LDL-C, because of emerging evidence for outcome benefit for this approach over individual risk-factor control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ133C22">22</xref></sup> This may be due to benefits on the common vascular consequences of risk factors. We now show additional benefits of statin therapy beyond lipid lowering in a frequently encountered patient population, with substantial reduction in symptomatic and asymptomatic ischaemia. Although we did not demonstrate additional benefits with amlodipine and atorvastatin combination therapy, future studies in patients with more severe ischaemia, not controlled by a single agent, as well as of lower-dose combination treatment, will be instructive.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was sponsored by <funding-source>Pfizer Inc</funding-source>.
