In response to situation change couple&#x02019;s counseling for IDUs was introduced. Data presented in the abstract are part of the randomized trial to test couple&#x02019;s counseling as a mean of HIV prevention among IDUs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Baseline data were collected in June - September 2011. 560 IDU couples in 10 cities were surveyed and screened for HIV and Hepatitis C. Participants were recruited using respondent-driven sampling method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Age of respondents varied between 30 and 33 years old with women being about 3 years younger compared to men. On average, duration of relationship was 3.7 years. Only 15% of respondents were married, while majority (64.9%) lived in a civil marriage; 20% declared having close intimate relationships. At the same time women tended to consider living together as &#x0201c;marriage&#x0201d; while men differentiated between these two categories. Men had regular jobs more often compared to women (23.8 vs 15.8%), as well as odd jobs (53% vs. 31% respectively). Data showed that there was no difference observed between men and women in sexual activity with regular partners. But men reported having more occasional sexual partners (3 partners/30 days), and women were more often engaged into commercial sex (19 partners/30 days). Condom use with occasional (80%) and commercial (88%) sex partners took place more often compared to sexual intercourse with regular partners (44%). Condom use during anal and oral intercourse was much lower and varied between 8% with regular partners and 25% with occasional partners. The most common reasons for avoiding condom use were sensitivity decrease (28%).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intimate partners are often not engaged into sexual relationships, even if they live together; drug use is sees as a more intimate process. Sex education for IDUs should account for nature of intimate relationsips; focus on reasons of condom non-use; and promote protected anal and oral intercourses. Education should also teach to understand risks related to own or partner's extramarital sex.</p></sec></body></article>
