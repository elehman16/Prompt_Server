Nutritional strategies can be effective in enhancing recovery rate. Choosing the best food items in appropriate intervals can play effective roles in resynthesis of fuels and recovery of muscle injury. Beverage micro and macronutrient content are helpful in fuel restoration. In this study, we assess the effects of various kinds of beverages on oxidative stress, muscle injury, and metabolic risk factors in taekwondo players.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This quasi-experimental study was performed on 21 taekwondo players of Isfahan. After collecting fasting blood, they performed runningbased anaerobic sprint test (RAST). Blood lactate was tested again and participants were divided into 3 intervention groups, that is, receiving 500 cc dough, non-alcoholic beer, and chocolate milk at 4 day intervals. After a 2-h recovery period, blood sampling was repeated. Elites consumed other beverages in later phases. Dietary intake and fasting triglyceride, cholesterol, blood sugar, lactate dehydrogenase, and F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostane concentrations were determined. Data were analyzed with a simple repeated-measures test and post-hoc tests using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Data showed that cholesterol levels non-significantly decreased after intervention. Triglyceride level was lower after taking dough and carbohydrate replacement drink. Blood glucose concentration increased after intervention periods, however, this increase was significant only after non-alcoholic beverage consumption. Lactate dehydrogenase levels reduced after all cycles, however, F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostane level showed no significant change. There was not significant change in lactate dehydrogenase and F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostane levels.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Non-alcoholic beer consumption can reduce lactate dehydrogenase concentration; however, it leads to blood sugar increase. Moreover, dough consumption significantly reduced triglyceride level in taekwondo players.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Athletic performance</kwd><kwd>beverages</kwd><kwd>F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostanes</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Recovery plays a critical role in improving athletes&#x02019; performance. Limited rest time, high intensity, and competition rate of strenuous sports emphasize on the necessity of following the most suitable approach to manage the functional overload of professional athletes.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] A proper nutritional strategy is helpful in order to achieve proper recovery, with multiple competing periods and several times per day. The content and time of nutrient consumption impact the resynthesis of fuel supply, reduction of muscle injury, and optimizing the competition performance.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>One of the most rapid repletion methods is drinking supplement beverages. Fluid supplements are preferable to solid products. Liquids are more tolerable in suppressed appetite of instant post-exercise period and they help in cell rehydration and substituting lost electrolytes due to sweating.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Beverage micro and macronutrient content and their utilization, during or post-exercise period, are effective in fuel restoration. Studies reflect that the consumption of carbohydrate-protein beverages during post-exercise recovery periods can facilitate glycogen restore and muscle turnover speed.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Chocolate milk composition is similar to common sports drinks, and it can enhance blood sugar level, speed of muscle glycogen repletion, and protein turnover. Its branched chain amino acids, carbohydrates, electrolytes, and easily absorbed casein and whey protein help athletes&#x02019; muscle stores.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Dough or Persian salty yogurt drink with a consistency similar to milk which contains high amount of whey protein and critical electrolytes such as sodium and calcium can affect athletes&#x02019; performance. Moreover, non-alcoholic beer as a source of carbohydrate, minerals, and vitamins is a popular and available supplement fluid.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Choosing the most proper recovery beverage can be useful for nursing and medical members of sports medicine to guide athletes. In the present study, we compared the effects of dough, non-alcoholic beer, and carbohydrate replacement drink on lactate dehydrogenase enzyme level, F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostane, lipid, and glucose blood level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This quasi-experimental study was performed on 21 elite taekwondo players. Written informed consents were obtained from all the participants. Athletes followed their regular physical activity and dietary patterns. The professionals were asked to stop their exercises for 24 hours before initiation of the intervention program. They were also asked to note their food intake in one-day &#x0201c;food recall&#x0201d; questionnaires.</p><p>Five milliliter venous blood was collected, and after 10-min warming up exercises, athletes followed standard protocol of running-based anaerobic sprint test (RAST). Blood lactate was tested after running the protocol and 1-h post-RAST by a calibrated lactometer (Scout Company, Germany).</p><p>Athletes at a 4 day interval, received 500 cc isocaleric beverages as dough, non-alcoholic beer, and chocolate milk. After taking the first beverage, they spent a 2-h recovery period. Then, the participants&#x02019; venous blood was taken; the other two beverages were consumed following the same guidelines. In other words, 21 participants who enrolled in one experimental study group consumed all three beverages. Interventions were performed at 4-day washing periods. Participants&#x02019; indirect VO<sub>2 max</sub> was determined by Harvard Step Test and their 24-h recalls were assessed using a NUTRITIONIST IV Software (Version 7.0; N-squared Computing, Salam, OR, USA). Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol level, and blood sugar assessed with enzymatic kits (Pars Azmoon Ins, Tehran, Iran). F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostane level as the marker of muscle breakdown was determined with Bender Medsystems GmbH Kit, Vienna, Austria.</p><p>Means and standard errors were calculated for each variable. Data were compared between different times using a simple repeated-measures analysis, and post-hoc comparisons were also performed too. All the analyses were done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) (version 20). <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was set as the significant level.

Mean triglyceride change was different after consumption of the three beverages. Non-alcoholic beer increases the triglyceride level, and the other liquids lowered plasma triglyceride level.</p><p>In a study by Bishop <italic>et al</italic>., plasma glucose levels reduced in the placebo group in comparison to the group that received carbohydrate-rich beverages, both at fatigue and at 1 hour after exercise.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Carbohydrate sport beverages increased glucose level and glycogen restoration rate during the recovery period.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It seems that stress hormone release was accompanied with post-exercise blood glucose reduction. Carbohydrate beverage consumption can compensate hypoglycemic periods of sports. Moreover, it can balance the fatigue perception, lowering quality of athletes&#x02019; performance.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Nutrient profile of milk and its products as carbohydrate, whey, electrolytes, and water can be effective on glucose level in athletes&#x02019; recovery periods.</p><p>The observed effect of fluid drink on triglyceride and total cholesterol levels are comparable with previous findings.

This reduction was higher in participants following aerobic exercises in addition to the mentioned diet. Lack of reported studies on the effects of fluid supplements on F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostane level makes more comparison impossible. These findings can help nursing and medical team members of sports medicine to guide elites and professional athletes in rapid and most proper recovery periods.</p><p>The limitations of our study were small sample size of participants and a before-after study design.
