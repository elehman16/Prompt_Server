Based on these findings, major efforts in preventive periodontics have focused on the various methods of plaque control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Mechanical plaque control methods, like scaling, is the first recommended step in the management of gingivitis and periodontitis and are an indispensable phase of periodontal therapy,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] but there are factors such as accessibility or presence of plaque retentive areas that can limit the clinical and microbiological response. Therefore, in addition to mechanical plaque control measures, chemical plaque control measures have also been advocated that can be used as adjuncts to mechanical measures, which together can reduce plaque and associated gingivitis. Although a number of chemical plaque control agents have been suggested, there is still a need for an anti-plaque agent that can be used on a daily basis with minimal side effects.</p><p>Herbal formulations can provide an option for safe and long-term use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Certain plants used in folk medicine serve as a source of therapeutic agent by having multi-potential effects in addition to their antimicrobial activity. Recently, studies have been carried out to find out the effectiveness of herbal extracts on established plaque and gingivitis, but the literature regarding this is very limited. Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gum Massage powder<sup>&#x000a7;</sup> is one such poly-herbal formulation that can be used to treat gingival inflammation and reduce the microbial load. Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gum Massage powder consists of <italic>Cinnamon zeylanicum, Piper nigrum, Eugenia caryophyllata, Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, and <italic>Rubia cordifolia</italic>, all of which have been shown individually to exhibit antimicrobial and antiinflammatory properties.</p><p>Hence, the present study was undertaken as a prospective, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of commercially available Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gum Massage powder, as a topical application and gum massage, in the reduction of plaque and gingival inflammation and in reduction of microbiological load in subjects with gingivitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 75 dentate subjects who reported to the Department of Periodontics, DAPM R V Dental College, Bangalore, were recruited for the study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the concerned Ethical committee of the institution. Subjects aged 20 to 40 years, having at least 20 teeth and with no history of periodontal therapy or previous use of antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medication within the preceding six months, were included in the study. Subjects with smoking habits, with known allergies to the constituents of the formulation, hematological disorders or other systemic illness, pregnant women, and women on oral contraceptives were excluded.</p><p>Each subject was randomly assigned to one of the three groups (25 subjects in each group): Group I - Scaling + Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gum Massage powder, Group II - Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gum Massage powder alone, and Group III - Scaling. In order to standardize the brushing technique, all the selected subjects were demonstrated the roll method of brushing technique and were educated and motivated to follow the same brushing technique during the course of the study. The powder was dispensed to subjects of Group I and II by a dental assistant not involved in the study. Subjects were instructed to apply a pea-sized amount of powder to the gums, twice daily, and to massage the gums gently by finger or soft brush an hour after regular brushing and to leave it for five minutes before rinsing. Subjects were also asked to refrain from all other unassigned forms of oral hygiene aids such as dental floss or oral rinse during the study. Subjects were assessed for gingivitis using the gingival index (GI) (<italic>Loe and Silness</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>], and for plaque using the plaque index (PI) (<italic>Tureskey</italic>
<italic>et al</italic>. <italic>modification of Quigley Hein Index</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] under identical conditions at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks. In addition to clinical evaluation, sub-gingival plaque samples were taken with the help of sterile paper points and sent for microbiological examination to assess the colony forming units (CFUs).</p><p>All the selected subjects fulfilled the clinical criteria of gingival index scores between 1-2, plaque index scores between 1-2, probing pocket depth &#x02264;3 mm, and with no attachment loss or radiographic evidence of bone loss.</p><p>Apart from clinical evaluation, subjective evaluation was also undertaken at each visit, using a questionnaire relating to the taste and flavor of the powder or any adverse effect experienced after use. To check for compliance, the participants were asked to return their assigned powder container, so that the investigator could verify the amount of powder that was used.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Collection of plaque sample</title><p>Sample sites were isolated using cotton rolls and supragingival plaque was removed to avoid sub-gingival plaque contamination. Sub-gingival plaque was collected using sterile absorbable paper points, which were inserted into gingival sulcus for 25 to 30 seconds and then transferred to preheated Robertson's cooked meat medium (2 ml) for culturing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Microbiological procedure</title><p>Preheated Robertson cooked meat media and thioglycolate media were used to transport the paper points to the microbiological laboratory.</p><p>For aerobic culturing,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] the trypticase soy agar plates were placed in an incubator and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 hours.</p><p>For anaerobic culturing,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] anaerobic condition was achieved using a &#x0201c;Gaspak system.&#x0201d; Subculture from Robertson cooked meat media and thioglycolate media was done using trypticase agar plate. The system comprised a transparent plastic body jar<sup>&#x000a3;</sup> with an air-tight lid fitted with a screened catalyst chamber containing palladium-sized aluminium pellets. Water was added to a disposable aluminium foil packet containing pellets of sodium borohydride, tartaric acid, and sodium bicarbonate. The packet was immediately put in the jar. Reactions then took place to supply hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The agar plates mounted on a metal stand were immediately placed in the jar and the lid was closed and clamped tightly. The jar was then placed in the incubator and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 hours. After the incubation period, the plates were observed for microbial growth. Using a colony counter, CFUs for each plate were counted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Students paired &#x02018;<italic>t</italic>&#x02019; test and unpaired &#x02018;<italic>t</italic>&#x02019; test were used for statistical analysis.

However, this procedure is tedious and it requires meticulous practice by the subject. Many chemotherapeutic agents have been introduced and widely studied, but most of them have side effects when used over a long time. Moreover, the increased awareness of environment and healthy lifestyle is generating some demand for more natural products such as those containing herbal extracts. In recent years, attempts have been made to test plants and plant products for their specific anti-plaque properties.</p><p>In this context, the present study evaluated the effectiveness of Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> gum massage powder in reducing plaque scores, gingival score, aerobic CFUs, and anaerobic CFUs. Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> gum massage is a brownish herbal preparation dispensed as a micro fine powder.</p><p>A total of 75 subjects were selected and divided into three groups. In group I, only scaling was done and then test product was given, in group II only test product was given, and in group III only scaling was done.</p><p>The best results in the present study were obtained when Scaling + Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was used together. It showed a very highly significant reduction in clinical and microbial parameters. This can be attributed to the mechanical removal of microbial plaque by scaling procedure with the added benefits of anti-inflammatory, astringent, and antimicrobial actions exerted by Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ingredients. In a similar study by Pradeep AR <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] the oral microbial load was found to be reduced after topical application of a herbal medicament containing mainly <italic>Acacia arabica</italic>. The results of our study also reported a reduction in the oral microbial flora in group I and group II subjects, which could be attributed to the antimicrobial action of various components of the test product used.</p><p>The positive effects of Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> gum massage powder can be attributed to its ingredients, such as <italic>C. zeylanicum, Piper nigrum, E. caryophyllata, G. glabra</italic>, and <italic>R. cordifolia</italic>.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title><italic>Cinnamon zeylanicum</italic> (Ceylon cinnamon)</title><p><italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> is known to have both antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] <italic>Quale JM</italic>

The results of this study suggest that Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> by itself cannot be a &#x0201c;stand alone therapy&#x0201d; in the prevention of plaque and gingivitis. When conventional mechanical plaque control methods were supplemented with Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> massaging, it resulted in very highly significant reduction in plaque scores, gingival scores, aerobic and anaerobic CFUs. In this study, oral prophylaxis (scaling) alone also resulted in significant reduction of all the measured variables; however, it is conceivable to suggest that Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> along with scaling is more beneficial in the treatment of periodontitis, which is primarily caused by anaerobic microorganisms.</p><p>Thus, from the present study, it can be concluded that mechanical plaque control coupled with multi-herbal formulation like Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> forms an effective method of plaque control and aid in maintaining optimum gingival health. The use of natural herbal preparations in healthcare continues to be popular and Periocare<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> powder may be a useful addition. Further long-term prospective studies are needed to confirm the results achieved in this short-term study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>&#x000a7; Good Shepherd Pharmaceuticals, Kerala, India.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>&#x000a3; Himedia Laboratories, Mumbai</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Theilade</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Experimental gingivitis in man</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1965</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>177</fpage><lpage>87</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14296927</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Theilade</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Experimental gingivitis in man.
