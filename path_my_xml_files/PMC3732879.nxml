Therefore, it can affect the movement ability in human and needs enough care and suitable treatment to avoid making difficulties in the rate and the range of movement and also low the complications and allowing fast return to work. Improper treatment may affect the movement ability and the quality of life, and the patient's disability may cause many social and economic problems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Some studies on femoral neck dislocation fractures have shown that non-union is seen in 23&#x02013;37% of the cases. These studies showed that fracture fixation can also affect osteonecrosis and non-union.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In other studies, the rate of non-union in dislocated femoral neck fractures has been reported to be 15%. In a meta-analysis of 564 patients of 15&#x02013;50 years, non-union was 4.7% in closed reduction. The authors stated that this rate may reach 11.2% in open reduction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] There are various treatment methods for these fractures, such as arthroplasty and internal fixation, but there is conflict of interest about applying these methods and their results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] All patients under 40 years of age and also patients between 40 and 60 years of age without risk factors for osteoporosis and other risk factors can be treated by closed or open reduction and internal fixation. While patients between 40 and 60 years with risk factors for osteoporosis such as diabetes can be treated with total hip arthroplasty (THA), and patients between 40 and 60 years consuming alcohol are treated with a bipolar hemi-arthroplasty. In patients over 60 years, due to factors such as functional needs of the patient, the presence or absence of cognitive impairment, mobility of patients, and associated medical conditions, various types of arthroplasty can be used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study is detecting the treatment outcomes of intracapsular femoral neck fractures with open or closed reduction and internal fixation with screw in 18&#x02013;50-year-old patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This clinical trial study was done from Nov 2010 to Nov 2011 in Ayatollah Kashani Educational Center.
