The intervention group (IG) received advice and encouragement to improve their vision, hearing, and indoor lighting conditions in the home, with a 10-week follow-up period.

It appears that modest interventions have great potential for improving vision and hearing. Older patients in the home-care setting cannot be expected to take the necessary action to improve their sensory impairments by themselves. They require close monitoring, help from a specialist, and help to improve the indoor lighting conditions in their homes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>vision and hearing impairments</kwd><kwd>home lighting conditions</kwd><kwd>old people</kwd><kwd>home care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multimorbidity, increased risk of diseases in the sensory organs, and age-related changes in the eyes and ears not only lead to reduced vision and hearing but also render the elderly aged over 80 years who are in a home-care setting vulnerable to many disabilities.<xref rid="b1-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Older persons experience hearing loss, which may be a combination of sensory, neural, strial (metabolic), and cochlear conductive presbycusis.<xref rid="b5-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The older person thus experiences considerable problems understanding rapid speech and unfamiliar accents.<xref rid="b5-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b7-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Sounds may be difficult to localize, particularly when different hearing aids are used in the left and right ears.

Indeed, we have identified only one study concerning the relationship between indoor home lighting and quality of life in the healthy elderly.

Inclusion criteria for the participants were &#x02265;80 years old, receiving home care, and able to speak Norwegian. The exclusion criteria were the presence of obvious cognitive impairment, dementia, or palliation as documented in the medical chart or by clinical judgment by the primary nurse. Initially, the 50 participants for the IG were randomly drawn from the home-care patient lists. Then, the 50 patients to be included in the CG were randomly drawn from among the remaining home-care patients.</p><p>All of the subjects provided written informed consent to participate.

The participants were trained to apply the metrics for these three parameters. The measures that could be taken to improve the conditions within each of the three parameters were also explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of evaluations at T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2,</sub> which were executed at the start and the end of the 10-week intervention period, respectively, in both the IG and the CG. The patients in the IG received individual advice regarding improvements to their home lighting conditions at T<sub>1</sub>. If the lux values were below the recommended values<xref rid="b19-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> or if there were lighting factors that negatively affected the participants&#x02019; daily functioning, reading, or communication abilities, the IG participants were advised as to how to improve the lighting conditions in their homes. The IG patients were referred to a specialist if the evaluation at T<sub>1</sub> revealed impairments of vision and/or hearing or were advised to have their ears rinsed of earwax. If the hearing test revealed a Pure Tone Average (PTAV) value at T<sub>1</sub> of &#x02265;35 dB or if the vision test yielded a VA of &#x02264;0.7, the IG patient was referred to a specialist. They were not referred to a specialist if they already were in a treatment course. The nurses visited the patients in the IG once a week during the 10-week intervention period. These visits were the nurses&#x02019; regular visits to these patients, and they were instructed to ask the patients while they were there whether they needed any help to book an appointment with the doctor or if there were other issues related to the project for which they needed help. All the participants in the study were surveyed to identify those who had problems, including those who were unaware of their impairments, and to provide specific and individual advice.</p><p>The intervention was based on the theory of self-care management.<xref rid="b29-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We assumed that it would be in the best interests of the elderly patients to follow the advice they were given. The nurses were not able to come with the participants to the doctor, but they were able to help them to arrange the visit. The nurses provided information to the IG patients regarding how to increase the lighting levels in their homes, if necessary, and the changes that would be wise to make, such as adding more lamps or installing a lighting control system that would allow the user to operate all of the lamps in one room with a single switch.</p><p>The patients in the CG were evaluated in the same manner by two specially trained nursing assistants and the first author (GGH), who obtained the same training as the nurses. In addition, a lighting designer controlled the lux values for 20 patients in the CG and 20 patients in the IG to ensure that the experimental setup was correct. However, the CG patients were not referred to specialists if their vision or hearing was considered to be impaired, and they were not provided with advice as to how to improve their home lighting conditions if found to be inadequate, until after the completion of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data collection</title><p>The data for T<sub>1</sub> were collected during October and November 2011, when general outdoor light levels in Norway are low for much of the day.

The remaining eleven patients were offered a referral to an optician or an ophthalmologist, but only two had been to the specialist by T<sub>2</sub>, and none of them had bought new spectacles.</p></sec><sec><title>Hearing status</title><p>The results from the pure-tone audiometry test are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jmdh-8-011">Table 4</xref>.

One-way ANOVA showed that the difference between the groups was not significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.10).

Two of the respondents (one each in the IG and the CG) were not able to complete the pure-tone audiometry test at T<sub>1</sub>; the nurses reported that this was either because they could not hear sufficiently well to perform the test or because they failed to adhere to the instructions they were given when performing the test. The analysis in this paper is based on those who completed the test at both T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Notes from the open-ended questions in the KAS screen and the nurses&#x02019; logbooks revealed that 23 participants in the IG were offered a referral to a hearing specialist and five were advised to contact their general practitioners to have earwax removed. Half of those who received a referral to a hearing specialist had made an appointment to attend or had already visited a specialist at least once by T<sub>2</sub>, but they had not yet received a new hearing aid. All five participants who were advised to visit their general practitioners for removal of earwax had done this by T<sub>2</sub>.</p><sec><title>Self-assessment of vision and hearing</title><p>Self-assessment of vision and hearing was tested by the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For the IG, the self-assessment was significantly higher at T<sub>2</sub>. The <italic>P</italic>-value was 0.025 and 0.008 for vision and hearing, respectively. This means that the IG participants assessed both their vision and their hearing to be better by T<sub>2</sub> compared to the same at T<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Indoor lighting</title><p>The lighting levels measured at T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jmdh-8-011">Table 3</xref>. It is worth noting that the indoor lighting level increased between T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> by an average of 70 lux in the IG, while it decreased by 5 lux in the CG (<italic>P</italic>=0.009). The maximum lighting level in the living room increased by 129 lux in the IG (n<italic>=</italic>34) and decreased by 26 lux in the CG (n=36). The difference between the two groups was significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.002). The minimum lighting level in the living room increased by 35 lux in the IG and decreased by 0.37 lux in the CG (<italic>P</italic>=0.039). The reading light level increased by 94 lux in the IG and decreased by 38 lux in the CG (<italic>P</italic>=0.20).</p><p>Four participants had moved into residential care after T<sub>1</sub>, rendering it impossible to compare the lighting conditions in their homes between T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>. The lux values were miscalculated in ten homes in one of the municipalities, and so the number of participants for whom the lighting levels in their homes were measured at T<sub>1</sub> was 36 in the IG and 37 in the CG; these figures at T<sub>2</sub> were 32 and 31, respectively.</p><p>The lighting levels measured in the living room were generally low and were also significantly below the recommended levels<xref rid="b19-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> at T<sub>2</sub>. At T<sub>1</sub>, there was considerable variation across the participants, but no significant sex difference in the average lighting levels. A reading light was used by 31.2% of the men but only by 17.3% of the women. The lux values of these reading lights were also clearly below the recommended value of 750&#x02013;1000 lux (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jmdh-8-011">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Notes from the open-ended questions in the KAS screen and the nurses&#x02019; logbooks revealed that 30 of the IG participants received advice concerning their indoor lighting conditions. Advice about artificial lighting included adding more lamps or moving lamps, changing to brighter light bulbs, reducing glare, using more of the lamps already in the house, or installing a light control system that connected all of the lamps in the living room to one light switch with a dimmer. Advice about natural lighting comprised removing plants or objects from the window frame and changing the curtains if they were dark. At T<sub>2</sub>, none of the IG patients had installed a lighting control system or bought new lamps, but some had changed to brighter light bulbs and switched on more of the lamps in their homes. None of them had changed their curtains, but three had removed objects or plants from the window to allow more daylight to enter the room.</p></sec><sec><title>KAS screen</title><p>The results from the KAS screen questionnaire are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jmdh-8-011">Table 4</xref>.

Although there were significant changes between T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> in the lighting levels between the two groups, the lux values in the IG were still clearly below recommended values at T<sub>2</sub>. The actions taken by the elderly in the IG to improve the lighting conditions in their homes during the follow-up period were not sufficiently in line with the recommendations given by the nurses. This might partly explain why the improvements in visual function at T<sub>2</sub> in the IG were not statistically significant. At the same time, an unexpected finding was a statistically significant improvement in VA in the CG at T<sub>2</sub>, which could be due to a placebo effect.<xref rid="b39-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b41-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> It is not uncommon that people concentrate more at the follow-up test (T<sub>2</sub>).<xref rid="b10-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b42-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Another possible explanation is that only two of the patients consulted a specialist and obtained a recommendation for new custom spectacles, with none of the participants actually obtaining new spectacles or vision or hearing aids during the intervention period. Moreover, there were no detailed notes on how often the elderly maintained or cleaned the spectacles or hearing aids they already had.</p><p>Of the 46 participants in the IG at T<sub>1</sub>, only 17% had normal VA values, while at the same time, 57% assessed their vision as being good. In addition, Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed a significant improvement in the self-assessment of vision in the IG by T<sub>2</sub>. There was also a significant change in lux values from T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>2</sub> for this group. Thus, although there was no significant improvement in the VA for the IG participants, they may have experienced a difference at T<sub>2</sub>. They may have found it somewhat easier to read or to manage their daily life by T<sub>2</sub> when they had switched on more lights. Another explanation could be the Hawthorne effect,<xref rid="b43-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b46-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> whereby the participants felt that they were expected to say that they had experienced an improvement after the intervention.</p><p>The Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the self-assessment of vision and hearing revealed a significant improvement in the IG by T<sub>2</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=0.025 and <italic>P</italic>=0.008, respectively).</p><p>One of the assumptions for this intervention study was that because self-care management would be in the elderly&#x02019;s own best interests, they would follow the advice given to them. Although several of them did not follow the advice they were given, those who did follow at least some of the advice experienced improved hearing, vision, and home lighting conditions. The presence of some changes despite the relatively modest nature of the interventions suggests that even relatively small efforts have a great potential for improving sensory impairments.</p><p>As a consequence of the normal aging process, the changes in vision and hearing often are gradual; so, the person may not notice it and perhaps neither see nor consider the need for an improvement. It may also be difficult for the elderly to admit the loss of either vision or hearing or to accept that situation.<xref rid="b47-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b49-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Furthermore, the everyday life of a nurse is hectic and involves many tasks; the nurses who delivered the intervention and follow-up had attended only a 4-day course in preparation. Focusing on the senses involves new tasks and, in practice, probably requires a little more time to develop the necessary skills to both measure the impairments and to implement the improvements.</p><p>When asked about their finances, more than 50% of the participants stated that they must be careful with money, and so economic factors could also have influenced why they did not buy new lamps or new spectacles. In addition, the participants were on average 89 years old and thus constituted a group of elderly people who might have experienced economic hardship during their childhood and upbringing because they grew up during the recession in the 1930s and during World War II. According to Hauge et al,<xref rid="b50-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> those born from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1930s are often called the &#x0201c;strugglers&#x0201d; as many grew up with fathers who were unemployed. Similarly, those having less financial concerns might be characterized by a cautious attitude toward spending money. If purchasing lamps or spectacles required them to save money, or would adversely affect their budget, they may not prioritize it.<xref rid="b51-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p>Furthermore, taking a taxi to a specialist was costly in terms of both money and effort for these participants; if they were not guaranteed a positive result, they might not consider the effort to be worthwhile. It is possible that when they realized they had to implement the improvements themselves, they considered the costs &#x02013; both financial and with respect to the effort required &#x02013; too high.<xref rid="b9-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>We suggest that future recommendations could be closely and carefully drafted to assist the elderly to achieve optimal indoor lighting in their homes and to optimize their vision and hearing functions. The home-care nurse could play an important role in this context. Simple periodic evaluations could reveal impairments or restrictions at an early stage. It is important that nurses who work with the elderly have knowledge of 1) age-related changes and diseases related to vision and hearing and 2) the consequences of sensory loss on factors of daily life like ADL/instrumental ADL, falls, loneliness, and the quality of life.<xref rid="b10-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b16-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, we recommend increased knowledge and awareness about what can be improved with regard to sensory impairments and lighting conditions in the home.</p><p>The intervention implemented in this study was not sufficient for this patient group, perhaps because of reduced motivation to make any changes. We assume it could be related to their age and to their health condition. The sum total of high age, frailty in combination with expenses, and strenuous movement could be an explanation. This indicates that the organization of health services related to vision and hearing may be brought home to the patients instead of the elderly having to seek the service in a hospital outside of their home. In addition, the competence in these areas needs to be increased among nurses in community health care.</p><p>The study showed that the participants were too old and too fragile to fully comply with the advice and that they needed a lot more help and supervision than was envisaged in the design of this study. However, the intervention may be adequate for younger seniors.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>A possible limitation is that it was not possible to blind the nurses as to the patients&#x02019; group identity because the evaluations and follow-up sessions were conducted by the same nurses. In addition, some nurses may have been more motivated than others, perhaps making a greater effort to persuade their patients to follow their advice. To have more control with the placebo effect, which is common in intervention studies,<xref rid="b38-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b40-jmdh-8-011" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> it would probably have been an advantage to have had a control group with another intervention and a reference group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Several of the elderly in the study did not follow all of the advice offered by the study nurses; however, those who did follow at least some of the advice experienced improvements in vision, hearing, and home lighting. There is thus reason to believe that even modest measures have great potential for improving vision and hearing. Elderly home-care patients cannot be expected to take the necessary actions to meet their sensory impairments themselves; they need close assistance and help to see a specialist and to improve the indoor lighting conditions in their homes. Even small steps such as changing to brighter light bulbs and switching on more lamps in the house can have an encouraging effect. It is recommended that such interventions be applied to the elderly at an earlier age than those evaluated in this study, who had a mean age of 89 years.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
