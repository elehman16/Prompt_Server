There is no similar study in the past to compare the results. However, one study showed a significant difference in the mindful eating score relative to yoga tenure and also vegetable and fruits intake relative to Yoga tenure.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Since Yoga can help to unite the mind and body, it can be useful in regulating appetite, decreasing food preoccupation, enhancing body awareness, and boosting body satisfaction. The longer one participates in Yoga, the more self-awareness and positive impact on body image/eating they develop. Yoga can help eliminate binge-eating patterns. This may be due to the meditation aspect and ability to heighten mindfulness.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The study showed statistically significant improvement in the adherence to medications.

A primary care physician can play a vital role in promotion and facilitation of self-care behavior of diabetes patients by encouraging them to practice Yoga.</p><p>India is the home of Yoga. The benefits of Yoga is not only limited to diabetes but has a positive impact on all noncommunicable diseases. Yoga has been shown to be effective in bring down BP, cholesterol, and ischemic heart disease.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Hence, the inclusion of Yoga in the primary care delivery system can be a vital step in combating the challenge of rising NCDs in India.</p><p>The aim of our study was to assess the effectiveness of Yoga program in the management of diabetes as multidisciplinary approach in the primary health-care delivery system. Through this evidence, we hope to promote and advocate Yoga in the management of diabetes at the primary care level.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>In this study, randomization could not be done; participants interested in practicing Yoga were included in the intervention group. HbA1c, which is the main outcome measure, was assessed after only 40 days of intervention.
