This study was performed in the Beheshti Medical Center, Isfahan, Iran, during the period from March 2010 to December 2011.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were significant coexisting, hepatorenal, or other end organ disease, twin or complicated pregnancy, obesity (BMI &#x0003e; 38 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), contraindication to regional anesthesia and sensitivity to local anesthetic drugs.</p><p>The operating theatre nurse assistant used randomization protocol to assign participants to their respective groups, and an independent anesthesiologist, who did not participate in the study or data collection, prepared unlabelled syringes containing the study drugs.</p><p>All patients were fasted for 8 h preoperatively and infused intravenous preload of 10 cc/kg Ringer's lactate solution before surgery.</p><p>Intraoperative monitoring included pulse oximetry, automated blood pressure cuff, lead II electrocardiogram and capnograph.</p><p>The patients were randomly allocated to one of four groups of 33 each.</p><p>Groups C: the control group received 12.5 mg (2.5 mL) of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% with 0 .2 mL normal saline without preservative.</p><p>Groups M<sub>50</sub>: received 12.5 mg (2.5 mL) hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% with 50 mg (0.1 mL) magnesium sulfate 50% added to 0.1 mL normal saline without preservative.</p><p>Group M<sub>75</sub>: received 12.5 mg (2.5 mL) hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% with 75 mg (0.15 mL) magnesium sulfate 50% added to 0.05 cc normal saline without preservative.</p><p>Group M<sub>100</sub>: received 12.5 mg (2.5 mL) hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% with 100 mg (0.2 mL) magnesium sulfate 50%.</p><p>Subjects were allocated study groups by the computer-generated random number assignment. Both patient and anesthetist were blind to treatment.</p><p>Lumbar puncture was performed in the sitting position. A 25 gauge (pencil point, Braun, Melsungen, Germany) spinal needle was introduced into the subarachnoid space at the L3&#x02013;L4 lumber level midline approach with the needle orifice cephalad. Cerebrospinal fluid was aspirated and the ready fluid hyperbaric bupivacaine (Mylan Co, France) added with magnesium sulfate was injected to subarachnoid space over the period of 15 s, with no barbotage. Patient was set to the left lateral position and after the establishment of T6 block with pin prick test and confirmation of anesthesia, the cesarean section was done.</p><p>The study solution prepared by another researcher was not involve in patient care, and then injected immediately afterwards.

Complete motor block recovery was assumed when the modified bromage score was 0. The duration of spinal anesthesia was defined as the period from spinal injection to the first occasion when the patient complained of pain in the postoperative period.</p><p>If SBP was&#x0003c;20% below baseline or &#x0003c;100 mmHg, intravenous (IV) ephedrine 5 mg was given incrementally.

But it seemed that this drug was enough and provide effective anesthesia [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the onset of the sensory and motor block was slower it the M<sub>75</sub> and M<sub>100</sub> groups than in the M<sub>50</sub> and C groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. This finding is similar to previous study in which it has been shown that the addition of intrathecal magnesium sulfate to bupivacaine and fentanyl anesthesia delayed the onset of the sensory and motor blockade but also prolonged the period of anesthesia without additional side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] It is possible that the solution to which magnesium sulfate was added had a different pH, which might describe our findings. However, we cannot suggest a satisfactory explanation for this delay and further studies and clinical trial are required.</p><p>We found that the median duration of sensory and motor blockade was significantly prolonged by 75 mg magnesium sulfate 50% to 124 &#x000b1; 12 min and 110 &#x000b1; 80 min and by 100 mg magnesium sulfate 50% to 129 &#x000b1; 21 min and 111 &#x000b1; 14 min compared with 92 &#x000b1; 10 and 98 &#x000b1; 11 min in group M<sub>50</sub> and 96 &#x000b1; 13 min and 91 &#x000b1; 12 in group C respectively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>Magnesium prolongs the duration of spinal anesthesia, given during labor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] This drug is the analgesic and antinociceptive additive drug. When it used with local anesthetic, it resulted in prolongation of analgesia without significant complication.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] This prolongation of anesthesia is consistent with the experimental synergistic interaction between spinal local anesthetics and NMDA antagonists, like magnesium, which use antinociceptive effects via different mechanisms; hence, the rationale for combining the two. The NMDA receptor channel complex includes binding sites for noncompetitive antagonists such as magnesium sulfate and ketamine. Activation of C-fibers leads to neuronal excitation, which is decreased by NMDA receptor antagonists; hence, the use of magnesium such as an additive drug for spinal block.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] It acts as an antagonist at a theca NMDA receptor; NMDA receptor antagonists can prevent central sensitization due to peripheral nociceptive stimulation, and can revoke such hypersensitivity once it is established.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The dose of magnesium used in this study was based on data from Buvanendran <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] where 50 mg of spinal magnesium sulfate potentiated fentanyl antinociception. Larger doses have also been used. In 1985, Lejuste[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] described the inadvertent intrathecal injection of 1000 mg of magnesium sulfate, producing a dense motor block followed by complete resolution within 90 min, with no neurological deficit at long-term follow up. Further examination is required to determine whether larger doses of magnesium produce greater potentiation of spinal analgesia without causing any neurological deficit when injected intrathecally.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of intrathecal magnesium sulfate reported in rats and human in earlier studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] In rats, boluses of magnesium sulfate produced transient motor and sensory block with no opposed clinical or histological results. In a randomized, controlled canine study, no neurological deficit or change in cord histopathology was reported following interathecal magnesium administration (45&#x02013;60 mg).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] A recent human study found no harmful effects of IT magnesium on spinal opioid analgesia in labor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Thus, interathecal magnesium sulfate seems to have a good safety profile.</p><p>In this study, higher dose (100 mg) of magnesium sulfate might result in increasing some of side effects (hypotention, nausea, and vomiting).</p><p>These patients needed to use supplemental drug such as ephedrine or metoclopramide.</p><p>Hypotension is a common side effect due to compress vena cava vein by pregnant uterus. Also, it can be caused by sympathectomy of spinal block.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting are frequent side effects during the caesarean section due to uterine manipulation and peritoneal closure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>An increased risk of respiratory depression in labor has been reported with magnesium sulfate therapy,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and an increased incidence of respiratory depression may be expected when other drugs are combined; however, we did not observe this.</p><p>Total analgesic requirements for 24 h following surgery were lower than in patient received higher dose of intrathecal magnesium sulfate (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). It is likely that magnesium sulfate can potentiate opioid analgesic effect by both central and peripheral mechanism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Compared to published data and from the clinical point, the 100 mg magnesium sulfate 50% used in our study does not seem to have more desirable effect than 75 and 50 mg. Although 75 mg magnesium sulfate decrease the postoperative analgesic requirement.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. We did not assess the incidence and intensively of chronic pain after caesarean section surgery that might have revealed the action of magnesium sulfate in modulating wind up and synaptic plasticity.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomized double blind clinical study comparing intrathecal magnesium sulfate in different doses of 50, 75, and100 mg with placebo added to hyperbaric bupivacaine for the caesarean section showed all techniques provide safe and effective anesthesia, but 75 mg of this drug increases duration of postoperative analgesia and prolong than sensory and motor block without significant increase in maternal and neonatal side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>Dr. Mitra Jabalameli participated in generating the idea.
