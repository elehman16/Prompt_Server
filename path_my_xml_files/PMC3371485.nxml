With an emphasis on multidimensional features of dexmedetomidine, we designed a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study to determine whether the addition of dexmedetomidine would decrease the dose of opioids and anaesthetics for attenuation of haemodynamic response during laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation, surgery and extubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining the ethics committee approval, 100 American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA)-I/II patients, aged 25&#x02013;50 years, undergoing elective general surgical procedures were enrolled in the present study. Patients with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, child-bearing potential, taking any antipsychotic medications or having a history of allergy to any drug and in whom the intubation attempts lasted longer than 25 s were excluded from the study. The research methodology was prospectively randomized with the help of computer-generated coded envelopes and patients were divided into two groups: Group F and group D.</p><p>Patients were premedicated with tab ranitidine 150 mg and tab alprazolam 0.25 mg a night before and 2 h before on the morning of surgery with a sip of water. In the pre-op room, a good intravenous access was secured and baseline parameters were observed and recorded, which included heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), electrocardiogram respiratory rate and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>). All patients were pre-hydrated with 500 mL of Ringer's lactate solution. Thereafter, group F received 100 mL of normal saline 20 min pre-operatively and inj. Fentanyl 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg 3 min before induction, while group D received 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg of dexmedetomidine in 100 mL of normal saline over 20 min and 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg of fentanyl 3 min before the induction of anaesthesia. A subjective sedation scale, derived from the sedation agitation scale, was employed for the purpose of evaluation of sedation effect in both the groups[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] (1=fully awake and conscious, 2=awakening on verbal command, 3=awakening on gentle shaking, 4=awakening on vigorous shaking and painful stimuli and 5=unarousable).</p><p>Induction of anaesthesia was carried out with thiopentone sodium in a dose sufficient to abolish the eyelash reflex followed by 0.1 mg/kg of vecuronium bromide to provide neuromuscular blockade. The lungs were ventilated with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen with Bains circuit for the next 3 min. Thereafter, laryngoscopy was performed with a Macintosh laryngoscope and intubation was performed with a cuffed endotracheal tube of appropriate size with a strict and vigil monitoring of haemodynamic and respiratory parameters at regular intervals of 1 min for the first 5 min and thereafter were observed continuously but recorded at 5-min intervals till completion of surgery. Response to skin incision was also observed and recorded in a similar manner. During surgery, anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. The adjustment in the inspiratory concentration of isoflurane was carried out in increment or decrement values of 0.2%, as judged by the increase or decrease in HR and MAP of 20% from the baseline values. An additional 0.5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg dose of fentanyl was repeated whenever the inspiratory concentration of inhalational anaesthetic reached 1%, and the average total inspiratory concentration of isoflurane was calculated by the sum of the products of inspiratory concentration and times divided by total anaesthesia time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] At the end of the surgical procedure, residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with neostigmine 2.5 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.5 mg intravenously (IV). Extubation was carried out as routine procedure and stress response to extubation was again observed and recorded in a similar manner as done during the intubation process, and patients were shifted to the recovery ward for further observation.</p><p>Demographic data was analysed using Student's <italic>t</italic> test while all the continuous variable were analysed using analysis of variance with <italic>post hoc</italic> significance to interpret changes over time. Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test and chi-square test were applied whenever there was a statistically significant difference between two different sets of data for each variable. Power analysis was carried out using SPSS version 15 for windows and assuming &#x003b1;=0.10 and &#x003b2;=0.8, the effective sample size on the basis of haemodynamic differences turned out be 43 for the comparison of independent means.

The infusion of dexmedetomidine was well tolerated and sedative effects of the drugs started appearing during infusion only in group D, but patients were arousable on verbal commands. The most strikingly significant feature after the completion of dexmedetomidine infusion in addition to lower blood pressure and HR was the fall in oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) up to 94&#x02013;95%, which returned to normal on waking up the patients in group D [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

Although a 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg dose of fentanyl in the control group was used, it was not sufficient to attenuate the stress responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation as 15&#x02013;25% increase in HR and blood pressure was recorded.</p><p>The dosage of general anaesthetic for the induction of anaesthesia decreases significantly, as was also evident from the decreased requirement of thiopentone in group D. Even the requirement of inhalational anaesthetic for maintenance of anaesthesia during the entire surgical procedure was markedly reduced as we used a lower inspiratory concentration of isoflurane in group D as compared with 0.6&#x02013;1.6% of the concentration of isoflurane used in the control group. The effects of alpha-2 agonists in decreasing the minimal alveolar concentration for volatile anaesthetics and opioid have been well studied previously also and possibly mediated through both pre- and post-synaptic alpha-receptor activation in the CNS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have used dexmedetomidine in doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/h with not so much conclusive data but definitely associated with a significant incidence of bradycardia and hypotension in higher doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] We used dexmedetomidine in a pre-operative infusion dose of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg over 20 min and observed a moderate reduction in the MAP and HR to the extent of 10&#x02013;15% from the baseline values, and the findings are very much similar to the observations of other studies and can be explained on the basis of markedly decreased CNS sympathetic activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Earlier studies have demonstrated a transient increase in HR and MAP initially during the administration of dexmedetomidine infusion, which is followed by a decrease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] A similar kind of phenomenon was encountered during the present study as a transient increase in HR and MAP for 3&#x02013;5 min was observed after the start of dexmedetomidine infusion and is probably due to the vasoconstriction effect of dexmedetomidine appearing earlier than the central sympathetic action. Studies using dexmedetomidine have commonly reported cardiac side-effects like bradycardia and sinus pause, which is mainly due to sympatholytic effect as well as preservation of baroreflex mechanisms. But, none of the patients in the present study had such an incidence, which could have warranted the use of atropine possibly due to the usage of a lower dose of dexmedetomidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] However, to substantiate the cardiovascular safety of such drugs, such a small study of ours is not sufficient and larger meta-analytical studies are required. The rapid speed of infusion also determines, to a large extent, the higher incidence of side-effects such as apnoea and irregular ventilation, and occurs due to increased central sedation rather than direct respiratory depressant effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] On the contrary, it is demonstrated that a lower dose of dexmedetomidine decreases the risk of apnoea and is considered a better alternative in critical patients in whom narcotics can cause severe respiratory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p><p>Another strikingly significant observation was the clear consciousness and alert state of mind in the patients who received dexmedetomidine and a lower fentanyl requirement as compared with the patients in the control group who were slightly sedated even 10&#x02013;15 min after extubation, and the findings are almost similar with other such studies as sedation scores were significantly better in group D patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparative sedation scores in both the groups post-operatively</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-56-123-g006"/></table-wrap><p>Emergence from anaesthetic effects and extubation are equally crucial as is the laryngoscopy, intubation and surgical period, as the depth of anaesthesia decreases abruptly and the rising levels of catecholamines can be deleterious for high-risk patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Dexmedetomidine enables a smooth transition from the time of administration of reversal to the post-extubation phase by suppressing the CNS sympathetic activity, leading to a high quality of extubation, as was observed in the majority of our patients in group D.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>]</p><p>There were certain limitations as the present study was carried out in surgical procedures of a short duration (&#x0003c;1 h) and on a smaller number of patients. More studies are required to establish the effects of a single dose of dexmedetomidine in surgeries of longer duration. Moreover, the effect was seen in ASA I/II patients, but the usefulness will be of immense help in high-risk cardiac patients who we could not study because we did not have an advanced cardiac set-up at our institute. The use of a Bispectral Index system would have been ideal in drawing the conclusions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Dexmedetomidine is an excellent drug when used as an adjunct to general anaesthesia for attenuation of pressor response.
