Clinical lumbar instability is a subgroup of LBP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-7-1189">1</xref> It has been described as the inability of the spine to maintain its normal displacement pattern under physiologic loads without any initial or additional neurological deficits, major deformity, or incapacitating pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ppa-7-1189">2</xref> It results in pain, functional disability, and/or reflexive muscular spasm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-7-1189">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-7-1189">4</xref> In Thailand, patients with clinical lumbar instability are frequently referred for physical therapy intervention. No specific exercise has been available for this group of patients as of yet.</p><p>Core stabilization exercise (CSE) with the abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) technique has been found to primarily activate the deep abdominal muscles with minimal activity of the superficial muscles. Previous studies promoted the benefits of the CSE in terms of reducing pain and disability for patients with clinical lumbar instability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-7-1189">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ppa-7-1189">7</xref> It was hypothesized that trunk muscle recruitment in patients with clinical lumbar instability was changed to adapt to underlying spinal instability resulting from osteoligamentous laxity or damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-7-1189">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-7-1189">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ppa-7-1189">8</xref> There are two main types of trunk muscles: deep and superficial. Internal oblique (IO), transversus abdominis (TrA), and lumbar multifidus (LM) are deep trunk muscles; whereas external oblique (EO), rectus abdominis (RA), and erector spinae (ES) are superficial trunk muscles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-7-1189">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-7-1189">5</xref> It is considered that the role of the deep trunk muscles is to provide a stiffening effect on the lumbar spine through its attachment to the thoracolumbar fascia, in conjunction with an increase in intra-abdominal pressure, and eventually this could result in spinal stability in patients with clinical lumbar instability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ppa-7-1189">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ppa-7-1189">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ppa-7-1189">11</xref></p><p>In addition to pain and functional disability, patient satisfaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-7-1189">12</xref> and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-7-1189">13</xref> have gained interest recently in treatment evaluation of LBP. None of the previous studies have reported the effect of CSE on patient satisfaction and HRQOL in patients with clinical lumbar instability, and there is no information on detraining effects on improved sensitivity of pain after exercise treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 10 week CSE training and 3 month follow-up on pain during instability catch sign (ICS), functional disability, patient satisfaction, and HRQOL in patients with clinical lumbar instability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a randomized assessor-blind controlled trial with four measurement points, including baseline, at the tenth week, and 1 and 3 months after stopping the exercise program (follow-up). It was conducted in the Physical Therapy Laboratory at Khon Kaen University, Thailand. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research at Khon Kaen University, based on the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients aged 20&#x02013;60 years who had had LBP for 3 months or longer were recruited from the Orthopaedic Outpatient Department, the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Department, and the Physical Therapy Department of Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. They underwent a history-taking interview and a physical examination by an orthopedic surgeon who was unaware of the treatment procedure. Anteroposterior, lateral, and flexion-extension radiographs were used to exclude other spinal conditions. An ICS was performed to confirm the diagnosis of clinical lumbar stability. A positive ICS was defined as a sudden painful snap when a patient extends his/her back from the trunk forward-bending position into the upright position.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-7-1189">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ppa-7-1189">4</xref> To be eligible, patients must have a pain intensity of at least 5 out of 10, based on a numeric rating scale during ICS, and have a positive sign in one of the following provocation tests: painful catch, apprehension sign, or prone instability test. Eligible participants gave their written informed consent before their participation. They were excluded if they had other spinal pathology that might interfere with the study protocol,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ppa-7-1189">2</xref> were pregnant, and/or regularly performed CSE or trunk stretching exercises.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size determination</title><p>The sample size, using a formula of repeated measures analysis of variance, was estimated on the basis of pain during ICS, using a numerical rating scale at 3-month follow-up and assuming 90% power, 5% of significance, and 15% of attrition rate. To detect a clinically meaningful difference between groups of two scores on a numerical rating scale,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ppa-7-1189">14</xref> a total sample size of 42 was required.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise intervention</title><p>Eligible participants were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of the two groups: CSE and conventional group (CG) by a block randomization with block sizes of two, four, and six. Randomization results were concealed in sealed and opaque envelopes with consecutive numbering. Lasting approximately 20 minutes, all training sessions of both groups took place at the Physical Therapy Laboratory twice a week for 10 weeks. Exercises were demonstrated and supervised by a research assistant blinded to the outcome assessment.</p><sec><title>CSE</title><p>Details of this exercise have been described in our previous study (see supplementary material).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-7-1189">10</xref> The 10-week exercise program was divided into three phases. The first phase, weeks 1 and 2, focused on correctly isolating low-load activation of the TrA and LM muscles, using an ADIM technique in prone lying and sitting. Then, coactivation of TrA and LM were taught. A pressure biofeedback device (Chattanooga Australia Pty Ltd, Brisbane, QLD, Australia) and electromyography biofeedback (MP100, BIOPAC Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) were used to provide feedback and facilitate correct performance during training. The second phase, weeks 3&#x02013;7, started as soon as individuals could accurately control the TrA and LM muscles. The exercises progressed to the application of low load to the muscles through controlled movements of the upper and lower extremities. The last phase, weeks 8&#x02013;10, aimed to integrate this coactivation into functional tasks. The participants were trained to maintain coactivation of TrA and LM during walking and two chosen tasks previously known to aggravate pain. At the end of the tenth week, 47.62% of participants were at the third phase, 38.09% were at the second phase, and 14.29% remained at the first phase.</p></sec><sec><title>CG</title><p>This group performed active trunk stretching exercises, which are the standard treatment for LBP in Thailand.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ppa-7-1189">15</xref> The exercises consisted of ten repetitions of an alternating single knee to chest; as well as a lateral trunk-bending in standing. Each exercise was to be held for 10 seconds. Immediately after the exercises, a hydrocollator (60&#x000b0;C) (Enraf-Nonius Medical Equipment Company Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand), was placed over the lumbar area in the supine position for 15 minutes.</p><p>Both groups were required to practice the demonstrated exercises at home on a daily basis. To monitor their compliance, they were asked to record this in their logbook. In addition, every week, the same physical therapist made a phone call to participants in both groups to motivate them to continue their home exercises. After 10 weeks of training, all participants were asked to completely stop their exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Primary outcome of this study was pain during ICS assessed by the 11-point numeric rating scale (range, 0&#x02013;10), where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-1189">16</xref> Participants were asked to mark the line to indicate their level of pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcome measures included functional disability, patient satisfaction, HRQOL, and activation ratio of trunk muscles. Functional disability was evaluated using the Thai version of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-7-1189">17</xref> This 24-item questionnaire assesses physical disability specific to LBP. The participants were asked whether any statements characterized them on evaluation day. The total score is calculated by adding up the number of items answered with a &#x0201c;yes,&#x0201d; which ranges from 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximum disability). The internal consistency reliability of Thai RMDQ ranges from 0.71 to 0.93.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ppa-7-1189">18</xref> It is also reproducible and sensitive to change over time for patients with LBP.</p><p>Patient satisfaction with treatment outcome was measured by the 11-point scale of Global Perceived Effect. It ranges from &#x02212;5 (vastly worse) through 0 (no change) to +5 (completely recovered).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-7-1189">12</xref> The HRQOL was measured with the Thai version of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form Health Survey version 2.0 (SF-36V2).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-7-1189">17</xref> The Thai SF-36V2 measures eight quality-of-life domains collapsed into two summary scales: physical component summary (PCS), which consists of physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, and general health, and mental component summary (MCS), which consists of vitality, social functioning, role emotion, and mental health. The internal consistency reliability of the Thai SF-36V2 was high in patients with LBP (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of the PCS, 0.93; MCS, 0.92; range, 0.72&#x02013;0.93 for eight domains).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-7-1189">17</xref> The correlation coefficients were higher between scales with similar constructs than for those with competing construct. The interscale correlation coefficients ranged from 0.21 to 0.51, with the correlation coefficient of the vitality and mental health being 0.71.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ppa-7-1189">18</xref></p><p>Trunk muscle activities were measured by surface electromyography (sEMG). After light skin abrasion and alcohol cleansing, four pairs of electrodes were placed over the right side of four trunk muscles: TrA and IO, RA, LM, and iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis (ICLT). Details of electrode placement were consistent with a previous study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-7-1189">10</xref> The ground electrodes of the right RA and ICLT muscles were placed over the ribcage, and the other two ground electrodes of the right TrA and IO and LM muscles were placed over the right iliac crest. The EMG signals were sampled at 1,000 Hz with gain of 1,000, 10&#x02013;500-Hz bandwidth, and a 110-dB common mode rejection ratio. The task, ADIM with 10-second hold, was performed three times with a 1 minute rest between trials. Normalization of abdominal and back muscle activities was done by using submaximal voluntary isometric contractions. For the abdominal muscles, participants raised both feet 1 cm from the floor in a crook lying position with a 5 second hold. For the back muscles, participants performed a double knee raise 5 cm from the floor in prone lying position with 5 second hold. The root mean square values of EMG signals produced during an isometric hold of these activities were then used to normalize the sEMG signals obtained during the ADIM. The activation ratio of the abdominal (TrA and IO/RA) and back (LM/ICLT) muscles were then calculated, using the normalized data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are presented as means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence interval. All analyses were performed on the basis of intention-to-treat with the last observation carried forward. SPSS version 11.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. All data were normally distributed and were tested by the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test. A 2 &#x000d7; 4 (group &#x000d7; time) repeated measures analysis of variance was applied for each variable. Post hoc analysis for pairwise comparison followed when a significant main effect was found. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-eight patients responded to the recruitment advertisements, and after the screening test, 42 eligible participants entered the study. The reasons for exclusion were LBP with other spinal conditions such as disk herniation, spondylolisthesis, spinal infection, and back muscle strain. There were three patients who declined before the study began. Of the 42 participants, 21 were randomly assigned to the CSE group and 21 to the CG group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-7-1189">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates progress through this study. Although the loss to follow-up was two participants for each group at 10 weeks of intervention, it was within the 15% attrition rate. The reasons for loss to follow-up were loss of interest about intervention or job restrictions.</p><p>The baseline characteristics of CSE and the CG are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ppa-7-1189">Table 1</xref>.

The major finding was that all outcomes of the CSE group not only improved significantly after 10 weeks of training but also continued to have an effect after ceasing the exercise for 3 months.</p><p>The findings supported the hypothesis related to trunk muscle recruitment pattern in patients with clinical lumbar instability. After 10 weeks of CSE training, the activation ratio of the abdominal muscles (TrA and IO/RA) was significantly increased, with higher activation of TrA and IO muscles. Although the activation ratio of the back muscles (LM/ICLT) did not differ significantly from its baseline, it also had a tendency to increase. Gardner-Morse and Stokes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ppa-7-1189">19</xref> propose that the deep abdominal muscles play a more important role than superficial abdominal muscles in providing spinal stability. Despite their short moment arms, the deep abdominal muscles are tonic muscles functioning as stabilizers of lumbar segments, whereas the superficial abdominal muscles are tonic muscles generating movements and providing overall stability. In addition, the authors further stated that at least 10% of spinal segmental stiffness caused by poor neuromuscular control and altered abdominal recruitment could lead to abnormal spinal movement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ppa-7-1189">20</xref> Therefore, the plausible explanation for diminution of pain during ICS and functional disability was that the CSE helps promote the changes in activation ratio of the abdominal and back muscles,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ppa-7-1189">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-7-1189">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ppa-7-1189">14</xref> leading to a direct potential stabilization of the lumbar spine via generation of intra-abdominal pressure and increased thoracolumbar fascial tension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-7-1189">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ppa-7-1189">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-7-1189">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ppa-7-1189">21</xref> It is likely that after 10-week training, the trunk muscle activation pattern in the participants in the CSE group has become automatically generated. The results are in agreement with the work of Javadian et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ppa-7-1189">3</xref> who reported that despite stopping CSE for 3 months, the pain intensity and functional disability of patients with LBP remained the same.</p><p>At baseline, participants in both groups had an average of 12 items on the RMDQ of a possible 24, indicating a high level of disability. Immediately at the end of the training, the CSE group had improved, on average, by 5.14 points on the RMDQ scale, whereas the RMDQ of the CG group remained largely unchanged, reflecting the chronic nature of this condition. The improvement continued through 3 months after stopping the exercise.</p><p>These improvements in functional ability in the treatment group were in parallel with significant increases in patient satisfaction and HRQOL. Both groups were very similar at baseline, with no significant differences between the group means. The CSE group showed a significant increase in the PCS of HRQOL at 10 weeks, as well as 3 months afterward. The CG, in contrast, exhibited reduced or unchanged scores.</p><p>Even though the main finding of this study suggested that CSE was superior to the conventional treatment for treating patients with clinical lumbar instability, the interpretation of the results should be done with caution because of a limitation of sEMG. The EMG signals may be interfered with by crosstalk from other superficial muscles, especially for the LM muscles. Further studies should use indwelling EMG signals to accurately measure individual muscle activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has demonstrated that 10 week CSE provides 3 month retention effects on pain intensity during ICS, functional disability, patient satisfaction, and HRQOL in patients with clinical lumbar instability. Ratio of abdominal muscle activation has changed significantly after core stabilization training. Deep trunk muscles appeared to activate more than superficial trunk muscles in the exercise group compared with the CG. Improved trunk muscle recruitment pattern, hence, could be an efficient means to achieve trunk stability, reduce pain and disability, and improve quality of life in patients with clinical lumbar instability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><sec><title>Core stabilization exercise</title><p><bold>Instruction:</bold> This document demonstrates the use of core stabilization exercise and consists of illustrations of each exercise over the course of 10 weeks. Arrows indicate a specific trunk muscle activation is required in that exercise. Intensity of exercise is based on your exercise performance. Each session of exercise is done for 20 minutes per session, two sessions per week, and daily home exercises should be done following the instructions of this document.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-ppa-7-1189"><table-wrap id="ts1-ppa-7-1189" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Core stabilization exercise</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1"><bold>Isolated transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus training</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="4" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Train transversus abdominis muscle activation in a prone lying position without spinal and pelvic movements for 10 seconds with ten repetitions.
