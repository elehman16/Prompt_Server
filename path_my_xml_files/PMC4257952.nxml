Common superficial bacterial infections of the skin include impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, cellulitis, acne and others.

There was a significant reduction in mean severity scores for all the symptoms of bacterial infections (including erythema, crusting, exudation, swelling, pruritus, pain, and tenderness) in the nadifloxacin groups of all the three clinical studies as compared with other study groups. In all the studies (clinical and PMS), nadifloxacin was rated as excellent (complete remission of symptoms) on a 4-point scale by a significantly higher number of patients as compared with mupirocin, framycetin, and fusidic acid. Investigators also rated the overall response to the application of the study cream on a 4-point scale as excellent (complete remission of symptoms) in significantly higher number of patients in the nadifloxacin groups. Minimal AEs were reported.</p><p>Several antibiotics (fusidic acid, mupirocin, framycetin and fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin) are available for the treatment of bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nadifloxacin is a new chemically synthesized fluoroquinolone that has C-6 substituted with flouro group. The presence of fluoro group enhances the anti-bacterial activity of nadifloxacin probably by improving its ability to bind the DNA gyrase complex (2- to 17-fold) and cell penetration (1- to 70-fold) as compared to quinolones with no substitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In vitro and clinical studies have already proven the safety and efficacy of nadifloxacin in the treatment of acne vulgaris and suggested that nadifloxacin could be used as an effective therapeutic agent in treatment of other bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. All the studies conducted to date (both in vitro and in vivo) have shown nadifloxacin to be a superior treatment for bacterial skin infections. Nadifloxacin has also been reported to be effective against bacteria, like MRSA, that have developed resistance to other available anti-microbial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Previous in vitro studies have assessed the activity of nadifloxacin against bacterial skin infection causing organisms. Nenoff et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] conducted an in vitro study that compared and assessed the activity of nadifloxacin with various other anti-bacterials including oxacillin, flucloxacillin, ofloxacin, erythromycin, cefotiam, clindamycin and gentamicin against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria including <italic>S. aureus</italic>, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS), <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp., <italic>Propionibacterium granulosum</italic>, <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> strains. The results demonstrated nadifloxacin to be highly active against all bacteria except some of the CNS strains. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>90</sub> at which 90% of bacteria are inhibited) of nadifloxacin was 0.1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL for <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 0.39&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL for <italic>Propionibacterium</italic> spp., and 0.78&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL for both <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. and CNS, which was significantly less than MICs for other test antibiotics. No resistant strains to nadifloxacin were found in this study except for some CNS strains in agreement with the study by Vogt et al, who also reported the lowest incidence of resistance of nadifloxacin against the strains of CNS, <italic>S. aureus, P. acnes</italic>, and <italic>P. granulosum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Another in vitro study, which compared the activity of nadifloxacin with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin against isolates of <italic>P. acnes</italic>, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, and both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA and MRSA, respectively) taken from Spain, Hungary and Germany showed that nadifloxacin possesses better activity against strains of <italic>P. acnes</italic> than other test antibiotics as the MIC<sub>50</sub> (at which 50% of bacteria are inhibited) and MIC<sub>90</sub> values (range between 0.03 and 1&#x000a0;mg/L) for nadifloxacin were lesser than MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>90</sub> values of other test antibiotics. The study observed that MSSA and MRSA strains were more resistant to ciprofloxacin as compared to nadifloxacin with exception of the MSSA isolates from Spain in which 7.5% were resistant to nadifloxacin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Jacobs and associates assessed the in vitro activity of nadifloxacin against quinolone-susceptible and -resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis.</italic> The MIC of nadifloxacin was less than all the other currently available quinolones (clinafloxacin, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, teicoplanin) which showed it to be the most potent therapeutic agent against the tested <italic>Staphylococci</italic> spp. (both quinolones susceptible and resistant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>There are limited clinical studies conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of nadifloxacin in treatment of bacterial skin infections. Haustein and colleagues investigated the efficacy and tolerability of nadifloxacin in treatment of patients with bacterial infections including impetigo contagiosa, folliculitis/sycosis vulgaris, impetiginized dermatitis and secondarily infected wounds. Statistically significant reduction in the degree of infections was observed and physicians rated the therapeutic effect of nadifloxacin on a 4- point scale as &#x02018;very good&#x02019; in more patients similar to that observed in our studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Resistance to anti-microbials is a menace in treating bacterial infections. Drug export by efflux pumps is a common mechanism for anti-microbial drug resistance. Bacteria encode several efflux pumps; extensive research is reported on the NorA efflux pump. NorA efflux pump is used by bacteria (such as <italic>S. aureus)</italic> to pump out drugs leading to drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This inhibits the activity of drugs on bacteria. Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin have shown resistance to both Gram-positive (including <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species) and Gram-negative bacteria. However, nadifloxacin is not influenced by over expression of the NorA efflux pump on the bacterial cell membrane which reduces the chances of development of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A previous study determined that nadifloxacin acts independent of NorA efflux pump, as MIC for NorA<sup>+</sup><italic>S. aureus</italic> was only one fold higher than that of NorA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several other studies demonstrated nadifloxacin to have negligible or low resistance against strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and good susceptibility to all bacteria that are resistant to fluoroquinolones currently in use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The authors&#x02019; studies were the first to compare nadifloxacin with fusidic acid, framycetin, and mupirocin for the treatment of bacterial skin infection. The use of fusidic acid, framycetin, and mupirocin in the treatment of bacterial infections has been investigated in several studies. A study, by Gisby and co-workers, in mouse models with skin wound infections compared the efficacy of mupirocin with other antibiotics including fusidic acid, neomycin&#x02013;bacitracin, erythromycin, cephalexin, benzylpenicillin, methicillin and flucloxacillin used in the treatment of primary and secondary bacterial infections. In vitro results found that MIC value of mupirocin for <italic>S. aureus</italic> was 0.12&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL, which is more than that reported by Nenoff et al. in which the MIC value of nadifloxacin was 0.1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL for <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This indicates that nadifloxacin is a better option than mupirocin and other comparator antibiotics used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Another randomized clinical trial reported that fusidic acid resistant strains of MRSA were found in isolates of patients treated with fusidic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Spelman and his colleagues gathered in vitro and clinical studies data to assess the efficacy and safety of fusidic acid in treatment of patients with bacterial infections. Though the study demonstrated that fusidic acid is effective against <italic>Staphylococci,</italic><italic>Streptococci</italic> were resistant to fusidic acid. However, nadifloxacin has shown good efficacy against both <italic>Staphylococci</italic> and <italic>Streptococci</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Anti-bacterials currently used in the treatment of bacterial skin infections such as fusidic acid, mupirocin, and quinolones including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin have been reported to cause several AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, nadifloxacin, a synthetic quinolone, has been reported to cause minimal/negligible AEs in the treatment of acne vulgaris. The data on its AEs for use in the treatment of bacterial skin infections are limited. Haustein et al. reported AEs including itching, erythema and inflammatory swelling in only three patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].
