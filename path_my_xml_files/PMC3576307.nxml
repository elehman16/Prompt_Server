Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) creates a whole body systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that could impair pulmonary function. Impaired pulmonary function can, however, be attenuated by pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK (histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate) solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Pulmonary Protection Trial (PP-Trial) randomizes 90 patients undergoing CPB-dependent cardiac surgery to evaluate whether pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution reduces postoperative pulmonary dysfunction in COPD patients. Further, we aim for a non-randomized evaluation of postoperative pulmonary function after transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI). The primary outcome measure is the oxygenation index measured from anesthesia induction to the end of surgery and until 24 hours after anesthesia induction for a total of six evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Patients with COPD may be impaired by hypoxemia and SIRS. Thus, prolonged recovery and even postoperative complications and death may be reflected by the degree of hypoxemia and SIRS. The limited sample size does not aim for confirmatory conclusions on mortality, cardiovascular complications or risk of pneumonia and sepsis, but the PP-Trial is considered an important feasibility trial paving the road for a multicenter confirmatory trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01614951.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiopulmonary bypass</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary perfusion</kwd><kwd>Pulmoplegia</kwd><kwd>Transcatheter aortic-valve implantation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pulmonary dysfunction is a complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and yet a preoperative pulmonary function test (PFT) is not performed routinely although lung function appears to be an independent predictor of both morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Five to thirty percent of patients undergoing cardiac surgery present with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and patients with moderate to severe COPD, including a fifty percent reduction in diffusion capacity, demonstrate a 2- to 10-fold higher 30-day mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Depending on the preoperative lung function, pulmonary dysfunction varies from only a short need of mechanical ventilation to fever, productive cough, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and consequent prolonged ICU - length of stay (ICU-LOS) and, in the most severe cases, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a mortality rate of approximately 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The etiology of pulmonary dysfunction after CPB-dependent cardiac surgery is multifactorial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, contact of blood with artificial surfaces creates a whole body systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), lung ischemia and reperfusion injury with increases in immunologic mediators and CPB-induced non-physiologic laminar perfusion, including release of endotoxins from the splanchnicus area, are considered reasons for postoperative pulmonary dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In clinical trials for patients with a preoperative normal lung function, the reduction in PF ratio (PF = P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and increase in immunologic mediators are attenuated by pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or custodiol HTK (histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate) solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The custodiol HTK solution is similar to the chemical composition of extracellular fluid, including a low potassium concentration, and is used for flushing donor liver, kidney, heart, lung, and pancreas prior to organ harvesting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively to CPB- dependent aortic valve replacement (AVR), transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) represents a procedure during which the aortic valve is replaced via inguinal access without the use of CPB. Procedural stress, including the inflammatory response is, therefore, expected to be reduced. Whether the TAVI procedure preserves lung function remains, however, unknown.</p><p>This trial evaluates whether pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution reduces postoperative pulmonary dysfunction after CPB-dependent cardiac surgery in patients with COPD. Further, we aim for a non-randomized evaluation of postoperative pulmonary function after TAVI in COPD patients compared to COPD patients undergoing CPB-dependent cardiac surgery, with or without pulmonary perfusion.</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>This trial assesses 1) the effect of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution during CPB on postoperative arterial oxygenation in COPD patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and 2) postoperative arterial oxygenation after TAVI compared to CPB-dependent cardiac surgery, with or without pulmonary perfusion in COPD patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The trial is designed as an open, assessor and data analyst blinded, randomized clinical trial on patients with COPD undergoing cardiac surgery. The patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution during CPB, while patients who are not provided with selective pulmonary perfusion during CPB and those undergoing TAVI serve as control groups. The randomization procedure will be stratified according to the severity of COPD since we expect a relation between the responses to the interventions and the severity of COPD.</p><p>Patients having a TAVI are currently randomized to either CPB-dependent aortic valve replacement or TAVI (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01057173) and therefore will patients undergoing TAVI not be randomized for the Pulmonary Protection Trial (PP-Trial) because they do not receive any intervention. Patients undergoing TAVI serve, however, as controls for the intervention groups in the PP-Trial and will be enrolled when approximately half of the patients are randomized to pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution, or control. The distribution of the severity of COPD in the TAVI patients will be attempted to be identical with the distribution in the randomized groups.</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>1.

One peripheral vein, one radial artery and the internal jugular vein are cannulated. The ventilation mode is volume controlled with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 mmHg and lung recruitment is performed after CPB.</p><p>After heparinization (350 IU/kg, ACT &#x0003e;480 sec), normothermic CPB (36.5 to 37.0&#x000b0;C bladder temperature) is initiated as follows: in the ascending aorta an angled arterial cannula is placed (DLP 24 FR, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) and the right atrial appendage is provided with a two-stage venous cannula (36/46 FR, Medtronic). A membrane oxygenator (Capiox RX25, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and a roller pump (Stockert S5, Sorin Group, Milano, Italy) are used for perfusion with laminar flow. The arterial line includes a 40-&#x003bc;m filter (AL06, Pall, Port Washington, NY, USA). Pump flow is 2.4 L/minute/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. Mean arterial pressure is kept between 40 and 60 mm Hg.</p><p>In group I, the main pulmonary artery is provided with a straight arterial cannula (14 FR DLP, Medtronic), the aorta is cross-clamped, cardioplegia administered and pulmonary perfusion initiated at 300 to 400 ml/minute from the CPB circuit. We aim to maintain a pulmonary flow equaling about 10% of the patient&#x02019;s total flow resulting in an overall flow rate of 110% until cross clamp release. The blood returning from the pulmonary circuit is drained to the venous reservoir via a left atrial vent (VT-53218, CalMed Laboratories, Costa Mesa, CA, USA). During CPB the lungs are not ventilated and that applies also to groups II and III.</p><p>The pulmonary perfusion pressure (PPP) is monitored online via the pulmonary cannula. We aim to maintain a PPP equal to the patient's baseline pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAMP) and not to exceed 20 mmHg.</p><p>In the event of lack of volume, the pulmonary perfusion is stopped and subsequently resumed when the needed volume is re-established.</p><p>Before aortic cross-clamp release the pulmonary perfusion is terminated and the pulmonary cannula removed.</p><p>In group II, pulmoplegia with 2 L 4&#x000b0;C custodiol HTK solution is performed after cardioplegia via a pulmonary artery cannula. The PPP is monitored similarly to group I and used to guide the infusion rate. The surgical procedure can continue during the pulmoplegia that takes about 8 to 10 minutes. The blood and solution returning from the pulmonary circuit to the left atrium is sucked and filtrated by a cell saver. The custodiol HTK solution is discarded and the remaining red blood cells are returned to the patient.</p><p>In group III, standard CPB is performed as described.</p><p>For groups I, II and III the residual blood in the CPB circuit is retransfused to patients after CPB. In case of excesses, fluid ultrafiltration (BC60 plus, Maquet, Wayne, NJ, USA) is performed during rewarming.</p><p>In group IV, TAVI is performed according to current guidelines at Rigshospitalet (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01057173).</p></sec><sec><title>Blood samples</title><p>In all patient groups, blood samples for inflammatory indicators are collected from the pulmonary artery catheter: (1) after anesthesia induction; (2) at CPB start; (3) after declamping of the aorta; (4) 10 and 20 minutes after CPB; (5) at the end of surgery; (6) 120, 240, and 360 minutes after CPB; and (7) 24 hours post anesthesia induction. A total of 3 ml of blood is placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetate coated tubes, immediately centrifuged (or kept on ice for a maximum of 60 minutes) for 10 minutes at 1,800 rpm and cooled to 4&#x000b0;C. Plasma is extracted and stored in polypropylene test tubes at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until assayed.

It will be emphasized that the involved staff does not report or disclose the randomization, for example, it will not be entered into the patient&#x02019;s file.</p><p>Blood samples, BALF, and lung biopsies will be labeled with a unique patient number (starting 101) and personnel carrying out analyses will be blinded to which group the patient is randomized. Several of the other outcome variables cannot, however, be blinded but represent objective measures established at a fixed time. Decision makers on when to extubate a patient or whether FiO<sub>2</sub> and other ventilator settings should be changed will be blinded to the allocation of the patient.</p><p>The patient's case report form (CRF) will be completed by the project coordinator or other personnel in accordance with the trial master file (TMF) list of tasks. The CTU will conduct blinded, double entry of the CRF data and blinded statistical analyses in which the intervention groups are coded as A, B, C, and D will be performed. Based on this analysis two blinded conclusions will be established: firstly assuming that groups A + B represent the intervention groups will be compared with data from groups C + D representing the control groups; and secondly the reverse scenario is assumed. Hereafter, and only then, will the groups be unmasked.</p></sec><sec><title>Serious adverse reactions</title><p>Serious adverse reactions (SARs) described with the use of the custodiol HTK solution include electrolyte imbalance (hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia) and fluid overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Such manifestations can also be related to CPB but if they manifest, they will be recorded in the CRF and after an independent statistician has evaluated the data reported to the Ethics Committee and Danish Health &#x00026; Medicines Authority. Furthermore, such events will be compared among the patients included in the two active trial groups. Yet, we consider that the amount of infused custodiol HTK solution is small (maximum 100 ml). Under all circumstances the Sponsor will provide a yearly report to the Ethics Committee and the Danish Health &#x00026; Medicines Authority.</p><p>Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be defined as SARs not described in the summaries of product characteristics for custodiol HTK solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. SUSARs will be reported by the trial site investigator to the Sponsor within 24 hours. The Sponsor ensures that all information on SUSARs that are fatal or life-threatening will be recorded and reported to the Danish Health &#x00026; Medicines Authority and Dr. Franz K&#x000f6;hler Chemie GmbH as soon as possible and no later than within seven days after the sponsor becomes aware of such side effects.</p><p>All other SUSARs will be reported to the Danish Health &#x00026; Medicines Authority within 15 days after the Sponsor is informed of such events. When reporting SUSARs the e-form on the Danish Health &#x00026; Medicines Authority&#x02019;s website is used.</p><p>Patients in the pulmonary perfusion group will also be followed for 24 hours during which, for example, bleeding, the number of blood transfusions, and the need for reoperation due to hemorrhage is recorded.</p><p>For patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the total time in the operating theatre is locally 6 to 8 hours, the time requiring mechanical ventilation is 10 to 12 hours, and the patients spend 7 to 10 days in hospital. All such data will be recorded in the CRF and reported to the Ethics Committee and Danish Health &#x00026; Medicines Authority if it deviates markedly.</p><p>Events directly related to the surgery and events directly related to the normal course for this type of patient will be recorded but not reported as incidents. These events are: apoplexia cerebri, transient cerebral ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pericardial tamponade, pericardial effusion, arrhythmias, deep vein thrombosis, pneumothorax, emphysema, pleural effusion, pneumonia, subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinitis, anemia, pain, nausea, generalized weakness, constipation, esophagitis, ileus, gastric ulcer, acute liver damage, acute tubulointerstitial nephropathy, sepsis, wound infection and others.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Discontinuation of the trial for an individual patient: Patients will be withdrawn from the interventions in the PP-Trial protocol if SARs or SUSARs occur.</p><p>Discontinuation of the whole trial: For a SUSAR or in case there is raised suspicion that a SAR may be related to the experimental treatment, this will be reported to the Ethics Committee and the Danish Health &#x00026; Medicines Authority. There will, however, not be any interim analyses during the trial and the trial will not be terminated before the estimated sample size has been reached due to apparently beneficial effects of the interventions.</p><p>Yet, the trial will be terminated if results from other trials within the period of the trial show clear benefit or harm with one or more of the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients&#x02019; withdrawal</title><p>Patients who are withdrawn from the PP-Trial trial protocol (see Safety) will be followed and analyzed the same as the remaining patients. Patients may withdraw their informed consent to participate in the trial at any time. The patients who withdraw their consent to participate in the trial will be asked for permission to obtain data for the primary outcome measure. If the patient declines, however, no data will be collected. All randomized patients will be reported, and all data available with consent will be used in the analyses. If appropriate, multiple imputation will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. If there are patients with missing data for the primary outcome measure, new patients will be randomized to obtain the full sample size.</p><p>Patients who are transferred to another ICU will be followed up for the primary outcome measure and all other assessable secondary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>Previously, a randomized clinical trial of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus standard CPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and a randomized clinical trial with custodiol HTK solution pulmoplegia versus standard CPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] has been performed. The primary outcome measure for these trials was the PF ratio defined as PF = P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/F<sub>i</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>For the trial of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus standard CPB the standard deviation (SD) for the PF ratio was 50 mmHg and the mean difference was 55 mmHg. For the trial of custodiol HTK solution pulmoplegia versus standard CPB, the SD for the PF ratio was 110 mmHg and the mean difference was 150 mmHg.</p><p>This experiment has theoretically six possible comparisons with randomization to three groups and a secondary control group represented by TAVI. However, for practical reasons five comparisons will be performed as this trial, based on the sample size estimation, does not include enough patients to perform a comparison between pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood and custodiol HTK solution. With multiple comparisons the risk of a type 1 error increases and to limit the family wise error rate to 0.05, we set the significance level to &#x003b1; = 0.01 for each of the five comparisons planned. The power 1 - &#x003b2; (&#x003b2; being the risk of a type 2 error set to 0.20) of each comparison is set to 80%.</p><p>Using the Dupont &#x00026; Plummer power and sample size calculator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the required number of patients to detect or reject a relevant mean difference of 50 mmHg between pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus standard CPB is estimated at 30 patients for each group. The required number of patients to detect or reject a relevant mean difference of 150 mmHg in the PF ratio during the postoperative period between pulmonary perfusion with custodiol HTK solution versus standard CPB is estimated at 14 patients for each group. We have therefore chosen to set N = 4 &#x000d7; 30 = 120.</p><p>If the PF ratios in the above two interventions both prove to be superior to standard CPB, it is to be expected that the difference in the PF ratio between pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution will be less than the differences between the PF ratio of the two interventions and the PF ratio of the standard CPB. With a fixed N = 120, pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood versus custodiol HTK solution pulmoplegia yields a power of 67% to detect or reject a mean difference of 55 mmHg between the two interventions and, therefore, needs to be assessed there from. To obtain a power of 80% for the detection or rejection of a mean difference of 55 mmHg in comparison with pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution, with a risk of type 1 error of 1%, would require 52 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p>The differences between the groups according to the primary outcome measure of OI, as mentioned measured six times during the postoperative period, will be tested with a mixed-effects model. For other continuous outcomes we will use analysis of variance (ANOVA). If the ANOVA is significant, a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for unpaired groups will be used to locate deviating values. For the mixed-effects model and the variance analyses <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.05 are considered to be statistically significant. For the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.01 are considered to be statistically significant. The difference between groups of the frequency of patients with binary outcomes including frequency of patients with one or more adverse events will be tested with a Chi<sup>2</sup> test.</p><p>Trial results will be analyzed according to the modified intention to treat principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Post-randomization exclusion will be allowed only for patients not undergoing CPB dependent heart surgery. Further, per-protocol analyses will be performed excluding patients with major protocol violations defined as: 1) patients who were randomized to an intervention but did not receive any intervention; 2) patients who received an incorrect intervention; or 3) patients randomized to standard CPB who received preoperative pulmonary perfusion; and 4) patients who violated one or more inclusion or exclusion criteria.</p><p>With data missing on more than 5% of the patients (12 patients) a complete case analysis will be made, provided that the missing data can be assumed to be at random and that Little&#x02019;s test is not significant. If missing data cannot be assumed to be at random and Little&#x02019;s test is significant, multiple imputations will be performed assuming missing data at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Data registration</title><p>Data will be registered in the CRF from patient notes (source) by trial or clinical personnel under the supervision of the trial investigators.

The involved patients are a high-risk cardiac surgical group because of their preoperative reduced lung function. There are currently no methods to mitigate the deterioration of lung function after cardiac surgery in this patient group. In the PP-Trial we use sophisticated intensive care and innovative monitoring in the form of invasive and non-invasive monitoring, clinical physiological examinations and biochemical, cell biological, immune-histochemical and histological analyses.</p><p>It is expected that trial results can contribute in innovative ways to: 1) a better understanding of pulmonary physiology, hemodynamics, and the role of lung inflammation during cardiac surgery; 2) a randomized clinical trial by intervention with pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution to improve the postoperative oxygenation ability for cardiac surgical patients with COPD; 3) develop a template for classification of cardiac surgical patients as low or high immunologic responders, making it possible to individualize patient treatment with a focus on reducing the CPB-triggered inflammatory response deleterious effects on the organs; and 4) to determine if the respiratory failure in TAVI patients is mainly due to an inflammatory response or to pump failure.</p><p>The results may be used as a precursor to a larger randomized multicenter trial and in other patient groups with, for example,a major surgical trauma, expected long CPB-time (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment), and in severe sepsis/sepsis shock where our lung protective modalities may be able to reduce the pulmonary driven part of the immunologic response, and thereby diminish the degree of pulmonary failure and reduce mortality.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The PP-Trial will provide important data on the use of pulmonary perfusion with oxygenated blood or custodiol HTK solution in patients with COPD undergoing cardiac surgery. An alternative strategy could be cooling of relevant organs leading to an overall reduced cell turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The PP-Trial has its limitations due to its inherent exploratory nature with the primary outcome of OI being a surrogate outcome. However, it is important to address the fact that patients with COPD, and especially patients with moderate to severe COPD, may be functionally incapacitated by hypoxemia, SIRS and prolonged recovery, and even an increased number of postoperative complications and death may be reflected by the degree of hypoxemia and SIRS. The sample size does not aim for confirmatory conclusions on the effect on important patient outcomes, such as mortality, cardiovascular complications, and risk of pneumonia and sepsis, which need a large trial with a low risk of bias, but the PP-Trial is considered an important feasibility trial paving the road for a possible pragmatic multicenter confirmatory trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial was registered 6 June 2012.
