Blood and muscle biopsies were procured before and after sifalimumab administration. Selected proteins were measured in patient serum with a multiplex assay, in the muscle using immunohistochemistry, and transcripts were profiled with microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assays. A 13-gene IFNGS was used to measure the pharmacological effect of sifalimumab.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The IFNGS was suppressed by a median of 53&#x02013;66% across three time points (days 28, 56 and 98) in blood (p=0.019) and 47% at day 98 in muscle specimens post-sifalimumab administration. Both IFN-inducible transcripts and proteins were prevalently suppressed following sifalimumab administration. Patients with 15% or greater improvement from baseline manual muscle testing scores showed greater neutralisation of the IFNGS than patients with less than 15% improvement in both blood and muscle. Pathway/functional analysis of transcripts suppressed by sifalimumab showed that leucocyte infiltration, antigen presentation and immunoglobulin categories were most suppressed by sifalimumab and highly correlated with IFNGS neutralisation in muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Sifalimumab suppressed the IFNGS in blood and muscle tissue in myositis patients, consistent with this molecule's mechanism of action with a positive correlative trend between target neutralisation and clinical improvement.

Primary trial objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sifalimumab in dermatomyositis or polymyositis patients, while one of the exploratory objectives included the assessment of the effects of sifalimumab on pharmacodynamic markers in blood and disease tissue. A description of the latter objective is the scientific focus of this paper. Fifty-one patients were enrolled with seven, eight, 16 and eight patients dosed with sifalimumab at 0.3, 1, 3 and 10&#x02005;mg/kg, respectively, and 12 received placebo. Patients received treatment for 6&#x02005;months with 14 doses (every other week dosing), while patients receiving placebo were dosed for 3&#x02005;months, then switched to sifalimumab for 3&#x02005;months with seven doses beginning at day 98.</p><p>Sixty-one different immunosuppressant agents or corticosteroids were used among 37 patients, with prednisone (n=30) and methotrexate (n=15) being the two most common.

Sifalimumab shows strong neutralisation of the IFNGS in blood up to day 98 at three dose levels and is distinct from the placebo-dosed cohort, although the 10&#x02005;mpk cohort in blood does not reflect this difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012202794F1">figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012202794F2">2</xref>).

The small sample size accompanied by patient-to-patient variability could contribute to this observation. Furthermore, neutralisation by sifalimumab may be partly bypassed via IFN-&#x003b2; or other type I IFN family members besides IFN-&#x003b1;. Sifalimumab binds to the majority of the IFN-&#x003b1; subtypes with high affinities, but not to other type I IFN. The prevalence of IFN-&#x003b2; compared to IFN-&#x003b1;, and its contribution to the disease pathogenesis in myositis, is less clear. The IFN-&#x003b2; level in the blood has been shown to be both unique to and correlate with an elevated IFNGS in dermatomyositis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Cappelletti et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> showed that IFN-&#x003b2; and not IFN-&#x003b1; transcripts were overexpressed in polymyositis as well as dermatomyositis and juvenile dermatomyositis muscle, suggesting a local source of IFN-&#x003b2; that might contribute to the lack of stronger target neutralisation by sifalimumab in muscle compared to blood beyond the variation in pharmacokinetic profile in individual patients. Furthermore, type III IFN signalling can similarly bypass effects of sifalimumab and induce activation of IRF-9 and transcription of IFN-inducible genes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> although IFN-&#x003bb; induces a much smaller effect on IFNGS in blood (data not shown). Stimulation of purified human plasmacytoid DC with virus or Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, CpG A showed that one subset of cells produced IFN-&#x003b1; only, while another subset produced IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003bb;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> A larger study, particularly one comparing sifalimumab to an anti-type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) monoclonal antibody, will help to explain if blockage of the type I IFN pathway would clinically benefit myositis patients, and what type I IFN contributes to the pathogenesis and drives the disease progression.</p><p>In a previous independent study of dermatomyositis or polymyositis patients, a leucocyte index, an MHC class I signature and an immunoglobulin signature were overexpressed in muscle biopsies and positively correlated with the IFNGS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Independent pathway analysis conducted across the transcriptome in this study identified three similar pathways&#x02014;leucocyte extravasation, antigen presentation and B-cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012202794F5">figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;C, respectively), which were preferentially suppressed in muscle biopsies following exposure to sifalimumab. The leucocyte index and immunoglobulin signature represented the level of leucocyte infiltration and abundance of plasma cells in the myositis muscle, respectively. Type I IFN plays a critical role in the self-sustaining inflammatory response, contributing to leucocyte infiltration as well as the upregulation of MHC class I expression on the cell surface of muscle fibres.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> For both dermatomyositis and polymyositis, the inflammatory cell infiltrates are primarily composed of CD4 cells, DC and macrophages, whereas polymyositis has an additional CD8 T-cell component.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> In addition, DC infiltrates may act as both antigen presenting cells and as a major source of type I IFN in the diseased tissue,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> and contribute directly to disease pathogenesis and sustained inflammation at the disease site. In this study, all three inflammation-related signatures were suppressed concordantly with the modulation of the IFNGS in muscle following administration of sifalimumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012202794F5">figure 5</xref>), consistent with the biological function of IFN-&#x003b1;.</p><p>Modulation of the type I IFN signature in both blood and muscle of dermatomyositis or polymyositis patients dosed with sifalimumab positively correlates with MMT8 improvement at day 98. It should be noted that a few patients receiving placebo also showed clinical improvement at day 98 based on MMT8 with no target neutralisation in either blood or muscle. One likely explanation is that some patients respond favourably to standard of care (ie, immunosuppressive medications). As MI-CP151 was not designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sifalimumab, the true clinical benefit of sifalimumab (on top of standard of care) in myositis needs to be evaluated in a carefully designed trial with sufficient statistical power.</p><p>This study shows the utility of an IFNGS as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for sifalimumab in adult dermatomyositis or polymyositis patients. Although this clinical trial is modest sized, we observed substantial target neutralisation of this biomarker following administration of sifalimumab in blood with a trend in muscle tissue, as well as suppressed signalling activity in several important inflammatory pathways. Preliminary results indicate a positive trend between target neutralisation of the IFNGS and reduction in disease activity in dermatomyositis or polymyositis patients, an observation that needs additional confirmation. This potential association between the mechanism of action of sifalimumab and clinical benefit, coupled with the lack of complete target neutralisation by sifalimumab, raises the possibility that blockage of the IFNAR might show superior clinical benefit in myositis patients. This hypothesis, along with a better understanding of the potential contribution of other IFN types, needs to be rigorously evaluated in future clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Yanping Wu and Jichao Sun for providing and managing clinical data.
