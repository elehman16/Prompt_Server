A total of 60 male patients undergoing elective surgery with urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction will be randomized to receive either DPNB with 0.33 % ropivacaine (DPNB group) or intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg (TRAM group) after the completion of surgery but before extubation. The primary outcome is the incidence and severity of CRBD. Secondary outcomes include Visual Analog Score (VAS) for postoperative pain, number of patients requiring sulfentanil after operation, acceptance of an indwelling urinary catheter after extraction of the catheter, and postoperative side effects, which include postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV), vertigo, sedation, drowsiness, and dry mouth.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>For CRBD prevention, this trial is planned to test the superiority of a dorsal penile nerve block with 0.33 % ropivacaine to the use of intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg.

The incidence of CRBD ranges from 47 to 90 % in the postoperative period, especially in male patients who have had urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction under general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. CRBD often causes patient agitation and is accompanied by behavioral responses that may include loud complaining and attempts to remove the urinary catheter. In addition, CRBD may result in exacerbated postoperative pain, increased postoperative complications, and prolonged hospital stay. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent and treat CRBD as early as possible.</p><p>The mechanism of CRBD has been reported to be similar to that of overactive bladder, that is, the involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscles of the urinary bladder, which is caused by acetylcholine released from activated cholinergic nerves and mediated by muscarinic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, muscarinic receptor antagonists such as tolterodine, oxybutynin, ketamine, butylscopolamine, and tramadol have been reported to be effective in the prevention or treatment of CRBD with a variable successful rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, side effects such as sedation, nausea or vomiting, dry mouth, or other unpleasant complications may occur with these systemic administrations. Clinically, the dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) has been applied in penile surgery for decades, and satisfactory pain relief effect could be achieved during operation and postoperatively without the side effects related to systemic administrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, we have observed that patients undergoing urethral surgery with a urinary catheter left in-situ seldom complained about CRBD if the DPNB is performed at the end of operation. Based on these literatures and clinical practice, we hypothesize that DPNB could relieve CRBD for male patient with an indwelling urinary catheter if the insertion occurs after the induction of general anesthesia.</p><p>In this trial, we will compare the efficacy of a dorsal penile nerve block with 0.33 % ropivacaine to intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg in the prevention of CRBD, as well as the incidences of postoperative side effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial that examines the use of the nerve block technique for CRBD prevention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The DPNB trial is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial that will test the superiority of a dorsal penile nerve block with 0.33 % ropivacaine to intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg for CRBD prevention.

Postoperative sulfentanil requirement will be analyzed by <italic>Z</italic> test, and the duration of postoperative sulfentanil requirement and the number of patients requiring sulfentanil for postoperative pain will be analyzed with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. A <italic>P</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 is considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tramadol is a weak opioid that is commonly used for postoperative pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and it is reported to halve the incidence of CRBD if it is administered i.v. 30 min before the end of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, we chose tramadol treatment as the control and are testing the superiority of a dorsal penile nerve block with 0.33 % ropivacaine over the intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg in CRBD prevention.</p><p>Dorsal penile nerve block, a local anesthetic technique, has been applied widely in patients undergoing urethra surgery, and these patients, with a urinary catheter left in situ, rarely complain about CRBD. Theoretically, the nerve block should be associated with fewer side effects when compared with intravenous administration. Therefore, we hypothesize that DPNB could reduce the incidence of CRBD as well as the side effects. In addition, the afferent nerves of the urethra and bladder triangle are derived from sacral somatic (S2 to 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and a successful prevention of CRBD could be achieved by blocking the pudendal nerve. If the prevention of the CRBD can be achieved by the DPNB, a new mechanism of CRBD other than overactive bladder would be suggested by this trial.</p><p>In terms of the study design, the diameter of the 18 G Fr Foley catheter and the sex (male) has been reported to be independent predictors of moderate or severe CRBD in the PACU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], so we choose male patients with 18 G Fr Foley catheter to test the effects of CRBD prevention in the current study. In addition, the local anesthetics are not applied for catheterization to minimize other factors related to CRBD. Furthermore, although we test the superiority of the dorsal penile nerve block with 0.33 % ropivacaine to intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg in CRBD prevention, we are not going to cast doubt on the beneficial effects of anti-cholinergic drugs to relieve CRBD.</p><p>The limitation of this trial is that DPNB is only applicable to surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia. The application of DPNB should be studied in the future to benefit those patients who are undergoing catheterization for medical procedures not requiring any surgical intervention.</p><p>In conclusion, this trial plans to test the superiority of a dorsal penile nerve block with 0.33 % ropivacaine to intravenous tramadol 1.5 mg/kg in CRBD prevention. This study may provide a new insight into the mechanism of CRBD and new clinical practice for the prevention of CRBD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study is currently ongoing.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>American Society of Anesthesiologists</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRBD</term><def><p>catheter-related bladder discomfort</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPNB</term><def><p>dorsal penile nerve block</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCS</term><def><p>Glasgow Coma Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OAB</term><def><p>overactive bladder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PACU</term><def><p>post-anesthesia care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PONV</term><def><p>postoperative nausea/vomiting</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAS</term><def><p>statistical analysis system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>visual analog score</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>J-Y L and RL have jointly designed and developed the study protocol.
