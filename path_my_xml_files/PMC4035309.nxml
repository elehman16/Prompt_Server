The relationship between HIV and malnutrition is easily explained, and the etiology of malnutrition in HIV disease has been shown to be multifactorial. The implicated factors include altered nutrient intake, malabsorption, or metabolic changes. Inadequate food intake may also occur as a result of anorexia, dysgeusia, dysphagia, depression, or lack of access to adequate foods.<xref rid="b2-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It therefore follows that ongoing assessment of nutritional and medical status is crucial to quality nutrition care for every person living with HIV.<xref rid="b1-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Usually included in the assessment and monitoring is a complete baseline nutrition assessment. This should be done for each patient. Both baseline and ongoing assessment examine changes in body composition, clinical, and biochemical parameters, dietary intake, as well as psychosocial issues. Anthropometric measurements, including measures of body weight, body mass index (BMI), and subcutaneous fat stores, can help the nutrition professional identify and track changes in body composition.<xref rid="b3-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Previous study points to low energy intake combined with increased energy demands, due to HIV infection and related infections, as the major driving forces behind HIV-related weight loss and wasting. Nutrition experts recommend that energy needs be increased by 10% over accepted levels for otherwise healthy people. This is based on the increased resting energy expenditure that has been observed in the study of HIV-infected adults.<xref rid="b4-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> During the course of HIV treatment, the patient may experience muscle loss, subcutaneous fat loss, or fat hypertrophy, which may or may not be reflected in the patient&#x02019;s total body weight. For this reason, it is vital to assess body composition on a regular basis. Regular assessment of body weight and body composition can help in the early detection and treatment of morphologic changes, such as the loss, accumulation, and/or altered distribution of fat as well as AIDS wasting syndrome.<xref rid="b1-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Hematologic abnormalities, including anemia, are common manifestations of HIV infection and AIDS. Anemia may result from the indirect effects of HIV infection, including adverse reactions to medications, opportunistic infections, neoplasms, or nutritional abnormalities stemming from anorexia, malabsorption, or metabolic disorders. The resultant anemia can impact daily quality of life by inducing such symptoms as loss of stamina, rapid heart rate, and shortness of breath. Anemia has been shown to be a risk factor for early death in patients with AIDS.<xref rid="b5-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Previous study found that nutritional supplementation taken concurrently with antiretroviral therapy (ART) improved hemoglobin, red blood cell, and white blood cell count, and suggested that the best way to prevent anemia is by eating a wide variety of nutritious food.<xref rid="b6-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Nutrition intervention includes both food-based approaches and micronutrient supplementation. Researchers have employed both in the past. Both approaches have their benefits and challenges.<xref rid="b7-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The aim of this study was to find out the effect of nutritional counseling and monitoring, using individualized dietary prescriptions, on the BMI and hemoglobin of patients who are HIV infected and also receiving HAART in our setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was carried out at Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Southeast Nigeria. The hospital offers HIV care and services among other primary, secondary, and tertiary care services for other aspects of health care. At the time of this study, the HIV clinic had about 750 patients in its enrolment. The study was a 6-month, quasi-experimental study of HIV infected patients who were receiving treatment with HAART and who also accessed care from the HIV clinic. The sample size was calculated using the following formula</p><disp-formula id="FD1-hiv-6-091"><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>}</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>}</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><p>where n = the sample size required in each group; A =1.96, the level of significance; B =0.84, desired power at 80%; p<sub>1</sub> =0.75, the estimated proportion of HIV patients that would receive a nutrition intervention; p<sub>2</sub> =0.40, the estimated proportion of HIV patients that would not receive a nutrition intervention; and p<sub>1</sub>&#x02212;p<sub>2</sub> =0.35, the level of change or difference from nutritional intervention chosen to be of clinical importance.</p><p>The calculated sample size was 84 participants.

These patients were all receiving HAART, including zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, and efavirenz. None of the patients were on a protease inhibitor. The eligibility criteria included: patients who gave consent to participate, patients who were residents within Abakaliki town, and patients without opportunistic infections at the beginning of the study. Patients who were pregnant at the time of study or who were likely to become pregnant during the course of study were excluded. The intervention group received nutritional counseling. This included dietary counseling and individualized food prescriptions based on locally available food and counseling on food hygiene. The individualized prescription included assessment of foods easily available and affordable by individual patients, and assessment of patients&#x02019; daily energy requirement. The daily energy requirement was calculated using the formula</p><disp-formula id="FD2-hiv-6-091"><mml:math id="mm2"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TER</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>RMR</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>TEF</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>physical&#x000a0;activity</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><label>(2)</label></disp-formula><p>where, TER was the thermic effect of food, TER was total energy requirement and RMR was the resting metabolic rate. Calculating this daily energy requirement for each patient ensured that the patients&#x02019; energy intake did not go below daily energy expenditure. Also, the nutritionist ensured that the food prescriptions contained food from all food classes.</p><p>Both groups had anthropometric measurements, such as weight, height, and BMI, and hemoglobin concentration measured at baseline and then monthly for 6 months. Only the intervention group received nutrition counseling on a monthly basis, during their scheduled monthly clinic visits. At the end of 6 months, the differences in the mean BMI between the intervention group and control group were calculated. The difference in mean hemoglobin concentration between the intervention and control groups was also calculated. This was done using the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. The tools used for the measurements included a stadiometer/body weight scale (model ZT-120; Sino-Resource International Trade Co, Ltd, Tianjin, People&#x02019;s Republic of China). This was used to measure weight and height. Venous blood, drawn in the morning in the laboratory during each clinic visit, was used for the hemoglobin level. Hemoglobin estimation was done using the HemoCue<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Hb 201DM Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) in the laboratory. Dietary counseling and food prescriptions were obtained from the Nutrition and Dietetics department of the hospital. The nutrition counseling was done by the nutritionist attached to the HIV clinic. A semistructured questionnaire was used to collect information from the patients. The information included demographic data, date of enrollment into ART, height, weight, and 24-hour food recall. The questionnaire was administered at every clinic visit, and information, such as weight, food recall, and hemoglobin, was updated. All patients selected for this study completed the study. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 16 (SPSS, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Ethical clearance was duly obtained from the Ethics and Research committee of the hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-hiv-6-091">Table 1</xref> shows the age, sex distribution, and the mean age of the respondents.

After 6 months, the BMI was 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for both males and females. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests the following classification of BMI values:<xref rid="b8-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> &#x0003c;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (thinness); 18.5&#x02013;24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (eutrophy); 25&#x02013;29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight); 30&#x02013;39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obesity); and &#x0003e;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (morbid obesity). In our study, the mean BMI reflects a eutrophic population. This suggests that nutrition intervention can help people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to maintain adequate weight during the course of infection and treatment with HAART.<xref rid="b9-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> One study has shown that the prevalence of thinness among HIV-infected people in the era of HAART is about 8.8%.<xref rid="b9-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This provides an understanding of why weight loss and malnutrition continue to be common problems among HIV-infected patients in developing communities, even in the era of ART.<xref rid="b10-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A previous study also showed that low BMI at ART initiation was an independent predictor of mortality.<xref rid="b12-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This study also showed that those with a BMI between 16.0 and 16.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> had a 2.1-fold increased risk of early mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7&#x02013;2.5), and those with a BMI of 16.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> had a 2.3-fold increased risk (95% CI: 2.0&#x02013;2.7).<xref rid="b12-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> BMI, therefore, is a useful tool to detect chronic energy deficiency and has also been proposed as an indicator of HIV progression, in developing countries.<xref rid="b13-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In our study, nutrition intervention had a significant effect on the BMI of females in intervention group when compared with that in females in the control group. This was not so for the males. The effect was not significant when the difference in mean BMI of males in the intervention group was compared with the difference in the control group. This pattern could not be explained by our study, but when the results for both males and females were aggregated, the difference between the mean BMI of the intervention group and control group was found to be significant. One explanation could be that going to the market to buy food and cooking are considered female activities, possibly helping the females adhere to the nutrition counseling and hence, having a significant change in nutritional status. The results of another study also showed the positive effect of nutrition intervention on the maintenance of body weight in HIV-positive persons and support the principle of including nutrition intervention as a first line of defense in the care of HIV-infected patients.<xref rid="b2-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The authors obtained a positive outcome among the intervention group despite its concentration of severely compromised patients, which further supports the importance of nutrition intervention.<xref rid="b2-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>We also understand that obesity is becoming more common among PLWHA after the introduction of HAART. A number of laboratory studies have suggested the possibility of interaction between ART medications and several enzymes or hormones associated with lipid metabolism, mitochondrial toxicity of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, insulin resistance associated with protease inhibitors, and cytokine dysregulation. Even with this &#x0201c;multiple pathway&#x0201d; hypothesis, the role of HAART remains unclear in the pathophysiology of lipodystrophy syndrome.<xref rid="b15-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> All our patients were receiving zidovudine and lamivudine, both of which are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This could also have contributed to the eutrophic BMI of intervention and control groups.</p><p>The insignificant difference in the mean BMI of intervention group males and control group males in this study does not preclude offering nutritional counseling to PLWHA. This was also revealed in a study that assessed the relationship of energy intake to weight changes. The researchers concluded that the relationship was complex. Their data suggest that an increase in energy intake is not likely to increase weight, but they nevertheless recommended that all patients with HIV-related weight loss receive nutrition counseling so that energy intake is optimized.<xref rid="b16-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Consequently, nutrition counseling can improve health outcomes and should be an integral part of HIV care at any stage of the disease &#x02013; from helping newly infected people to stay healthy and assisting people taking ART to manage their therapy, to allowing people with end-stage AIDS to die with dignity.<xref rid="b17-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>A relationship between nutritional intervention and hemoglobin concentration was observed in our study. The difference between the mean hemoglobin concentration of the group that received nutrition intervention and that of the control group was statistically significant. This suggests that the development of anemia in HIV patients is an important factor that should be considered in their management. Hemoglobin is the iron-containing oxygen transport metalloprotein in the blood. Reduction in hemoglobin concentration leads to depletion of iron stores.<xref rid="b18-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Iron deficiency ranges from iron depletion, which causes little physiological damage, to iron deficiency anemia, which can affect the function of numerous organ systems. Iron depletion also causes the amount of stored iron to be reduced. Consequently, a person with no stored iron has no reserve should the body enter a state where more iron is required than is being absorbed from the diet.<xref rid="b18-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Anemia is associated with more rapid progression to AIDS, increased risk of death, and fatigue, as well as a greater need for transfusions.<xref rid="b19-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A study done in Nigeria revealed that anemia was a major problem of people living with HIV/AIDS and that those who received nutritional counseling and micronutrient supplementation had an increase in packed cell volume levels, while their controls had reductions.<xref rid="b20-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In that study, about 49 (35.5%) of the controls were anemic, and the authors inferred that nutritional counseling and micronutrient supplementation were effective in improving the packed cell volume of HIV patients. Elsewhere, researchers studied the predictors of mortality in HIV-infected patients starting ART.<xref rid="b21-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> They showed that anemia was a strong predictor of mortality and that severely anemic patients had nearly a 15-fold higher risk of dying during the first year on HAART compared with those with normal hemoglobin level.<xref rid="b21-hiv-6-091" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Our findings in this study have clinical implications. One is that monitoring weight and hemoglobin in PLWHA can be of benefit to their nutritional needs. Secondly, nutritional counseling can provide PLWHA with information on how to achieve a balanced diet from locally available foods. Weight and hemoglobin monitoring are simple to carry out. Therefore these could be applied at primary- and secondary-level clinics.</p><p>An important strength of our study is that Abakaliki is an agrarian community. Foods that can provide the needed nutrients are readily available and affordable. A second strength was that all patients involved in the study adhered to their clinic visits and appointments because our clinic has a strong treatment support service. Also our patients were randomized, hence many factors that could have affected our findings were randomly distributed between the intervention and control groups.</p><p>A major weakness in this study is that it did not account for the effect of ART on fat metabolism, which can affect weight gain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study has shown that nutrition intervention is important in the management of PLWHA while on ART. This can be achieved through nutritional counseling and monitoring of PLWHA in resource-constrained practice areas.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors
