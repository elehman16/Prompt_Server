Intumescent cataract remains, even for more experienced surgeons, a surgical challenge owing to the absence of the red reflex and the high intralenticular pressure.

Bhattacharjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] initially released the intralenticular pressure after filling the anterior chamber with OVD and applied the high magnification of the operating microscope without capsule staining. Another applied an assisted slit illuminator mounted in the vicinity of the operating microscope to improve anterior capsule visualization and overcome the absence of the red reflex.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Despite all studies and efforts to minimize intraoperative complications in intumescent cataract, the complication that might take place within seconds of puncturing of the anterior capsule is that the high intralenticular pressure expands the initial capsule incision in an uncontrolled way with the development of the Argentinean flag sign.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, instead of allowing the higher intralenticular pressure to passively equilibrate with the anterior chamber pressure, the pressure within the lens should be actively reduced by a closed system aspiration of liquefied cortical matter.</p><p>In the present study, in all eyes, the anterior capsule was stained with trypan blue to enhance visualization and reduce capsular elasticity. The complication rate was higher, though not statistically significant, in Group 1, which used peripherally dispersive OVD followed centrally by a higher viscosity cohesive OVD (Healon GV), than in Group 2, where lens decompression technique was applied. In Group 2, a 25-gauge needle was introduced into the anterior chamber through the main incision, with the bevel down, inserted into the lens center, and 0.1&#x02013;0.2 ml of liquid cortex was aspirated by pulling back on the syringe plunger, actively reducing intralenticular pressure. The needle bevel was facing down to prevent aspiration of the anterior capsule into the needle, occluding it.</p><p>In all eyes in Group 2, active reduction of intralenticular pressure prevented the egress of liquefied cortical matter, protecting against the occurrence of radial capsular tears, allowed the completion of CCC, followed by uneventful stop and chop phacoemulsification technique and in the bag implantation of a foldable IOL. In group 1, radial capsular tears occurred in four eyes; in two of them, phacoemulsification was completed while in the other two cases, with radial capsular tears endangering the equator, the

id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The lens decompression technique is reliable, safe, and more advantageous than the combined use of a dispersive and a higher viscosity cohesive OVD because it
