Dawali is a disease in which veins of legs and feet become dilated, tortuous, and greenish in colour due to excess accumulation of blood which is derived from saudavi madda &#x00026; balgham ghaleez. The aetiology of varicose veins is still incompletely under stood, despite the fact that it is a very common disease affecting all ages from teenagers to elderly people. The complication of varicose veins like venous eczema, venous pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, venous ulceration, etc impair health related quality of life significantly. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Taleeq in Dawali and to provide safe &#x00026; cost effective alternative treatment. Randomized controlled clinical open trial was conducted in regimenal unit of NIUM Hospital. 50 patients were divided into 2 groups, 30 in test &#x00026; 20 in control group. Test group was treated with Taleeq on alternate day &#x00026; control group was treated with grade 2 compression stockings &#x00026; limb elevation for 2 months. Response was measured by assessment of pain / leg discomfort, limb girth at calf, ankle, and feet, pigmentation area &#x00026; colour on every 15<sup>th</sup> day. Hb% was assessed on every 15<sup>th</sup> day to check anaemia. Effect on anatomy of vein was assessed by colour flow Doppler USG. Test group showed significant reduction in pain, limb girth, pigmentation, number of perforators. Control group showed significant reduction in pain &#x00026; limb girth, but there was no improvement on pigmentation. Both groups do not show significant improvement on SFJ &#x00026; SPJ incompetency. Test group has major effects in improvement of all parameters. Study stresses that leech therapy should be administered in combination with compression stockings &#x00026; other effective treatment modalities like weight normalization for obese patients, physical therapy, dietary modification etc for optimal results.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Compression Stockings and leg elevation</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Hirudin</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>hypovolumic hemodilution</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
