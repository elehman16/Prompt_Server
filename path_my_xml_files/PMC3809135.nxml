provision of non-prescription medication via community pharmacies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref> The practice guidance consists of an overall
PSA Standard for the supply of non-prescription medication to consumers, along with
specific guidelines developed for the supply of Pharmacist Only Medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> Non-prescription medication supply is also
referred to as dispensing in some countries. Appraisal of the impact of the PSA
guidelines on pharmacy practice has not been published in the scientific
literature.</p><p>The treatment of vaginal thrush in the community pharmacy setting is ideal to test
the impact of a PSA guideline on the practice of community pharmacy staff.
Approximately 75% of women suffer from vaginal thrush at sometime during their
lives, making it one of the most common ailments presented in the community
pharmacy. Symptoms are often non-discriminatory which can lead to misdiagnosis and
inappropriate treatment. Fluconazole and clotrimazole, are medications that are both
indicated for vaginal thrush, available without prescription. In 2004, when
fluconazole first became available without prescription, the PSA developed a
guideline to aid pharmacists in the provision of fluconazole for this
condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> It should be noted that
non-pharmacist members of staff may not be familiar with the guideline, however
under Australian law, a pharmacist must be involved with the sale of fluconazole. By
contrast, clotrimazole has been available without prescription longer than
fluconzole and has yet to have a guideline developed for supply.</p><p>Internationally, Watson and colleagues in the UK compared three dissemination
strategies of evidenced-based guidelines for treatment of vaginal thrush in
community pharmacies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> The authors examined
practice pre and post dissemination over a period of seven months and found no
improvement in outcome regardless of dissemination strategy (defined as appropriate
supply or non-supply). At the same time, Watson found, that pharmacist knowledge was
high post guideline dissemination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> Watson&#x02019;s
work suggests that knowledge does not correlate to compliant behavior, which may be
attributed to psychological effects such as existing attitudes and intentions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the practice of community pharmacies in response
to requests for antifungal medication with and without a PSA guideline. The primary
objective was to compare the incidence of appropriate patient outcome (in this case
non-supply of the requested medication and referral to a medical practitioner)
between groups. A secondary aim was to describe the assessment and counseling
provided to patients when requesting this medication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The University of Western Australia Human Research Ethics Committee granted
approval for the study. </p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The study was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted
in a metropolitan region of Australia. Community pharmacies (n=405) in the
metropolitan area were eligible for inclusion during 2008. Pharmacies that
employed staff known to the simulated patients, had previous knowledge of the
study, or did not supply non-prescription medication to the public were excluded
(n=29). From the remaining 376 eligible pharmacies, 100 community pharmacies in
a metropolitan area were randomly allocated to one of two groups: a request for
the product with a guideline (fluconazole), or a request for a product without a
guideline (clotrimazole). The sample size chosen provided an 85% chance of
detecting a 30% difference at a 5% significance level (two tailed).
Randomisation was performed by use of a random number generator.</p></sec><sec><title>Scenario </title><p>Visits were performed using the same simulated patient methodology as our
previous study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> Briefly, one of either
two female simulated patients in their mid-20&#x02019;s presented to pharmacies in the
guideline and non-guideline groups with a request for either Diflucan&#x000ae;
(fluconazole) or Canesten&#x000ae; (clotrimazole) respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Request by brand name was chosen
in consultation with practicing community pharmacists as this was likely to be
representative of actual practice in Australia due to the widespread advertising
of antifungals for the treatment of vaginal thrush. Upon entering a pharmacy,
the request was made to any member of staff, based on availability. The
simulated patients were to provide only information specifically pertaining to
questions asked. Training of the simulated patients was conducted via role-play
and by practicing the scenario in eight pharmacies that were not part of the
study. Completion of a written data collection form by the simulated patients
occurred immediately post-visit.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Scenario description</p></caption></table-wrap><p>Variables including the age and position held by pharmacy staff members were
assessed by simulated patient observation and thus may potentially be subject to
estimation error. To minimize potential error, age was grouped by decade and an
&#x02018;unsure&#x02019; category was used for visits where the staff position was difficult to
determine. In addition, the results were recorded immediately post-visit and
relied on recollection by the simulated patient. Employment position was defined
as the person who completed the consultation that resulted in advice, referral
or sale (or all three). Other variables measured included: </p></sec><sec><title>Outcome</title><p>The appropriate outcome was referral to a medical practitioner with non-supply of
antifungal medication. Medications were only purchased when advised to do so.
For the scenario presented, the symptoms provided were atypical of vaginal
thrush. In addition, the PSA guideline recommends patients with first-time
thrush to have the diagnosis confirmed by a medical practitioner. Data was also
collected on the amount and type of assessment and counselling provided to the
simulated patient. Assessment and counselling incidence was reported if any
assessment or counselling took place. The amount of assessment was defined as
the number of questions asked. The amount of counselling was defined as the
number of counselling elements verbally provided to the patient during the
consultation.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were performed for all data. Comparison between data was
via Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square and Student t-test for categorical and continuous data
respectively. Significance was set at the 5% level. For the primary objective,
the incidence of referral advice and medication non-supply were the dependant
variables compared between groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Demographic data of the 100 community pharmacies visited is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. There were no significant differences
found for pharmacy or counselor characteristics. The average time taken for the
visit also did not differ between groups. The appropriate outcome for the scenario
was determined as non-supply of antifungal medication and referral to a medical
practitioner for assessment of the patient&#x02019;s symptoms. Overall, 16% (n=16) of visits
resulted in an appropriate outcome (Figure 1). An appropriate outcome was achieved
in 10% (n=5) of the guideline cohort and 22% (n=11) of the control cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The incidence of an appropriate
outcome in the guideline cohort was half that of the control, however the result did
not achieve statistical significance (chi-square=2.68, df=1, p=0.10). Pharmacy staff
provided referral advice when selling antifungal medication in 32% (n=16) of the
guideline group and 40% (n=20) of the non-guideline group. Antifungal medication
sold without any referral advice occurred in 58% (n=29) of visits in the guideline
group, which was significantly more likely when compared with 38% (n=19) of visits
in the control group (chi-square=4.01, df=1, p&#x0003c;0.05). In six of the 100 visits,
pharmacy staff recommended treatment with an antifungal, despite indicating to the
patient that they either were unlikely to have thrush (n=5) or that they should see
a medical practitioner due to lack of a prior history of thrush (n=1). Comparison
between groups was not performed for this result.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Pharmacy and pharmacy staff characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Guideline (n)<break/> n=50</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control (n)<break/> n=50</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Significance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pharmacy Type</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.s.</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Independent</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50 (25)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 (30)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chain </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50 (25)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40 (20)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pharmacy Location</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.s.</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shopping Centre </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54 (27)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54 (27)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Street</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (11)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 (15)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medical Centre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (11)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pharmacy Busyness</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.s.</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Staff &#x0003e;

the control groups. The minority of pharmacy visits resulting in an appropriate
outcome is consistent with prior studies examining the provision of other
non-prescription medication in the same population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> The result is also
consistent with international research assessing the provision of anti-fungal
medication for vaginal thrush without prescription.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></p><p>From our results it is clear that the PSA guideline for supply of fluconazole for
vaginal thrush is not performing its intended purpose of ensuring that supply is
appropriate. This guideline was disseminated four years prior to the current study.
When compared with Watson and colleagues' findings that appropriate pharmacy
practice did not improve post-guideline implementation8, the results suggest that
additional time post-dissemination does not result in practice improvement.
Non-pharmacist members of staff may not be familiar with the guideline, however
under Western Australian law, a pharmacist must be involved with the sale. In over
one third of cases, this law was not followed in the current study.</p><p>Approximately half of the pharmacy staff that inappropriately provided antifungal
medication also provided referral advice to "see a medical practitioner if
symptoms persist". Visits in the guideline group were significantly more likely
to result in antifungal medication supply without referral advice. When supplying
medication that is inappropriate, lack of advice to the patient regarding what to do
if symptoms persist may further delay appropriate patient care. Misdiagnosis may
also involve vaginal thrush occurring alongside other vaginal infections such as
bacterial vaginosis and Chlamydia trachomatis which require treatment with
antibiotics and thus a consultation with a medical practitioner. In these cases, if
women achieved symptomatic relief for their vaginal thrush, they may be less likely
to seek medical treatment and continue to be affected by the other infection.
Pharmacy staff in a small proportion of visits gathered adequate information to make
an appropriate decision, accurately identified an appropriate reason for non-supply,
yet proceeded to recommend use of an antifungal. These results suggest that
decision-making is a discrete step in handling medication requests after information
gathering and processing.</p><p>While the rate and amount of both assessment and counseling between groups was not
different, there was a significant difference in the type of assessment conducted.
Literature has previously identified that different types of requests for
non-prescription medication are associated with variation in the assessment pharmacy
staff provide: direct-product versus symptom-based requests<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, and requests for medication for differing
medical conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> In this study, a request for clotrimazole
was significantly more likely to elicit assessment of the patient&#x02019;s reason for the
request and prior history than a request for fluconazole. This was despite both
medications being indicated for the same condition and the same patient details
being provided. As the disease state and the patient are controlled, our research
suggests that variables related to the medication itself contribute to a difference
in assessment. These variables may include pharmacy staff product knowledge, the
fact that clotrimazole has been available over the counter for longer, that
clotrimazole is indicated for more than one condition and is available in multiple
preparations via more than one route of administration or indeed whether the
medication has a guideline for supply.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the majority of visits, pharmacy staff inappropriately supplied antifungal
medication to the simulated patient, with symptoms inconsistent with vaginal thrush
and without a prior history of the condition. The presence of an existing guideline
for the supply of fluconazole did not increase the incidence of an appropriate
outcome.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Competing interests: None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>Pharmaceutical Society of
