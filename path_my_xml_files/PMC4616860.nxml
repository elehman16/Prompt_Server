Hypertension is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can also lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD), not only the person of African ancestry.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Activation of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system (RAAS), especially angiotensin II, plays an important role in its hemodynamic pathophysiology. The 8th Joint National Committee (JNC8)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> reported new guidelines for the management of high blood pressure, and recommended that in the population aged &#x0003e;18 years with CKD, initial antihypertensive treatment should include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or Ang-II receptor blockers (ARBs) to improve kidney outcomes. As agents for blocking of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system, ACEIs and ARBs have equal efficacy in terms of controlling blood pressure and improving renal function. Although some related analyses indicated a small difference in efficacy between ACEIs and ARBs, the investigations were not comprehensive, and little evidence is available regarding which is more effective in treating proteinuria.</p><p>In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of the extant trials, assessing renal outcomes of hypertensive patients treated with either ACEIs or ARBs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> were followed in all the phases of the study, that is, during the design, implementation, analysis, and reporting. We performed a comprehensive and systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using Web-based search engines (PubMed, OVID), China Biology Medicine (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Wanfang Data, from January 1990 to November 2014. The search was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ACEI versus ARB therapy in humans published in peer-reviewed journals; all included studies were required to report the albumin excretion rate (AER), albumin (Alb) level, and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) level as outcomes. If some data were unavailable, or if local libraries were unable to retrieve the full paper, the authors were contacted via e-mail. No language restriction was applied; non-English-language studies were translated by native speakers experienced in the health field. We reviewed the reference lists of the articles and original studies identified by the electronic search for other potentially eligible articles. If multiple publications addressed the same dataset, the most recent complete report was included. All analyses were based on previous published studies; thus no ethical approval and patient consent are required.</p><sec><title>Study Selection and Data Extraction</title><p>Two authors searched the data independently. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third party until a consensus was reached. For studies to be included they had to fulfill the following criteria: the design was a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial; it was published between January 1990 and November 2014; the population was primary hypertensive with or without diabetes; patients were randomly assigned to ACEIs or ARBs; and outcomes included urine protein excretion (UPE), UAE, urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR), or urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) levels. Data regarding detailed inclusion criteria, the research object, experimental measures, duration of follow-up, and UPE/UAE/UPCR/UACR levels were extracted (as available) from each study. Research was eliminated if it included primary diseases of the kidney system (including renal transplantation), CKD (eliminated as CKD can also cause proteinuria, including glomerular nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and systemic lupus with lupus nephropathy), type I diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, and secondary hypertension.

The criteria used for quality assessment related to whether the trial involved a double-blind patient assignment, whether complete outcome data were presented, whether there was any evidence of selective outcome reporting, or other sources of bias, as recommended by the Jadad rating scale. We classified studies that had a high or unclear risk of bias for any of the first 3 components to be of low quality.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and using Review Manager (RevMan), version 5.2 (Cochrane Collaboration, 2013).

Another meta-analysis comparing the effects of monotherapy and combination therapy with inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system on proteinuria<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> concluded that the ARBs reduced proteinuria, independent of the degree of proteinuria and underlying disease. The magnitude of effect was similar regardless of whether the comparator was placebo or a calcium-channel blocker. A previous meta-analysis compared the effects of the ARB telmisartan on proteinuria or albuminuria with other ARBs, ACEIs, other antihypertensive drug therapies, placebo, or no medication.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Their meta-analysis suggested that telmisartan therapy was likely to improve proteinuria/albuminuria over the short- to medium term and to prevent the progression of proteinuria/albuminuria over the medium term.</p><p>This meta-analysis, which included 17,951 patients, sought to evaluate the effects of RAAS inhibitors on proteinuria or albuminuria in primary hypertension. The experiments were selected to avoid the influence between the drugs. Furthermore, all patients underwent at least 2 weeks of placebo treatment, making the experimental design more scientific and rational. Only ACEIs and ARBs had a direct effect on urine protein levels. Overall, the results showed an equivalent effect associated with the class of RAAS inhibitors over a mean duration of 62.6 weeks. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that this meta-analysis was designed to allow a head-to-head comparison of ACEIs and ARBs. Notably, our analysis incorporated various doses of RAAS inhibitors and varying durations of therapy. We performed subgroup analysis covering a variety of dosages and found no difference between the 2 drug classes or according to the dose used. However, the large number of drug classes precluded performance of subgroup analysis. In our meta-analysis, the ONTARGET study,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> which included 16,740 patients with a median 56-month follow-up, showed that the effect of telmisartan on major renal outcomes in people at high vascular risk was similar to that of ramipril. This finding was supported by almost all of the trials with reasonable follow-up, showing that the therapeutic effects of ACEIs and ARBs were equivalent. As the numbers of patients in the ONTARGET study dwarf those of all other studies combined, we ran data from the other 16 studies to examine whether there was any change. We found the Forest plot showed no offset. The meta-analysis showed that the 2 classes of therapies yielded the same improvement in proteinuria/albuminuria over the short to medium term and prevented the progression of proteinuria/albuminuria during the medium term in primary hypertension patients with proteinuria. Our findings are important as the analysis included a large number of patients. The findings are relevant to clinical practice, as they are based on data from well-designed randomized trials encompassing a broad population of patients with high blood pressure and (or) diabetes mellitus (DM), who were treated for proteinuria or albuminuria and who are representative of hypertensive patients seen in clinics.</p><p>Diabetes mellitus is associated with many macrovascular complications, especially with hypertension. Approximately 40% of patients with type 2 DM at the age of 45 years were hypertensive; the proportion increases to 60% by the age of 75 years.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Both hypertension and DM markedly accelerated the progression of proteinuria/albuminuria. A recent meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> of patients with DM investigating the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) death, and CV events found that ACEIs reduced all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and major CV events in patients with DM, whereas ARBs had no such beneficial effects. The highlight of our meta-analysis is the performance of subgroup analysis of individuals with DM, and found that ACEIs and ARBs had analogous effects in terms of improving the AER and ACR. However, the main source of heterogeneity was from the ACR, which was assessed in only 3 trials. Moreover, as stated, there was considerable variation in the urine protein levels. Performance of further large trials with long-term follow-up will decrease the heterogeneity of this subgroup. However, further investigations are required to determine the equivalence of AER and ACR in the assessment of urine protein in patients with DM. Other findings of our meta-analysis showed that ACEIs have a greater effect in hypertensive patients with DM and that ARBs have a greater effect in patients without DM; the effects trend more to ACEIs at the 6-month follow-up and trend to ARBs thereafter; however, these differences were not significant.</p><p>In addition, we assessed changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as a secondary indicator of the antihypertensive effects of the 2 types of drug. A previous meta-analysis in hypertensive patients<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> showed that the overall reduction in all-cause mortality resulted almost completely from ACEIs; ARBs did not reduce mortality. We found that the effects of ACEIs and ARBs in terms of controlling blood pressure and improving proteinuria were similar. Therefore, in view of the high prevalence of hypertension in the general population, widespread use of ACEIs may control blood pressure to a certain extent, reducing the incidence of hypertensive nephropathy.</p><p>However, we realized that high heterogeneity, resulting mainly from ACR (including the ONTARGET study), was present. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate whether potential effect modifiers could explain any of the heterogeneity in treatment effects between studies. We found that the main source of heterogeneity was the ONTARGET study, which investigated individuals with high vascular risk, and the participants&#x02019; initial urine protein levels were low, or in some cases negative. Furthermore, the heterogeneity was reduced by the removal of the ONTARGET study. Moreover, we performed a further subgroup analysis of the stage of proteinuria and using different follow-up times, and found a high degree of heterogeneity.</p><p>Several limitations of our analysis should be discussed. There was considerable variation among the study populations. For example, the research populations were not unified, and the dosages of the active and control drug, target proteinuria levels, and follow-up times differed. Moreover, in several studies patients had other concomitant conditions and had received background therapy. Although these did not reduce the generalizability of our results, they made it challenging to accurately estimate the effects of ACEIs and ARBs in terms of improving blood pressure and preventing progression of proteinuria/albuminuria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>ACEIs and ARBs can reduce urine protein levels, resulting in an improvement in blood pressure. There was no significant difference between the 2 drug types in reducing urinary protein excretion in patients with primary hypertension. In summary, by improving proteinuria or albuminuria in patients with primary hypertension, especially those with DM, the widespread use of ACEIs may improve many clinical outcomes. However, our conclusions are not specific to patients with chronic kidney disease. This study highlights the need for further large, high-quality studies to enable more reliable conclusions to be drawn.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: 24-h = 24 hours, ACEIs = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ACR = albumin/creatinine ratio, AER = albumin excretion rate, Alb = albumin, ARBs = angiotensin receptor blockers, CBM = China Biology Medicine, CI = confidence intervals, CKD = chronic kidney disease, CNKI = China National Knowledge Infrastructure, DM = diabetes mellitus, EH = essential hypertension, ESRD = end-stage renal disease, HT = hypertension, MD = mean difference, OR = odds ratio, RAAS = renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system, RD = risk difference, RR = relative risk, SMD = standardized mean difference, UACR = urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, UAE = urinary albumin excretion, UP = urinary protein, UPCR = urine protein/creatinine ratio, WMD = weighted mean differences.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>RX, SS, and YH equally contributed to this work and should be regarded as co-first authors.This research was supported by the Shandong Province Outstanding Young Scientist Research Award Fund of China (BS2010YY062), the Medical Science and Technology Development Programme of Shandong Province, China (2013WS0130), and the Science and Technology Development Programme of Shandong Province, China (2014GSF118055).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yano</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujimoto</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
