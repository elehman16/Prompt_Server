This novel intervention targeted five behaviors; cleanliness of serving utensils, handwashing with soap before feeding, proper storage of cooked food, and thorough reheating and water treatment. Based on formative research and a creative process using the Behavior-Centered Design approach, an innovative intervention package was designed and delivered over a period of 3 months. The intervention activities included local rallies, games, rewards, storytelling, drama, competitions linking with emotional drivers of behavior, and &#x0201c;kitchen makeovers&#x0201d; to disrupt behavior settings. The effect of the package on behavior was evaluated via a cluster-randomized before&#x02013;after study in four villages with four villages serving as controls. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean cluster level proportions of mothers directly observed practicing all five food hygiene behaviors. The five targeted food hygiene behaviors were rare at baseline (composite performance of all five behaviors in intervention 1% [standard deviation (SD) = 2%] and in control groups 2% [SD = 2%]). Six weeks after the intervention, the target behaviors were more common in the intervention than in the control group (43% [SD = 14%] versus 2% [SD = 2%], <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) during follow-up. The intervention appeared to be equally effective in improving all five behaviors in all intervention clusters. This study shows that a theory-driven, systematic approach employing emotional motivators and modifying behavior settings was capable of substantially improving multiple food hygiene behaviors in Nepal.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Behavior change has been described as the last-mile problem in public health.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite the fact that solutions are available for most of the world's burden of disease, problems of uptake remain.

Behaviors are determined by a wide array of factors; however, the few previous interventions that have been reported focused on imparting knowledge rather that changing behavior.

Half of the population used water piped from unprotected springs, the other half surface water, and the majority of households had no toilet. Animal and child feces were visible throughout the study villages.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention design and delivery.</title><p>The food hygiene behavior change motivational package was designed following the five steps of BCD&#x02014;A: Assess, B: Build, C: Create, D: Deliver, and E: Evaluate<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>.
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Step A (assess): The first step involved the collection and analysis of published and local knowledge concerning food hygiene behavior to define target behaviors, the parameters of the intervention, and the questions to be answered in the Formative Research. We carried out a systematic review of literature on food hygiene (presented elsewhere), examined past experience, in particular small-scale weaning food studies in Mali,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Brazil,<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and Bangladesh,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> other hygiene interventions, learning particularly from the World Health Organization five key behaviors for safer food<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> and the successful SuperAmma handwashing trial in India.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> We consulted colleagues in government and non-governmental organizations to establish that the intervention would be replicable and scalable in the context of Nepal.</p></list-item></list>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Step B (build): Formative research was conducted to investigate specific behaviors; target audiences, and behavioral determinants including habits, motives and plans, and social, physical, and biological factors in the kitchen and village environment (the key elements of the BCD model<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). We carried out a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points assessment<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> with microbial food testing to help us pinpoint behaviors that were a source of risk of food contamination. This work led us to identify the following five key behaviors to target:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Cleaning of child food-serving utensils using soap or ash before serving food</p></list-item><list-item><p>Handwashing with soap by mother before feeding, and by child before eating</p></list-item><list-item><p>Storing cooked food in containers with a tight-fitting lid</p></list-item><list-item><p>Thorough reheating of leftover/stored food before feeding to the child (temperature <italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 70&#x000b0;C)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Serving only treated water to the child.</p></list-item></list></list-item></list></p><p>A further critical control point: the thorough cooking of foods to be fed to a child was also identified.

<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Step C (create): A local creative team with expertise in marketing, design, innovation, program development, and behavior change was assembled to design the intervention. They were briefed to use the motives of nurture, disgust, affiliation, and status and to disrupt behavioral settings (social and physical determinants of behavior<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Key principles were that the intervention should be recognizable, feasible to implement by local health workers/volunteers, and have a reasonable possibility of replication at larger scale. Prototypes of the intervention components were developed and pretested in several iterations in nonstudy areas and the package was finalized after incorporating government and NGO stakeholder feedback.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step D (deliver): The food hygiene promotion package was delivered through six events followed by six household visits from 15 trained Food Hygiene Motivators (FHMs) over a period of 3 months during May&#x02013;August 2013 (see <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The primary target audience were mothers with a child aged 6&#x02013;59 months. The campaign's theory of change was that mothers would identify with a central &#x0201c;ideal mother&#x0201d; character, who practiced safe hygiene so as to be respected in the community (Status motive). Nurture, Disgust, and Affiliation were further levers of change, and we aimed to disrupt daily food preparation habits that were held in place by tradition, routine, and the social and physical settings of kitchens.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>FHMs with a similar profile to Nepal's ubiquitous Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) were recruited locally and trained to implement the campaign. The details can be accessed online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shareresearch.org/om-prasad-gautam">http://www.shareresearch.org/om-prasad-gautam</ext-link> and a video documentary can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shareresearch.org/research/nepal-food-hygiene-intervention-campaign">http://www.shareresearch.org/research/nepal-food-hygiene-intervention-campaign</ext-link>. Nurture-based activities included a game about the child's life, an exchange of letters, and a family drama. Affiliation-based activities included a folk song, a puzzle game, peer review, and cookery demonstration. Disgust-based activities included a Glo Germ demonstration and a hot potato game. Status-based activities included a public pledging, public display of photos of ideal mothers, and declarations of safe food zones. The social and physical settings of kitchens were disrupted by holding makeover parties where the kitchen was redecorated using colored bunting and danglers placed at eye level and when neighbors agreed to practice new hygiene rituals. Villages were then declared &#x0201c;safe food hygiene zone,&#x0201d; with volunteer mothers becoming food hygiene monitors. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>

Some ethnic groups also fed jad (an alcoholic brew). The majority of households (86%) fed the same staple food to their children that they themselves consumed daily.

We attribute the apparent success of the intervention to the use of a systematic process employing global and local knowledge, behavioral theory, and a creative process to design a tailored intervention targeting emotional drivers of food hygiene behavior as well as disrupting food preparation settings.</p><p>An alternative interpretation of the study results is that the changes in behavior that were observed were not representative of real behavior, but were due to reactivity on the part of observed mothers. In effect, mothers may have been anxious to demonstrate to observers that they had learnt the lessons of the campaign by adhering closely to target behaviors during the observation period, but did not actually change their daily food hygiene routines. We think that this is unlikely because 1) observers were not connected by mothers to the intervention and mothers were told that the observation was to monitor their daily routine and 2) the analysis of microbiological samples taken at unannounced visits support the findings of improved behaviors (results presented elsewhere). Similar studies on the effectiveness of handwashing with soap interventions in Bangladesh<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and India<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> also used direct observation. Those studies claimed that the differential reactivity was likely to be low if participants saw no link between the intervention and the outcome measurement process.</p><p>The fact that the intervention was equally effective across targeted behaviors and across clusters and in differing socioeconomic settings suggests that the improvements were due to the effects of the intervention itself. The intervention was based on motivating mothers rather than educating them using a creative approach and behavior change science. Several authors have called for the use of more creative and innovative techniques to change public health-related behavior.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> We also paid attention to the training and motivation of our outreach workers (FHMs) as studies have suggested that the quality of interventions improves if the implementation team is skilled.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Several of our FHMs were also FCHVs. They found that it was feasible to deliver the intervention on top of their existing workload, suggesting that the package might capable of being scaled across Nepal.</p><p>The question of which elements of the intervention were most effective cannot be determined from this quantitative study. Hence, we do not know if the kitchen makeovers or the activities based on nurture, disgust, affiliation, or status were the most active ingredients of the intervention. We suspect that the food preparation setting disruption activity was particularly effective, involving as it did a transformation of the physical environment (repainting, bunting, danglers as behavior reminder, kitchen tools), the script (mothers committing to behave in a new way), social control (commitment made in front of their neighbors), and the changing designation/purpose of the setting (from kitchen corner to safe food hygiene zone). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> (right top picture) shows a typical transformation from all-purpose room used for cooking, eating, sleeping, and keeping animals to a beautiful, bright, and special small kitchen in one corner. The settings idea is a powerful one that was laid out in the 1950s by ecological psychologists,<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> but that has since been neglected. Yet Roger Barker showed that knowing settings can predict behavior 90% of the time, and all behavior takes place in settings.<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> This concept could be useful for changing health-related behavior.</p><p>The use of emotional motivators such as nurture, disgust, affiliation, and social status may have motivated the key behaviors. Our focus on the positive emotional reward of each behavior (becoming an ideal mother, shiny serving utensils, child's warm tummy, tasty food, social approval) probably helped to reinforce each behavior, making them part of the daily food preparation routine. To our knowledge, this is the first study to attempt to use emotional drivers to affect food hygiene behaviors, though they have been shown to work on other hygiene behaviors such as handwashing in low-<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> and high-income<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> countries.</p><p>This study faced the particular challenge of trying to change five different behaviors at the same time. Our intervention was designed to disrupt their common setting and used drivers that could be associated with all five behaviors. We further suspect that performing one behavior served as a reminder to perform another. For example, mothers practicing cleanliness of serving utensils just before feeding their children were likely to remember to wash their hands just before feeding, as both activities happened simultaneously. Many of the target behaviors happened in sequence; for example, immediately after reheating the food, the mother served the food using serving utensils, then washed her hands, and stored the leftover food properly. It may thus be easier to change multiple behaviors when they are practiced in similar settings and in sequence, when the practice of one can cue another.</p><p>The intervention was relatively intense, with six events and six door-to-door contacts. Based on our process evaluation (forthcoming), the intervention could be simplified for wider scaling-up at reduced cost. This study, however, provides proof of principle that food hygiene can be improved in challenging environments provided that interventions are based on a careful process involving Formative research, behavioral theory, and imaginative and motivating creative campaigns. BCD provides a simple process framework for the design of such interventions (the ABCDE steps) as well as theoretical basis for identifying key drivers of and a theory of change for behavior. The intervention was relatively intense, however, and it remains to be seen if the large-scale replication of the package will achieve the same degree of behavior change and whether such changes in behavior can be sustained for the long term.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank all the mothers, social leaders, teachers, female food hygiene motivators (FHMs), research assistants, project coordination committee members, local health institutions, and VDCs staffs for their involvement in this study.
