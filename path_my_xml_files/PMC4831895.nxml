Numerous investigations have demonstrated that playing Wii is moderate physical activity at best, but Move and Kinect have not been as thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare heart rate, oxygen consumption, and ventilation while playing the games <italic>Wii</italic> Boxing, <italic>Kinect</italic> Boxing, and <italic>Move</italic> Gladiatorial Combat. Heart rate, oxygen consumption, and ventilation were measured at rest and during a graded exercise test in 10 males and 9 females (19.8 &#x000b1; 0.33 y, 175.4 &#x000b1; 2.0 cm, 80.2 &#x000b1; 7.7 kg,). On another day, in a randomized order, the participants played <italic>Wii</italic> Boxing, K<italic>inect</italic> Boxing, and <italic>Move</italic> Gladiatorial Combat while heart rate, ventilation, and oxygen consumption were measured.

A hallmark of health promoting exercise is that it results in an increase in ventilation, heart rate, oxygen consumption, and thus energy expenditure (<xref rid="b2-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b13-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), so playing a physically active video game is being considered as a form of exercise. Playing a physically active video game may increase energy expenditure 2&#x02013;4 fold compared to a traditionally sedentary video game in children and adults (<xref rid="b10-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b16-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). There are a number of factors that can influence the magnitude of increase in energy expenditure above resting levels while playing physically active video games, such as the game playing experience of the person playing the game (<xref rid="b24-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the game being played (<xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>; <xref rid="b25-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and whether the game requires 1 hand or 2 hands or the whole body to control on-screen play (<xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; <xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). O&#x02019;Donovan reported that energy expenditure and heart rate are higher when playing against another person rather than against the game system (<xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), but McWha et al. (<xref rid="b18-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) observed no differences in heart rate, oxygen consumption, or energy expenditure when the game is played against another human or the computer opponent. Furthermore, the social setting in which the game is played can alter the interest in and level of exertion during active video game play (<xref rid="b22-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Thus, the level of physical activity elicited while playing a physically active video game can be influenced by a myriad of factors including (but not limited to) whether it is a one or two handed game, the experience level of the player, and the social setting of game play.</p><p>In November 2010, <italic>Sony</italic> introduced the <italic>Move</italic> system for the <italic>PlayStation</italic> 3 gaming system and <italic>Microsoft</italic> introduced the <italic>Kinect</italic> system for the <italic>XBOX</italic> gaming system. The <italic>Move</italic> system seems to be very similar to the <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic> in its use of motion sensitive controllers, only with greater sensitivity by incorporating a motion sensitive camera and glowing orbs on the ends of the handheld controller, allowing more precise control of the game play. The <italic>Kinect</italic> system uses no handheld controller; rather, it utilizes a camera system to capture a player&#x02019;s movement and then translates those movements onto the screen. The majority of research evaluating energy expenditure while playing physically active video games has focused on the <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic> game system (<xref rid="b10-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b16-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). There has been much less evaluation of energy expenditure during game play while using the <italic>Microsoft Kinect</italic> (<xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="b25-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and there seems to have been no evaluation of energy expenditure during game play while using the <italic>Sony Move</italic>. It was therefore hypothesized that due to the similarity of game play between <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic> and <italic>Sony Move</italic>, these gaming systems would elicit similar levels of physical activity. However, it was hypothesized that the lack of handheld controller by the <italic>Microsoft Kinect</italic> would provide for greater freedom of movement and higher levels of physical activity than <italic>Wii</italic> or <italic>Move</italic> (<xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Finally, based on previous observations from this laboratory (<xref rid="b18-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), it was hypothesized that a human or computer opponent would not alter the level of physical activity.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this research project was to assess the effects of playing similar games using the <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic>, <italic>Sony Move</italic>, and <italic>Microsoft Kinect</italic> on heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure when competing against a computer or human opponent in college aged adults. The resulting data for oxygen consumption were also used to compare playing <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic>, <italic>Sony Move</italic>, and <italic>Microsoft Kinect</italic> to guidelines for moderate intensity health promoting physical activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>In order to assess the effects of playing <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic>, <italic>Sony Move</italic>, and <italic>Microsoft Kinect</italic> on heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure when competing against a computer or human opponent in college aged adults, 19 college students were asked to participate in this study. Each participant was assessed for body composition for descriptive purposes, and was assessed for maximal aerobic (VO<sub>2</sub>max) capacity in order to determine the relative intensity of playing the active video games. On another day, each participant played hand to hand combat style games that required similar hand movements such as punching, thrusting, and blocking for 8 minutes using the <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic>, <italic>Sony Move</italic>, and <italic>Microsoft Kinect</italic> while heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure were measured using a metabolic cart. The order of game play was randomized with each participant playing in each of 6 conditions (<italic>Wii</italic> vs. human, <italic>Wii</italic> vs. computer, <italic>Move</italic> vs. human, <italic>Move</italic> vs. computer, <italic>Kinect</italic> vs. human, <italic>Kinect</italic> vs. computer). Data for heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure were analyzed using a three way (Gender X Opponent X Game) repeated measures ANOVA with a p value of 0.05 and a student Newman Keuls posthoc comparison. In order to determine if playing <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic>, <italic>Sony Move</italic>, or <italic>Microsoft Kinect</italic> could be considered to be health promoting physical activity, the guidelines that moderate intensity physical activity should induce heart rate and oxygen consumption equal to or greater than 50% of maximal, or should be 3 or more metabolic equivalents of task (METs) were used (<xref rid="b1-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>; <xref rid="b14-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Nineteen, apparently healthy male and female college students (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijes_07_01_22">Table 1</xref>), free from chronic disease or contraindications to exercise (as determined by a detailed written medical history), were recruited through word of mouth for this study. Participants were informed of the potential risks of this project and signed a document of informed consent prior to participation. This project was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Nebraska at Kearney.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol</title><p>For descriptive purposes, the participants were assessed for body composition. First, body mass was measured using a digital scale (PS 6600ST, Befour Inc, Saukville WI) and height was measured using a stadiometer (Model 707, Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Then body composition was measured using a Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA; DPX-IQ, Lunar Corp, Madison, WI). The participants were asked to wear comfortable clothing with minimal metal snaps, buttons, or zippers and to remove all jewelry to facilitate accurate measurement of body composition.</p><p>In order to measure the aerobic fitness of the participants, and also to facilitate the relative exercise value of physically active video game play, the participants were measured for maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max). The participants underwent a Bruce Ramp Protocol (<xref rid="b29-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) on a treadmill to measure VO<sub>2</sub>max. First, the participants put on a HR monitor (E600, Polar Electro, Oy, Finland) and then sat for 5 minutes in order to record resting HR. Participants were then connected to the metabolic cart (True One 2400, Parvomedics, Sandy, UT) using a facemask (NRB1, Hans Rudolph Inc., Kansas City, MO) and began by walking on the treadmill (425C, Trackmaster Treadmills, Newton, KS) at 1.7 mph with a 10% grade. The treadmill speed and grade gradually increased in small increments every 30 seconds so that every three minutes the speed had increased by 0.8 mph and the grade by 2%. Data for VO<sub>2</sub> and heart rate were measured continuously and then averaged over 20 second intervals by the Parvomedics software. The VO<sub>2</sub>max test was terminated when at least 2 of the following criteria were met: VO<sub>2</sub> or HR decreased or remained unchanged in response to increases in workload (as displayed at the end of each 20 second averaging interval), a respiratory exchange ratio value of 1.14 and/or a rating of perceived exertion of 20 was reached on the Borg 6&#x02013;20 rating of perceived exertion scale (<xref rid="b2-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). All fitness testing and game play occurred indoors under conditions that were as consistent as possible (21.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 Celsius, 63.9 &#x000b1; 4.7% humidity, and 702.4 &#x000b1; 2.0 mmHg). Temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure were measured (Fisherbrand Traceable Digital Barometer, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) before each session when the metabolic cart was calibrated.</p><p>The active video games used in the project were <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic> Sports Boxing (Wii), <italic>Microsoft Kinect</italic> Boxing (Kinect), and <italic>Sony PlayStation Move</italic> Gladiatorial Combat (Move). These games were selected because it has been observed that <italic>Wii</italic> Boxing elicits the highest level of energy expenditure of the non-dancing games (such as Wii Tennis or Wii Bowling) (<xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; <xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; <xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), so a hand to hand style combat game should result in the greatest exercise stimulus from all 3 gaming systems. However, at the time this project was initiated, no boxing game was available for the <italic>Move</italic> system but Gladiatorial Combat uses movements of both the hands and upper body to control swordplay (such as thrusting, dodging, blocking, and slicing) that are comparable to the hand and upper body movements (punching, dodging, and blocking) in the boxing games. On a separate day from the body composition and fitness testing, the subjects reported to the Human Performance Laboratory for the measurement of heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure to physically active video game play. This visit occurred at least 24 hours and not more than 14 days after the fitness assessment. Participants were in a seated position for 10 minutes before beginning game play while the researchers provided verbal instructions. When playing the video game, subjects played each game for eight minutes with the heart rate monitor and metabolic cart attached. The order of game play (human or computer opponent; Wii, Kinect, or Move) was randomized and each subject played each of the six possible combination for eight minutes with two minutes of rest between each game play condition. Eight minutes of game time was utilized as this should be sufficient time to obtain adequate measurements of the physiologic response to active video gaming, and also because previous investigations have reported that the light to moderate intensity physical activity of video game play does not seem to produce fatigue in participants when played in 8&#x02013;10 minute intervals even when multiple games are played sequentially (<xref rid="b18-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; <xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The randomization occurred by having the subject roll a six sided die and used the following table to assign the order of game play (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijes_07_01_22">Table 2</xref>). After each eight minute gaming session, the subject again rolled the die to determine the next gaming session, and the die was rolled again if a previously used condition was returned. The human opponent during those phases of testing was one of the researchers (K.S. or S.S.). Prior to engaging in game play the participants were given verbal instructions as well as on-screen demonstration on how to the play the games, how to use the controllers or move their body to control on-screen play, and the participants were also instructed to do their best. But the participants were not given information on specific gaming strategies. During the gaming trials some conversation between the researchers and the participants occurred to assure there were no unpleasant side effects occurring (e.g. headaches, nausea, or dizziness), but no verbal encouragement or &#x0201c;trash talking&#x0201d; occurred.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>After allowing for 3 minutes of game play in order for the participants to attain steady state, the average heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure for the final 5 minutes of each eight minute gaming session were used for statistical comparison.

However, the intensity level of while playing <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic> Boxing, <italic>XBOX Kinect</italic> Boxing, <italic>and Sony PlayStation Move</italic> Gladiatorial Combat does not meet established guidelines for health promoting exercise. These data further indicate that the presence (<italic>Wii</italic>, <italic>Move</italic>) or absence (<italic>Kinect</italic>) of a handheld motion sensitive controller does not alter the amount of physical activity required to play an &#x0201c;Exergame&#x0201d;, which contradicts the hypothesis that the presence or lack of a handheld controller influences the level of physical activity.

Although playing a video game may be mentally stimulating, previous investigations have demonstrated no difference in heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, or energy expenditure between resting conditions and playing a typical, sedentary style video game (<xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b17-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Similarly, playing an active video game that requires the use of 1 hand elicits less physical activity than playing a two handed game, which elicits less physical activity than playing a video game that requires whole body movement (<xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b17-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="b27-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In the present research, all of the games required the use of 2 hands to control on-screen game play, but no jumping, stepping, or other body movement were required. The lack of difference in heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure between <italic>Nintendo Wii</italic> Boxing, <italic>XBOX Kinect</italic> Boxing, <italic>and Sony PlayStation Move</italic> Gladiatorial Combat is noteworthy in that it suggests that the presence (<italic>Wii</italic>, <italic>Move</italic>) or absence (<italic>Kinect</italic>) of a handheld motion sensitive controller or the presence (<italic>Kinect</italic>, <italic>Move</italic>) or absence (<italic>Wii</italic>) of a motion capturing camera does not alter the amount of physical activity required to play a physically active video game. Instead, it seems as though whole body movement (such as in dancing or jumping games) or the number of hands being used (<xref rid="b10-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="b27-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) are the main determinants of energy expenditure while playing physically active video games.</p><p>Similar to McWha et al. (<xref rid="b18-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), the present research indicates that playing against a human or computer opponent does not alter the physiologic response to physically active video game play. However, O&#x02019;Donovan et al. (<xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) reported that playing against another person compared to single player mode during Wii Boxing mode increases the physical exertion while playing physically active video games. The overall levels of physical exertion reported by McWha et al. (<xref rid="b18-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), O&#x02019;Donovan et al. (<xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and the present investigation are all similar (VO<sub>2</sub> ~10&#x02013;12 ml/kg/min), so it does not seem that the overall level of physical activity induced by physically active video games was different between these investigations. However, the participants in the present investigation and in McWha et al. (<xref rid="b18-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) did not engage in &#x0201c;trash talking&#x0201d; when playing against a human opponent while more player interaction occurred in the research by O&#x02019;Donovan et al. (<xref rid="b20-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which may explain why measured physical exertion was observed to be higher in multi-player in the research by O&#x02019;Donovan et al. Taking all of these data together, it suggests that a human opponent may present a variable level of stimulation to physical activity based upon the relationship between the players and the extent of interpersonal competition (<xref rid="b8-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b24-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Generally speaking, health promoting moderate intensity physical activity (roughly equal to brisk walking) is that which causes notable increases in heart rate, breathing, and oxygen consumption (<xref rid="b14-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). More specific recommendations state that health promoting moderate intensity physical activity should induce heart rate and oxygen consumption equal to or greater than 50% of maximal, or should be 3 or more metabolic equivalents of task (METs) (<xref rid="b1-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b14-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although playing the physically active video games in the present research increased heart rate, oxygen consumption, ventilation, and energy expenditure, these physically active video games only elicited ~25% of VO<sub>2max</sub> or ~2.8 METs, which does not meet the minimal intensity for health promoting exercise (<xref rid="b1-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b14-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Miyachi et al. (<xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) used a metabolic chamber to evaluate the energy expenditure of participants while they played 68 different physically active video games, most of these using the Wii Fit balance board, and observed that only 1/3 of these activities elicited 3&#x02013;6 METs and the rest elicited less than 3 METs. Previous research has also indicated that while playing physically active video games requires more exertion than playing a sedentary video game (which is not different from resting), playing a physically active video game is unlikely to meet the criteria for health promoting moderate intensity physical activity (<xref rid="b11-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b17-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b27-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>One limitation to the present investigation is that the metabolic cart used was a traditional metabolic cart that requires the players to be &#x0201c;tethered&#x0201d; by a hose to stationary object. Thus, using a portable metabolic cart (e.g. Cosmed K4b<sup>2</sup>) or metabolic chamber might allow for greater freedom of movement while playing the video games, and thus elicit higher levels of physical activity. For instance the physical activity for <italic>Wii</italic> Boxing in the present investigation (~2.6 METs) is slightly lower than previously reported while playing <italic>Wii</italic> Boxing in a calorimetric chamber (~3 METs). Another limitation is that, although similar, boxing (<italic>Wii</italic> and <italic>Kinect</italic>) and Gladiatorial Combat (<italic>Move</italic>) are not the exact same sport, thus comparing boxing on the <italic>Wii</italic> and <italic>Move</italic> might have a different result. Unfortunately, at the time this project was initiated there was not a boxing game available for the <italic>Move</italic> game system.</p><p>Overall, there has been a considerable amount of research evaluating physically active video games and their effect on energy expenditure and physical activity levels (<xref rid="b11-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b17-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b27-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, to our knowledge there has not been much evaluation of the effects of physically active video gaming as a form of habitual exercise on measures of health and fitness, such as Owens et al. (<xref rid="b21-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). There also exist a wide number of video games that require whole body movement (e.g. <italic>Kinect Adventures</italic> Obstacle Course), which very likely elicit higher levels physical activity and could thus be more likely to promote health if played regularly.</p><p>The present results indicate that when using similar style 2 handed combat games, the gaming system used does not alter the amount of physical activity elicited by physically active video games. Also, playing against a human opponent with minimal interaction presents the same stimulus for physical activity as does a computer opponent. So, while playing physically active video games may be beneficial for rehabilitation from stroke (<xref rid="b5-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; <xref rid="b6-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and for assisting in the development of motor control for individuals with neuromuscular disorders (<xref rid="b9-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>; <xref rid="b26-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>; <xref rid="b30-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The use of physically active video games may also be beneficial as a starting point for an exercise program in those who have previously been engaged in little to no leisure time physical activity or as an alternative activity in physical education classrooms (<xref rid="b4-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>; <xref rid="b10-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>; <xref rid="b28-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, the present results, along with numerous previous investigations (<xref rid="b11-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>; <xref rid="b12-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; <xref rid="b17-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; <xref rid="b27-ijes_07_01_22" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) suggest that playing physically active video games are unlikely to be a suitable alternative to other forms of exercise when one is trying to meet the established criteria for engaging in moderate intensity health promoting exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This project was supported by the Undergraduate Research Fellows Program at the University of Nebraska at Kearney.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-ijes_07_01_22"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>American College of Sports Medicine Position Stand</collab><article-title>The recommended quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and flexibility in healthy adults</article-title><source>Med Sci Sports Exerc</source><volume>30</volume><fpage>975</fpage><lpage>991</lpage><year>1998</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9624661</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ijes_07_01_22"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><source>ACSM&#x02019;s Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription</source><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lippincott, Williams, &#x00026; Wilkins</publisher-name><year>2000</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ijes_07_01_22"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Achten</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeukendrup</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Heart rate monitoring: applications and limitations</article-title><source>Sports Med</source><volume>33</volume><fpage>517</fpage><lpage>538</lpage><year>2003</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12762827</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ijes_07_01_22"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Borja</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dance Video Games Hit the Floor in Schools</article-title><source>Education Week</source><volume>25</volume><fpage>1</fpage><year>2006</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-ijes_07_01_22"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Broeren</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Claesson</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Goude</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Rydmark</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sunnerhagen</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Virtual rehabilitation in an activity centre for community-dwelling persons with stroke.
