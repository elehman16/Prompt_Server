different support surfaces on the thickness of the musculus transversus abdominis and
lower extremity muscle activities. [Subjects] Thirty-five students of H University.
[Methods] The experimental group (n=18) performed bridging exercise on the sling support
surface, and the control group (n=17) performed bridging exercise on a general support
surface. [Results] Thickness changes in the musculus transversus abdominis were 0.35&#x02005;cm in
the experimental group, and 0.17&#x02005;cm in the control group, suggesting that the experimental
group showed a more significant change. For the lower extremity muscular activity, there
was a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group only in
the biceps femoris muscle. [Conclusion] Based on these results, we consider that bridging
exercise on a sling support surface would increase the thickness of the transversus
abdominis and lower extremity muscle activities in rehabilitation programs for patients
with back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bridging exercise</kwd><kwd>Sling exercise</kwd><kwd>Transversus abdominis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Back pain, the most common of musculoskeletal disorders, is a pain occurring in the waist
region between the second lumbar and the sacroiliac joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is known to be experienced by 50% of the population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and results in activity reduction because
of the pain and difficulty in social life, as well as economic problems requiring a certain
amount of time and cost<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The main causes of back pain include dynamic causes of waist structure and neighboring
tissues and non-specific causes due to degeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Back pain patients often show weakness of the trunk muscles and
lowering of proprioceptive sense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and have
problems with vertebral stability owing to weakness and injury of soft tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Vertebral stability is provided by the spinal column, muscles and tendon units surrounding
the vertebrae, and a control sub-system. The spinal column is composed of a passive system
of the vertebral ligaments, vertebrae, and intervertebral discs, and an active system of
muscle and tendon units that provide vertebral stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. When these systems and the control sub-system move cooperatively,
vertebral stability is improved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscles surrounding the vertebrae are divided into global muscles and local muscles
according to their roles. The global muscles are involved in large motions, and the local
muscles are responsible for stability in each spinal segment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that people with back pain have shortened
contraction times and poorer recruitment of the transverse abdominis and multifidus, which
are deep local muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The functions
of these muscles are not automatically restored even after recovery of normal function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional damage and weakening of the
transverse abdominis and multifidus cause back pain, and the transverse abdominis plays an
important role in vertebral stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Trunk stability exercise is an intervention for vertebral stability, which is performed to
protect the vertebrae from repetitive damage, mitigate pain, and reduce degenerative
deformation that might have developed in the vertebrae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Special exercises for trunk stability help back pain patients
retain normal structure of the lumbar segments, provide stability, reduce pain, and improve
function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Bridging exercise, a closed chain weight-bearing exercise, is an exercise which increases
muscular strength of the hip extensor and promotes trunk stability. It is often prescribed
for patients with back pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
increases the activities of trunk stabilization muscles such as the internal oblique,
external oblique, and erector spinae muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the trunk stabilization exercises, a stabilization exercise under a dynamic condition
using a sling is known to have greater effect than a stabilization exercise under a static
condition. It improves sense of balance and balance maintenance ability by stimulating
proprioceptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise on an
unstable support surface elicits greater muscle activity than exercise on a stable support
surface, and improves dynamic balance, promotes vertebral stability, and prevents vertebral
injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that
stabilization exercise on an unstable support surface increases activity and coordination of
the ventral muscles, and that the bridging exercise on an unstable support surface causes
alteration of the internal oblique and rectus abdominis muscles.</p><p>Although there have been many studies of stabilization exercises on unstable support
surfaces, few have compared the effects of different support surfaces.</p><p>In this study, we investigated and compared the effects of bridging exercise on different
support surfaces on the thickness of the transverse abdominis and on lower extremity muscle
activity, to present empirical data for a therapeutic intervention for chronic low back pain
(CLBP), an ailment of the musculoskeletal system. CLBP involves pain in the thoracic
vertebra 10 to the lumbar region that continues for more than three days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Its annual prevalence rate is 4 to 7%, and
its lifetime prevalence rate is 59%. The prevalence rate for acute, subacute, and chronic
patients is 50 to 53%, 21%, and 26%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>,
respectively. Although CLBP patients recover within six to twelve weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, 60 to 80% undergo recurrence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Major factors that trigger low back pain include obesity, decrease in spinal mobility,
increase in lumbar lordosis, tension in the hamstring muscle, weakening of the abdominal
muscles, imbalance in trunk muscle strength, and differences in the lengths of the legs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low back pain is characterized by
instability of the lumbar vertebrae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>,
which triggers problems in postural maintenance and trunk stability, causing functional
problems for the body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The instability of CLBP patients may be reduced by muscular adjustment through
exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and selective exercise of
the transversus abdominis (TrA), lumbar multifidus muscle, pelvic floor muscle, and
diaphragm muscle, which all engage in stabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, spinal stabilization exercises increase the
contraction capacity of the TrA and lumbar multifidus muscles, alleviate pain, and improve
function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stabilization exercises based
on the abdominal drawing-in maneuver are widely used to contract the TrA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This method retrains the deep muscles using
isometric contractions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, minimal
contractions of the large muscles, and selective contraction of the TrA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It increases
tension in the lumbar and thoracic fasciae, stabilizing the lumbar spine and the pelvis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study examined the effects of lumbar stabilization exercises for patients with CLBP on
functional disability, activation capacity, as well as the thickness of TrA, a trunk
stabilization muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were 35 students of H University located in Chuncheon. They were divided
into an experimental group (9 males and 9 females) and a control group (8 males and 9
females). In the test group, the mean &#x000b1; SD age was 23.67 &#x000b1; 2.00, height was 167.78 &#x000b1; 8.43
cm, and weight was 60.78 &#x000b1; 13.96 kg. In the control group, the mean &#x000b1; SD age was 23.18 &#x000b1;
2.46, height was 168.77 &#x000b1; 9.26 cm, and weight was 66.59 &#x000b1; 12.39 kg. The experimental group
conducted a bridging exercise on a sling support surface, and the control group conducted
a bridging exercise on a fixed support surface. Those who experienced any back pain within
the last 6 months or had any musculoskeletal problem, spinal deformity, orthopedic or
neurological disease, or functional limitations of the extremities were excluded. The
subjects were provided with information about this study, and signed an informed consent
form indicating their voluntary participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects widened their knees and both feet to shoulder width in the supine position,
crossed their arms and placed both their hands on their chests, and flexed their knees to
60&#x000b0;. In the bridging exercise on the sling (Redcord Workstation, Redcord AS, Norway)
support surface, subjects put both feet on the strap of the sling and raised their bottoms
to a height where the shoulder, the pelvis, and the knee made a straight line, by pressing
against the strap. In the bridging exercise on the fixed support surface, subjects raised
their bottoms to a height where the shoulder, the pelvis, and the knee made a straight
line, by pressing against the floor with both feet. These bridging exercise were performed
while keeping the pelvis in the neutral position with the abdominal drawing-in maneuver,
by drawing the navel upward and rearward, pulling the abdomen inward as in expiration,
prior to the bridging exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. For
the bridging exercise, 2&#x02013;4 sets were measured and recorded, with one set defined as 5
repetitions with 5 seconds maintenance. Whenever a subject developed any pain, the test
was stopped immediately.</p><p>An Ultrasound Scanner (SONOACE X4, Medison Corp., Korea) linear array probe was used to
measure thickness changes in the transverse abdominis. In order to scan the same region of
the subjects, the guide was placed in the transverse and vertical direction and adjusted
until the lateral abdominis appeared, and the abdominal anterior lateral edge between the
right iliac crest and the inferior angle of the 11th rib was maked<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The depth was adjusted until the muscle layers
accounted for 40&#x02013;50% of the ultrasound imaging screen, and radiologists measured the
thickness at the end of expiration to minimize the effects of the respiration cycle on the
thickness. The thickness was measured at a point 2.5&#x02005;cm from the lateral edge of the
medial edge of the V shape on the screen.</p><p>For measurement of muscle activity, surface EMG (LXM3204, Laxtha Inc., Korea) was used.
Body hair and horny substances were removed, and the skin was rubbed with alcohol to
reduce skin impedance. Ag/AgCl circular electrodes about 1&#x02005;cm of diameter, were used with
an inter-electrode distance of 2&#x02005;cm. For the gluteus maximus (GM), (the electrodes were
placed halfway between the sacrum and greater trochanter. For the gluteus medius (Gm),
(the electrodes were placed halfway between the iliac crest and greater trochanter). For
the biceps femoris (BF), (the electrodes were placed halfway between the ischial
tuberosity and caput fibulae)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
reference electrode was attached on the spinous process of 7th cervical vertebrae. Data
were sampled at 1,024&#x02005;Hz and bandpass filtered between 13&#x02013;480&#x02005;Hz (&#x02212;3dB response). The
muscle activities of GM, Gm and BF of each group were normalized to %MVIC.</p><p>SPSS for Windows (version 18.0) was used for statistical analysis. Subjects'
characteristics and homogeneity were tested using the independent t-test. Transverse
abdominis thicknesses and muscle activities were compared between the experimental and
control group, and between before and after the bridging exercise using the paired t-test.
For comparison between the groups, the independent t-test was used. The statistical
significance level was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Comparison of TrA within groups and between groups (n=35)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group (n=18)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=17)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">TrA (cm)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pre</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.35 &#x000b1; 0.09</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.36 &#x000b1; 0.13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">post</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.70 &#x000b1; 0.24*</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.52 &#x000b1; 0.16*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">change</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.35 &#x000b1; 0.21<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.17 &#x000b1; 0.14</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* p&#x0003c;0.05, Mean &#x000b1; SD.

exercise for patients with back pain by identifying thickness changes and muscle activities
induced by performing bridging exercise on different support surfaces.</p><p>The bridging exercise is an exercise which controls weight load by pressing the feet
against a support surface, which plays a role in controlling body balance and power to
maintain the position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is performed
to promote coordinated contraction of global muscles and local muscles in a position in
which patients with back pain feel comfortable and less painful<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, and to increase the muscle power of hip extensor group,
and it can restore trunk stabilization ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In trunk stabilization exercises, a dynamic stabilization exercise
on an unstable support surface is more effective, because it stimulates the motor regions of
the brain, sense of balance, and balance maintaining ability, by stimulating proprioceptors
more than a static stabilization exercise on a stable support surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Teyhen et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that LBP
patients had 20.9% reduced thickness of the transverse abdominis compared to healthy people,
and that the drawing-in maneuver should be included as exercise for control of the
transversus abdominis. However, Beazell et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the thickness of the transverse abdominis of back
pain patients was 0.58&#x02005;cm on the symptomic side in rest and 0.82&#x02005;cm in contraction, and in
healthy subjects it was 0.56&#x02005;cm on the right and 0.59&#x02005;cm on the left in rest and 0.79&#x02005;cm on
the right and 0.81&#x02005;cm on the left in contraction, with no significant differences between
the two groups of subjects.</p><p>Vera-Garcia et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that
exercise on an unstable support surface further enhanced changes in the motor control
system, increased the muscle activity, contraction speed, and strength of spinal
stabilization, and improved the harmony of neuromuscular reflexs reactions more than
exercise on a stable support surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Guthrie et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the contraction
ratio of the transverse abdominis in sling bridging exercise and general bridging exercise.
The ratio in the sling bridging exercise group was 1.61 in rest and 1.58 in contraction, and
in the general exercise group it was 1.55 in rest and 1.65 in contraction, indicating the
general bridging exercise induced greater contraction of the transverse abdominis. Vasseljen
et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the muscular thickness
and ratio of the transverse abdominis after exercise with a sling for 8 weeks. The ratio of
the experimental group which performed exercise with a sling was 1.76 before exercise and
2.00 after exercise, and the group performing general exercise had a ratio of 1.80 before
exercise and 1.81 after exercise, indicating the ratio of the transverse abdominis was
greater after intervention with the sling, and the sling exercise increased the thickness of
the transverse abdominis more than the general exercise.</p><p>Saliba et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a bridging
exercise group using a sling as the support surface showed greater changes in the
transversus abdominis thickness than a bridging exercise group using the floor as the
support surface. In the present study, we found that the transversus abdominis thicknesses
of the bridging exercise group using the sling as the support surface and the bridging
exercise group using the fixed support surface were, respectively, 0.35&#x02005;cm and 0.36&#x02005;cm in
rest and 0.70&#x02005;cm and 0.52&#x02005;cm in contraction, indicating that the bridging exercise using the
sling support surface increased the thickness of the transverse abdominis more. We consider
that the thickness difference from those of previous studies was a result of differences in
posture. We also consider that the reason for the difference in the thickness of transverse
abdominis was that the unstable support surface, the sling, provided a dynamic environment,
so the number of myofibrils involved in motor control increased, and the increase of
contractibility resulted in an increase in the transverse abdominis thickness.</p><p>Kang et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup> reported in a study
comparing trunk muscle activities of bridging exercises, that a bridging exercise with a
sling induced higher %MVIC of the trunk muscles than bridging exercises with a ball and
general bridging exercise. In the present study, we found that the gluteus maximus muscle
showed 25.9%MVIC in the experimental group and 25.4%MVIC in the control group; the gluteus
medius muscle showed 27.8%MVIC in the experimental group and 30.1%MVIC in the control group;
and the biceps femoris muscle showed 61.6%MVIC in the experimental group and 30.9%MVIC in
the control group. We consider that in the bridging exercise on the unstable support
surface, the knee flexor and hip adductor muscle were used more to prevent hip abduction in
order to maintain balance and alignment, so the activity of the hip abductors was lower and
the activity of knee flexors was higher than in the general bridging exercise.</p><p>Accordingly, we consider that the bridging exercise on the support surface using a sling,
as a part of stabilization exercise program for patients with back pain, would be more
effective at improving activity of the transversus abdominis and lower extremity muscles,
and should be recommended for muscle retraining and muscular function improvement. A future
study will be needed to compare the effectiveness of long term exercise performance and the
activities of several lower extremity muscles with more subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Diagnosis and management of low back pain and
