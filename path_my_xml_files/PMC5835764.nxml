Scarce evidence exists for effectiveness of interventions to reduce self-harm.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial of family therapy versus treatment as usual was done at 40 UK Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) centres. We recruited young people aged 11&#x02013;17 years who had self-harmed at least twice and presented to CAMHS after self-harm. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive manualised family therapy delivered by trained and supervised family therapists or treatment as usual by local CAMHS. Participants and therapists were aware of treatment allocation; researchers were masked. The primary outcome was hospital attendance for repetition of self-harm in the 18 months after group assignment. Primary and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN59793150.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Nov 23, 2009, and Dec 31, 2013, 3554 young people were screened and 832 eligible young people consented to participation and were randomly assigned to receive family therapy (n=415) or treatment as usual (n=417). Primary outcome data were available for 795 (96%) participants. Numbers of hospital attendances for repeat self-harm events were not significantly different between the groups (118 [28%] in the family therapy group <italic>vs</italic> 103 [25%] in the treatment as usual group; hazard ratio 1&#x000b7;14 [95% CI 0&#x000b7;87&#x02013;1&#x000b7;49] p=0&#x000b7;33). Similar numbers of adverse events occurred in both groups (787 in the family therapy group <italic>vs</italic> 847 in the treatment as usual group).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>For adolescents referred to CAMHS after self-harm, having self-harmed at least once before, our family therapy intervention conferred no benefits over treatment as usual in reducing subsequent hospital attendance for self-harm.

This addition has been done in previous studies of child health,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> but is not part of the NICE reference case and assumes interdependence between utilities (the health state) of the adolescent and caregiver.</p><p id="para520">Our study sample had baseline levels of difficulty at least as severe as the average CAMHS referral.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The proportion of female participants recruited and the mix of referrals from hospital and community sources are similar to those seen in other studies.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The treatments given in the treatment as usual group were highly varied, which can be expected from a pragmatic trial, but broadly similar to CAMHS practice in the UK with a mixture of supportive or individual counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, and family work;<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> however, the proportion of patients who received formal family therapy for self-harm (87 [21%] of 417) was much higher than we were expecting. Those in the treatment as usual group who received a version of family therapy did not, however, have significantly better primary outcome results than either those in the family therapy group or those in treatment as usual who only received other interventions.</p><p id="para530">Although we report almost complete data for the primary outcome, loss to follow-up resulted in partial data from 478 (57%) of 832 participants for self-reported self-harm at 18 months. Strenuous efforts were made by the research team to track participants via clinic and general practitioner records, and by use of letters, emails, telephone calls, and text messages. More frequent follow-up might have maintained engagement with participants and improved follow-up but would have substantially added to the cost of the project and was not feasible while retaining an 18-month primary outcome. From the self-report data, many self-harm events did not lead to hospital attendance (the primary outcome), with 349 (73%) of 478 self-reporting self-harm; however, the self-reported results were similar between groups, and in line with the primary outcome finding that was based on hospital records. For other secondary outcomes, young people and their caregivers in the family therapy group reported significantly better outcomes on several elements of general emotional and behavioural difficulties (SDQ), suggesting family therapy had a significant positive effect on general mental health, even if this did not translate into reduced repetition of self-harm. Self-reported suicide ideation scores were lower in the family therapy group than in the treatment as usual group at 12 months but not at 18 months, consistent with other family therapy research.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> It might be argued that reducing suicidal ideation sooner is a potentially important clinical benefit. Furthermore, those lost to follow-up in the treatment as usual group seemed to have had less favourable baseline characteristics (eg, depression), meaning that the participants in this group who returned data might have been a less impaired group than those who returned data in the family therapy group. This factor makes comparison between the groups unreliable and might mask any advantages gained by the family therapy group.</p><p id="para540">In our trial, families who reported poorer family functioning scores in relation to affective involvement benefitted more from family therapy (<italic>vs</italic> treatment as usual) than those with better scores; whereas previous studies have suggested that the families with good functioning benefit most from family therapy.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> The finding that adolescents who find communication about feelings difficult might do less well in a family intervention, where such expression is encouraged, is in line with the literature. These two findings together suggest an association between adolescent and family functioning, and ability to talk about feelings, that is more complex than previously reported. Harrington and colleagues' study<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> of a home-based intervention for self-harm found moderation by depression, with family therapy reducing suicidal ideation in the absence of depression in the young person.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Families with high levels of criticism tend to drop out of family therapy for eating disorders and do worse in conjoint family therapy than when parents and adolescents are seen in parallel.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p><p id="para550">Our study differs from other trials of interventions to reduce self-harm in its substantially larger sample size, long follow-up, and use of an objectively measured primary outcome (hospital attendance) that traced 96% of participants. For example, three other studies have reported positive outcomes for self-harm reduction following dialectical behaviour therapy (n=77),<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> mentalisation-based treatment (n=80),<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> and family psychoeducation (n=48),<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> but all recruited far fewer participants than our study, and their primary outcomes used retrospective self-report questionnaires and interview measures&#x02014;with potential for reporting biases. The most rigorous other published study, the ASSIST trial of routine care plus group therapy,<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> assigned 366 young people and used masked-researcher-rated structured interview techniques to elicit the frequency of self-harm events, with good follow-up attendance. ASSIST also found no significant clinical or cost benefits for its primary outcome of frequency of repetition of self-harm.</p><p id="para560">Most young people in our trial (594 [71%] of 832) had self-injured for their index episode rather than self-poisoned (184 [22%]), differing markedly from the 17% in a monitoring study in three English cities of 5200 consecutive hospital attendances for self-harm in people younger than 18 years;<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> the discrepancy is explained by the high proportion of trial participants recruited from community referrals in our study. Participants in our trial must have self-harmed at least twice, complicating comparison with other studies because previous self-harm is not always reported consistently. SASII ratings suggested that 516 (62%) of 832 patients' index events would be classified as non-suicidal self-injury but 412 (50%) of participants were rated by the researcher as having some intent to die; we deem the UK definition of self-harm, which disregards motive, to be justified because of ambiguity and difficulty interpreting statements of intent. The fact that the method used for the primary self-harm outcome event was often different from that for the index event (more than half of participants who self-poisoned at repetition had self-injured at their index episode) further challenges any assumption of non-suicidality in young people who self-injure.</p><p id="para570">The SHIFT version of family therapy placed great emphasis on families discussing self-harm and formulating strategies to deal with subsequent events&#x02014;often involving the seeking of help from external agencies. Therefore, the intervention itself might have differentially increased presentation to hospital for self-harm and as a result, confounded results. However, the large proportion of missing self-reported data makes it difficult to test this hypothesis in this trial. The pragmatic design of this trial also conferred a potential advantage on treatment as usual because experienced CAMHS clinicians in the treatment as usual group had flexibility in selecting treatments on the basis of clinical assessment and discussions with the young person and family about preferred treatment strategies.</p><p id="para580">The substantial loss to follow-up markedly limited the interpretation of secondary participant-reported questionnaire outcomes and health economic analyses. The large proportion of missing data, imputed through multiple imputation, increases the variability in secondary outcomes, limiting inferences where non-significant differences were detected. Analysis relies on the missing at random assumption, with missingness fully explained through observed data; covariates and treatment were therefore included in our imputation model to support this as a plausible assumption.</p><p id="para590">The low intensity of treatment given in our family therapy intervention could have reduced the chance of finding a positive effect of family therapy. The average number of sessions in UK CAMHS clinics<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> is low relative to those in some studies of psychological inteventions, but we received a strong clinical message from collaborating sites that participants who had self-harmed were difficult to engage in treatment and would not adhere to a longer and more intensive intervention than that which was delivered in our study. Because this was a pragmatic trial, we designed an intervention that would be broadly equivalent in the number of sessions to those in the treatment as usual and likely, if successful, to be funded by the UK health-care system. No a priori evidence exists for an advantage of longer duration of therapy. In practice, participants in the family therapy and treatment as usual groups did receive broadly similar numbers of sessions. A more intensive intervention might have been more successful but might also have led to concerns that positive findings were as a result of the intensity of the intervention rather than the intervention itself. The same arguments might apply to the ASSIST trial in which the mean number of sessions attended for the core intervention was 10&#x000b7;2 (<italic>vs</italic> a median of six sessions in our study).<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref></p><p id="para600">The SHIFT trial shows that this version of family therapy did not confer extra benefits in reducing the risk of hospital attendance after further self-harm. The trial participants were a high-risk group, having self-harmed at least twice, and comparisons cannot be drawn with those presenting for the first time after self-harm. Some evidence supports the increased effectiveness of family therapy versus treatment as usual in reducing self-harm in cases in which caregivers report poor family functioning, or young people report ease in discussing emotions. Conversely, when young people report difficulty in expressing emotion, or families report healthy functioning, other interventions or modifications of family therapy might be indicated.</p><p id="para610">The findings might not be generalisable to the subset of adolescents who present to hospital in the UK after a first episode of self-harm. However, this trial does confirm that young people are likely to switch methods in subsequent episodes of self-harm and that the method of self-harm might not be a useful indicator of suicidal intent or risk. The trial provides some evidence that family therapy has a positive effect on general emotional and behavioural problems and might reduce suicidal ideation faster than treatment as usual, albeit based on self-report measures with substantial amounts of missing data. Young people who self-harm form a varied and heterogeneous group with self-harm likely to be the final common pathway for a wide range of predicaments. Future research needs to explore the characteristics of specific subgroups within the self-harming population. Possible candidate groups arising from this research would be families who self-report poorer family functioning, young people who are more unemotional, and those referred to CAMHS directly from the hospital rather than from the community. Further analysis of the effect modifiers in SHIFT might have a useful explanatory or theoretical function and help develop effective interventions. Longer follow-up studies are needed and the possibility that family therapy might have had benefits beyond that of the participant deserves further exploration, including how health economic benefits might be aggregated for family members.</p><p id="para620"><boxed-text id="cetextbox20"><p id="para630">For the <bold>SHIFT protocol</bold> see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
