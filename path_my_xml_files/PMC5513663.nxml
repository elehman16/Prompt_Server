These high-stakes programs typically use patient experience measures derived from standardized tools such as the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys (<xref rid="bibr2-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). At the same time, there is growing interest in using patient narratives along with survey scores to help clinicians understand what they can do to improve care and inform patients about differences in the care delivered by available providers (<xref rid="bibr3-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="bibr4-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr"/>

In fact, a recent survey of outpatient health-care providers found that over 40% of providers reported using narrative comments as a basis for implementing measures to improve care (<xref rid="bibr8-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Interest in narratives as a means of conveying information about patient experience raises 3 important questions about the relationship between patient narratives and scores from standardized closed-ended surveys. First, given the added cost of collecting, analyzing, and reporting narratives, how much value do narratives add to our understanding of how patients evaluate their health-care providers beyond information gathered by closed-ended survey questions? On one hand, the content of patient narratives may overlap with standardized surveys to such a degree that narratives provide little additional information. On the other hand, these surveys may omit aspects of patient experience that are expressed in narrative accounts. Consistent with this notion, a recent study of online narrative hospital reviews found that over half of such reviews mention aspects of care that are not reflected in the CAHPS Hospital Survey (HCAHPS; <xref rid="bibr9-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and a separate study found that the comments written by patients responding to the HCAHPS survey help to predict overall hospital ratings beyond the numerical scores derived from closed-ended questions (<xref rid="bibr10-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It is unclear whether these findings apply outside of inpatient settings.</p><p>Second, do narratives have differential value for representing the experiences of patients who have had relatively more complex interactions with the health-care system compared with healthier patients? For example, sicker patients are likely to have more complicated and frequent encounters with health-care providers than patients who are healthy. Reducing these experiences to a single response on a closed-ended scale may obscure nuanced interactions that have both positive and negative aspects (<xref rid="bibr7-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Third, does adding a narrative elicitation protocol into a patient survey (such as CAHPS) influence the information derived from either the narratives or the closed-ended responses? There are logistical benefits to embedding a narrative elicitation protocol within extant surveys, including a ready-made sampling frame and the ability to link narratives to quantitative metrics. However, it might be necessary to decouple the 2 if placing open-ended questions at the end of a standardized patient survey results in patients discussing fewer topics or providing narratives that are less detailed or engaging. In contrast, asking patients to articulate their experiences in narrative form prior to answering closed-ended questions about that experience may encourage patients to think deeply about their experiences with their providers but could also influence their responses on subsequent closed-ended scales.</p><p>This article presents findings from an experimental study aimed at developing and testing a protocol for rigorously eliciting patient narratives in the context of the CAHPS Clinician and Group (CG-CAHPS) survey. We report our findings related to the development and performance of the elicitation protocol elsewhere (<xref rid="bibr11-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Our focus here is on the implications of including this protocol in a CAHPS survey. In sum, we address the following 3 questions:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To what extent does the evaluative information in patient narratives account for variation in patients&#x02019; global ratings of their provider beyond the information derived from closed-ended CAHPS survey responses?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does this explanatory potential differ for sicker versus healthier patients?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are patients&#x02019; answers to closed- and open-ended questions affected by the relative placement of these questions in an integrated survey?</p></list-item></list></p><p>These are not the only ways in which narratives could have value or could influence other forms of feedback regarding patient experience; however, these 3 foci are crucial areas for investigation, given the expanding use of CAHPS survey results in public reports on health-care system performance and in provider payment arrangements, many of which are closely tied to the global rating score.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2374373516685940"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2374373516685940" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Data were collected from 332 members of a standing Internet panel (the &#x0201c;Knowledge Panel&#x0201d;) of over 60 000 households recruited and maintained by the research firm GfK, which is representative of the American population in terms of its demographics and health status (<xref rid="bibr13-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A random sample of panelists was invited to participate; those who agreed (59.5%) were screened to ensure that they had some contact with a health-care provider in the past year. To investigate whether the association between patient narratives and responses to closed-ended CAHPS questions differed between patients with simple versus more complex health-care experiences, we used stratified random sampling to recruit approximately equal numbers of participants who (a) reported having a &#x0201c;serious or life-threatening&#x0201d; health event in the past year (n = 90), (b) reported having a chronic health problem that required regular medical monitoring (n = 121), and (c) had neither of these types of health problems in the past year (n = 113).</p></sec><sec id="section3-2374373516685940"><title>Study Design and Procedures</title><p>Within each health stratum, participants were randomly assigned to complete a version of the CG-CAHPS survey that was either preceded or followed by a series of 5 open-ended questions designed to elicit a narrative account of patients&#x02019; experiences with the provider they saw the most over the past year. Eighty percent of the surveys were completed online and 20% by phone. Data collection occurred from May 2014 to June 2014. All procedures were approved by the institutional review boards at RAND, Yale University, and the University of Wisconsin&#x02013;Madison.

This 5-question protocol has been shown to yield coherent narratives that accurately represent the balance of positive and negative experiences that patients have with their health-care providers and capture with reasonable fidelity the depth and nuances of patients&#x02019; experiences (<xref rid="bibr11-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).

Two independent coders determined the number of positive and negative statements pertaining to 10 aspects of care that were identified via both inductive and deductive analytic approaches to the qualitative data (<xref rid="bibr12-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)&#x02014;provider communication, time spent during office visits, access to care, office staff, emotional rapport between the provider and the patient, perceived thoroughness of the provider, perceived technical competence of the provider, shared decision-making, provider practice style, and care coordination. We calculated the percentage of patients who mentioned each aspect of care and who mentioned anything negative about each aspect. For each aspect of care, we also quantified the extent to which a patient&#x02019;s narrative conveyed negative experiences with care by dividing the number of lines in the narrative that conveyed negative experiences about a given aspect of care by the total number of lines in the narrative that pertained to that aspect of care. Our focus on negative experiences is consistent with prior research showing that patients&#x02019; overall evaluations of their health care are more strongly based on negative aspects of care than on positive aspects (<xref rid="bibr10-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The coders also assessed the scope, salience, evaluative balance, and coherence of each narrative. Scope was quantified as the proportion of the 10 aspects of care mentioned in the narrative. Narrative length was the total number of lines of transcribed text. Evaluative balance was the number of lines in the narrative that conveyed a positive assessment of the provider divided by the number of lines that conveyed a negative assessment. Overall coherence of the narrative was assessed by coding and then averaging 5 facets of coherence identified in the literature on narratives related to health&#x02014;statement of expectations for care, emotional expressivity, substantive expressivity, completeness of storyline, and the extent to which the narrative conveys a clear chronology (<xref rid="bibr15-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Each of these facets was assessed on a 0 to 3 scale, with higher numbers indicative of greater coherence (<xref rid="bibr12-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>To ensure interrater reliability in the use of the coding scheme, all narratives were coded by both coders; disagreements were resolved through discussion. Interrater reliability, calculated using Cohen&#x02019;s kappa, ranged from 0.65 to 0.79, meeting conventional standards of acceptable reliability (<xref rid="bibr16-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section7-2374373516685940"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We estimated a series of multiple linear regression models to investigate the predictive utility of evaluative information contained in patient narratives. In model 1, we predicted the global provider rating using only the 3 CAHPS composite measures. In model 2, we predicted the global rating solely from the indicators derived from the narratives. In model 3, we combined CAHPS and narrative measures to predict the global rating. We tested each model separately among healthier and sicker patients (ie, those who had a recent serious or ongoing chronic illness), calculated the percentage of variation in the global provider rating explained by each model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>), and tested the statistical significance of changes in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> across models.</p><p>Next, we conducted a series of <italic>t</italic> tests to assess the effect of the placement of the narrative elicitation protocol in the survey on the content and other qualities of the narratives.

Open-ended narratives can be a rich source of information about the particular experiences on which patients base their ratings of their health-care providers. Our findings demonstrate that it is feasible to incorporate protocols for eliciting patient narratives into large-scale patient surveys with minimal distortion of the feedback from either the open- or closed-ended responses.</p><p>Our findings also demonstrate that narratives&#x02014;particularly those of patients with more complex interactions with the health-care system&#x02014;help to explain variation in the ratings that patients assign clinicians. The difference in the predictive utility of narratives for sicker and healthier patients is not explained by differences in how often or extensively these participants discussed particular aspects of care but by how important those aspects were in shaping their evaluations of their providers. Although we tested only for differences between healthier and sicker patients, it seems likely that narratives will have greater predictive power for other types of respondents who may be considered medically complex and thus require ongoing care from multiple providers, including those with multiple comorbidities, cognitive and mental health issues, and problems with substance abuse (<xref rid="bibr19-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

This is noteworthy given that these topics are not covered by the CAHPS survey. Although patients&#x02019; perspectives on whether care is appropriately thorough may differ from clinical standards or similar assessments by other professionals, it is clearly an aspect of care that is salient to them and that underlies their evaluation of their providers. As perceptions of provider thoroughness are likely to have a basis in concrete features of the patient&#x02013;provider interaction, it would be worthwhile to understand what patients are cueing in on to make judgments about thoroughness so that particular provider behaviors or patient expectations can be addressed if necessary.</p><p>Although these findings can be used to support the case for collecting patient narratives more systematically, measuring the statistical influence of narratives on global provider ratings is just one way of assessing the value of narratives for explaining the nuances of patient experience. The tests used here reduce a large amount of rich detail and nuance to a set of numerical indicators, ignoring much of the information in the verbatim narratives. Moreover, the CAHPS global provider rating is a relatively limited metric for assessing the quality of patient&#x02013;physician interactions, albeit one that is often heavily weighted in provider compensation arrangements.</p><p>These findings also need to be considered in light of certain methodological limitations of the study. Although the elicitations were drawn from an Internet panel that is sociodemographically representative of the overall population, our sample size was relatively small, making it infeasible to examine whether narratives are more or less important for various subsets of patients. Moreover, the responses to the elicitation questions were given by respondents who knew that their commentary would be kept confidential. Were these same questions asked of patients whose answers would be reported back to clinicians or incorporated into public websites, the content of the responses might differ (though it is not clear whether it would be enriched or impoverished).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section15-2374373516685940"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It has been argued that patient narratives may improve health-care quality beyond what standardized survey scores can accomplish by better informing consumer choice and enhancing clinicians&#x02019; understanding of health-care interactions that patients consider to be problematic (<xref rid="bibr7-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2374373516685940" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Our results demonstrate that a rigorously designed protocol for eliciting patient narratives can be incorporated into patient experience surveys with minimal distortion of patient feedback and that the information contained in the narratives offered by sicker patients is useful for understanding variation in provider ratings beyond the information derived from closed-ended CAHPS questions. Because patients with more serious and complex conditions arguably represent the most challenging test of any health-care system, better understanding their experiences seems an essential prerequisite for improving health system performance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2374373516685940"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-2374373516685940"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by 2 cooperative agreements (2U18HS016980 and 1U18HS016978) from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to RAND and Yale University, respectively, and by a grant (1R21HS021858) from AHRQ to Yale University.</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d35e118"><title>Author Biographies</title><p><bold>Steven C Martino</bold> is a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation.
