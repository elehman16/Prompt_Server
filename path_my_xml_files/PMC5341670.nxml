Younger age, gynecological surgeries, laparoscopic surgeries, female gender, volatile anesthetics, increased duration of anesthesia, and postoperative opioid use are associated with increased incidence of PONV.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aim:</title><p>The present study was conducted to study the efficacy of ramosetron and its comparison with ondansetron in the prevention of PONV in patients undergoing pyelolithotomy, pyeloplasty, and upper ureterolithotomy.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred patients with physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II, aged 20&#x02013;60 years were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly distributed to receive either injection ramosetron 0.3 mg intravenously (IV) or injection ondansetron 6 mg IV just before extubation.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>There was no significant difference between the groups in age, gender, weight, duration of anesthesia, and duration of surgery. In the patients, who received ramosetron, it was observed that incidence of the episodes of nausea and vomiting increased with time after surgery. Each patient had an episode of nausea and an episode of vomiting during the 6&#x02013;12 h interval. Similarly, two patients had episodes of nausea and two patients had episodes of vomiting at 18&#x02013;24 h. This necessitated the increased need for rescue antiemetics with a total of four patients needing rescue antiemetics at 18&#x02013;24 h. In patients receiving ondansetron, the episodes of nausea were more in number when compared with the ramosetron group. Twelve patients complained of nausea and thirteen patients had episodes of vomiting with the needfor rescue antiemetic in 14 patients. Both genders had a comparable incidence of nausea and vomiting.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>A single dose of IV ramosetron (0.3 mg) is more effective when compared with a single dose IV ondansetron (6 mg) in the prevention of PONV.

One hundred patients with physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II, aged 20&#x02013;60 years, undergoing elective urological procedures including pyelolithotomy, pyeloplasty, and upper ureter lithotomy, under general anesthesia were taken up for the study in a double-blind randomized fashion. The following groups of patients were excluded from the study:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Patients with a history of motion sickness, migraine, muscular dystrophy, or any other neurological problems</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients at particular risk for developing torsade de pointes including those with underlying heart conditions, such as congenital long QT syndrome</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who were predisposed to low levels of potassium and magnesium in the blood</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients on other medications that lead to QT prolongation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who received antiemetics within 48 h before surgery</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with a history of recurrent vomiting in the postoperative period</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pregnant/lactating females.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>After taking informed written consent and approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee, patients were randomly allocated to one of the following two groups to receive either injection ramosetron 0.3 mg IV or injection ondansetron 6 mg IV just before extubation.</p><p>The sample size for the study was calculated from the software G power 3.1.5. G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &#x00026; Buchner, 2007) is a stand-alone power analysis program for many statistical tests commonly used in the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences. It is available free of charge via the Internet for both Windows and Mac OS X platforms. For an &#x003b1; value of 5% and keeping the power of the study (1&#x02212;&#x003b2;) equal to 80%, it was found that a minimum of fifty patients are required to be recruited in each group. It was found that the expected proportion for one group is 31% and another group is 60% which depicts the moderate effect &#x0201c;d&#x0201d; size exists between the groups.</p><p>Hence, the ramosetron group comprised fifty patients who received injection ramosetron (0.3 mg), while ondansetron group again comprised fifty patients who received injection ondansetron (6 mg).</p><p>To ensure blindness, either of the study drugs was diluted in 0.9% normal saline to a volume of 4 ml and coded by the technologist in charge of operation theater who did not reveal the nature of drug to anyone till the completion of the study. He also maintained a register documenting the particulars of each patient and code of the drug. Decoding was done at the completion of the study and patients were allocated to their respective groups.</p><p>General anesthesia technique was standardized. On arrival in the operation theater, an IV line was established with dextrose in saline using 18/20 FG cannula. All patients received morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV just before induction of general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced using injection propofol 2 mg/kg body weight. Tracheal intubation was facilitated using injection atracurium besylate 0.5 mg/kg body weight. Anesthesia was maintained with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen and isoflurane 0.6&#x02013;1%. Ventilation was controlled to end-tidal carbon dioxide of 30&#x02013;35 mmHg, and neuromuscular blockade was maintained using supplementary injection atracurium besylate 0.2 mg/kg IV. At the end of the operation, residual neuromuscular block was reversed with injection neostigmine 80 &#x000b5;/kg and injection atropine 40 &#x000b5;/kg body weight.</p><p>After surgery, all the patients were observed for 24 h. Throughout the study period, vital signs such as pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were monitored and recorded every 6 h, except during sleep.</p><p>The incidence of nausea and vomiting was recorded every 6 hourly for a period of 24 h after the surgery by direct questioning to the patient or his/her attendants. Nausea and vomiting were regarded as separate events and evaluated on a three-point scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. However, no distinction was made between vomiting and retching (retching event was considered as vomiting event) rescue antiemetic medication was administered as and when required in the form of injection metoclopramide (10 mg) and dose repeated, if the patient experienced severe nausea; there were more than three emetic episodes within a period of 15 min or the patient asked for it.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Gan and Alexander scale for assessment of nausea and vomiting</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-78-g001"/></table-wrap><p>At the end, all the data collected were decoded and subjected to statistical analysis using unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test.
