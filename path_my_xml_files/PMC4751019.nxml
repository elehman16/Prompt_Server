<bold>Background:</bold> Colonoscopy is the gold standard investigation for the diagnosis of bowel pathology and colorectal cancer screening. Adenoma detection rate is a marker of high quality colonoscopy and a high adenoma detection rate is associated with a lower incidence of interval cancers. Several technological advancements have been explored to improve adenoma detection rate. A new device called Endocuff Vision&#x02122; has been shown to improve adenoma detection rate in pilot studies.</p><p>
<bold>Methods/Design:</bold> This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing the adenoma detection rate in patients undergoing Endocuff Vision&#x02122;-assisted colonoscopy with standard colonoscopy. All patients above 18 years of age referred for screening, surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopy who are able to consent are invited to the study. Patients with absolute contraindications to colonoscopy, large bowel obstruction or pseudo-obstruction, colon cancer or polyposis syndromes, colonic strictures, severe diverticular segments, active colitis, anticoagulant therapy, or pregnancy are excluded. Patients are randomized according to site, age, sex, and bowel cancer screening status to receive Endocuff Vision&#x02122;-assisted colonoscopy or standard colonoscopy on the day of procedure. Baseline data, colonoscopy, and polyp data including histology are collected. Nurse assessment of patient comfort and patient comfort questionnaires are completed post procedure. Patients are followed up at 21 days and complete a patient experience questionnaire. This study will take place across seven NHS Hospital Trusts: one in London and six within the Northern Region Endoscopy Group.&#x0200a;A maximum of 10 colonoscopists per site will recruit a total of 1772 patients, with a maximum of four bowel screening colonoscopists permitted per site. </p><p>
<bold>Discussion:</bold> This is the first trial to evaluate the adenoma detection rate of Endocuff Vision&#x02122; in all screening, surveillance, and diagnostic patient groups. This timely study will guide clinicians as to the role of Endocuff Vision&#x02122; in routine colonoscopy.</p><p>Study registration: ISRCTN11821044.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Colonoscopy is considered to be the optimal procedure for bowel cancer screening and diagnosis of colonic pathology. However, it remains an imperfect tool for cancer prevention. Missing lesions during colonoscopy is implicated as one of the primary reasons for interval colorectal cancers, with a clear correlation between adenoma detection rate (ADR) and interval cancers demonstrated in a few trials <xref rid="JR300-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Adenoma detection is the most important contemporaneous marker of mucosal visualization and of high quality colonoscopy <xref rid="JR300-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Variation in ADR exists within the UK, although there has been an improvement in the interval between two large audits of colonoscopy quality <xref rid="JR300-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Reasons for non-detection of a lesion at colonoscopy include: suboptimal technique; shorter withdrawal time; inadequate bowel preparation; presence of flat, depressed or subtle lesions; and the inability to visualize the proximal side of haustral folds, flexures (blind spots), rectal valves, and ileocecal valves <xref rid="JR300-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Optical imaging innovations and technological developments in the field of colonoscopy have attempted to decrease the adenoma miss rates with the introduction of high definition endoscopes, electronic chromoendoscopy (such as narrow-band imaging), wide-angle colonoscopies and retrograde viewing devices <xref rid="JR300-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Lesions located on the proximal sides of colonic folds may be missed during standard conventional colonoscopy <xref rid="JR300-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Although views may be improved with dynamic patient position changing and routine retroflexion, these maneuvers may not be effective, particularly in the narrower colonic segments, even with the use of a pediatric colonoscope or gastroscope <xref rid="JR300-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Currently available transparent caps and hoods, attached at the tip of the scope, have been used to hold down folds and improve visualization in the forward view. However, they make the tip section of the scope more rigid and longer, and this may impair scope insertion in an angulated sigmoid colon <xref rid="JR300-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p>A preliminary pilot evaluation study has demonstrated a potential benefit in terms of mucosal visualization and adenoma detection when using Endocuff Vision&#x02122; <xref rid="JR300-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Published work on the improved ability to undertake therapy using Endocuff Vision&#x02122; has additionally demonstrated advantages gained by obtaining scope tip stability and a safer operational platform <xref rid="JR300-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Endocuff Vision&#x02122; </title><p>The Endocuff&#x02122; (ARC Medical Design Ltd and Diagmed, UK) is a new device (CE marked in UK) made of a soft plastic material with a unique dynamic shape (<xref rid="FI300-1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x0200a;1</xref>). The core is made of polypropylene and the &#x02018;finger-like&#x02019; projections are made of a thermoplastic elastomer. Endocuff&#x02122; comes in four color coded sizes (purple, blue, green and orange) to fit a range of pediatric and adult colonoscopes. The first version of Endocuff&#x02122; comprised backwards pointing (proximal and distal to the scope tip) flexible &#x02018;finger-like&#x02019; projections at intervals around the device circumference with the following dimensions in different cuff sizes (length of 23.8&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;diameters of 16.1/16.7/17.2/18.5&#x0200a;mm with the finger-like projections folded back and 32.6/33.1/33.6/34.8&#x0200a;mm with the finger-like projections opened out). The new version of Endocuff &#x02122; (the Endocuff Vision&#x02122;) that is utilized during the clinical trial, however, has only one proximal row of more rounded finger-like projections to eliminate any mucosa lacerations that were observed with the first version (<xref rid="FI300-2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x0200a;2</xref>). Both versions are mounted at the tip of the scope and held on by friction (pull-off force is a minimum of 10 Newton). The chief investigators have used the Endocuff Vision&#x02122; extensively, and report no occasions of cuff dislodgment. The Endocuff Vision&#x02122; aims to improve access in the large bowel by flattening colonic folds and manipulating them away from the field of forward view. </p><fig id="FI300-1"><label>Fig.&#x0200a;1</label><caption><p>

It helps anchor the scope tip against the bowel wall to provide a stable platform of access. The soft, elastic projections are pushed back (recoiled) towards the scope shaft during insertion but evert during withdrawal to hold colon folds away from the field of view. </p><fig id="FI300-3"><label>Fig.&#x0200a;3</label><caption><p>

Colonoscopy related complications are routinely recorded up to 21 days post-procedure. All patients will have their post colonoscopy surveillance interval (according to BSG <xref rid="JR300-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> or BCSP <xref rid="OR300-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> guidelines) recorded in the Case Report Form, where appropriate. In the case of incomplete colonoscopy, the reason for this will be recorded. Eligible, consented patients will remain in the study for 21 days following colonoscopy. SAEs will also be reported for the 21-day period post colonoscopy for all patients in the study. We will review complication data and adverse events at 21 days by the most appropriate method for the population at each local site. This will consist of either a phone call to the patient or review of medical notes and hospital databases. If a patient presents to a different hospital post procedure to the hospital where the colonoscopy was performed, we will contact their General Practitioner to obtain information with regard to the event. This collection of data can occur up to 14 days after the end of the 21-day follow-up period, but will only include data within the 21-day window. No additional visits are required for patients who enter the study. Any follow-up appointments post-colonoscopy will be as per routine care for the respective unit. The timescale for the outpatient appointment and subsequent care will be unaltered by participation in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The study is powered to detect a difference in the ADR between two groups. There will be two subgroups of participants&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;those undergoing colonoscopy via the BCSP, and those with symptoms or being followed up in the general, non-screening, NHS service. ADR varies between these two groups; in the BCSP screening population, ADR is approximately 45&#x0200a;%, and in the non-screening population, 16&#x0200a;%. A difference in ADR of 5&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;10&#x0200a;% would be of clinical importance (5&#x0200a;% in the non-screening cohort, and 10&#x0200a;% in the screening cohort).</p><p>Preliminary work on BCSP participants at one of the Chief Investigators&#x02019; sites suggests that such a rise in ADR for EAC procedures is possible. The proportion of screening to non-screening participants is anticipated to be approximately 20:80.&#x0200a;Mean ADR for the whole group is therefore 21.8&#x0200a;%, and a 6&#x0200a;% increase in ADR to 27.8&#x000a0;% is deemed to be clinically significant. Therefore, to demonstrate a 6&#x0200a;% increase in ADR with a 5&#x0200a;% significance level and 90&#x0200a;% power using a one-sided test, it is calculated that 886 patients per group are required for the study, 1772 patients in total (<xref rid="FI300-6" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x0200a;6</xref>).</p><fig id="FI300-6"><label>Fig.&#x0200a;6</label><caption><p>

A chi-squared test will be used to compare this outcome between groups. A secondary outcome is the number of adenomas detected per procedure. This is likely to have a positively skewed distribution, and so the Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare between groups. An additional secondary outcome is the proportion of patients who require a follow-up procedure (based on BSG adenoma surveillance guidelines), which will be compared between groups using the chi-squared test.</p><p>Other secondary outcomes will be examined on a non-inferiority basis, namely cecal intubation rate, insertion time to cecum, withdrawal time in procedures where there are no polyps, and patient satisfaction. The margin of non-inferiority will be set for all outcomes. For the continuous outcomes, one-sided 97.5&#x0200a;% confidence interval for the mean difference between groups will be calculated. For the binary outcomes, a one-sided 97.5&#x0200a;% confidence interval for the difference in proportions will be calculated. Non-inferiority will be assumed if the bound of the confidence interval does not cross the point of non-inferiority. The rate of cuff exchange will be calculated in the EAC group, along with a corresponding confidence interval. The analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Data and all appropriate documentation will be stored for a minimum of 15 years after completion of the study, including the follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Data monitoring </title><p>The trial is supervised by the Data Monitoring Committee which consists of an independent chair, with two independent clinicians and an independent statistician. The aim of the Data Monitoring Committee is to safeguard the interests of trial participants, assess the safety and viability of the intervention during the trial, and monitor the overall conduct of the clinical trial. The Data Monitoring Committee will meet every 4 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Management Group</title><p>The Chief Investigator has overall responsibility for the study and will oversee all study management.

The role of the Trial Steering Committee is to supervise the trial to ensure that it is conducted to the rigorous standards set out in the Department of Health&#x02019;s Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The Trial Steering Committee will meet every 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Publication policy</title><p>The Chief Investigators will take responsibility to present and publish the outcomes of the study. Study results will be disseminated through national and international symposia and local networks. The results will also be submitted for publication in international peer reviewed journals and presented to the British Society of Gastroenterology Endoscopy Research Committee, BSG guideline groups and the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. Feedback will be given to regional and national Endoscopy leads, maximizing the exposure of findings to colonoscopists. </p></sec><sec><title>Study period</title><p>The study period of this trial is November 2014 to July 2016, with the participant entry period from November 2014 to June 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol version</title><p>The trial is on protocol version 14.0 dated 11 November 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations </title><p>Ethics approval has been awarded via the NHS Research Ethics Committee before the study starting. There are no known additional risks to patients associated with the use of the Endocuff Vision&#x02122; device. The addition of Endocuff Vision&#x02122; will not add significantly to the duration of the procedure, although if adenoma detection rate increases significantly, the procedure may take longer due to increased polypectomy numbers. Patients will be informed of the risks associated with standard colonoscopy and consented for the procedures as per standard clinical practice in each center, in addition to a study-specific consent form which will have been discussed with the patient by the research team. The study will be conducted in accordance with the recommendations for physicians involved in research on human subjects adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki 1964 and later revisions. The ADENOMA Study is supported by the British Society of Gastroenterology Endoscopy Research Committee and has been identified as a research priority. The protocol for ADENOMA study has been reviewed and endorsed by the Bowel Cancer Screening Research Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Sponsor</title><p>The trial is sponsored by South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust District Hospital.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Adenomatous polyps can turn into colorectal cancer through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence <xref rid="JR300-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Thus, an increase in adenoma detection and subsequent removal may reduce colorectal cancer risk. Methods to improve ADR are widely contested and have been studied via various modalities of technology. This is the first randomized controlled trial looking at the use of Endocuff Vision&#x02122; in screening, surveillance, and diagnosis of patients.</p><p>Studies have shown that there is a wide ADR variation in non-screening colonoscopists with BCSP colonoscopists having a 30&#x0200a;% higher ADR comparatively <xref rid="JR300-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="JR300-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Although this may in part be due to the increased risk of adenomas in BCSP patients who attend because of a positive fecal occult blood test, this may also reflect higher quality colonoscopy. The Endocuff Vision&#x02122; may be of benefit in non-screening colonoscopists to increase ADR. </p><p>The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme started in July 2006 with all screening endoscopists having to undergo strict accreditation criteria via the Screening Assessor Accreditation System which is a web-based application process maintained by the Joint Advisory Group in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. All screening colonoscopists must submit audit data demonstrating a high level of performance before accreditation. Completion of an accreditation examination at an independent unit is then undertaken which consists of a multiple choice question examination and performance of two colonoscopies observed by two independent and trained examiners using objective directly observed colonoscopic procedural skills assessment criteria. Accredited colonoscopists are subjected to a rigorous ongoing audit of colonoscopic performance which includes maintaining a minimum of 150 screening colonoscopies annually and having a complication rate below the national average as outlined by the latest national or BSCP data <xref rid="OR300-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The quality of BCSP colonoscopy has been reported widely <xref rid="JR300-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. </p><p>This study&#x02019;s strengths are that it is conducted at multiple sites to reflect tertiary and secondary centers. Although a large scale trial, it has a simple patient recruitment process. In addition, use of the Endocuff Vision&#x02122; will not unnecessarily lengthen colonoscopy time and no additional NHS resources are required. The minimum of 20 training cases required for completion by each trial colonoscopists ensures that all colonoscopists have a minimum standard from which to progress from. </p><p>One limitation of this study is that colonoscopists are not blinded to EAC or SC groups. Alternatives that were discussed included having a different colonoscopist perform initial anal intubation or to video record each colonoscopy to be double read by a different colonoscopist after the procedure. However, this was felt to be impractical as the &#x02018;finger-like&#x02019; projections of the Endocuff Vision&#x02122; occasionally come into luminal view during colonoscopy. The results of this trial will be valuable in determining the role of Endocuff Vision&#x02122; in routine colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently active.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study is conducted on existing NHS and BCSP lists, at no extra cost to the NHS.&#x0200a;Funding is provided by ARC Medical Design Ltd to cover the Endocuff Vision&#x02122; devices, clinical trial unit costs, and results analysis.
