All patients had histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer and all had residual disease after primary surgery, with the majority having stage III/IV disease. The primary treatment for all patients was debulking surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Eligible patients were further randomised to undergo a second debulking operation. The main end point, survival, was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model identified performance status (P = 0.002), residual disease (P = 0.005) and albumin level (P = 0.04) as independent prognostic factors. A multivariate model to predict survival curves for patients with the best and worst prognoses was developed with predicted 5 year survival of 30% and 3% for those in the best and worst prognostic groups respectively. The identification of clinical interventions to improve outcome is an urgent matter since the prognosis for patients with advanced ovarian cancer remains poor.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1513" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1514" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1515" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1516" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1517" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
