In contrast, foreshortened life expectancies reduce employment or retirement experience. Which phase is impacted, however, is likely influenced by one&#x02019;s motivation to work longer or not. To date, empirical evidence has indicated positive effects of age on both, retirement planning and retirement intentions, i.e., later retirement (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Montalto et al., 2000</xref>). Functionally, workplace and retirement scholars similarly locate future time perspective (FTP), defined as &#x0201c;perceptions of the future as being limited or open-ended&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lang and Carstensen, 2002</xref>; p. 125), as a mediator between age and respective focal criteria. For example, workplace researchers regard FTP as mediating age effects for retirement intentions (RetirIntent; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Henry et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, workplace researchers suggest workplace solutions may reduce FTP&#x02019;s decline and, thereby, retain older knowledge workers by <italic>prolonging</italic> retirement intentions. On the other hand, retirement scholars regard FTP as mediating age effects for retirement planning (RetirPlan; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hershey and Mowen, 2000</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. Consequently, retirement researchers suggest mindfulness solutions may strengthen FTP&#x02019;s increase and, thereby, prompt earlier retirement planning by accelerating preparations for wellbeing in retirement.</p><p>The predicted directions of the FTP-mechanism with age, however, are competing, such that retirement scholars predict increasing FTP with age (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hershey and Mowen, 2000</xref>), whereas workplace scholars predict decreasing FTP with age (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Griffin et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with inveterate lifespan theories (Carstensen and Lang, 1996, Unpublished). Effectively, the rival hypotheses can be understood from two valid perspectives on workforce aging, (1) Relative aging (as cohort effect), and (2) Absolute aging (as longer life expectancies). Although both perspectives are reasonable, the implication from &#x02018;absolute&#x02019; aging is that chronological age&#x02019;s explanatory value for developmental predictions will deteriorate continuously (proxy indicator detaches further from longevity complexions). This is evidenced by the fact that absolute aging (work-life and post-work life) will likely continue after the relative aging (graying from Baby Boomer cohort) subsides. Consequently, the substantive value of age-related predictions in both workplace and retirement researches is depreciating. Causally, however, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> displays the disciplinary sources for the competing age-related predictions for FTP. To date, the competing predictions have not been evaluated (c.f., see <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Rudolph et al., 2017</xref>). As <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Schultz (2010</xref>, p. 176) described the disjunction between workplace and retirement fields of research, &#x0201c;&#x02026;very few studies that examined outcomes of retirement have incorporated factors that influenced the original retirement decision&#x02026;This creates a logic gap because the reasons why people decide to retire would naturally influence how they evaluate outcomes.&#x0201d;</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Lifespan theoretic-disciplinary origins for contradictory age-related predicts for FTP.

That is, conditioning predictions on age for meaningful interpretation of relevant criteria across workplace and retirement domains, requires independence assumptions between work and retirement contexts. Independence of work &#x02013; retirement domains is intuitively flawed, given the dependence of retirement from a previous worklife. Consequently, age is limitedly meaningful for the growing complexity and overlap of work and retirement contexts. This practical disconnect evidences in probabilistically opposing (directionally competing) age-predictions for FTP concerning the focal criteria of interest (delaying intentions/advancing preparations for retirement).</p><p>In contrast to age effects on employment and retirement, much less research attention has been given to its counterpoint, that is, subjective life expectancy (SLE; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Griffin et al., 2013</xref>). Empirical evidence has indicated that perceptions of remaining time in later stages of life are comparatively better predictors than age for decision processes and transitions, e.g., retirement, (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">van Solinge and Henkens, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, workplace and retirement scholars locate FTP in similar nomological networks vis-&#x000e0;-vis intended retirement (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of directional empirical findings.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antecedents</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mechanisms</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Consequences</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(+) Retirement planning</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(-) Intended retirement</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(+/-) FTP</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(+) Intended retirement</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SLE</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(?)

Its dynamic feature, to auto-increase savings contributions over employment, is premised on counteracting increasing discount rate (and retirement delays) as a function of aging. This reasoning is further consistent with recent empirical findings that substantively distinguishes between temporal quantification and domain-specific goal strivings as mechanisms to specific facets of developmental self-regulation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kornadt et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the second mechanism, FTP as-delayer of retirement intentions, it has received empirical support from a study that indicated, future-oriented prospections induced escalations-of-commitment (i.e., sunk-cost biases; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Strough et al., 2016</xref>).

Moreover, mediation tests of perceived stress and positive-affect suggested that positive-affect operates as a significant-mediator between FTP and procrastination; Inclusion of the mediator resulted in the unconditional-direct effect of FTP-procrastination to switch signs (from negative to positive).</p><p>Retention of older workers, by aligning workplace conditions with growing &#x02018;stability preferences&#x02019; is premised on counteracting the opportunity cost from workforce continuation at older age; Indeed, workplace conditions typically govern worker wellbeing, and poor quality workplaces render their occupants decremented in wellbeing to levels comparable to, both the unemployed and disabled (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">ten Have et al., 2015</xref>). Extrapolating, a systematic review of the association between the latest economic crisis (i.e., low job mobility opportunity) and workplace stressors found that job insecurity was the strongest correlate with mental health impairments (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mucci et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Synthesizing conceptions across empirical studies, the impacts of: (1) work vs. non-work valuation (affect), and (2) short vs. long time horizons (cognitive), as two mechanisms linking work and retirement has not yet been evaluated in a single study. The goal of the current experiment, therefore, is to pit these competing mechanisms in an evaluative framework by manipulating SLE via attribute-framing conditions. The results are expected to clarify competing age-predictions for FTP across workplace and retirement research domains. Next, we will introduce our SLE manipulation for subsequently deriving our research hypotheses.</p><sec><title>Hypotheses</title><p>The current study evaluates the competing predictions for age-FTP with an attribute-framing manipulation of SLE and simultaneous estimation of FTP and RetirIntent. Recent findings indicate that the framing of SLE questions, as either &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; or &#x02018;Die-by,&#x02019; results in an SLE difference of approximately 7&#x02013;10 years (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Payne et al., 2013</xref>). Examples of the &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; and &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; framings are &#x0201c;What is the probability that you currently expect to &#x02018;<bold>live-to</bold>&#x02019;/&#x02018;<bold>die-by</bold>&#x02019; 95-years of age? The &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; frame has been found to lower SLE compared to &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; framings.</p><p>Conceptually, we may re-interpret this SLE manipulation as a &#x02018;subjective age&#x02019; manipulation. In this case, if the &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; frame is successfully replicated so that it lowers SLE, we may interpret this as inducing &#x02018;older subjective age.&#x02019; Consequently, the randomization of participants and comparison on FTP enables us to infer how FTP covaries with different perceptions of one&#x02019;s remaining lifetime/SLE. Restated in the context of formal hypothesis-testing, we hypothesize that the &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; SLE frame will reduce FTP compared to the &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; frame.</p><list list-type="simple" prefix-word="simple"><list-item><label>H1:</label><p> The &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; frame will decrease FTP compared to the &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; frame.</p></list-item></list><p>Additionally, we include the variable &#x02018;retirement intention&#x02019; in order to assess the consistency of directional effects across &#x02018;work&#x02019; and &#x02018;retirement&#x02019; domains. Specifically, if we accept retirement to be subsumed by overall age, then it follows that older workers (lower SLE from &#x02018;die-by&#x02019; frame) should report closer proximity to retirement (sooner retirement). Thus, we also hypothesize that the &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; SLE frame will reduce retirement intentions compared to the &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; frame.</p><list list-type="simple" prefix-word="simple"><list-item><label>H2:</label><p> The &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; frame will decrease RetirIntent compared to &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; frame.</p></list-item></list><p>Finally, &#x02018;retirement planning&#x02019; is purposefully assessed before randomized treatment assignment (live-to/die-by).

Specifically, for the &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; condition, a significant positive correlation was observed between RetirPlan-RetirIntent, <italic>r</italic> = 0.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04.

The latter finding supports views of RetirPlan as a mechanism that accelerates workforce withdrawal (earlier retirement).</p><p>Given the patterning of external correlates, we considered additional explanatory causes for our experimental findings to support substantive interpretation of RetirPlan&#x02019;s moderation effects. First, we considered if the FTP main effect may be attributable to its sensitivity to &#x02018;careless responding&#x02019; based on mix-scored items (positive- / reverse-scored). An independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test was re-conducted, excluding the <italic>j</italic> = 3 reverse-scored FTP items.

An independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test was re-conducted separately for the low-Time and high-Time groups.

The pattern of interactions also remained unchanged in terms of direction and statistical significance. We summarize our findings and briefly elaborate their implications for future work-retirement integrative research in the section &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; below.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study identified a construct, FTP, with disproportionate external validity evidence in a shifting applied context, specifically, workers and retirees. The mono-operation bias inherent to two contrarian theoretical origins of FTP across functionally dissimilar populations (workers and retirees), thus, vesseled weak validity evidence and poor verisimilitude (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cronbach, 1988</xref>). We evaluated the rival age-related hypotheses with an experimental SLE-framing manipulation.</p><p>Summarizing our findings, first, we successfully replicated the SLE-framing manipulation and observed the opposing relations between SLE-FTP, which was positive in the &#x02018;Live-to&#x02019; condition (<italic>r</italic> = 0.40) and negative in the &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; condition (<italic>r</italic> = -0.30). For hypotheses, H1 was supported with a significant negative effect of the &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; condition on FTP. The finding generally support inveterate lifespan theories that postulate age-related decline in FTP (Carstensen and Lang, 1996, Unpublished). Furthermore, we received support for FTP&#x02019;s hypothesized interaction with RetirPlan, such that participants reporting more RetirPlan were unaffected by the &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; framing&#x02019;s negative impact on FTP.</p><p>On the other hand, H2 pertaining to RetirIntent was unsupported by our findings. There was no significant difference between SLE-frames for RetirIntent. Further inspection of the interaction hypothesis (H4) revealed an unexpected cross-over effect, providing some indication for obscuring the hypothesized main effect. Contrast analyses supported our hypothesis for RetirPlan&#x02019;s strengthening of the negative &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; effect. On the other hand, we also observed an unanticipated positive effect of the &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; condition on RetirIntent for low-RetirPlan. The cross-over effect could be interpreted as a delay of RetirIntent when shorter SLE is combined with inadequate preparation. This interpretation is consistent with recent empirical findings that indicate FTP&#x02019;s dual-mechanism of prompting planning and inducing sunk-cost biases/escalations of commitment with current conditions. That is, in the same way that job characteristics may enhance occupational FTP, contracted lifespans may induce avoidance of retirement&#x02019;s unknown, if ill-prepared, event space.</p><p>Taken together, we hope that the current findings hold practical import for bettering the practice of career counseling and job crafting amid longer working lives. For example, practical implications of this experimental study intersect the age-integration of social institutions and domain-integration of work-life balance. To this end, results should inform ongoing areas of research on related lifespan concepts &#x02013; For example, &#x02018;active aging&#x02019; (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2002</xref>), &#x02018;aging-in-place&#x02019; (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</xref>), and &#x02018;successful aging in the workplace&#x02019; (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Krause, 2001</xref>).</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>We aimed to evaluate contradictory predictions for age-related changes in FTP. Although, we found support for negative age-related predictions for FTP, we also observed a substantive content responsitivity effect (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Nichols et al., 1989</xref>). A tenable mechanism to explain such effects stem from empirical findings on mortality salience, specifically, its impact on identified determinants of motivated responding. For example, mortality salience is positively associated with prosocial attitudes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Jonas et al., 2002</xref>) and trust beliefs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Paulhus, 1983</xref>). The cognitive context of our SLE elicitations systematically impacted response processes, in turn, un-differentiable main effects were observed on RetirIntent. On the other hand, we observed an unexpected crossover interaction, such that participants in the &#x02018;Die-by&#x02019; reporting low RetPlan reported significantly <italic>later</italic> RetirIntent. Although exploratory analyses were conducted to increase substantive inference from our findings, important limitations are noteworthy for cautious interpretation. For example, from a response-modeling perspective, our focus on latent-structural relations limited our examination of potential response biases to classical approaches, such as conditioning on standard- and reverse-scored items (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Colsher and Wallace, 1989</xref>). More advanced item response theory (IRT) models, however, have recently been published, enabling researchers to precisely account for wording effects and model directly, any number of suspected response styles (e.g., midpoint, extreme, acquiescence; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Falk and Cai, 2016</xref>). Second, regarding RetIntent, we presumed that our sample of older employees anticipated a future withdrawal from the workforce toward retirement. It is tenable, however, that low-RetPlan participants did not represent inadequate- or ill-preparation but, rather, a deliberate intention to never retire.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Directions</title><p>The continually aging workforce puts a premium on organizational and retirement scholars&#x02019; specification of lifespan motivation theories (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f6;ckenhoff, 2012</xref>). The psychological construct of FTP figures prominently in both areas of research; for work scholars, the socio-emotional selectivity theory (SST) of lifespan motivation predicts that FTP decreases with age (Carstensen and Lang, 1996, Unpublished). In opposition, retirement scholars employ a psycho-motivational model, adapted from a theory of lifespan planning that predicts FTP increases with age (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hershey, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Sophisticated IRT models offer explanatory testing of suspected response biases for self-report measures. For example, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kam and Meyer (2015)</xref> recently examined the broad implications of item valence (i.e., standard- and reverse-scoring) for, both factor loading-patterns and bivariate external correlates. Future research should continue to integrate cognitive context of the assessment scenario (including response instructions/item framing) with IRT models sensitive to potential response styles or construct distortion.</p><p>Regarding workplace adaptations of FTP, redesigning work to motivate older employees&#x02019; may not function as increase of occupational-FTP, rather, as a decrease in waiting costs, as Paglieri observes, &#x0201c;Costs of delay should be taken into account, on par with delay, in determining intertemporal choices. From this viewpoint, refusing to sustain the costs of a delay is not the same thing as devaluing a reward because it is delayed&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Paglieri, 2013</xref>, p. 371). A future experimental study examines this possibility (alternative mechanism) with a battery of decisional delay-discounting, psychophysical patience tests, and the FTP questionnaire (see also, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Scheibe and Zacher, 2013</xref>). Summarizing, the new context of aging workforces and retirees presents an opportunity for theory elaboration in future research agendas (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fisher and Aguinis, 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The divide between work and retirement scholarship may be a reification of initial schisms between lifespan researches (early childhood vs. gerontological). The current authors concur with <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Shepard&#x02019;s (1993)</xref> articulation of consequential validity regarding unintended consequences of measures, specifically, that it is a &#x0201c;logical extension&#x0201d; (p. 426) of <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Campbell&#x02019;s (1960)</xref> advocacy for rival hypotheses in validity evaluations. Understanding of the aging labor force, by extension, requires a more comprehensive understanding of the motivations for retiring and for continuation. Should longer life expectancies abide the relative-cohort effect, then age-based predictions may depreciate in usefulness amid ever-longer and more complex employment lives. The contribution of the current experiment&#x02019;s findings is that, not all work redesigns will encourage adequate planners to forego retirement, and not all who continue working past retirement are meaningfully present at work.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MK designed the experiment, recruited and ran participants, and conducted primary analyses.
