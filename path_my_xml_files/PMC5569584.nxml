For example, in humans, liking of palatable foods is assumed to be modulated by endocannabinoid activity. Studies in rodents suggest that the ECS also plays a role in sweet taste intensity perception, but it is unknown to what extent this can be extrapolated to humans. Therefore, this study aimed at elucidating whether &#x00394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) affects sweet taste intensity perception and liking in humans, potentially resulting in alterations in food preferences.</p><p><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> In a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study, 10 healthy males participated in three test sessions that were 2 weeks apart. During the test sessions, participants received THC-rich, CBD-rich, or placebo <italic>Cannabis</italic> by inhalation divided over two doses (4&#x02009;+&#x02009;1&#x02009;mg THC; 25&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x02009;mg CBD). Participants tasted seven chocolate milk-like drinks that differed in sugar concentration and they rated sweet taste intensity and liking of the drinks. They were then asked to rank the seven drinks according to how much they liked the drinks and were offered <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to their favorite drink. In addition, they completed a computerized food preference task and completed an appetite questionnaire at the start, midway, and end of the test sessions.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Inhalation of the <italic>Cannabis</italic> preparations did not affect sweet taste intensity perception and liking, ranking order, or <italic>ad libitum</italic> consumption of the favorite drink. In addition, food preferences were not influenced by the interventions. Reported fullness was lower, whereas desire to eat was higher throughout the THC compared to the CBD condition.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results suggest that administration of <italic>Cannabis</italic> preparations at the low doses tested does not affect sweet taste intensity perception and liking, nor does it influence food preferences in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title><bold>Keywords:</bold>&#x02002;</title><kwd>cannabidiol</kwd><kwd>food preferences</kwd><kwd>phytocannabinoids</kwd><kwd>sweet taste</kwd><kwd>tetrahydrocannabinol</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s001"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is growing evidence that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an important role in the regulation of hedonic hunger, that is, consuming foods for the experience of reward and not for the compensation of any energy deficit.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> More specifically, the ECS seems to modulate palatability-dependent appetite,<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref></sup> although the underlying mechanisms are far from clear.</p><p>It is important to note that palatability, or pleasantness, is not a fixed function of the sensory properties (e.g., taste, smell, texture) of a food, but also depends on the hedonic evaluation of more qualitative (liking) and contextual (eating occasion) characteristics.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Considering taste, there seem to be two ways in which taste intensity perception and liking can be modulated. One is through alterations in quantitative taste intensity perception, reflected by a shift in the psychophysical (concentration intensity) function. In case of, for example, sweet taste, the same sugar concentration is perceived as more or less intensely sweet. The other way is related to changes in hedonic evaluation, reflected by a shift in the psychohedonic (intensity pleasantness) function, where for example, the perceived sweetness intensity of a sugar concentration is unchanged, but the perceived sweetness is liked more or less.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>In rodents, endocannabinoid activity modulates sweet taste palatability. Endocannabinoid stimulation enhances liking of sweet taste<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and motivational behavior aimed at obtaining a sucrose solution,<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> whereas endocannabinoid inhibition reduces liking and motivational behavior.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Some studies suggest that administration of cannabidiol (CBD) decreases food intake,<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> possibly through indirect antagonism of the ECS,<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> whereas other studies do not find an effect of CBD on food intake.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Taken together, it is clear that CBD is far from being a classical ligand for the CB<sub>1</sub> or CB<sub>2</sub> receptor. The molecule displays a wide spectrum of activities on various molecular targets and produces multiple pharmacological effects.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Administration of endocannabinoids was found to specifically increase responses to sweet taste in the Chorda tympani, the nerve that innervates the tongue, in wild-type mice, but not in CB<sub>1</sub> knockout mice.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Administration of a CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist decreased responses to sweet taste in the Chorda tympani.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Together, these results suggest that modulating the ECS selectively changes the psychophysical function for sweet taste in mice.</p><p>In humans, anecdotal evidence suggests that the use of <italic>Cannabis</italic> preparations increases food palatability and intake,<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;25</xref></sup> a phenomenon colloquially known as &#x0201c;the munchies.&#x0201d; Furthermore, the CB<sub>1</sub> inverse agonist rimonabant decreases food intake.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Thus far, only one study examined the effects of oral administration of &#x00394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on taste intensity and liking in humans. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, acute <italic>Cannabis</italic> administration was found not to affect taste intensity perception and liking for sweet, sour, salty, and bitter food stimuli at baseline, and 2, 4, and 6&#x02009;h postdosing. However, THC bioavailability varied widely and THC could not be detected in plasma of all participants.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Based on the limited number of studies performed in humans, the aim of this study was to further investigate whether modulating the ECS by administering phytocannabinoid preparations affects sweet taste intensity perception and liking in humans, and whether this results in altered food preferences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Participants</title><p>Ten healthy, normal weight (body mass index=21.7&#x000b1;1.2&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) males aged 23.4&#x000b1;1 years participated in this study.

Food products included in this task were high in carbohydrate, high in fat, high in protein, or low in energy, and had a sweet or savory taste. Examples of foods included in the food preference test are pancakes (high-carbohydrate sweet), salty sticks (high-carbohydrate savory), chocolate bar (high-fat sweet), cheese cubes (high-fat savory), shrimps (high-protein), strawberries (low-energy sweet), and cucumber (low-energy savory). In short, the task consists of a macronutrient section, in which participants are presented with one product from each of the four macronutrient categories, and a taste section, in which participants are presented with two sweet and two savory products. Based on the rankings, preference scores for different macronutrient and taste categories, that is, high-carbohydrate, high-fat, high-protein, and low-energy, and sweet and savory are calculated as described elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Preference scores for the macronutrient categories can range from 1 to 4, with a higher score indicating a higher preference for a category.

The results indicate no change in sweet taste intensity perception and liking, nor in food preferences, as related to taste (sweet vs. savory) and macronutrient composition (carbohydrate, protein, fat, and low energy).</p><p>The lack of effects on sweet taste intensity and liking after activating or inhibiting the ECS is contradictory to our expectations based on previous studies that showed endocannabinoid modulation of sweet taste intensity perception in mice.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, the current findings are in line with a study in humans that assessed taste intensity perception after oral THC administration. In that study, THC did not affect intensity and liking of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and bitterness.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>In line with the results from the taste test, preference for sweet taste in the MTPRT did not differ between the THC, CBD, and placebo conditions. In addition, preference for macronutrients was not affected by the administration of THC or CBD. Earlier studies in humans showed that <italic>Cannabis</italic> increases intake of snack foods, with a specific increased intake of sweet snacks.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, participants had a preference for savory over sweet. Just before completing the MTPRT, participants had consumed a large amount of a sweet drink to satiety. This might have caused sensory-specific satiety, that is, decreased pleasantness of sensory properties of the food that has just been consumed to satiety.<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The effect of sensory-specific satiety might have overruled a potential effect of endocannabinoid modulation on preference for sweet taste. However, given that THC and CBD administration did not influence sweet taste intensity perception and liking of the chocolate milk-like drinks, we think it is more likely that there is no effect of endocannabinoid modulation on sweet taste preference.</p><p>Desire to eat was higher and fullness was lower in the THC condition compared to the CBD condition, possibly related to baseline differences. However, despite these differences, <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake of the most preferred chocolate milk-like drink did not differ between conditions. In a previous study in cancer patients, THC treatment increased appetite, but did not affect total energy intake.<sup><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Also, in a healthy population, THC did not affect the total energy intake.<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> However, other studies in humans showed that THC increases food intake.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> CBD has previously been shown not to affect appetite in patients who suffer from type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> In rats, however, CBD has been shown to decrease food intake,<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> which may be caused by higher fullness. These contradicting findings warrant further investigation.</p><p>The plasma levels of THC and CBD showed that the administration of pharmacological doses by inhalation was successful in our study. The placebo <italic>Cannabis</italic> contained traces of THC, which led to detectable, but very low, THC plasma levels in the placebo condition. As THC plasma levels in the placebo condition were eight times lower than in the THC condition, the functional consequences on outcome measures are likely minimal.</p><p>The relatively small sample size could be regarded as a limitation of our exploratory study. However, we would expect to find similar results in a larger sample. With 10 participants, we see a great overlap of the mean sweet taste intensity and liking of the different drinks, which suggests that we will also not see any differences with more participants included in the study. Especially for the sweet taste liking, there is a large variation between participants. For the food preference task, one may expect to find differences in preference for low-energy products with a larger sample size. As CBD increases fullness and decreases desire to eat, we would expect that it also increases preference for low-energy products based on previous experience with the MTPRT.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>This study included only male participants. As endocannabinoid pharmacology differs between males and females,<sup><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> females might respond differently to inhaled THC and CBD. Future studies should take this into account and consider to include both males and females.</p><p>Another plausible explanation for our negative results might be that we used a relatively low dose of THC compared to other studies.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We chose this dose as we did not want obvious intoxication to influence the results. However, it is possible that the dose is too low to evoke an effect and we would have seen an effect of THC on sweet taste intensity perception and liking if we would have used a higher dose. Importantly, the effects of THC and other CB<sub>1</sub> agonists usually follow an inverted u-shape, that is, there is an optimal dose at which the largest effect occurs and for higher doses, the effect wears off.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Dosing too high could therefore also lead to no effect. Future studies should take this in consideration.</p><p>Based on the results from this study, we conclude that challenging the ECS with low doses of THC or CBD does not influence sweet taste intensity perception and liking in humans. In addition, low doses of THC and CBD do not affect food preferences.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s019" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Pauline Claessen, research dietician, for providing the recipe for the chocolate milk-like drinks, and Tim Crolla and Michele Pedrotti for their help in carrying out the study.
