Objective responses were seen in 14/24 (58%) patients with regimen A (4 complete) and 6/24 (25%) with regimen B (1 complete) (P less than 0.02). The median duration of response was 14 months with regimen A and 6.5 months with regimen B. The median duration of survival was 20 months and 8 months respectively (P less than 0.01). The toxicity was similar with each regimen. There was no evidence of deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction nor congestive heart failure in any patient. It is concluded that when given at 3-weekly intervals adriamycin is a more effective treatment for advanced breast cancer at higher rather than lower dosage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00509-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="471" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00509-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="472" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00509-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="473" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
