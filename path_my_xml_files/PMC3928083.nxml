Here, we report the efficacy and safety of 300IR birch pollen sublingual solution administered discontinuously for 2 consecutive years to patients with birch-associated allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Birch pollen-allergic adults were randomized in this double blind study to 300IR birch pollen sublingual solution or placebo, daily, starting 4&#x000a0;months before and continuing through the pollen season for two pollen seasons. Randomization was stratified according to the presence or absence of oral allergy syndrome (OAS). The primary efficacy endpoint was the Average Adjusted Symptom Score (AAdSS) over the second pollen season and was analyzed by ANCOVA. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the AAdSS over the first pollen period. Safety was evaluated by means of adverse event monitoring.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>574 patients (284 in the active group and 290 in the placebo group) were randomized and 496 completed the study. Over the second pollen period, the least square (LS) mean AAdSS was significantly lower in the 300IR group than in the placebo group (LS mean difference &#x02212;2.04, 95% CI [&#x02212;2.69, &#x02212;1.40], (p &#x0003c;0.0001) with a relative reduction of 30.6%. Results were consistent in patients with and without OAS (&#x02212;33.6% and &#x02212;28.4%, respectively). A significant reduction in LS mean AAdSS was also observed over the first pollen season. The most frequently reported adverse events were application site reactions: oral pruritus, throat irritation, and mouth edema. There were no reports of anaphylaxis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pre- and co-seasonal treatment with 300IR birch pollen sublingual solution demonstrated sustained clinical efficacy over 2 pollen seasons and was well tolerated in adults with birch pollen-associated allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

The pollen is generally present from March to May, depending on the latitude, and for up to 8&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Sensitization to birch correlates with the distribution of the tree, with low prevalence in Southern Europe and high prevalence in Northern Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cross-reactivity to alder and hazel contributes to a prolonged tree pollen season in patients with birch pollen allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition to allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) symptoms, 50% to 93% of birch pollen allergic patients develop an oral allergy syndrome (OAS), with oropharyngeal symptoms after eating certain foods, because of the cross-reactivity between the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, and the food proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>ARC represents a considerable burden on public health because of its prevalence, its impact on quality of life and productivity, its economic costs, and its associated co-morbidities, including asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Current treatment options for ARC are allergen avoidance, symptomatic pharmacotherapy, and allergen immunotherapy (AIT). Limiting exposure to outdoor triggers is quite difficult for practical reasons. Symptomatic treatment options include antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, and leukotriene modifiers. These provide temporary relief from allergy symptoms but are not effective in all patients and are not disease-modifying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. WAO Guidelines recommend AIT by subcutaneous (SCIT) or sublingual (SLIT) route as therapeutic options for patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by avoidance measures or medications, those experiencing unacceptable adverse effects of medications, or those who wish to reduce the long-term use of medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The positive benefit-risk ratio of SLIT and its ease of use are likely factors that have contributed to its substantially increased use in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, as there have been few large, double-blind, controlled AIT trials for birch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], this study was conducted to assess the sustained efficacy (over two pollen seasons) and safety of pre- and co-seasonal treatment with 300IR (Index of Reactivity) birch-pollen sublingual solution in adults with birch-pollen induced ARC. The study also explored the efficacy and safety of treatment with the birch-pollen sublingual solution in the subpopulations with and without oral allergy syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 56 study centers in 11 European countries (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01731249).</p><p>Patients were enrolled between November 2010 and January 2011 for a two-year study consisting of two pre- and co-seasonal treatment periods in 2011 and 2012 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study design.</bold> The no-treatment period was about 7&#x000a0;months.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2045-7022-4-7-1"/></fig><p>Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 by center (block size of 4) using a computer-generated list to receive placebo or 300IR sublingual solution of birch pollen allergen extract initiated approximately 4&#x000a0;months before the expected start of the birch pollen season and continued throughout the season. Randomization was stratified according to the presence or absence of OAS and with the objective of enrolling a similar number of patients with and without OAS. Patients, investigators and all other study personnel remained blinded for the entire study. The study complied with ICH good clinical practice and was approved by local Regulatory Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees.

Sensitivity to birch pollen was verified by a positive Skin Prick Test (Stallergenes S.A.), defined as wheal diameter&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;mm, birch-specific serum IgE (ImmunoCAP, Thermoscientific)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.70 kUA/L, and a Retrospective Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RRTSS)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12 (0&#x02013;18 scale) based on the most severe days during one of the two birch pollen seasons preceding enrolment. Patients were excluded from the study if they had symptoms of rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis during the birch pollen season due to any other allergen (except alder and hazel), had received AIT treatment to birch pollen and/or another Betulaceae species (such as hazel or alder) within the previous 5&#x000a0;years, were receiving AIT for any other allergen, or had moderate or severe persistent asthma. Patients with asthma controlled with inhaled corticosteroids at a maximum dose of 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of budesonide or the equivalent were eligible.</p></sec><sec><title>Study treatment and rescue medications</title><p>Active treatment consisted of a sublingual solution of birch-pollen allergen standardized extract (Staloral, Stallergenes S.A., Antony, France) provided at a concentration of 10IR/mL for the titration phase and 300IR/mL for both the titration and maintenance phases. IR is the in-house standardization unit used to quantify the allergenicity of a solution. The titer of an allergen extract solution corresponds to 100IR/mL when, in an SPT performed with the Stallergenes&#x02019; SPT device (Stallerpoint&#x000ae;), in 30 subjects sensitized to the allergen in question, the extract produces a wheal measuring 7&#x000a0;mm in diameter (geometric mean).</p><p>Each year, treatment was initiated with a 12-day titration phase during which the dose was progressively increased daily from 1IR to 300IR. The dose regimen was as follows: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300IR/day. The maintenance phase consisted of daily intake of a 300IR dose until the end of the birch pollen season. Patients were instructed to deposit the prescribed dose directly under the tongue and keep it there for 2&#x000a0;minutes before swallowing. Each year, the first dose of treatment was taken at the study site and the patients were monitored for 30&#x000a0;minutes; the remainder of the treatment was taken at home. To maintain blinding, the placebo sublingual solution was matched in appearance, color and taste (i.e., the same glycerol saline solution was used and a coloring agent added for color matching).</p><p>Rescue medications (oral and ophthalmic antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids) were provided to patients to be used according to a stepwise regimen to manage severe ARC symptoms due to birch pollen. The investigator could provide oral corticosteroids if other rescue medications were insufficient.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>At the beginning of each treatment period, patients received an electronic diary (PHT Corporation, Geneva, Switzerland) and were advised to record, on a daily basis, their intake of the investigational product, the severity of each of their six rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, ocular pruritus and watery eyes) on a 4-point descriptor scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) and their use of rescue medication during the previous 24&#x000a0;hours.</p><p>Each study year, the patients completed the standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ[S])[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] before the first intake of the investigational product (i.e., 4&#x000a0;months before the expected start of the birch pollen period), then every week from 2&#x000a0;weeks before the expected start of the birch pollen season to 2&#x000a0;weeks after its end (i.e., end of the treatment period).</p><p>Birch-specific serum IgE and IgG4 were measured using fluoroenzyme immunoassay at study entry, about 2&#x000a0;weeks after the end of the first pollen season, about 4&#x000a0;months before the second pollen period and about 2&#x000a0;weeks after the end of the second pollen season (ImmunoCAP, Thermoscientific).</p><p>Safety variables were adverse events (AEs) monitored from the signing of patient informed consent as well as data from physical examinations and clinical laboratory assessments. For each treatment period, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as adverse events which started on or after the first administration of the investigational product, up to 30&#x000a0;days after its last intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The sum of the six Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Scores (RSS) defined the daily Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS, range 0&#x02013;18). The daily Rescue Medication Score (RMS) was derived as follows: 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no rescue medication taken; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;use of antihistamines (oral and/or ophthalmic); 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;use of nasal corticosteroids; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;use of oral corticosteroids. If more than one class of rescue medication was taken on a particular day, the highest score was retained for the score of that day.</p><p>The primary efficacy variable was the Average Adjusted Symptom Score (AAdSS, range 0&#x02013;18) during the second birch pollen period. The AAdSS takes into account both symptom scores and rescue medication usage. It is subject specific and is calculated as the average of the daily Adjusted Symptom Scores (AdSSs) over the evaluation period. Each day, the AdSS adjusts the daily RTSS for rescue medication usage. If a patient took rescue medication on one day, the AdSS of that day is defined as the RTSS of that day or the AdSS of the day before, whichever was higher. The next day, the AdSS is defined as the RTSS of that day or the AdSS of the day before, whichever was higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Secondary efficacy variables included the Average RTSS (ARTSS), individual Average RSSs (ARSSs), Average RMS (ARMS), and overall RQLQ(S) score.</p></sec><sec><title>Birch pollen periods</title><p>The estimated site-specific start and end dates of the 2011 and 2012 birch pollen seasons were supplied by SciCon Pharma Sciences (Vienna, Austria) taking into account historical pollen data and seasons for the various sites. Actual daily pollen counts and pollen graphs of the 2011 and 2012 birch pollen seasons were provided so that the start and end of the pollen seasons at each site were defined before data unblinding. The birch-pollen period at each site was defined as the period covering 90% of the total annual birch-pollen count.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Based on previous birch pollen studies, given an &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and a coefficient of variation of the primary endpoint of 70% (CV&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.70), a sample size of 210 evaluable patients per treatment group would provide 90% power to detect at least a 20% relative mean difference vs. placebo, which is the threshold recommended by the WAO taskforce as clinically relevant for efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Assuming a dropout rate of 12% per year, it was planned to randomize 544 patients (i.e., 272 per treatment group).</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS System&#x000ae; for Windows version 9.1 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The threshold for statistical significance was set at p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and all inferential tests were 2-sided.</p><p>The Full Analysis Sets for Period 1 (FAS<sub>P1</sub>) and Period 2 (FAS<sub>P2</sub>) included all patients who received at least one dose of the investigational product during that period and had at least one AdSS during the corresponding pollen period.</p><p>The primary endpoint (i.e., the AAdSS during the second birch pollen period for the FAS<sub>P2</sub>) was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as main effect, OAS status and pooled centre as stratification variables, and age in categories, gender, asthma status and baseline sensitization status as covariates. The primary efficacy analysis was repeated on the subgroups of patients with and without OAS. ARTSS, ARMS, and ARSSs were analyzed as per the primary efficacy criterion. The RQLQ(S) was analyzed using a linear mixed effects model with the weekly overall RQLQ(S) scores during the birch pollen period as dependent variables and treatment group, week number, baseline RQLQ(S) overall score, pooled centre, OAS status, age, gender, asthma and sensitization status as independent variables.

The need for larger scale studies of sublingual immunotherapy has long been acknowledged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The present study is the largest to date specifically focused on assessing the efficacy and safety of a sublingual solution of birch pollen allergen extract as treatment for allergic rhinitis. After two consecutive pre- and co-seasonal treatment periods, a significant, sustained reduction in symptoms and medication use, measured with the Average Adjusted Symptom Score, was demonstrated for the 300IR dose. The robustness of this finding was supported by the positive results on secondary endpoints including efficacy during the first birch pollen period.</p><p>Evaluation of treatment efficacy included the assessment of patient self-reported quality of life. Each pollen period, a significant difference in RQLQ(S) overall score was observed between active treatment and placebo. For the second pollen period, the adjusted mean difference vs. placebo was greater than 0.5, the intra-patient minimal clinically important difference defined for symptomatic treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Of note, in this study rescue medication was permitted as treatment for severe rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and was used more frequently in the placebo group. Therefore, the true impact of treatment with the sublingual solution of birch pollen allergen extract on patients&#x02019; quality of life as evaluated by the RQLQ was underestimated.</p><p>Randomization was stratified on the presence or absence of OAS. Efficacy of the birch-pollen sublingual solution was similar in the subgroups with and without OAS, with statistically significant reductions in overall symptom scores (i.e., AAdSS) and in the use of rescue medication, compared to placebo, regardless of OAS status.</p><p>As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the pollen count was notably higher during the second pollen season, (peak nearly 2400 grains/m<sup>3</sup>/24&#x000a0;h), compared to the first pollen season (peak at about 1000 grains/m<sup>3</sup>/24&#x000a0;h). In spite of the higher pollen exposure, the relative adjusted mean difference in AAdSS in the active group relative to the placebo group was higher during the second pollen period compared to the first pollen period.</p><p>In this study, birch pollen allergen extract sublingual solution was associated with an acceptable safety profile. There were no reports of anaphylaxis or serious severe laryngopharyngeal reactions. The most frequent adverse events were application site reactions (e.g., oral pruritus and throat irritation). Consistent with the published experience with grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events decreased from the first treatment period to the second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The sustained clinical efficacy over 2&#x000a0;years, favorable safety profile, and ability to administer birch pollen sublingual immunotherapy at home, make this treatment an alternative to subcutaneous immunotherapy for patients with birch pollen-associated ARC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this European study, 4&#x000a0;months of pre-seasonal and co-seasonal treatment with 300IR sublingual solution of birch-pollen extract over 2 consecutive years demonstrated sustained and clinically meaningful efficacy and acceptable safety profile in adults with birch pollen-associated allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Efficacy and safety were shown in the subpopulations of patients with and without oral allergy syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AAdSS: Average Adjusted Symptom Score; AdSS: Adjusted Symptom Score; AE: Adverse event; AIT: Allergen immunotherapy; ANCOVA: Analysis of covariance; ARC: Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis; ARMS: Average Rescue Medication Score; ARTSS: Average Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score; ARSS: Average Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score; CI: Confidence interval; FAS: Full Analysis Set; IR: Index of reactivity; LS: Least square; OAS: Oral allergy syndrome; RMS: Rescue Medication Score; RRTSS: Retrospective Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score; RQLQ(S): Standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire; RTSS: Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score; RSS: Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score; SCIT: Subcutaneous immunotherapy; SE: Standard error; SLIT: Sublingual immunotherapy; TEAE: Treatment-emergent adverse event.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MW was the principal investigator of the study and she also received honoraria for lectures from Stallergenes.
