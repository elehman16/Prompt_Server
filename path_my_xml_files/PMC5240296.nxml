Also, the process of promoting a physical activity intervention for pregnant smokers has not been previously recorded. This study describes the experiences of researchers conducting a randomised controlled trial of physical activity as an aid to smoking cessation during pregnancy and explores how the effectiveness of future interventions could be improved.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two focus groups, with independent facilitators, were conducted with six researchers who had enrolled pregnant smokers in the LEAP trial, provided the interventions, and administered the research measures. Topics included recruitment, retention and how the physical activity intervention for pregnant smokers was delivered and how it was adapted when necessary to suit the women. The focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Five themes emerged related to barriers or enablers to intervention delivery: (1) nature of the intervention; (2) personal characteristics of trial participants; (3) practical issues; (4) researchers&#x02019; engagement with participants; (5) training and support needs. Researchers perceived that participants may have been deterred by the intensive and generic nature of the intervention and the need to simultaneously quit smoking and increase physical activity. Women also appeared hampered by pregnancy ailments, social deprivation, and poor mental health. Researchers observed that their status as health professionals was valued by participants but it was challenging to maintain contact with participants. Training and support needs were identified for dealing with pregnant teenagers, participants&#x02019; friends and family, and post-natal return to smoking.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Future exercise interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy may benefit by increased tailoring of the intervention to the characteristics of the women, including their psychological profile, socio-economic background, pregnancy ailments and exercise preferences. Delivering an effective physical activity intervention for smoking cessation in pregnancy may require more comprehensive training for those delivering the intervention, particularly with regard to dealing with teenage smokers and smokers&#x02019; friends and family, as well as for avoiding post-natal return to smoking.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

Behavioural support can increase smoking cessation rates in pregnancy by only around 6% and additional aids to cessation are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The development of complex smoking cessation interventions during pregnancy have been constrained by limited availability of the process-related data necessary to apply lessons from past studies to improve the design and execution of future studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In particular, process evaluation provides a means to monitor and document the implementation of interventions in order to understand why an intervention was or was not successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Besides considering what was delivered, process evaluation helps us to understand how the intervention was delivered. Ultimately, this information can inform researchers, policy makers and practitioners about how the intervention might be implemented in future. We could only identify a few smoking cessation and pregnancy trials which have reported process data and there was very limited information about the experience of those delivering the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to conduct a process evaluation of the London Exercise And Pregnant smokers (LEAP) randomised controlled trial, focusing on the experiences of the researchers conducting the trial. The main aim of the LEAP study was to assess a physical activity intervention as an aid to smoking cessation during pregnancy. The trial protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] is published elsewhere and the study methods are summarised here: The 785 women participating in the trial were daily smokers, recruited from antenatal clinics in the South East of England at 10 to 24&#x000a0;weeks of gestation. After enrollment participants were randomised (1:1). Those in the physical activity group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;392) were offered 14 sessions, combining supervised treadmill walking with physical activity consultations (including exercise diaries and pedometers to encourage non-supervised exercise), plus six sessions of standard behavioural support for smoking cessation. Those in the control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;393) received six weekly sessions of behavioural support for smoking cessation alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The main findings have been published and there was no significant difference in smoking rates between the two study groups at the end of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>As reported in this paper, we conducted a parallel qualitative-based process evaluation to help understand the challenges associated with trial procedures, and intervention delivery and engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We report here the qualitative results of focus groups used to elicit the experiences of researchers who recruited women to the trial, delivered all the interventions and administered the research measures. Further qualitative work, involving interviewing the pregnant women participating in the trial, will be published elsewhere. The aim of this paper was to use the process evaluation data from LEAP to report the broader lessons learned to improve future physical activity and smoking cessation interventions for pregnant smokers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>A qualitative methodology was chosen for this process evaluation of an RCT as it would allow an in-depth and non-hypothesis approach to investigating the experiences of the researchers involved in the trial. We adopted a qualitative descriptive approach, which is suitable for gathering professionals&#x02019; experiences and involves a rich description of experiences and events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Focus groups were chosen as they allow the study of a group perspective among a particular set of people who share a set of common experiences, especially where the subject of study is little understood and talked about infrequently in day-to-day life or professional practice. It is also a strong method in allowing topics to come to the foreground that might not be talked about in one-to-one settings such as qualitative interviews. As a form of group interview, participants are encouraged to talk to one another: asking questions, exchanging anecdotes and commenting on each other&#x02019;s experiences and points of view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, focus groups are considered particularly valuable when developing and refining health education messages and interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Focus group participants</title><p>Following an invitation from the principal investigator (MU), all six researchers employed on the trial volunteered to participate in both focus groups. The six researchers comprised three midwives (researchers 1, 2 &#x00026; 6 as labelled in results below) and one nurse (researcher 3) all with extensive experience of providing behavioural support for smoking cessation in pregnancy, plus one nurse (researcher 4) and psychologist (researcher 5) without previous experience of providing this support. The researchers had been recruited to work on the trial through an advert in a national newspaper and on university websites.</p><p>Only one of the researchers had experience of recruiting to trials (R3) and none of the researchers had experience of promoting physical activity. All the researchers were trained to NHS Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training standards during a two-day course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], plus two days training in physical activity promotion during pregnancy. Two further researchers who had worked on the trial were approached to participate but were not available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics and consent</title><p>The trial was approved by Wandsworth Research Ethics Committee and trial participants gave written informed consent. For the present study, all six focus group participants were informed about taking part in the evaluation and gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Topic guide and procedure</title><p>Consistent with MRC recommendations for process evaluation, the qualitative data was collected and analysed iteratively so that themes that emerge in early interviews can be explored in later ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Two focus groups were conducted, with the same six researchers, to explore their experience of delivering the intervention. The first focus group was conducted during trial recruitment (June 2012), so that the researchers could report on issues while the trial was active. The second focus group was conducted during the trial follow-up period (January 2013). A topic guide for the first focus group, with open-ended questions, was developed for understanding the researchers&#x02019; perspectives on the trial (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). It focused on recruitment and retention factors (such as timing, methods for contacting potential participants), participant-related factors (such as health problems, social networks); the nature of the RCT (randomisation, use of technology, encourage exercise intervention) and the interaction between researchers and participants.</p><p>The first focus group lasted 60&#x000a0;min, was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Topics discussed included recruitment, retention, exercise intervention and general trial implementation. The discussion was facilitated by a qualitative investigator (ML) not known to the focus group participants and who was not involved with the main trial. In addition, a co-facilitator, who did not take part in the discussion, took field notes of the focus group to provide background information for the transcription and analysis. After an initial analysis of the transcript and notes by three of the authors (NG, EW and MU) several areas were identified for further exploration in the second focus group, these included: exercise (suitability of treadmill exercise for pregnant women, alternate types of exercise such as yoga, Pilates, swimming or group exercises); communication with participants, suitability of the environment (hospital, children&#x02019;s centre, sports centre) and psycho-social aspects of the participants lives which may have affected attendance to sessions or retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The second focus group was also facilitated by a qualitative investigator (NG), again, not known to the participants and not involved in the main trial, with a co-facilitator taking notes. The topic guide for the second focus group is presented as Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. This focus group lasted 90&#x000a0;min, was recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analysis</title><p>The analysis was guided by the framework described by Braun and Clarke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Initial coding was undertaken independently by three investigators: EW (researcher on trial and member of focus groups), NG (lead second focus group) and MU (chief investigator for the trial), by reading and familiarising themselves with the transcripts and developing initial codes from the data. Following this the team assigned codes to lines, sentences and phrases in the transcripts, similar codes were ordered into sub-themes, and then codes and sub-themes ordered to create themes. Themes were then reviewed and refined through discussions (EW, NG, MU) to ensure that they accurately reflect the data and what was said by the participant. This process of investigator triangulation allowed for internal validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>To facilitate data management and analysis, NG used the qualitative software NVivo 9 (NVivo qualitative data analysis software; QSR International Pty Ltd Version 9, 2010). Themes are illustrated by selected anonymised quotes which are characteristic of the data. Reporting of the qualitative data is consistent with RATS (Relevance, Appropriateness, Transparency, Soundness) guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We considered that data saturation was achieved and identified five themes related to the difficulties and resources faced by the researchers delivering a physical activity intervention to pregnant smokers. They were: (1) nature of the intervention, (2) personal characteristics of trial participants, (3) practical issues, (4) researchers&#x02019; engagement with trial participants and (5) training and support needs. In the following report, FG&#x02009;=&#x02009;Focus Group and R refers to the number of the researcher (i.e., 1 to 6 as indicated above).</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Nature of the intervention</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intensive nature of physical activity intervention</title><p>Participants attended a median of 4 out of 14 treatment sessions in the intervention group and 3 out of 6 sessions in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Researchers expressed concern that the supervised treadmill exercise was a significant commitment for trial participants that are pregnant. For example, <italic>&#x0201c;Two sessions per week for an exercise group&#x02026; it was very off-putting&#x02026;&#x0201d;</italic> (R1, FG1). They felt that some trial participants were put off by the treadmill exercise. &#x0201c;<italic>One trial participant said, &#x0201c;It&#x02019;s not working for me, going on the treadmill, let&#x02019;s just chat&#x0201d;.</italic> (R2, FG1). The researchers were cautious about encouraging the women to exercise at higher intensities: <italic>&#x0201c;Some people would go pretty slowly&#x02026; you&#x02019;d try to get them to speed up a bit sometimes&#x0201d;</italic> (R2, FG1) <italic>&#x0201c;I was keen not to overly push them and then put them off.&#x0201d;</italic> (R4, FG1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Lack of tailoring</title><p>Researchers advised that the intervention could have been more tailored to women&#x02019;s preferences (e.g., number of intervention sessions, exercise mode):<italic>&#x0201c;There isn&#x02019;t a &#x02018;one plan fits all&#x02019;, everyone&#x02019;s different.&#x0201d;</italic> (R4, FG1). There was also a concern that there were few opportunities for community-based exercise tailored to pregnancy, beyond the main trial intervention: <italic>&#x0201c;I thought there might be people there [sports centre], personal trainers, who would have had pregnancy training, and there wasn&#x02019;t anybody&#x0201d;</italic> (R2, FG2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Simultaneous behaviour change: stopping smoking and increasing physical activity</title><p>Helping the trial participants to change two health behaviours (stopping smoking and increasing physical activity) simultaneously was seen as challenging: <italic>&#x0201c;Maybe two things was a bit too much. Maybe we should get them to stop smoking or to be fit and then, tackle the other bit.&#x0201d;</italic> (R2, FG2). Conversely, exercise was viewed as a helpful distraction: <italic>&#x0201c;If you&#x02019;re giving up smoking, all you think about is a cigarette. If you&#x02019;re trying to get fitter and do exercise, by not just focusing on the cigarettes&#x02026; sometimes it makes it easier.&#x0201d;</italic> (R4, FG2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Personal characteristics of trial participants</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Socio-economic background</title><p>Trial participants frequently came from deprived backgrounds (including a mixture of factors such as low income, single parenthood, poor housing, unstable partnerships, drug/alcohol abuse, unemployment), which meant that their health was not high on their agenda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This may have made demands that competed with participation in the trial: <italic>&#x0201c;Their lives are so chaotic&#x02026; they find the whole process keeping to appointments difficult.&#x0201d;</italic> (R2, FG1). <italic>&#x0201c;There were a few where their partner was an alcoholic&#x0201d;</italic> (R5, FG2) <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026; they had so many other problems apart from smoking&#x02026;&#x0201d;</italic> (R3, FG2).</p><p>Financial need was also seen as a barrier to attendance: <italic>&#x0201c;They have to have that money in the first place [to travel to appointments] and it&#x02019;s quite expensive, the bus&#x0201d;</italic> (R3, FG2). The cost of exercising, beyond the supervised exercise provided by the study, was also identified as a problem: <italic>&#x0201c;They would often say, &#x02018;Well, I can&#x02019;t afford to go swimming&#x02019;. A lot of them were on income support, and it surprised me why there weren&#x02019;t more initiatives to encourage low incomes into gyms.&#x0201d;</italic> (R4, FG2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Psychological issues</title><p>Researchers reported that many trial participants had an external locus of control and low self-efficacy and this may have affected their confidence for quitting smoking and for attending treatment sessions: <italic>&#x0201c;They haven&#x02019;t done very well at school, they&#x02019;ve gone through bad relationships, and everything is sort of out of their control.&#x0201d;</italic> (R4, FG1). <italic>&#x0201c;People have never said very positive things to them&#x02026; people have been telling them what they&#x02019;ve been doing wrong.&#x0201d;</italic> (R4, FG2).</p><p>Researchers also reported that it was evident from their conversations with women, that some women were depressed but that they often accepted being &#x02018;down&#x02019; as a routine part of life. Researchers found it challenging to know how to address this as it was beyond the focus of the intervention: <italic>&#x0201c;I got very worked up about it [high score on depression questionnaire]. I thought, oh my God, these women are ready to jump off bridges! You don&#x02019;t know if that&#x02019;s going to deter them from coming back, if you start talking about their emotional stability.&#x0201d; (R2, FG2)&#x02026; &#x0201c;There&#x02019;s always the issue, &#x02018;Oh, you&#x02019;re going to get Social Services involved and my baby is going to get taken away!&#x02019;&#x0201d; (R4, FG2)</italic> This issue not only affected participants&#x02019; capacity to work through the trial, but also affected the researchers&#x02019; role of retaining participants at the same time acknowledging their challenging mental health status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Pregnancy trajectories</title><p>For adherence, the stage of pregnancy was considered important: <italic>&#x0201c;They tend to be most enthusiastic at the beginning of a pregnancy, but they were usually very often a bit sick [at] 14&#x000a0;weeks, they were usually over the sickness, they weren&#x02019;t that big&#x02026; by the time they got to 30&#x02013;31 weeks, they weren&#x02019;t keen on doing the exercise (murmurs of agreement)&#x02026; just too heavy.&#x0201d;</italic> (R2, FG2).</p><p>Regarding encouraging the women to adhere to the exercise prescription, the researchers were cautious when women reported any pregnancy related symptoms. For example, early on in the pregnancy &#x0201c;women felt nauseous&#x0201d;; as the pregnancy progressed they found it &#x0201c;painful to walk&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;had anaemia&#x0201d;, and were &#x0201c;limited by backache and pelvic girdle pains&#x0201d;. In more severe cases some women withdrew from the interventions: <italic>&#x0201c;I had a woman who was diagnosed with placenta-previa; as soon as she found out she stopped coming back&#x02026; she&#x02019;s not taking any risk.&#x0201d;</italic> (R1, FG2)</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Practical issues</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Randomization</title><p>Trial randomisation took place in a hospital, a community-based children&#x02019;s centre, or a leisure centre. Researchers used an internet-based system to randomise the women and to complete study forms on-line. This system was often a source of frustration for the researchers as it required a reliable internet connection: <italic>R5: &#x0201c;Even with the good connections, the patient would fill the page up, try and go onto the next page and then, &#x0201c;Oh, what&#x02019;s happened?&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Oh, it&#x02019;s all gone blank; OK, we&#x02019;ll have to start again!&#x0201d; (murmurs of agreement) R3: &#x0201c;Oh, that was so irritating&#x0201d; R5: &#x0201c;Yeah, that was quite embarrassing, because you&#x02019;re just trying to go with the flow of the session, (murmurs of agreement)&#x0201d; R3: &#x0201c;Then if there&#x02019;s no signal from this room, you have to move to another one.&#x0201d; (FG2)</italic>
</p><p>The technical difficulties could affect the important rapport researchers were trying to establish with the trial participants of whom some were particularly vulnerable and therefore more prone to leaving the trial early. Finding an appropriate room, whether for Internet or physical exercise, was often a challenge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Room allocation</title><p>The researchers consistently found it challenging to find a dedicated treatment room: <italic>&#x0201c;We had a room set and organised and just as I started, the hospital said: &#x02018;No, you can&#x02019;t have that room.&#x02019;&#x0201d;</italic> (R4, FG1) <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026; getting tossed out of my room and having patients arrive and I had nowhere to see them, it was hard.&#x0201d; </italic>(R3, FG1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Child care</title><p>Many women were accompanied by children. If available, a cr&#x000e8;che (i.e., child care facility) was offered and paid for. Researchers felt that the women valued this but it was considered costly: <italic>&#x0201c;We could book child care, but that was always very expensive and then they wouldn&#x02019;t turn up and you&#x02019;d still have to pay.&#x0201d;</italic> (R2, FG2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Financial incentives</title><p>Paying the women &#x000a3;7 travel expenses at each visit was viewed as a vital incentive:</p><p>

A hospital location was seen as ideal as it was an easy to find landmark with bus routes stopping at the door and it was felt that women were reassured by the clinical setting: <italic>&#x0201c;They like to come to the hospital&#x02026;&#x0201d;</italic> (R6, FG1) <italic>&#x0201c;They can find the hospital.&#x0201d;</italic> (R2, FG1).

Again, this had a double effect: trial participants positively acknowledged the researcher&#x02019;s professional background, and this background helped the researchers communicate with the trial participants in a patient-centred way, often going beyond their call of duty: <italic>&#x0201c;I would actually make sure that people knew I was a midwife.

The researchers were required to call the women and to offer a place on the trial or offer usual NHS cessation-support. However, they observed that &#x0201c;phoning and leaving verbal messages&#x0201d; was not as effective as texting, either during recruitment or during the ongoing trial: <italic>&#x0201c;The texts were much better&#x02026; they&#x02019;re used to that form of communication, but also because they could think about it.&#x0201d;</italic> (R3, FG2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Deviating from the intervention protocol</title><p>In order to fit the exercise and counselling within the allocated time frame of about an hour, researchers often slightly adapted the trial protocol by providing some of the counselling while the woman was on the treadmill.

I thought there must be something I can do differently, but I never really discovered what that was. But I think there&#x02019;s probably strategies or techniques that work better for younger girls.&#x0201d;</italic> (R2, FG2).</p><p>Researcher said that teenagers often came with a friend and they found it difficult to manage these interactions: <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;which sometimes would mean they&#x02019;d then get a bit giggly and a lot of &#x0201c;in&#x0201d; jokes I probably found it easier if they came on their own, but they probably wouldn&#x02019;t have arrived, they needed support.</italic>&#x0201d; (R2, FG2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Deprivation</title><p>As reported in the section above on &#x02018;Socio-economic background&#x02019;, the researchers often had to deal with women with complex issues related to deprivation and they expressed the need for further training and support for knowing how to deal with these issues, especially when they impacted on smoking cessation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Partners and friends</title><p>Partners and friends who smoked were considered a major barrier to smoking cessation.

This study provides novel insights into researchers&#x02019; perspectives of the intervention and highlights several aspects of the intervention and trial design that may affect recruitment, retention and adherence. The information elicited from the focus groups has many implications for the design of a smoking cessation trial incorporating physical activity for pregnant smokers. It was evident that the trial and its researchers made great efforts to accommodate the needs of the women and that these were generally positively received, including child care provision, re-imbursement of travel expenses, having healthcare professionals deliver the intervention, the choice of venue for appointments and using text messaging as the predominant mode of communication.</p><sec id="Sec36"><title>Simultaneous behaviour change</title><p>Researchers were ambivalent as to whether exercise should be promoted simultaneously as smoking cessation. Similarly, the literature cites wide variation in the timing of exercise programmes for smoking cessation, at least for smokers in general, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In some instances, it has been recommended that exercise and smoking are changed sequentially, rather than simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Of relevance here, there is evidence that smokers who have achieved abstinence have higher confidence for increasing exercise than those only planning or preparing to quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; which supports the notion of increasing exercise when abstinent. However, this might limit the potential for exercise alleviating withdrawal symptoms and cravings in the critical first days and hours of a quit attempt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Hence, others support the notion that a physical activity intervention should commence several weeks before quitting, enabling the smokers to cope with increasing their activity before starting to quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Finally, there is also some indication of quit rates being higher when exercise is increased at the same time as quitting smoking, as opposed to doing this sequentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In regard to pregnant smokers, it may be unrealistic and unethical to expect women to delay quitting while they are taking part in a preparatory exercise programme as they are generally concerned about harm to the foetus during continued smoking; also, health professionals would most likely encourage them to quit as early as possible in their pregnancy, unless there is good evidence that delaying quitting will increase their chances of succeeding. Equally, if the exercise programme is delayed until further into the quit attempt, the woman will lose the potential benefit of exercise for ameliorating the withdrawal symptoms, including strong cravings, which are prominent in the first weeks of abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, as is common with smokers in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and even more so for pregnant smokers, the most beneficial and practical option may be to combine exercise and smoking cessation early in the quitting process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Deprivation and mental health</title><p>In the main report of the trial we observed that 18% of women were classed as depressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], a prevalence which is slightly higher than that reported for pregnant women in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is not surprising, as women who are depressed have an increased likelihood of smoking during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; while, women with mental disorders during pregnancy may have high motivation to quit, but find it extremely challenging to quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Also, there is little data on the effects of smoking cessation interventions during pregnancy among women with poor mental health, as these women are often excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, around three quarters of the women in the present study had low scores for self-efficacy for quitting smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Perhaps this was a reflection of the difficult and deprived lives they had, and may have contributed to preventing them from succeeding at various things throughout their lives. Public health and medical sociology studies have long pointed to the connection between low socio-economic status and poor health outcomes, as well as motivation to invest in health or even seek medical advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Text messaging</title><p>Our observations are consistent with a recent feasibility study showing that text messages have the potential to be used for delivering comprehensive and tailored self-help support for smoking cessation during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], although it is not clear whether text-based support is acceptable and useful for promoting physical activity during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Post-partum return to smoking: Partner and peer support</title><p>The researchers expressed the need for more support for preventing postpartum return to smoking. It is well known that a substantial proportion of women who quit smoking during pregnancy will return to smoking in postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Few smoking cessation trials provide and document support for preventing postpartum return to smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and extension of the period of support for women to stop smoking into postpartum has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There are various reasons for postpartum return to smoking, including having a partner who smokes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A review concluded that eliciting peer and partner support is positive and can support women to stop smoking, but is a challenge to put into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Many pregnant smokers suspend their smoking for the duration of pregnancy or they commit to &#x02018;temporary abstinence&#x02019; for pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Whilst, younger women are generally unaware of the specific impact of smoking on their developing baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This demonstrates the need to target information specifically to different groups of women depending on age, social support and decision-making processes particularly in the time after they have given birth. Several small studies of peer support for smoking cessation in pregnancy have produced promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], especially in teenagers, and larger more rigorous studies need to be conducted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Lessons learned: a summary of what worked well</title><p>Text messaging proved an effective form of communicating with the women.

</p><p>Pedometers, worn by participants in the physical activity arm of this trial, received positive reviews. Women enjoyed wearing the pedometers, particularly because they could see the immediate results of their efforts (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At each support session, participating women were encouraged to increase their step count by about 10%. This proved beneficial as many women either met or exceeded their step-goals. These findings are consistent with findings from a recent systematic review in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] which showed that pedometer users increased their physical activity by almost 2500 steps per day more than control participants. Pedometers have been shown to increase activity levels in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and have been shown to be acceptable during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and among pregnant smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] .</p><p>The financial incentives (i.e., &#x000a3;7 travel payment for each session attended) seemed to facilitate intervention attendance, particularly amongst the women from deprived backgrounds, which seemed to mainly be attending for this reason (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This finding is consistent with reviews of financial incentives in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and with the findings of a recent UK-based trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], in which women receive incentives on confirmation of successful abstinence from smoking.</p><p>To aid accessibility, three different treatment venues were offered, including being offered children&#x02019;s centres based in deprived areas. Participants generally preferred to attend in hospitals. An intervention may have different effects in different contexts, even if its implementation is the same or very similar across contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], although in this case our quantitative work did not show any difference in smoking abstinence according to the context (i.e., venue) in which the intervention was delivered. We can only consider why the women preferred attending at the hospital and this appeared to be because of the central location and a preference for a clinical environment. Hospitals are more often associated with antenatal care and in a hospital setting participants may find it easier to make the link between stopping smoking and their unborn baby&#x02019;s health. It is not clear what other steps could be taken to encourage women from deprived backgrounds to attend appointments. Pregnant smokers generally prefer one-to-one to group support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and offering home visits may have increased attendance, but it was impractical and costly to offer this on an extensive basis.</p><p>Researchers presenting themselves to the women more as health professionals than as exercise specialists appeared to facilitate the women&#x02019;s engagement with the exercise programme. Unlike the previous points, this approach had not been foreseen in the trial procedure, but was recognised by the researchers whilst undertaking the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Lessons learned: summary of what worked less well</title><p>Researchers were hesitant to encourage women to exercise at higher intensities and were often at a loss for how to adapt the exercise to the different stages of pregnancy and to pregnancy related symptoms, such as nausea, backache and fatigue (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Intensity has been cited as the most difficult component of an exercise regimen to prescribe for pregnant women with current guidelines suggesting that there is no need to adapt exercise for pregnant women with no medical or obstetric complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Many women in this trial did not experience complications during the trial, however they had gained weight and their bodies were changing on a weekly basis. Therefore, it may be unrealistic to expect pregnant women to follow the same exercise guidelines as non-pregnant women.</p><p>The researchers felt that the frequency of visits (14 sessions for the intervention group vs 6 sessions for the control group) was too high, and that face-to-face support may need to be combined with self-help strategies (e.g., self-help manuals and digital support such as text messaging, phone apps and websites) (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). There is evidence that self-help interventions are effective for smoking cessation during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and text message support may be an appropriate intervention in this context (see comments above).</p><p>Researchers agreed that more training targeted specifically to teenagers and women from deprived backgrounds would have been beneficial (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Specifically, researchers would have found it useful to have more and specific information on the following: (i) how to talk to teenagers about smoking (a study by Hill and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]) with young pregnant smokers has highlighted similar findings, with midwives agreeing that having resources relevant to teens would make talking to them easier); (ii) how to deal with complex issues related to deprivation (e.g., drug/alcohol abuse, poor housing) which have an impact on smoking cessation, (iii) how to manage sessions when a friend, partner or other family member, was present (iv) Those delivering a physical activity intervention may also benefit from training to be more confident about what is reasonable to expect of women at different stages of pregnancy or with different complications. Further research is needed on this topic, while noting that each pregnancy is different and one approach will not suit all women. Interventions, as well as expectations, may need to be tailored for individual women.</p><sec id="Sec42"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The major strength of this paper is the provision of novel and detailed information from researchers on how to effectively deliver and adapt an exercise intervention for pregnant smokers. The results are strengthened by the provision of the researchers&#x02019; views on two separate occasions seven months apart. All researchers&#x02019; in the first focus group also participated in the second focus group. Conducting two focus groups allowed further exploration of issues identified in the first focus group; this also generated richer data. Furthermore, those taking part in the focus groups could be considered as experts; all the researchers had substantial experience in implementing the trial and delivering the intervention as they had been in post for approximately three years at the time of the first focus group. One of the researchers contributed to the analysis and it was felt that this &#x0201c;insider view&#x0201d; aided the interpretation of the findings, which is in line with participatory research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>There is limited data on how, in practice, smoking cessation specialists promote changes in multiple health behaviours and, specifically, how physical activity is encouraged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This study sheds some light on this, albeit with the focus being on pregnant smokers. It is important to acknowledge that this intervention, and associated process evaluation data, were focussed on pregnant women in the UK and in London specifically; however, the women in the trial were generally representative of women who smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The findings of this qualitative evaluation could be transferable to primary and secondary care settings in the UK, although the findings may be less relevant to smokers outside the UK.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec43" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings add to the limited process data available concerning the challenges of implementing smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women. The results recognise that we are dealing with a particularly vulnerable group of women from deprived backgrounds. In this context, future studies can learn from the data presented here, combined with qualitative data in which the women are encouraged to share their experience of the trial and interventions (to be published elsewhere), in considering how interventions can be further tailored to the women&#x02019;s needs. In addition, future studies need to consider providing more comprehensive training for those delivering the intervention, both to deal with deprivation related issues as well as dealing with other under researched challenges such as catering for teenage smokers, managing smokers&#x02019; friends and family who attend cessation sessions, and offering advice about avoiding post-natal return to smoking.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec44"><title>Additional file</title><p>
