Although fatigue may be a presenting symptom, CRF occurs more commonly during treatment, with 30% continuing to experience fatigue after treatment is completed.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Cancer treatment-related fatigue generally improves after therapy is completed, but some level of fatigue may persist for months or years following treatment. Research indicates that for at least a subset of patients, fatigue may be a significant issue long into survivorship.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The etiology of CRF most likely involves the dysregulation of several interrelated physiological, biochemical, and psychological systems. Factors related to the development of CRF include serotonin dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis dysfunction, circadian rhythm disruption, muscle metabolism/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dysregulation, and cytokine dysregulation. Comorbid conditions such as anemia, cachexia, and depression have an incremental effect on CRF.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>CRF has a profound impact on patients' lives. Indeed, CRF has been rated as more troublesome and to have a greater negative impact on patients' daily activities and QOL than other cancer-related symptoms, including pain, depression, and nausea.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>For the management of CRF both pharmacologic and nonpharmacological interventions is available. Pharmacological intervention includes psychostimulants, corticosteroids, and exercises (e.g., individually tailored walking, cycling, or swimming programs), and modification of activity (e.g., naps during morning and early afternoon), assessment of sleep patterns, stress management and cognitive therapies, and adequate nutrition and hydration are nonpharmacological methods of dealing with fatigue.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest treating any identifiable conditions &#x02013; for example, anemia or insomnia. If these treatments do not work, or if no potentially causative factor can be identified, the guidelines suggest a variety of possible approaches. One of the recommended nonpharmacological approaches is increased activity. Activity and exercise may reduce both the physical effects and the psychological stress connected with cancer treatments, improve mood, and reduce anxiety and fear in patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>CRF frequently results from muscle metabolism/ATP dysregulation caused by cancer treatment. The muscle cells obtain energy for work through two metabolic pathways. In the first one, carbohydrates and fats are completely oxidized to water and carbon dioxide in the mitochondria; the energy obtained is stored in the cells as ATP. This process can only be carried out in the presence of oxygen and is therefore called aerobic. When the oxygen supply is reduced, the cells produce energy through the second metabolic pathway, called anaerobic glycolysis. In this process, glucose is incompletely metabolized, resulting in the production of ATP and lactic acid. The effects of physical activity are not limited to better cardiovascular or muscular function. Indeed, the improvement of physical performance can increase the feeling of control, independence, and self-esteem of patients; this improved self-confidence can result in better social interaction and a reduction in anxiety and fear. Therefore, physical activity also can result in secondary benefits, such as an improved mood state.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] There is also some evidence suggesting that physical activity can have an effect on the immune system.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The American College of Sports Medicine defines aerobic exercise as &#x0201c;any activity that uses large muscle groups, can be maintained continuously, and is rhythmic in nature.&#x0201d; There is a literature on the effects of exercise on cancer rehabilitation, especially for breast cancer patients, on whom the majority of research has been conducted. Only a limited number of formal scientific studies to see the benefits of aerobic exercise on CRF in patients with solid tumor after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy have been carried out. This study tries to look for the actual benefits of aerobic exercise on fatigue, physical performance, and QOL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients both male and female with cancer-related fatigue after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy between ages 35 and 70 years and willing to participate were included in the study.

The evaluation included a detailed history and physical examination to identify any medical problems which would limit participation in exercise. Screening of CRF was performed according to recommended algorithm of the NCCN. Each patient was screened for the presence and severity of fatigue. The rating was done on a 0&#x02013;10 scale, with 0 being &#x0201c;no fatigue&#x0201d; and 10 &#x0201c;the worst fatigue imaginable.&#x0201d; A score of 1&#x02013;3 indicated the presence of mild fatigue that did not require clinical intervention so were advised for general strategies to manage fatigue, i.e., energy conservation. The scores of 4&#x02013;6 and 7&#x02013;10 indicated moderate and severe fatigue, respectively, and needed clinical intervention.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] A total of 55 patients underwent screening for the presence and severity of fatigue. After finding suitability as per inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 candidates were selected and requested to participate in the study.

Patients were randomly included (using chit method) in the groups, 17 each in both the interventional group A in the control group B for 6 weeks.</p><p>Intervention group A received aerobic exercise program which comprised of a warm up period, aerobic exercise period (conditioning period) and a cool down period.</p><p>The warm up period included 10-min of mild total body movement and exercises, including walking (light-rate of perceived exertion on Borg scale). The aerobic exercise period[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] included low to moderate intensity exercise and the intensity was determined based on maximum heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion. Aerobic training was performed at 50%&#x02013;70% of maximum HR (maximum HR was considered to be 220 &#x02212; age), so for the lower limit of HR training range (low target HR = HR maximum &#x000d7; 0.50) and for the upper limit of HR training range (high target HR = HR maximum &#x000d7; 0.70) and rate of perceived exertion 11&#x02013;13 on the Borg scale. Duration of exercise was 20&#x02013;40 min/day and the frequency was 5 days/week.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Aerobic exercise program included walking on a treadmill and following an interval training pattern. During the 1<sup>st</sup> week, exercise duration was a 3-min bout 5 times during the week.

Cancer-related fatigue was measured with the brief fatigue inventory (BFI) which is patient-report instrument with established reliability and validity commonly used in studies of CRF. The BFI allows for the rapid assessment of fatigue in cancer patients and identifies those patients with severe fatigue as well as its impact on their ability to function over the previous 24 h. The BFI consists of nine items, measured on 0&#x02013;10 numeric rating scales. Three items in the BFI ask the patients to rate the severity of their fatigue at its &#x0201c;worst,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;usual,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;now&#x0201d; during normal waking hours, with 0 being &#x0201c;no fatigue and 10 being &#x0201c;fatigue as bad as you can imagine.&#x0201d; Six items assesses the amount that fatigue has interfered with different aspects of the patient's life during the past 24 h. The interference items include general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work (includes both work outside the home and housework), relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. The interference items are measured on a 0&#x02013;10 scale, with 0 being &#x0201c;does not interfere and 10 being &#x0201c;completely interferes&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and English or Gujarati version of BFI was used.</p><p>The physical function was assessed using the 6-min walk test (6MWT) which assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity as most activities of daily living are performed at submaximal levels of exertion, so 6-min walk distance (6MWD) reflects the functional exercise level for daily physical activities. The 6MWT should be performed indoors, along a long, flat, straight, enclosed corridor with a hard surface that is seldom traveled. The walking course should be 30 m in length. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in 6 min. It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The QOL was assessed using the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general (FACT-G). This questionnaire is one of the most widely used instruments for QOL assessment of patients with cancer. The FACT-G questionnaire is a self-reported instrument that measures multidimensional QOL using a total of 29 items in the following five specific life domains: (1) Physical well-being (7 items), (2) social well-being (7 items), (3) emotional well-being (6 items), and (4) functional well-being (7 items). The patients were asked to indicate how true each statement was for them during the past week on a 5-point ordinal scale where 0 indicates not at all; 1, a little bit; 2, somewhat; 3, quite a bit; and 4, very much. The score of each domain (possible range, 0&#x02013;28 for physical well-being, 0&#x02013;28 for social well-being, 0&#x02013;24 for emotional well-being, 0&#x02013;28 for functional well-being, higher scores indicate better QOL and the total score of all domains (possible range, 0&#x02013;108) were computed for each assessment and English or Hindi version of FACT-G was used.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data analyses</title><p>No differences were found in baseline sociodemographic and medical characteristics between the 34 patients who were included then divided equally into intervention group A and control group B.

Biological mechanisms evidence suggests that exercise may serve as a protective mechanism against the detrimental effects of proinflammatory cytokines by balancing the ratio of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This protective mechanism may theoretically explain the positive effect of exercise in persons with cancer, and thus, it is included in the proposed theoretical model. Psychobehavioral mechanisms related to CRF that are theoretically sensitive to physical exercise include psychological distress and sleep disturbances. Functional Mechanisms evidence suggests that exercise improves physical functioning and functional capacity in persons with cancer.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The results of this study showed that patients reported statistically significant reductions in CRF after completion of the aerobic exercise.

Prolonged inactivity following surgery and adjuvant therapy exacerbates physical debilitation leading to increased fatigue with even minor exertion.
