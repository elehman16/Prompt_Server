The cumulative 10-year incidence of gastroparesis has been estimated to affect 5.2% of people with type 1 diabetes and 1% of people with type 2 diabetes, in contrast to &#x0223c;0.2% of community control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Longitudinal studies show that despite improvement in glycemic control, once established, delayed gastric emptying (DGE) persists for at least a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This affects morbidity of the disease, so that even though patients do not necessarily die of the gastroparesis, they have greater morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The treatment of diabetic gastroparesis is suboptimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>); the only approved drug is metoclopramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), which may be associated with significant neurologic and endocrine side effects. Regulatory agencies have recommended treatment of this life-long condition with no more than 3 months of metoclopramide. In some countries, other medications, such as substituted benzamides (e.g., cisapride or itopride) or dopaminergic agents (e.g., domperidone), are approved and used to provide symptom relief. Unapproved alternatives are erythromycin (most effective in the acute setting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), intrapyloric injection of botulinum toxin (despite the only randomized trials showing no evidence of efficacy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), venting gastrostomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) with enteral feeding, and gastric electrical stimulation (GES). A systematic analysis of the published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) noted that the greatest efficacy of GES was observed in open-label treatment trials. The most recent controlled trial of GES showed no evidence of efficacy in the crossover phase of the trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Some patients are so incapacitated that gastrectomy is recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Ghrelin is the natural ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue-1a (GHS-1a) receptor and a potential target for treatment of impaired gastric motility and energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In pharmacodynamic (PD) studies using ultrasonography, ghrelin accelerated gastric emptying (GE) of nutrient liquids in patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>); ghrelin accelerated GE of solids (reviewed in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) when administered at pharmacological doses. Although ghrelin induced inhibition of gastric accommodation, there was no increase in upper gastrointestinal symptoms with pharmacological doses of ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In addition, in a study that used a dose of exogenous ghrelin that stimulated growth hormone (GH) release in the physiological range in human subjects, there were no significant effects of intravenous bolus synthetic human ghrelin (0.33 &#x003bc;g/kg) on gastric accommodation, emptying, or aggregate postprandial symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The ghrelin analog TZP-101 in diabetic gastroparesis slightly reduced the GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of solids by &#x0223c;20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Thus, the potential for ghrelin receptor agonists to normalize GE in people with diabetes is far from clear.</p><p>RM-131 is a novel pentapeptide that acts as a potent ghrelin receptor agonist. RM-131 has similar characteristics to native ghrelin but 100-fold greater potency in reversing gastric ileus in animal models. In a rat model of postoperative ileus, RM-131 effectively reversed gastric ileus; in addition, RM-131 was highly effective in reversing postsurgical, opiate-induced gastric ileus in rats. In normal, nonsurgical primates, RM-131 also increased the rate of GE (data on file; Rhythm Pharmaceuticals). In healthy humans, the estimated half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) for RM-131 acceleration of GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> was &#x0223c;0.49 ng/mL (unpublished data).</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the PD and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of RM-131 in patients with type 2 diabetes and prior documentation of both symptoms and DGE.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Design</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo&#x02013;controlled, single-dose, two-period, crossover study during period 1, September to 30 November 2011, in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes and prior documentation of DGE. Patients with type 2 diabetes were chosen to establish a well-defined patient population, as disease prevalence and PD/PK profiles of RM-131 may differ among those with type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetic gastroparesis was defined by the presence of both the following criteria: <italic>1</italic>) at least a 3-month past or current history of symptoms of gastroparesis (e.g., postprandial fullness, early satiety, bloating, postprandial nausea/vomiting, and epigastric or abdominal pain); and <italic>2</italic>) previously documented DGE by scintigraphy using a radiolabeled egg meal or by GE breath test within the past 10 years. Specifically, identification of DGE was based on either 60% retained at 2 h or 10% retained at 4 h on the scintigraphic GE test.</p><p>Patients were enrolled and, during period 1, received a subcutaneous injection of RM-131 or placebo (5% mannitol), which had identical appearance. After a 7-day washout period, patients crossed over to receive the alternative therapy in period 2. Patients were randomly allocated to a treatment sequence by a computer-generated allocation schedule. Patients were allowed antiemetics and prokinetics (e.g., metoclopramide or erythromycin), but doses of these drugs had to be stable for at least 2 weeks prior to period 1 and remain stable during the study. Consistent with the ethical review that patients should not be withdrawn from medication that may have been contributing to their health, only 2 of the 10 patients were receiving another medication for gastroparesis during the conduct of the crossover study: one on metoclopramide and one on domperidone. The doses of these medications were constant throughout both phases of the study. The study was conducted on an outpatient basis in the Clinical Research Unit at the Mayo Clinic. The participants, all members of the research team, and the study statistician were blinded to the interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>After approval by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board and after signed, written, informed consent, patient study eligibility was confirmed by medical history, physical examination (including vital signs and height and weight measurements), concomitant medication review, and clinical laboratory tests, including a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The presence of normal sinus arrhythmia was used as an indicator of normal cardiovagal function. Patients recorded gastrointestinal cardinal symptoms daily diary (GCSI-DD) entries for one full day during screening. Male and female patients 18&#x02013;60 years of age, meeting specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, were eligible for enrollment. Although age between 18 and 60 years does not appear to influence GE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), there is evidence that age &#x0003e;60 years delays GE of solids and 5% glucose drinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Patients were required to have a diagnosis of type 2 diabetic gastroparesis (see above), controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;8.5%), previous exclusion of upper gastrointestinal mechanical obstruction, and BMI = 18&#x02013;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Women were required to be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or not pregnant and using an acceptable form of birth control. Men were required to agree to abstinence throughout the study.</p><p>After screening, patients reported to the Clinical Research Unit in the fasted state on day 1 for period 1 dosing and for PD, PK, and safety evaluations. PD evaluations included upper GI motility evaluation by scintigraphy. After obtaining pretreatment samples, a single dose of RM-131 or placebo was injected subcutaneously. Thirty minutes after subcutaneous administration of the study drug, a standardized radiolabeled study meal was administered, which patients were asked to consume within 10 min. The study meal consisted of the following: 4 oz. of scrambled Egg Beaters that had been radiolabeled with 0.5&#x02013;1.0 mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc sulfur colloid; 120 mL of water that had been radiolabeled with 100 &#x003bc;Ci of <sup>111</sup>In diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid; and two slices of white bread with strawberry jam. Gamma scans were obtained immediately after completion of the study meal through 6 h postmeal. Postinjection blood sampling for postdose GH, insulin (in patients not receiving exogenous insulin), prolactin, and cortisol levels were collected. PK was also collected through 6 h postdose. Patients were discharged from the Clinical Research Unit after the final scintigraphic scan (6 h postmeal). Safety evaluations included the measurement of vital signs and assessment for adverse events on day 1. Patients were also contacted by phone on day 2 to evaluate for adverse events. Concomitant medication review was conducted at screening and at every study visit.</p><p>After the washout period, patients returned to the Clinical Research Unit in the fasted state for period 2 day 1 dosing, according to the same procedures as in period 1. After the follow-up phone calls on period 2 day 2, patients were terminated from the study.</p><p>Patients were required to fast overnight on the day preceding study drug administration. They were allowed to take their usual morning study medications (except those for treatment of diabetes) with a sip of water on the morning of study drug administration. Oral agents for the treatment of diabetes were administered with the study meal. Patients on insulin were instructed to bring their insulin and glucometer to the study center on day 1, periods 1 and 2. Patients were instructed to self-administer their usual morning insulin injections, prorated based on meal caloric content. This self-administration occurred within 10 min after the consumption of the study meal.</p><p>The dose level of 100 &#x003bc;g RM-131 was chosen based on the safety, tolerability, PK profile, and PD profile (GE breath test) established in a phase 1 single-ascending dose study of healthy normal volunteers (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Measurement of GE of solids and liquids and small bowel transit</title><p>Validated scintigraphy was used to evaluate GE and colonic filling at 6 h (CF6) of solids after a standardized meal (administered 30 min postdosing and consumed within 10 min).

From the observed subject-specific differences in the end-point responses, the percent difference between the two treatment groups, relative to the overall subject-specific mean values of the RM-131 and placebo values, was also calculated (see above). For the analysis of period 1 data, the percent difference in the primary end point (GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) was calculated as 100 times the difference in treatment group means divided by the overall subjects&#x02019; mean.

Numerical improvements were also observed in mean GE <italic>t</italic><sub>lag</sub> solid, mean GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> liquid, and mean CF6 with RM-131 compared with placebo; the study was not powered for these secondary end points. With placebo treatment, the mean GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> solid (127.8 &#x000b1; 18.6 min) was &#x0003e;117 min, the 90th percentile observed in 123 HVs with the same radiolabeled meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), suggesting that at least 50% had delayed GE when tested. Results also confirm the prokinetic effects of RM-131; in a rat model of postoperative ileus, RM-131 effectively reversed gastric ileus with greater potency than human ghrelin. It was also highly effective in the reversal of postsurgical, opiate-induced gastric ileus and increased GE in primates (data on file; Rhythm Pharmaceuticals) and in healthy males in a single ascending dose study (by GE breath test; data on file; Rhythm Pharmaceuticals).</p><p>It is worth noting that these PD results demonstrate a magnitude of the effect on GE even with a single-dose study that has not been previously observed with other ghrelin agonists. Investigation of the ghrelin agonist TZP-101 by Wo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) demonstrated improvement in nausea/vomiting subscale scores as well as overall gastroparesis symptoms among patients with diabetes gastroparesis, but postdose GE data was not presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Prior experience with TZP-101 demonstrated an &#x0223c;20&#x02013;25% effect on GE in a subset analysis, in contrast to the &#x0223c;65% effect observed in the entire cohort in this study with RM-131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In fact, the magnitude of this effect is similar to that previously observed in response to intravenous erythromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, the average percent retained in the stomach at 60 min in 10 patients with diabetic gastroparesis was 85% on placebo and 21% on intravenous erythromycin for an estimated effect of 75% relative to placebo.</p><p>Assessment of RM-131 effects on endocrine PD parameters, including GH, prolactin, and cortisol levels, demonstrated expected postdrug increases after a single administration of the ghrelin analog. Indeed, these responses are similar to those observed with a single dose of acylated ghrelin (1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg) administered as a bolus intravenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Ghrelin injection in humans has been found to stimulate ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, and GH secretion in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>); these actions are thought to be mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In repeated-dose administration studies of RM-131, the effect on hormonal end points was substantially less after 7 days of administration, without any reduction in the efficacy of RM-131&#x02019;s acceleration of GE (data on file; Rhythm Pharmaceuticals). However, long-term efficacy and safety studies are clearly necessary.</p><p>Consistent with prior data, RM-131 was associated with higher 120-min blood glucose compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07), reflecting the faster GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> with delivery of nutrients to the small bowel for absorption. There was no significant change in 4-h insulin levels. Such effects may also be mediated by direct effects on the regulation of glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Erratic emptying from the stomach, resulting in a mismatch between the dose of insulin administered and the nutrients emptied and absorbed in the upper gut may lead to poor glycemic control, poor compliance with treatment due to fear of hypoglycemia, and deterioration of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Hence, normalizing GE may result in improved glycemic control because of a more predictable appearance of glucose in the portal circulation, matching the action of the hypoglycemic therapy. More detailed clinical evaluation of the effects of RM-131 on glucose metabolism in diabetic patients is warranted in future studies.</p><p>A defined baseline symptom score was not a criterion for study participation. Participants were required to have a 3-month history of at least one of the following four cardinal symptoms: postprandial fullness/early satiety, bloating, nausea/vomiting, or epigastric/abdominal pain. No significant association with RM-131 was noted for total GCSI-DD score or composite score for nausea, bloating, or postprandial fullness and pain; the absence of a significant association in our study is not unexpected as there has been little evidence to demonstrate that GE is associated with symptom severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Multiple additional mechanisms, including impaired accommodation and visceral hypersensitivity, may contribute to upper GI symptoms in patients with documented DGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). It is conceivable that RM-131 may improve symptoms, based on enhanced GE of solids. Although it is also conceivable that an increase in gastric tone, as described with exogenous ghrelin in healthy participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), might aggravate some postprandial symptoms, Ang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) did not record increased postprandial symptoms, despite reduced accommodation with ghrelin. Further characterization of the effects of RM-131 on gastric accommodation is needed. The management of diabetic dyspepsia may require the correction of GE hypersensitivity and impaired accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The safety and tolerability of RM-131 were consistent with other preliminary investigations of the medication. Although adverse events were more common with RM-131 than with placebo when taking any and all patient-reported events into consideration, no serious adverse effects were noted. The most frequently reported adverse event with RM-131 was light-headedness or dizziness, which was more commonly reported on RM-131 compared with placebo. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were recorded, no adverse events required clinical intervention, and all adverse events resolved spontaneously. The PK of RM-131 in DGE patients was very similar to a small cohort of HVs studied in the RM-131 single ascending dose study at the same dose. <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was &#x0223c;4 ng/mL, which is substantially higher than the estimated EC<sub>50</sub> for GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (0.49 ng/mL) from a PK-PD model that was constructed from data in the RM-131 multiple ascending dose study (data on file; Rhythm Pharmaceuticals).</p><p>This investigation identified the presence of a significant order effect where patients receiving RM-131 first had faster GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, whereas in patients receiving placebo first, this effect was much more modest. Although the treatment effect on GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> solid was observed with RM-131 when the placebo came first, this effect was not statistically significant. Such an order effect was also noted for CF6, which may have masked overall treatment effect. This effect may be a result of a significant placebo effect upon study initiation, which is a common phenomenon in gastrointestinal disease and can be observed in both subjective and objective markers of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, an analysis of the period 1 GE data only, which provided an unbiased assessment of treatment effects, fully confirmed the significant drug effect for GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> solid, GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> liquid, and CF6. This period 1 assessment serves and demonstrates the efficacy of RM-131 in the acceleration of GE as measured by GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> solids, and the mean difference in GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for RM-131 compared with placebo ranged from 61 (parallel group, <italic>n</italic> = 5) to 66% (crossover, <italic>n</italic> = 10).</p><p>Although we had not a priori excluded males from participation, the fact that the first 10 patients fulfilling eligibility criteria were women is advantageous since there is a significant sex-related difference in GE of solids. This is well illustrated in a recent paper from our research group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) in a cohort consisting of 105 males and 214 females. Thus, sex (but not age or BMI) was significantly associated with GE <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; females, 127.6 &#x000b1; 28.7 [SD] min; males, 109.9 &#x000b1; 28.6 min). However, significant effects on the GE of solids in healthy males were demonstrated in a separate study (RM-131 Multiple Ascending Dose Study; data on file, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals), suggesting that the results reported in the current study would likely be generalizable between sexes.</p><p>A potential pitfall of this study is that patients&#x02019; symptoms were low to moderate (group mean score, 1.32) at baseline, as measured by average GCSI-DD total score, and even lower during the placebo treatments (group mean score, 0.75). The low level of symptom scores in the study at baseline (a &#x0201c;floor effect&#x0201d;) made it difficult to assess any effect of the medication on symptoms; the primary goals of the current study were to assess PK and PD effects. In addition, although gastroparesis often develops in patients who have had diabetes for at least 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), only 4 of 10 patients in our study had diabetes for at least that duration. It is possible that patients in our study represented those with milder disease. Applicability to patients with severe and symptomatic gastroparesis is limited and will require further investigation.</p><p>In summary, PD investigation of a single administration of RM-131 reveals that it is effective in greatly accelerating GE in patients with type 2 diabetes and DGE, similar to the known effects of intravenous erythromycin in patients hospitalized with gastroparesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These observations support the need for further clinical investigation of this promising and novel pharmacological agent in the medium- and long-term for the treatment of symptoms in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Future studies will also be necessary in patients with type 1 diabetes, which differs in disease prevalence of gastroparesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and may also differ in responsiveness to treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
