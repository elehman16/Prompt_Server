Understanding peoples&#x02019; behaviors is the basis for the initiation of targeted interventions to improve the quality of care for people with dementia. Furthermore, case conferences demonstrate positive effects on burnout, dementia-specific burden, and vocational action competence of the staff. The two likely approaches for conducting case conferences include the following: A) using a structured assessment instrument, which guides the staff in understanding the residents&#x02019; behaviors and B) using a narrative approach in which the staff must identify the reasons for the residents&#x02019; behaviors in an unstructured manner. Case conferences are a complex intervention, and evaluating their multiple effects is challenging. The aim of this study protocol was to describe a likely solution for evaluating this type of complex intervention using a special cluster randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this stepped-wedged cluster randomized trial, the two interventions will be sequentially implemented every three months in a group of 12 nursing homes (clusters) with a minimum of 360 residents over 19&#x000a0;months (7&#x000a0;months of intervention for each cluster and follow-up). The primary outcome is the reduction of challenging behavior (measured with the neuropsychiatric inventory-nursing home version [NPI-NH]). Secondary outcomes are residents&#x02019; quality of life, prescription of psychotropic medications, staff burnout, dementia-related stress, and vocational action competence. The effectiveness of the study will be accompanied by a process evaluation. The primary data will be analyzed using a Bayesian mixed effect model; the secondary data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and mixed effects models.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The implementation and effect measurement of complex interventions such as case conferences within a cluster randomized trial are challenging (e.g., complex and intensive training, delayed treatment effect).

Challenging behavior influences both the quality of life of individuals with dementia and the caring situation of the caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The staff in nursing homes are confronted with demanding and complex care situations daily, which is associated with staff distress and burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Because pharmacological treatments yield only moderate benefits and adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], safe and effective psychosocial interventions are needed to manage the challenging behavior of people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Challenging behavior can be understood as a response to unmet needs. Therefore, the key prerequisite for person-centered management of challenging behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and initiation of individualized interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] is the search for causes of challenging behavior. However, understanding the underlying causes and triggers of challenging behavior is both demanding and complex and requires unique skills. Case conferences (CCs) provide opportunities for care teams to practice reflective communication, to engage in problem-solving with residents, to grow professionally, and to provide and receive emotional support for difficult work situations. The aim is to create a common understanding of a case. Although CCs are recommended for use in dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], there is still a lack of evidence to support their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The few studies that have been performed in the field of dementia have demonstrated that CCs reduce challenging behavior in people with dementia, positively influence vocational action competence, and reduce the staff&#x02019;s work-related burden in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, due to the poor methodological quality of these studies, the results must be carefully interpreted. The studies highlight the need for methodologically well-designed intervention studies to provide more conclusive evidence of the effects of CCs on the care of people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Two different approaches to CCs are most commonly described in the literature, which differ primarily in the standardization of approaches for identifying the causes of challenging behavior in people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One approach follows a standardized method of using assessment instruments and guidance in the diagnostic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The other approach supports an open-thinking method for determining the potential causes of challenging behavior rather than relying on assessment instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The effect of using a standardized assessment instrument to understand the process of challenging behavior is not clear, and the advantages of an open approach (without a standardized assessment) have not been explored in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this cluster-randomized trial is to assess the effect of two different types of dementia-specific CCs, focusing on challenging behavior.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The primary research question of the effectiveness study</title><p>The primary research question is: do the two different types of CCs have an effect on the prevalence of challenging behavior in people with dementia in nursing homes?</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The secondary questions</title><p>Secondary research questions include the following: do the two different types of CCs have an effect on 1) quality of life of people with dementia in nursing homes; 2) use of psychotropic medications for people with dementia in nursing homes; 3) burnout and work-related stress of the staff who care for people with dementia in nursing homes; and 5) vocational action competence of staff who care for people with dementia in nursing homes?</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The cluster, randomized, controlled trial will be conducted using a stepped-wedge design (SWD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study, twelve different nursing homes (clusters) will participate in the study. Both interventions, (A) the Wittener model of CCs for people with dementia - the innovative dementia-oriented assessment tool (WELCOME-IdA) and (B) the Wittener model of CCs for people with dementia - the narrative approach (WELCOME-NEO), will be rolled out sequentially and in parallel every 3&#x000a0;months to two nursing homes (groups 1 to 4) over a period of 19&#x000a0;months, and the type of intervention will be randomly allocated (WELCOME-IdA will be allocated to six clusters and WELCOME-NEO will be allocated to six clusters). The last group (group 5) will contain four, instead of two, clusters because two clusters serve as reserves in case a cluster drops out during the intervention study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The primary intervention (training and performing CCs) takes 7&#x000a0;months, followed by a follow-up period that lasts until the end of the data collection in all of the clusters. Thus, each cluster will have the same length of intervention but different lengths of pre-intervention time and follow-up time.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Due to the logistical, timing, and financial aspects of the study, we plan to recruit five nursing homes per intervention arm; we feel optimistic in obtaining informed consent to participate in our study from at least 30 residents per home (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;150). Six time points in addition to baseline will be needed to ensure that every nursing home will receive the intervention. Based on the experience reported in an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], a reduction in the prevalence of challenging behavior from 0.89 to 0.77 after the intervention WELCOME-IdA is assumed. Here, the prevalence rates will be calculated in the study based on the neuropsychiatric inventory-nursing home version (NPI-NH) (presence or absence (0/1) of at least one of the 12 challenging behaviors).</p><p>The between-cluster variance (<italic>&#x003c4;</italic><sup>2</sup>) and within-cluster variance (<italic>&#x003c3;</italic><sup>2</sup>) are estimated, according to Hussey <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], as <italic>&#x003c3;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00326 and <italic>&#x003c4;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.198. The significance level &#x003b1; is set at 0.05. The increase in the outcome variance due to the between-cluster heterogeneity is quantified by the inter-cluster coefficient of variation (<italic>k</italic>). Even if we assume <italic>k</italic> to be 0.5, rather than the maximum of usually observable inter-cluster coefficients of variation, under all assumptions mentioned above, the trial would achieve more than 80% power. The primary outcome is associated with the resident-level data. At this level, the study population consists of old and often multi-morbid individuals. Therefore, we should account for a minimum dropout rate of 20% during the study. Because of the flexible design, we will be able to adjust the sample size by substituting the dropouts with new residents with dementia. In case an entire cluster prematurely withdraws from the study, one additional home will be used as a reserve. Consequently, 180 residents from 6 nursing homes will be included in the study to test the effectiveness of WELCOME-IdA. The same dropout effects are expected for WELCOME-NEO. Therefore, we calculated using the same number of clusters and residents. In total, 360 residents from 12 nursing homes will participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment and randomization</title><p>Nursing homes are invited (by advertisement in a nursing journal) to apply for participation in the study. From this pool of interested nursing homes in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), 12 nursing homes will be randomly (simple randomization procedure) selected. Additionally, the type of intervention and when the cluster (nursing homes) switches from the control to the intervention protocol will be randomized. This process will guarantee that all 12 nursing homes have a similar likelihood of utilizing a particular type of intervention at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Then, the leaders of the nursing homes are responsible for the recruitment of the units and the residents according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. Here, all eligible participants of the participating units are invited to participate. Before the recruitment procedure will commence, each leader of the nursing homes will attend a kick-off meeting held by a senior investigator about the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the planned recruitment strategy. For the participants who drop out of the trial, we are planning to monitor the reasons (for example, death or moving) and perform a sensitive analysis at the end of the trial to determine whether they differ according to certain characteristics (for example, the prevalence of the challenging behavior or gender). Residents who are newly admitted to clusters during follow up will also be included in the study because we are interested (in a secondary analysis) in measuring the effect of the intervention on residents who move into the cluster.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods to prevent contamination and selection bias</title><p>In the SWD, every nursing home acts as its own control group for the horizontal comparison of data. To avoid contamination of data in the vertical comparisons (between the clusters), the nursing homes will not be informed about the other participating nursing homes to prevent any type of communication and information exchange. Additionally, the data collectors and statistician will be blinded to the type of intervention (CC model) and the study phase (pre-intervention time).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions and control phases of the study</title><p>Both interventions (WELCOME-IdA and WELCOME-NEO) are defined as the reference interventions for each arm and therefore act as their own control groups (WELCOME-IdA versus control and WELCOME-NEO versus control) with respect to the stepped wedge design. In the control phase, in addition to primary and secondary data, the normal care practices (for example, existing care concepts, organizational aspects, and meeting forms similar to the CCs) will be assessed following the better reporting of interventions: template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] for each nursing home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>The intervention</title><p>Both CC interventions (WELCOME-IdA and WELCOME-NEO), together with the key characteristics and the different process structures, were tested regarding their feasibility in two previous pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. According to the results, both models were modified and adapted according to the current nursing home situation, were validated on behalf of the literature and expert interviews, and were pretested in one nursing home (manuscript in preparation). Both models have the same theoretical basis, key characteristics (group size, location, duration, sequences, number of participants and their functionality) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); however, the models differ in operationalization of the sequences with and without an assessment instrument (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Defining hermeneutic principles as a core element of CCs is related to the ability to translate a particular situation to a universal context and to an overall interpretational framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The concept of attachment and the translation process are important, which Gadamer (2004) defines as authentic participation. Naden (2007) notes that this concept also refers to the aspect of consciousness-raising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Understanding and interpretation are realized when reflection and contemplation occur, thus representing core principles of CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and are useful for understanding challenging behavior. All of the CC models used or known by the experts are also based on hermeneutic principles. Therefore, hermeneutics was chosen as a general theoretical framework for CCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, hermeneutics appears to be insufficient as the only theoretical background for CCs for residents with dementia because it disregards specific concepts associated with behavior in individuals with dementia. It may be assumed that care teams require a more specific theory for understanding the specific meaning of challenging behavior of residents with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, a dementia-specific theory (need-driven dementia-compromised behavior (NDB) model) for understanding challenging behavior and forming the content of our intervention was also selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the NDB model, behavior is treated as a meaningful indicator of an unmet need. Therefore, dementia-related behavior can be explained as the staff&#x02019;s inability to understand the needs of individuals with dementia and as the incapacity of people with dementia to express their own needs. Antecedents of NDBs include background factors and proximal factors. These factors can structure the search for causes and triggers of challenging behavior. In general, the understanding of these behaviors is the basis of initiation of individually tailored interventions, which could lead to a reduction in the prevalence of challenging behavior among residents, to an increased quality of life and to a reduction in the prescription of psychotropic drugs. Furthermore, it is expected that CCs result in an increase in the staff&#x02019;s vocational action competence, reduced burnout, and decreased work-related stress (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

The practicability and validity of the instrument was tested in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The IdA is a comprehensive assessment instrument based on the NDB model mentioned above and is utilized in a two-step process: the first step is a detailed description and quantification of the challenging behavior and the second step is the search for potential causes of the behavior. The second step of IdA is divided into five dimensions (state of health and independence in everyday life, communication, personality and life style before the onset of dementia, mood and emotions, and environmental influences) with specific guiding questions. The second intervention, WELCOME-NEO, uses no structured assessment. Understanding the situation of people with dementia requires the description and analysis of the behavior in an unstructured, free, narrative manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The intervention (components of the intervention) in both CC models will start with training in the respective CC model (WELCOME-IdA; WELCOME-NEO) and will be followed by four supported CCs (training on the job).

The maximum intervention period for each cluster varies according to when the nursing home switches from the control phase to the intervention phase, which occurs between 7 and 17&#x000a0;months. The measurement instruments were chosen based on their appropriateness for the target setting and population, psychometric properties (validity and reliability), and their feasibility. The data at the resident level (for example, health indicators, behavior) will be obtained from interviews using the caregivers as proxies. The trained study assistants will simultaneously interview two caregivers who know the resident very well. If there is no agreement between the caregivers, the response of the caregiver with the longest relationship with the resident will be chosen. Every study assistant rater (primarily students) will undergo a two-day training session on the use of the questionnaires and instruments and will receive a detailed manual for the data collection, questionnaires, and instruments. For the first data collection session, the raters will be assisted by a senior researcher and a junior researcher to ensure that the data are collected as planned. The staff will complete questionnaires at the institutional and staff levels. The questionnaires will be tested to assess their feasibility in a pretest in one nursing home before commencing the intervention study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The Institutional Review Board for Ethics in Research, German Society for Science in Nursing (E-DG-P) has discussed and considered the proposal <italic>Fallbesprechungen bei Menschen mit Demenz (FallDem), Teil II: Interventionsdurchf&#x000fc;hrung</italic> (delivered in August 2011) and imparts an ethical clearing. Informed consent from each participant (residents and staff) will be obtained before the start of the trial. We will publish the main outcomes of the study in peer-reviewed scientific journals and journals for nursing practice and present the results at national and international conferences. Furthermore, based on the key results, we plan to write a handbook for nursing homes on how to use and implement CCs into their daily work routines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Analysis of data for effectiveness</title><p>In general, the analysis will follow the principles of an intention-to-treat analysis at the cluster level. The missing data will be appropriately imputed after assessing the missing data mechanism. For the analysis of the secondary staff&#x02019;s outcomes, the missing data will be censored regardless of the reason for missing data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Primary data analysis</title><p>The statistical analysis will be conducted after the end of the follow-up phase (T6). For the main analysis of the primary outcome, differences in the NPI scores of the clusters within the two intervention groups (WELCOME-IdA and WELCOME-NEO) for the different time points will be analyzed. Here, the NPI-NH scores of the control condition will be compared with the data from the intervention phase within each intervention arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. With respect to the nature of the SWD, the clustering, repeated measurements, and confounding effect of time must also be considered in the data analysis. With respect to our binary outcome, the use of a generalized linear mixed-effects model is highly recommended for data obtained from such types of studies. These models allow the inclusion of both fixed (for example, intervention, time) and random (for example, nursing home, resident-observed several times) factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, a delayed intervention effect of the CCs is assumed because the nurses need time to implement the procedure. Thus, the duration of the intervention in months must be considered. For the estimation of model parameters, the Bayesian approach will be used. In contrast to the likelihood-based inference, the Bayesian approach is more flexible and powerful because it allows, for example, the inclusion of prior information from previous studies. For the model selection process, an approach will be used that was previously described by Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. If necessary, the influence of missing data will also be analyzed by sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Secondary data analysis</title><p>The secondary outcome parameters will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and mixed effects models to generate hypotheses for additional research (for example, reduction of staff burden, differences between the two concepts of CCs).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The effectiveness of CCs on challenging behavior, quality of life of people with dementia, prescription of psychotropic drugs, nursing staff&#x02019;s burnout, dementia-specific burden, and vocational action competences will be evaluated. The use of the SWD offers several methodological and logistical advantages over the traditional randomized cluster design. RCTs are the gold standard for measuring clinical effects. In some situations, it is not possible or it is unethical or unfeasible to deny an intervention to an organization, a team, or residents. CCs are widely used in nursing homes and are recommended in guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The traditional waiting-list designs seem to overestimate the effect of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Therefore, alternative approaches for evaluating clinical and community interventions have received increased attention, particularly those that can retain several elements of randomization and that can be considered as controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The SWD is described in the literature as an alternative approach because it avoids several methodological pitfalls associated with before and after designs and it retains controlled data elements and randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Cluster-randomized trials are used to test whether an intervention is replicable and recognizable. However, CCs represent an example of a complex intervention in which the framework may be standardized but not each individual component. The way in which staff conduct CCs cannot be completely controlled because there is also a type of ongoing group dynamic process, which could change from case to case; often, the process must change because of the specifics of the case. For complex interventions, it is more important to standardize the process and the function of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] rather than all of the individual components of the intervention. In this study, we describe key obligatory elements of the intervention. With the long follow-up period of the trial, we will be able to detect intervention changes over a long time period.</p><p>Several logistical advantages of the study design exist. The staggered introduction of the intervention allows time to provide training on CCs and supports the stepwise study design. If we chose to implement a traditional cluster randomized trial, we would need to start with the intervention at the beginning of the trial, which would not be feasible with respect to the resources of our research team. However, from the statistical point of view, the data analysis is complex (for example, control for temporal trends in outcome variables or accounting for repeated measurements) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Only a few papers discuss the analysis methods in an SWD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Additionally, some nursing homes will wait a long time to begin the intervention, which poses a potential risk that several nursing homes may drop out of the trial due to loss of motivation or organizational developments. This situation also affects the resident and staff samples, and the problem of missing data intensifies.</p><p>Measuring the effect of psychosocial interventions in health care research is, for the most part, a challenge because of their complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Complex interventions often consist of different components that may contribute to the success or failure of the effect of an intervention. Often, the environment in which the intervention will be implemented is also complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. RCTs are stated to be the most powerful design for proving the effect of an intervention; however, these trials are limited in their ability to explain the reasons why an intervention is effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Therefore, it is important that an effectiveness study is accompanied by a process evaluation that provides additional information regarding the change processes and the contribution of each component of the intervention to the overall effect of the intervention. Otherwise, it will not be possible to gain insight into the so-called <italic>black box</italic> of this intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>First, because of limited resources, the study will be conducted in only one state, North Rhine - Westphalia (NRW) in Germany, which must be considered in the generalization of the results (external validity). The funding of long-term care by the local governments could differ between states in Germany. However, NRW is one of the largest and most densely populated states in Germany. Nonetheless, the participating nursing homes can be compared with all of the nursing homes in NRW and in Germany with respect to how representative they are.</p><p>The second limitation is the small number of nursing homes (six for each intervention arm) and the simple randomization procedure, which could lead to an imbalance between the different nursing homes in relation to several important covariates. Several studies solve this problem by using a SWD with the constrained randomization procedure after obtaining baseline data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. They balanced the allocation with respect to important covariates at the clinic level (for example, geographic region or prevalence rates of important covariates) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, this type of restricted randomization procedure is criticized even with the use of a small number of clusters because of their influence on the data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Additionally, in our case, we would need baseline data to restrain the allocation sequence to important factors, which seems unrealistic because of logistical reasons. Because we are unable to conduct the randomization procedure after baseline data collection, possible covariates were mentioned in the data analysis section. The third limitation is a possible selection bias at the unit and resident level. In our stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial, we randomize the nursing homes according to the type of intervention and the time at which the cluster switched from control to intervention phase. However, the selection of the unit and the residents based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria must be performed by the nursing home leaders because of logistical reasons. This selection strategy may increase the possibility of post-randomization selection bias at unit and/or resident level (for example, only very motivated units take part in the study or residents with high-intensity or low-intensity behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are chosen). To identify a possible selection bias due to the recruitment process, we will collect organizational and structural baseline data at the nursing home, unit and resident level. Additionally, the risk at the resident level is negligible because all eligible participants of the two units are invited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, at the end of the trial, we will compare the demographic data (for example, care dependency, age, sex) at the resident and unit level with data from the German Office of Statistics.</p><p>The fourth limitation concerns the data quality. We will use proxy instruments for the primary and secondary outcomes. We must consider that the challenging behavior assessed using the NPI-NH may be biased. As a proxy-rating instrument, the NPI-NH assesses the experience and subjective perspective of a professional caregiver of an individual with a particular behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Another bias may occur if the staff believes they need to rate their own quality of care instead of the residents&#x02019; quality of life. To resolve this problem and to increase the objectivity, two staff members will generally be interviewed about people with dementia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial was initiated in 2011 (development of the intervention) and will be completed by the end of 2015.
