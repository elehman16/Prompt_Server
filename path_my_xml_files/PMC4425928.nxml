It is hypothesised that remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) protects the heart against such injury. Despite the numerous studies investigating the protective effects of RIPC, there is still uncertainty about the interpretation of the findings as well as conflicting results between studies. The objective of this trial is to investigate the cardioprotective effect of RIPC in patients having coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or aortic valve replacement surgery.

Data will be collected by a research nurse blinded to the intervention. The patient and the theatre staff are also blinded to the allocation.

Cardioplegic arrest allows the surgeon to operate on a motionless heart. While the heart is arrested, there is no blood flow to the myocardium, which makes it ischaemic and can cause myocardial damage. When the blood circulation to the myocardium is restored at the end of cardioplegic arrest, reperfusion of the ischaemic myocardium induces further injury, often more severe.</p><p>Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a potentially protective phenomenon in which brief ischaemia of one organ or tissue (for example, arm or leg) is hypothesised to confer protection of another organ or tissue (for example, heart) against a sustained ischaemia-reperfusion insult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinical benefits have been reported in patients prior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], in patients having paediatric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or adult open heart surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and during surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, not all studies of RIPC have reported benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>A key challenge in interpreting the variation in findings has been a lack of evidence about mechanisms underpinning the effects of RIPC. In the absence of such evidence, it is difficult to know what other aspects of the treatment of patients (for example, choice of anaesthetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and method of myocardial protection) may facilitate or inhibit the effect of RIPC and what aspects of the preconditioning stimulus are critical (for example, number and duration of cycles of ischaemia, timing in relation to onset of myocardial ischaemia, and applying the stimulus after rather than before sternotomy). It has been suggested that a sensation of pain (nociceptive preconditioning) may also be important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The study population is another factor that may affect the effect of RIPC. For example, it has been suggested that the hearts of patients with ischaemic heart disease needing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery may already be pre-conditioned by virtue of the disease. This view leads to the hypothesis that the effects of RIPC should be greater in patients without ischaemic heart disease but still undergoing CPB and cardioplegic arrest, for example, patients having heart valve surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, the evidence that has accrued to date from these proof-of-concept clinical studies in adult cardiac surgery has led to a large multicentre randomized clinical trial in patients having coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with or without valve surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Possible mechanisms underlying cardioprotection by remote ischaemic preconditioning</title><p>Although the mechanism by which a preconditioning stimulus in a patient&#x02019;s limb confers protection to the heart is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the preconditioned limb is presumed to transmit a signal to the heart, which, in turn, is presumed to trigger changes in the myocardium that eventually result in protection. Possible mechanisms have been proposed based on experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, it has been suggested that the &#x02018;signalling&#x02019; mechanism between the remotely preconditioned organ/tissue and the heart could involve humoral and neural factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or metabolites (for example, adenosine, bradykinin and opioids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. More recent evidence suggests the involvement of hydrophobic mediators acting via PI3K/Akt-dependent pro-survival signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. There is also evidence that RIPC triggers an inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, little is known about the changes in the target tissue (myocardium) that are brought about by RIPC <italic>before</italic> ischemia and reperfusion. Most studies that have investigated changes in the myocardium have done so <italic>after</italic> reperfusion. It has been suggested that a signalling factor triggers intracellular signal transduction mechanisms in the heart, which are similar to those involved in cardiac ischaemic pre- and post-conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These could include activation of pro-survival kinases of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway, which could protect the heart by inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is possible that a variety of other signalling pathways involved in MPTP regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] could also be involved in RIPC-induced protection. A recent experimental study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] investigated the differential role of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which suggested that the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, Erk1/2 and JNK could be involved in RIPC. Experimental evidence supports involvement of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A very recent observational clinical study reported that RIPC was associated with changes in the phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Most of these studies point to the mitochondria as a potential target for inducing protection by RIPC. We hypothesise that kinases involved in regulating the permeability of the MPTP are the mediators of RIPC-induced cardioprotection. Therefore, these enzymes and related signalling pathways will be monitored to identify the main pathway(s) responsible.</p><p>A key difference that is likely to exist between RIPC and cardiac pre- and post-conditioning stimuli (where the heart is made ischaemic for short periods) is related to changes in energy rich phosphates. Thus, RIPC is not expected to trigger cardiac changes associated with anaerobic metabolism (for example, drop in ATP, and build-up of ATP catabolites and lactate). However, a recent experimental study in mice has demonstrated that RIPC is associated with cardiac ischaemic stress and accumulation of cardiac adenosine prior to index ischaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This highlights the need to measure ischaemic-stress related metabolites in the hearts of patients undergoing surgery using RIPC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The overall aim of the trial is to investigate the cardioprotective effect of RIPC in patients having CABG or aortic valve replacement surgery.

Male and female patients, aged &#x02265;18 years, undergoing elective (or urgent) first-time CABG or AVR and who are willing to be followed-up and provide written informed consent will be eligible. Patients who have experienced cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest, suffer from significant peripheral arterial disease affecting the upper limbs or have neither upper limb available for the intervention, have pre-operative renal failure (with a GFR &#x0003c;30 ml/min/1.73 m2) or have been taking glibenclamide or nicorandil within 24 hours of surgery will be considered ineligible. Patients who are participating in other interventional studies are also ineligible. These exclusion criteria are similar to the ones used by other researchers who have investigated the effects of RIPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>All potential participants will be sent or given an invitation letter and Patient Information Sheet (PIS) (approved by the local Research Ethics Committee (REC)) describing the study. The patient will have time to read the PIS and to discuss their participation with others outside the research team (for example, relatives or friends) if they wish. Most patients will have at least 24 hours to consider whether to participate or not. In a few cases, this time interval may be as little as 12 hours or less, for example, for those patients admitted for urgent surgery without prior notification to the waiting list co-ordinator. Despite the short notice, it is important to include these patients for the applicability of the trial findings since about 40% of patients having cardiac surgery are admitted as urgent cases. Such exceptions were considered to be justified by the REC.</p><p>At the pre-assessment clinic or after admission to the cardiac unit for their operation, patients will be seen by a member of the local research team (study clinician/research nurse) who will answer any questions, confirm the patient&#x02019;s eligibility and take written informed consent if the patient decides to participate. A copy of the consent form is provided in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><p>A surgeon can decide not to randomise an otherwise eligible patient but has to give a reason for doing so. The trial screening log documents the reasons for ineligibility and, where provided, the reasons why an eligible patient declines to consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Random allocations, stratified by surgical stratum and centre, will be generated by computer. Random treatment allocations will be (a) blocked with varying block sizes to ensure approximate balance in the number of participants allocated to each group; (b) generated in advance of starting the study; and (c) accessed using a secure, internet-based randomization system to guarantee concealment until a participant&#x02019;s identity and eligibility is confirmed and securely documented. Randomization will be carried out after consent has been collected and before the operation by a designated member of the research team who will not be involved in data collection.</p><p>Participants will be blinded because the intervention is delivered in theatre and there will be no visible signs of having had RIPC. The operating staff and data collectors will be blinded because a research nurse, who will have no further role in the trial, will deliver RIPC or sham RIPC (see below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Trial interventions</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Remote ischaemic preconditioning (intervention)</title><p>A research nurse will apply the cuff for administering RIPC under the operating cover, placing the cuff around the participant&#x02019;s upper arm, after induction of anaesthesia and before sternotomy, CPB and cardioplegic arrest. RIPC will be induced as described by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It will comprise four 5 minute cycles of upper limb ischaemia, induced by a blood pressure cuff inflated to 200 mmHg, with an intervening 5 minutes of reperfusion by deflating the cuff. For participants with systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;185 mmHg, the cuff will be inflated at least 15 mmHg above the participant&#x02019;s systolic blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sham remote ischaemic preconditioning (comparator)</title><p>A research nurse will position the cuff for administering RIPC as for the intervention group, under the operating cover and will squeeze the bulb with the air valve opened, at the same intervals as in the intervention group.

The metabolites that will be investigated in the ventricular biopsies are creatine phosphate, ATP, ADP, AMP, IMP, inosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, adenosine, NAD<sup>+</sup>, lactate, alanine and glutamate. In addition, markers of potential signalling pathways that could be involved in RIPC will be monitored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These secondary outcomes will be analysed in biopsies from the majority of participants, with a subgroup (about ten per group) being used for analyses of protein expression.</p><p>Expression of proteins implicated in RIPC protection in experimental studies will be determined by characterising the activation of intracellular kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], the activation of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway, and the survivor activating factor enhancement (SAFE) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Gene expression for proteins that are activated will also be determined. Recent technological advances have provided new tools for screening and characterisation of activated proteins including mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This is particularly important at the level of post-translational modifications of proteins (for example, phosphorylation), which are largely responsible for regulation of protein activity and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, the cardiac phosphoproteome will be measured in order to draw firm conclusions about the functional relevance of changes in proteins (proteome). A recent study has shown that RIPC cardioprotection in mice is linked with significant changes in several phosphoproteins associated with the z-disk area of the sarcomere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Several of the phosphoproteins identified do not have antibodies available, thus making it difficult to measure using conventional methods. Therefore, we shall use these methods to screen for protein activation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Markers in blood samples</title><p>Inflammation, systemic oxidative and metabolic stress associated with surgery will be assessed by measuring the plasma concentration of key biomarkers.

Each sample will amount to approximately 10 ml of blood stored in separate vials for plasma and serum analysis.</p><p>Serum concentration of Troponin I will be measured using automated assays. Plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF&#x003b1; will be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for database use, data validation and data cleaning will be available and regularly maintained.</p><p>Trial data will be submitted directly into the database, which will be accessed via the NHS portal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data storage</title><p>All study documentation will be retained in a secure location during the conduct of the study and for 10 years after the end of the study, when all patient identifiable paper records will be destroyed by confidential means. Prior to destruction, paper records will be scanned and stored on the NHS server with limited password controlled access. Where trial-related information is documented in the medical records, these records will be identified by a label bearing the name and duration of the trial. Relevant &#x02018;meta&#x02019;-data about the trial and the full dataset, but without any participant identifiers other than the unique participant identifier, will be held indefinitely (Imperial College London server). A secure electronic &#x02018;key&#x02019; with a unique participant identifier, and key personal identifiers (for example, name, date of birth and NHS number) will also be held indefinitely, but in a separate file and in a physically different location (NHS hospital server).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Participant follow-up</title><p>Participants will be followed-up three months after their operation. They will be sent a questionnaire to capture the occurrence of any serious adverse events. Information about any hospitalization will be requested from the participant&#x02019;s GP or the admitting hospital. Active participation in the trial terminates once the participant completes the follow-up questionnaire and sends it back to the research team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Sample size</title><p>Cardiac Troponin I is measured at the start of the operation (before RIPC or sham RIPC), after applying RIPC or sham RIPC, and five times after the end of ischaemic cardioplegic arrest and CPB. Determining an appropriate sample size requires several parameters to be specified. We have estimated some parameters from our previous research: average pre-post correlation&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3 and average post-post correlation&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5. We propose to recruit 30 patients/group in each surgical stratum, giving a sample size of 60 per surgical stratum and a total of 120. This sample size for each stratum is similar to that used in a previous trial in which RIPC was observed to have induced significant cardio-protection during CABG surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Assuming an analysis of variance and covariance, this sample size will have 90% power to detect a standardised difference in serum markers of 0.43 between groups providing that there is no interaction between intervention/control and pathology. If there is an interaction, the sample size of 60 for each pathology will have 80% power to detect a standardised difference in serum markers of 0.55 between groups within each pathology stratum.</p><p>Assuming again an analysis of variance and covariance but without repeated measures, the sample size of 60 per group (assuming no interaction between intervention/control and pathology) will have 90% power to detect a standardised difference in cellular markers of 0.6 between groups. If there is an interaction, the sample size of 60 will have 80% power to detect a standardised difference in cellular markers of 0.72 between groups within each pathology stratum. Based on our previous research analysing myocardial biopsies, differences of this magnitude are plausible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec id="Sec30"><title>Plan of analysis</title><p>Continuous outcomes will be summarised and presented graphically as geometric means and standard errors, assuming that a natural logarithmic transformation will be applied to the data to normalise their distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The primary outcome, Troponin-I, and the secondary outcomes such as markers of kinase activity, oxidative stress and inflammation, are all measured multiple times in each patient (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Therefore, Troponin-I and the other markers will be analysed by fitting multilevel mixed effect linear regression models, which consider the repeated measures in an appropriate and efficient manner. These models will fit both fixed effects (intervention, surgical stratum, centre, time and the interactions of intervention x time and intervention x centre) and a random effect. The fixed effects are analogous to standard regression coefficients and are estimated directly. The random effect is not directly estimated but is summarized according to its estimated variances and covariance. Baseline (pre-intervention) measures, where available, will be analysed jointly with the post-intervention measure(s). The interaction of group and surgical stratum will be tested and, if statistically significant at the 10% level, the treatment effect will be reported for each stratum separately; otherwise, an overall treatment effect will be given. Similarly, interactions of group and time and group and centre, will be explored (overall or within stratum depending on the significance of the group by stratum interaction) and, if statistically significant at the 10% level, the treatment effect will be reported for each time point separately.</p><p>Analyses will be adjusted for stratification factors, namely surgical procedure and centre. Findings will be reported as effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals. Analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat; cross-overs are expected to be rare. The frequencies of complications and conversions will be tabulated descriptively, by pathology. However, the trial is not powered to detect differences in adverse events and no statistical comparisons will be carried out.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that analyses of all outcomes will adjust for baseline levels of outcomes. Therefore, although there will be heterogeneity between patients within groups, the analyses will take this heterogeneity into account by quantifying the effects of the design factors after removing variation attributable to individual participants. This approach extends to the analyses of the proteome/phosphoproteome since data will be available for biopsies from the same ventricle of the same participant before and after cardioplegic ischaemic arrest. In effect, this allows us to focus on detecting changes in the same tissue (left or right ventricle) in two different pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>No sub-group analyses are planned other than those described above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Frequency of analyses</title><p>The primary analysis will take place when follow-up is complete for all recruited patients. No formal interim analysis is planned. Given the nature of the intervention, we do not propose to have a formal Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC). We will report unexpected serious adverse events and deaths to the trial Sponsor. In these reports, the data will be presented by group but the allocation will remain masked, unless we are requested to disclose allocation because of concern about safety.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Changes to the protocol since first approved</title><p>Substantial and minor amendments have been made. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been amended to include a wider age range of patients and to facilitate recruitment. The primary outcome was changed from Troponin T to Troponin I because the coordinating centre measures Troponin I routinely. The type of blood sample collection was clarified in terms of distinguishing between serum and plasma concentrations. Anaesthetic details were removed to allow the operating team to follow their local practice. A more complete list of expected adverse events was added. Novel proteomic analyses on biopsies collected in a subgroup of participants have been added to characterise potential mechanistic pathways for RIPC. The sample size was increased by 25% to allow the proteomic analyses to be carried out in a subset of participants and to allow the trial to detect a smaller target difference between groups within each surgery stratum separately. The current version of the protocol is version 3 dated 17 July 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Measures to reduce the risk of bias</title><p>The trial has been designed to minimise the risk of bias. The trial is randomised, with stratification by centre and surgical stratum, so it is at low risk of allocation bias/confounding. Randomisation is unlikely to be subverted because random allocations are only issued after participants&#x02019; identity and eligibility are confirmed and securely documented. Blocked allocation could increase the risk of subversion bias, but this risk is being minimised by using varying block size. In order to subvert the trial, one person would need to know all allocations (across all surgeons) up to a particular timepoint; since different research nurses administer the intervention for different participants, this scenario would require collusion between research nurses.</p><p>The trial is at some risk of attrition bias because patients can decide to withdraw after randomisation or the care team could decide to withdraw them. However, we will try to minimise the probability of attrition bias by randomising the patient at a time close to the intervention. In addition, patients may not complete the follow-up questionnaire after discharge. We do not anticipate that attrition will be different between groups.</p><p>The trial is at low risk of ascertainment bias (outcome assessment) because the outcomes are objective and the analysts measuring blood or cellular markers are blinded to the allocation. Blinding of patients, the clinical care staff and the research team collecting the data, minimises risk of performance and detection biases. Success of blinding of patients will be assessed in the follow-up questionnaire.</p><p>Risk of bias in analysing the trial data is also low because analyses will be done according to a pre-specified statistical analysis plan and with an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Dissemination of findings</title><p>The findings will be disseminated by usual academic channels, that is, presentation at international meetings, as well as by peer-reviewed publications and through patient organisations and newsletters to patients, where available. As the study compares surgical techniques no commercially exploitable findings are anticipated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec37"><title>What the study will investigate</title><p>We hypothesise that RIPC will reduce myocardial injury and reduce inflammation following heart surgery and that this effect will be greater in participants having AVR than in those having CABG. The effects of RIPC have been investigated in several trials to date, but their results have been inconsistent. By measuring many markers in myocardial biopsies and in blood samples, at different times after administering RIPC or sham RIPC, we expect to be able to relate changes in potential signalling mechanisms to the extent of myocardial injury measured by troponin I.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design is a two-centre, randomised controlled trial with patients (CABG or valve) being randomly assigned to receive RIPC or control (sham RIPC) just before the surgery. This study design follows the one used in ERICCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Before this study commenced, we had discussions with the ERICCA trial team, and we tried to have our study as a sub-study to ERICCA. This was not possible because of the need for substantial protocol and governance changes, which were difficult to implement in a large ongoing multicentre study. Nevertheless, we adopted the same intervention and comparator. Our study population, however, is different; ERICCA is recruiting patients having CABG (with or without valve surgery) with an additive Euroscore greater than or equal to 5, whereas we have deliberately recruited patients undergoing CABG only or AVR only (regardless of their Euroscore). These differences in the trial populations meant that both centres taking part in this trial have also recruited to ERICCA at the same time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Challenges in study procedures</title><p>It has been suggested that some drugs interact with remote ischaemic preconditioning. Propofol and Fluorane, two of the most commonly used drugs in anaesthetic practice, are two such drugs. Propofol may inhibit STAT-5 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], hence reducing the preconditioning effect, while Fluorane may enhance protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, there is a lack of firm evidence to substantiate these potential effects on the ischaemic preconditioning pathway. Therefore, for consistency, we have opted for the strategy of the ERICCA trial, which does not specify an anaesthetic protocol and allows each centre to follow its own practice. The two centres recruiting to this study adhere to their own, well-documented centre-specific protocols, minimizing variability in the anaesthetic procedures used between patients at the same centre. Stratified randomization ensures that patients allocated to both the intervention and control group within a centre will undergo the same anaesthetic procedures. Moreover, we will be able (albeit with low statistical power) to describe the interaction between centre and intervention.</p><p>Despite being a two-centre study, this study will recruit CABG patients at only one centre (ICHT). This is because the cardioplegia protocol for this operation differs between the two centres (warm blood versus cold blood), and it is believed that this might influence selected outcomes. This is hindering the recruitment rate, together with the challenges in recruiting patients to the AVR group in both centres because AVR operations are less frequent.</p><p>The intervention is carried out primarily in the anaesthetic room. Blinding of the operating team and carrying out the intervention can be challenging at this stage of the study because it coincides with the pre-operative anaesthetic procedures. The time a patient spends in the anaesthetic room can vary, and on some occasions the intervention can be incomplete by the time the patient is ready for theatre. To prevent delay of surgery, the intervention is completed in theatre as the patient is being prepared for surgery before sternotomy.</p><p>In order to monitor the changes in biomarker outcomes, blood samples are collected at various time points during a participant&#x02019;s hospital stay. Some of these blood sample collections are scheduled outside office working hours. Even though reminders about the need to collect these samples are &#x02018;handed over&#x02019; to the clinical team in charge of the patient when shifts change, on some occasions sample collection may be missed due to lack of time and other priorities. Similarly, there may be instances in which the biopsies are not collected; we aim to minimise this risk by having a member of the research team present in the theatre to prompt the operator to take the biopsies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial opened for recruitment in one centre (ICHT) in February 2013 and in the other centre (UH Bristol) in June 2013.
