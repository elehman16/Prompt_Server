The pattern of physical activity in adulthood are often established during adolescence and sedentary behaviours in the early years could influence the development of diseases later in life. Studies on physical activity in Nigeria have focused largely on individual behaviours and the effects of school-based interventions have not been well investigated. The aim of the proposed study is to identify factors influencing; and evaluate the effects of a multi-level intervention on the physical activity behaviours of in-school adolescents in Oyo state, Nigeria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par200">The study will adopt a cluster randomised controlled trial design and schools will serve as the unit of randomisation. The sample size is 1000 in-school adolescents aged 10&#x02013;19 years. The study will be guided by the socio-ecological model and theory of reasoned action and baseline data will be obtained through a mixed methods approach comprising a cross sectional survey to document the self-reported physical activity levels coupled with objectively measured physical activity levels using pedometers for a subset of the sample. Other measurements including weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, fitness level using the 20-m shuttle run test (20-mSRT) and blood pressure will be obtained. The schools&#x02019; built environment and policy support for physical activity will be assessed using structured questionnaires coupled with key informant interviews and focus group discussions with the school authorities. Baseline findings will guide the design and implementation of a 12-week multi-level intervention. The primary outcome measures are self&#x02013;reported and 7-day objectively measured physical activity. Other secondary outcome measures are body-mass-index for age, waist-to-hip ratio, cardioresiratory fitness and blood pressure. The association between behavioural factors and physical activity levels will be assessed. Follow-up measurements will be taken immediately after the intervention and 3-months post intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Physical activity behaviours of adolescents in Nigeria are influenced by multiple factors.

According to the Global Status Report on Non-communicable diseases, Nigeria had an estimated 792,600 NCDs related deaths in 2008 and this high mortality figure is linked to four modifiable risk factors namely <italic>physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, tobacco and harmful alcohol use</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These risk factors are typically initiated during adolescence and set the stage for unhealthy behaviours which persist into adulthood and diseases later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">According to the National Strategic Framework on the Health and Development of Adolescents and Young People in Nigeria, there is a gradual increase in the number of physically inactive, overweight, young children and adolescents in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Obesity in childhood and adolescence has been linked to cardiovascular diseases, type-2 diabetes, cancer and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Findings from recent studies conducted among adolescents in different Nigerian states lend credence to the growing epidemic; the reported prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents in Benue state was 9.7% and 1.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; 13.8% and 9.4% in Lagos state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 5.8% and 1.1% in Ondo state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] respectively.</p><p id="Par19">Compared to other developed regions of the world, the reported prevalence of obesity among adolescents in Nigeria is low however; this is rapidly increasing due to the corresponding rise in the behavioural antecedent risk factors specifically <italic>unhealthy diets and physical inactivity</italic>. A study by Odunaiya et al., (2010) among in-school adolescents in Oyo State, Nigeria found that, 38%, 58.8% and 3.2% engaged in low, moderate and high intensity physical activity behaviours respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, 8.8% were overweight and 1.2% were obese and body mass index was inversely associated with physical activity levels. Adeniyi et al. (2011) also found a significant level of physical inactivity among students in Ibadan, Oyo State and this was linked to individual and school factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. According to Adeniyi et al, the physical activity levels of the participants varied; 53.8%, 38.8% and 7.4% engaged in low, moderate and high intensity physical activity behaviours respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Physical inactivity was higher among students in private schools and associated with depression. The increasing level of physical inactivity in Nigeria and many other countries in the world is largely due to motorisation, urbanisation, automation of daily activities and greater opportunities for sedentary behaviours and underscores the need to address this growing burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">In 2013, the World Health Assembly endorsed a resolution calling upon member states to address the needs of the youth by prioritising the surveillance of trends and determinants of non-communicable diseases and adopting a lifecourse approach in its prevention and control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Evidence points to adolescence as a crucial period in the development of NCDs and underscores the need to institute or intensify surveillance of risk factors and implement population wide interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases. Schools have been identified as a setting for influencing the physical activity behaviours of young people but several factors influences its role in this regard. Numerous recommendations have been proposed to address physical inactivity and unhealthy diets within the school setting however; most of these strategies have targeted the individual level resulting in relatively modest changes in behaviours.</p><p id="Par21">There is a global call to address the root cause of unhealhy diets and physical inactivity by implementing population wide interventions within health promoting setting such as schools and workplaces and this requires profound policy changes and leadership support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In order to reduce the impact of the major risk factors for NCDs, the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health and the School Policy Framework on Diet and Physical Activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Paragraph&#x000a0;49 of this document states that<italic>: &#x0201c;School policies and programmes should support the adoption of healthy diets and physical activity. Schools are encouraged to provide students with daily physical education and should be equipped with appropriate facilities and equipment. Governments are encouraged to adopt policies that support healthy diets at school and limit the availability of products high in salt, sugar and fats&#x0201d;</italic>. The extent of implementation of this initiative in Nigeria is currently low.</p><p id="Par22">A systematic review of few studies conducted in high income countries found strong evidence that multi-component interventions and policies were effective in promoting physical activity among students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However; this intervention has not been tested in Nigeria. A study conducted by Gillis et al. (2013) among international physical activity experts using a twin-panel Delphi methodology ranked <italic>policy and/or environmental change and their influence on children&#x02019;s physical activity and sedentary behaviours</italic> second on the list of 29 international research priorities on child and adolescent physical activity behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This underscores the justification for this study. Research studies on the physical activity behaviours of young people in Nigeria have focused solely on individual behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] without analyzing critically, the influence of social-cultural, institutional, environmental and policy level factors resulting in an unbalanced attention to individualised behaviour change strategies instead of a true public health intervention which requires systems approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These underscore the importance of this study which is designed to identify the socio-ecological factors (<italic>individual, social, built environment and policy</italic>) influencing the physical activity behaviours of in-school adolescents and to evaluate the effect of a multi-level intervention on the physical activity and fitness levels of in-school adolescents in Oyo state, south western Nigeria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study research design</title><p id="Par23">The proposed study will utilise a cluster randomised trial design to test the effect of a 12-week multi-level intervention on the physical activity and fitness levels of in-school adolescents aged 10&#x02013;19&#x000a0;years in twenty two public and private-owned secondary schools in Oyo state, south western Nigeria. Secondary schools will be the unit of randomisation, and these will be assigned to the multi-level intervention or control arm (no intervention) with longitudinal data collection for index or cohort children randomly selected from the student population. Prior to the experimental study, preliminary data will be collected on the physical activity behaviours of in-school adolescents and the socio-ecological factors influencing the school physical activity environment. This will guide the design of a multi-level, multi-component intervention which will run for 12&#x000a0;weeks with assessments conducted at baseline, post-intervention and at 3-months follow-up. The design, conduct and reporting of this study will adhere to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

The PAQ-A is a self-administered, 7-day recall instrument. It was developed to assess general levels of physical activity for high school students approximately 13 to 19&#x000a0;years of age. It assesses the frequency of participation in physical activity during spare time, physical education period, lunchtime, after school, in the evenings and on weekends. A summary of the physical activity score is generated from the mean of 8 items, and ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more frequent participation in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). The physical activity levels will be categorised into three; low physical activity level will be those who score between 1 to 1.9 while moderate and high physical activity levels will be those who score between 2 to 3.9 and 4 to 5 respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For some statistical analyses, the self-reported physical activity level will be treated as a continuous variable. In a study to establish the convergent validity of the PAQ-A, the instrument was found to be significantly correlated to all self-report measures (including activity rating, <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.73; Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.57; and 7-day physical activity recall interview, <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.59) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The survey will also assess the frequency of engagement in structured physical activity from two time points (baseline and follow up) as the primary outcome measure. Based on the theory of Planned Behaviours which is the theoretical framework guiding this intervention, other variables which will be incorporated into the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) are the measures for attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy. A research tool which was theoretically derived by Motl et al., 2000 based on Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Social-Cognitive Theory (SCT) will be used to assess the social-cognitive factors among this young people.

A systematic review recently concluded that the 20-mSRT is the most reliable and valid field based method to estimate aerobic fitness in young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Performance in the 20-mSRT is typically expressed as laps, levels or distance completed. The 20mSRT estimates the cardiorespiratory fitness (aerobic capacity). Children run back and forth between two lines 20-m apart following beep signals played from a pre-recorded CD. The pace of the test is ramped such that running speed increases by 0.5&#x000a0;km/h each minute or period. The test is finished when the child stops owing to fatigue or when he/she does not reach the line in time with the audio signal on two consecutive occasions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The last completed run indicates the final result of the test.
