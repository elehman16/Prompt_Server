Prophylactic measures to reduce shivering are quintessential to decrease the morbidity and mortality. Believing that oral formulation will bring down the cost of treatment, we decided to compare the efficacy of oral clonidine and tramadol, as premedication, in prevention of shivering in patients undergoing transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) under spinal anesthesia in a prospective and double-blind manner.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The patients were randomly allocated into three groups (40 patients each). Group I received oral clonidine 150 &#x003bc;g, Group II received oral tramadol 50 mg, while Group III received a placebo. Number of patients having shivering, their grades and duration, hemodynamic changes, and side-effects in the form of sedation were recorded. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>Z</italic> test as and when appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In group I and II, 38 patients (95%) and 37 patients (92.5%) did not shiver, respectively. Although in the group III, 24 patients (60%) exhibited no grade of shivering, the shivering was of significantly severe intensity and lasted for a longer duration. No, clinically significant collateral effects were observed in patients who were administered clonidine or tramadol.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Oral clonidine and tramadol were comparable in respect to their effect in decreasing the incidence, intensity, and duration of shivering when used prophylactically in patients who underwent TURP under subarachnoid blockade.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Clonidine</kwd><kwd>postanesthetic shivering</kwd><kwd>spinal anesthesia</kwd><kwd>tramadol</kwd><kwd>transurethral resection of prostate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Shivering in transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) may be due to decreased core temperature secondary to peripheral vasodilatation from sympathetic blockade and/or cold irrigating fluids.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Elderly patients are not able to initiate autonomic protective responses.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Thus, the reported increased morbidity after TURP could be due to rapid decrease in body temperature leading to increased perioperative cardiac stress.</p><p>Clonidine, a centrally acting selective partial alpha-2 agonist, has been previously used to obtund shivering[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in patients undergoing urological surgery. Tramadol, a cyclohexanol derivative, has &#x003bc; agonist activity as well as acts as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake. Mainly used as an analgesic, its role as an agent to reduce perioperative shivering is well-established. Oral formulations of both these drugs are easily available. Oral tramadol Rs. 6.80/tablet and clonidine Re. 1/tablet) are economical when compared to their intravenous formulation (tramadol is for Rs. 17/injection and clonidine costs Rs. 43 for a 150 &#x003bc;g/ml injection). This study was intended to compare the prophylactic effectiveness of enteral formulations of clonidine and tramadol for prevention of perioperative shivering. Proving of their efficacy might integrate the use of these drugs as premedication in future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After obtaining approval of Hospital Ethical Committee along with written informed consent, 120 geriatric male patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists Grades I to III), scheduled for elective TURP under subarachnoid blockade (SAB) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized double-blind study. Patients who were allergic to tramadol or clonidine, obese (body mass index &#x0003e;35%), febrile had a history of ischemic heart disease, thyroid disease, cerebrovascular disease, severe diabetic autonomic neuropathy, contraindication to regional anesthesia, or patients who had an infection of the urinary tract or external auditory meatus were excluded from the study. Vasodilator/vasoconstrictor medications likely to cause alteration in thermoregulation if taken by the patients also precluded us from considering them to be a part of the study.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to three groups by computer generated numbers, each receiving a sealed envelope of an oral formulation 90 min prior to the surgery. Group I received oral clonidine 150 &#x003bc;g, Group II received oral tramadol 50 mg, while the control Group III received starch tablet. Anesthesiology Department technicians who were not involved in the study prepared these trial preparations. They recorded the group randomization separately, such that the anesthesiologist recording the data and caring for the patient was unaware of what the preparation contained or which group the patient belonged to.</p><p>All patients were examined and investigated a day prior to surgery, and were advised fasting for 6 h prior to surgery.</p><p>All operations were performed in the same operation theater, which was maintained at constant ambient temperature and humidity. The operating room was not equipped to provide laminar flow. In the operation theater electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry and noninvasive blood pressure were attached and monitoring was initiated. SAB was achieved with bupivacaine (0.5% hyperbaric) administered under all aseptic precautions in a sitting position. Patients were made supine following the block and a level up to T<sub>9</sub>&#x02013;T<sub>10</sub> was achieved. Warmed (to body temperature) intravenous and irrigating fluids were used. Patients wore cotton surgical drapes and no means of active warming were used until deemed essential.</p><p>Heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>); skin temperatures (axillary and forehead temperature, measured using temperature probes of GE Medical,Datex-Ohmeda Excel SE 210 Anesthesia Machine), core temperatures (tympanic membrane temperature, monitored with Braun Thermoscan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) were noted every 5 min for the 1<sup>st</sup> h and then every 10 min for the next half an hour. Baseline value was when the patient was made supine after subarachnoid bupivacaine was administered. The grades of shivering were recorded at a period of 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min from the baseline as per grades similar to those used by Wrench <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Grading of shivering as per wrench</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-30-340-g001"/></table-wrap><p>No measures were taken to forestall shivering, but warming blankets were available if it became necessary.

To calculate the sample size, we hypothesized that keeping Type I (alpha) error at 5% and Type II (beta) error at 20%, the study drugs would be able to reduce the incidence of shivering by 15% and using the variability of data as a standard deviation (SD), 40 patients per study group was arrived.

None of the patient experienced Grade 4 shivering. In the group III, 24 patients (60%) did not experience shivering, but 16 patients (40%) experienced different grades of shivering. On comparison of incidence of shivering [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] among group I versus group III and Group II versus Group III, a statistically significant variation was seen (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), whereas group I versus group II had statistically insignificant variation.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Incidence of shivering in the three groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-30-340-g004"/></fig><p>The variation in shivering was markedly significant at 30, 45, and 60 min among group I and group III (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>], while at 5, 10, 15, and 90 min the variation in shivering was statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

This is comparable to study conducted by Mao <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] who observed that oral clonidine 150 &#x003bc;g when given prophylactically prevents postspinal shivering. It was found to lower the incidence of shivering to 4% in the study group compared to 44% in the control group. This is also in concordance with various studies, which showed that tramadol reduces the incidence, severity and duration of perioperative shivering.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>We observed that patients who were given clonidine or tramadol had mild to moderate shivering. In our study, it was seen that shivering started earlier (in 5 min) and persisted for a longer duration in the control group (range = 5-90 min), while in clonidine and tramadol treated patients the onset was delayed (15 min) and the duration was also significantly less (range = 15-60 min). This is in concordance with study by Yang <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] wherein shivering was observed after 16.8 &#x000b1; 9 min, (range = 5-30 min) in the control group, while it occurred at 18 (range/mean and SD) minute in patient's who received intravenous clonidine 150 &#x003bc;g 20 min before epidural anesthesia was administered. Our study also corresponds to the results of study conducted by Vanderstappen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who found that clonidine decreased the total incidence (<italic>P</italic> = 0.024), the severity (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005) and duration (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) of postoperative shivering.</p><p>The significant fall in the tympanic membrane temperature in group III patients as compared with group I and II patients (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, &#x0003c;0.0001, &#x0003c;0.001, respectively) is in variance to the study conducted by Mao <italic>et al</italic>. who did not observe any fall in the tympanic membrane temperature, perhaps as they recorded the temperature at 30 min from baseline. However we observed lowest mean tympanic temperature at 50 min, 45 min, and 50 min in group I, II and III, respectively. Though there was no significant intergroup difference in the decrease in forehead and axillary temperatures, the fall of these within each group was significant.</p><p>Hypothermia causes bradycardia, reduced cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction. There are additional adverse effects on every other body system.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Previous studies have reported a reduction in core temperature during transurethral prostatectomy.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The cardiovascular system is stressed as a result of increased afterload, effects on myocardial excitability and conduction and the metabolic demands of rewarming.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The metabolic cost of shivering is an increase in oxygen consumption from 300% to 800%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Clonidine and tramadol would be effective in preventing shivering (and its adverse effects) but not hypothermia. Despite premedication with these drugs it would still be important to adopt measures to maintain normothermia. Hence maintaining strict normothermia alongwith premedication with either clonidine or tramodol can prevent shivering during regional anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From our study, we conclude that both drugs have a potential to be used as prophylactic anti-shivering drugs, especially in whom shivering could lead to detrimental consequences.
