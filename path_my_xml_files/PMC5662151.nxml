HIV self-testing (HIVST), defined as an individual performing and interpreting their own HIV test,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> is one potential solution, and its scale-up in Africa is recommended.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>HIVST offers an opportunity for early engagement of individuals in HIV services.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, there is limited research around the cost implications and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes of HIV-positive individuals, identified through HIVST, after entering HIV care, to inform potential users and providers on the benefits of HIVST. The cost of providing HIVST is comparable to standard facility-based HIV testing and counseling (HTC), but the lower yield of positive individuals makes it more costly for identifying those who are HIV-positive.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In contrast to HIVST, facility HTC services are more commonly accessed by those with advanced HIV disease,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> with individuals needing additional medical care to manage comorbidities.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Engaging individuals early within HIV care and treatment through HIVST may yield later cost savings. Improvements in HRQoL among those initiating ART after testing HIV-positive through facility HTC services have been demonstrated<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>; this has yet to be shown for those identified through HIVST. Accurate and contemporaneous understanding of these economic outcomes will be essential to inform policy on scale-up.</p><p>We recruited a cohort of adults attending HIV treatment clinics in Blantyre, Malawi, after they had undergone HIVST or facility-based HTC. Our primary aim was to compare the economic costs incurred by health providers and patients and to compare health-related quality of life outcomes for adults diagnosed through HIVST or facility-based HTC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>We undertook a prospective cohort study in Blantyre, Malawi, between March 2013 and January 2015. We recruited HIV-positive adults identified through either HIVST or facility-based HTC who were participants of a cluster-randomized trial investigating health outcomes of offering HIVST (ISRCTN02004005).<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Ethical approval was obtained from the College of Medicine Ethics Review Committee, University of Malawi, and the University of Warwick Biomedical Research Ethics Committee. All participants provided informed consent.</p><p>The cluster-randomized trial comprised a population of approximately 34,000 residents<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> where adult HIV prevalence was approximately 18%.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Participants in control clusters had access to routine facility-based HTC, and those in intervention clusters were offered HIVST through resident community counselors in addition to facility-based HTC. Participants who self-tested did not have to disclose their HIV test result to community counselors but were offered posttest counseling, advice on where to seek care and a &#x0201c;self-referral card&#x0201d; for HIV clinics. HIVST was provided in the intervention clusters for a 2-year period, starting in February 2012.</p><p>We recruited participants from 3 HIV clinics located in the study areas: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Ndirande Health Centre, and Chilomoni Health Centre. At the start of this study, these clinics had initiated 19,929, 6656, and 4485 individuals onto ART.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Eligible participants were HIV-positive adults (aged &#x02265;18 years) attending for first assessment for ART initiation and resident within trial clusters (verified using global position system-based &#x0201c;Map Book&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>). Participants who had not accessed either HIVST or facility-based HTC, or who had been assessed for ART initiation or started ART at another location, were excluded.</p><p>All care was provided by the routine health system. HIV-positive individuals underwent CD4 count measurements, tuberculosis (TB) screening, provision of cotrimoxazole, and ART adherence counseling. Multiple visits may have been required to complete this assessment. Those who met Malawi national ART eligibility criteria (CD4 count &#x0003c;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or WHO stage 3 or 4, or breastfeeding or pregnant) were initiated onto ART.</p><p>Participants initiated onto ART returned to the HIV clinic at regular intervals for assessment by clinic nurses [or clinical officers (available at all clinics), or doctors (available at QECH only) if unwell]. At clinic visits, ART medication was provided, adherence and response to treatment was assessed, and other clinical problems (eg, TB) managed. Visits varied in frequency, depending on response to ART.</p><p>We interviewed participants after each visit to the HIV clinic, and if they were initiated onto ART, they were followed-up for one year. On recruitment, the study team administered structured questionnaires, recording age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, employment status, self-reported income, mode of HIV testing (HIVST, or facility HTC), WHO clinical stage, CD4 count before starting ART, and tracing details. Participants were defined as lost to follow-up if they did not return for scheduled clinic visits and could not be traced.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Direct Health Provider Costs</title><p>After each visit to the HIV clinic, the study team used structured questionnaires to record healthcare resources for each participant, including medical personnel seen, investigations performed, and ART and other medications prescribed. Resources related to hospitalization were not available from participants' HIV clinic records. Primary resource-based costing was undertaken to estimate unit costs for each resource input and consequently total direct health provider costs.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Appendix A, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/QAI/A996">http://links.lww.com/QAI/A996</ext-link> provides a detailed description of the costing process, and Appendix B, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/QAI/A996">http://links.lww.com/QAI/A996</ext-link> the estimated unit costs estimated for healthcare resources from the primary costing studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Direct Non-medical and Indirect Costs</title><p>An interviewer-administered questionnaire was also used after each clinic visit to record participants' direct nonmedical and indirect costs and, where appropriate, costs incurred by family member(s) or carer(s) who accompanied them to clinic. Development, language translations, and pilot testing of questionnaires followed previous procedures.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Direct nonmedical costs included costs of transportation, food, drinks, and other items bought as a consequence of health center visits. For indirect costs, we recorded whether participants or their carers had taken time off work, and multiplied time by self-reported income.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> There are no formal payments to access public health services in Malawi.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Health-Related Quality of Life</title><p>The Chichewa EuroQoL EQ-5D-3L<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> was used to measure HRQoL after each clinic visit. Participants completed both the descriptive EQ-5D-3L system and the accompanying visual analogue scale (VAS).<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Responses to the 5 dimensions (mobility; self-care; usual activities; pain; anxiety) of the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system were converted into an EQ-5D utility score using a tariff. Tariff sets have been derived from national surveys of the general population, with a subset of the 243 health states being valued, most commonly using the time trade-off method.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> As there is no Malawian EQ-5D tariff, we used the Zimbabwean EQ-5D tariff set to derive an EQ-5D utility score for each study participant at each time point.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The VAS is similar to a thermometer and ranges from 100 (best imaginable health state) to 0 (worst imaginable health state). Participants recorded how good or bad their health was on the day of the clinic visit by drawing a line on the scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Analyses used Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corporation, TX). Costs were converted into 2014 US Dollars and International Dollars.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> International dollars are hypothetical units of currency that take into account differences in purchasing power across countries, thereby providing a means of comparing cost estimates across jurisdictions. Principal component analysis was used to generate wealth quintiles combining socioeconomic variables, which included 9 household assets and home environment variables.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>We undertook multiple imputation using chained equations to impute missing values for cost and HRQoL estimates for participants lost to follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Comparable to previous studies, our imputation models included mode of HIV testing received, baseline CD4 count, age, sex, and socioeconomic variables.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We used predictive mean matching to impute missing values for cost and HRQoL outcomes as they were nonnormally distributed, and to ensure imputed costs were nonnegative.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>We estimated the total direct health provider cost, total direct nonmedical and indirect cost, and total societal costs for each study participant. For direct health provider costs, we first estimated total cost for clinic consultations, total costs for investigations, and total costs for treatments. These costs were summed to estimate total direct health provider costs. Health provider costs only included the costs of providing HIV and related medical care at the clinics. The total societal cost was estimated by summing all direct and indirect costs.</p><p>We estimated costs for 2 time periods. The first was for the ART assessment period. This included all costs from first attendance to the HIV clinic and continued until the clinic had decided whether a participant was eligible for ART initiation. The second was for the first year on ART and included all costs from the first visit to be initiated onto ART until the participant had been on ART for one year. We estimated mean differences in these costs by mode of HIV testing using bootstrap methods with 500 replications to estimate bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (CI).<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> We undertook multivariable analysis to investigate the independent effects of mode of HIV testing on costs. The multivariable model was adjusted for age, sex, and other socio-demographic variables, in addition to baseline CD4 count.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> We used generalized linear models (GLM) and ran model diagnostics to determine optimal choices for distributional family and link functions.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>For HRQoL assessments, we estimated EQ-5D utility and VAS scores immediately before ART initiation, and for those who initiated ART, after one-year of treatment. We estimated mean differences, and 95% bootstrapped CIs, in HRQoL outcomes by mode of HIV testing received. In addition, we undertook multivariable analysis to investigate the independent effects of mode of HIV testing and baseline CD4 count on the EQ-5D utility scores. The multivariable models were additionally adjusted for age, sex, and other socio-demographic variables. As EQ-5D utility scores are nonnormally distributed, negatively skewed and truncated at 1.0, we evaluated 4 commonly used estimators for our multivariable analyses: ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, tobit regression, fractional logit regression, and censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) regression.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We compared mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) statistics between observed and estimated EQ-5D utility scores to determine the choice of estimator. We also undertook sensitivity analysis using the UK York A1 tariff<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> to investigate the impact of using an alternative tariff to determine EQ-5D utility scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 325 trial residents attended the HIV clinics for assessment for ART initiation over the study period: 265 after facility-based HTC and 60 after HIVST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

The mean EQ-5D utility score was 0.230 (95% CI: 0.163 to 0.296) lower in individuals whose CD4 count was below 50 cells/&#x003bc;L compared with those whose CD4 count was &#x02265;350 cells/&#x003bc;L on assessment for ART.</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>TABLE 6.</label><caption><p>Multivariable Analysis Exploring Relationship Between CD4 Count, Mode of HIV Testing and Pre-ART EQ-5D Utility Score*</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="qai-75-280-g007"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main finding of this study was that the economic costs of providing HIV care and ART to HIV-positive individuals identified through HIVST were comparable to those identified through standard facility-based HTC services. Health-related quality of life was worse among those with lower CD4 counts, with improvements seen after ART initiation, irrespective of mode of HIV testing. These findings emphasize that once HIV self-testers are linked into HIV services, their economic outcomes are comparable to those linked to services after facility-based HTC.</p><p>Health provider costs for assessing HIV-positive individuals for ART initiation were lower for HIV self-testers. This difference was because of lower health provider costs associated with clinic consultations and from provision of medical treatments. Additionally, fewer HIV self-testers were clinically assessed as WHO stage 3 or 4. In comparison with community-based HIV testing services, individuals accessing HIV testing at health facilities were often unwell for other reasons (eg, TB) or have more advanced HIV clinical disease.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> These individuals may need medical care for management for these other problems or for investigation to exclude HIV associated illnesses before initiating ART. Although the cost savings demonstrated are small at the individual-level, at the population-level, these could be significant with increasing availability of HIVST.</p><p>We estimated the annual health provider cost of managing a patient on ART to be approximately 2014 US$170, comparable to previous estimates for Malawi (US$136 per person per year in 2011).<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Health provider and societal costs were not affected by modality of HIV testing before entering HIV care services. Malawi has followed a public health approach to scaling-up its HIV treatment services with less reliance on diagnostic tests for clinical assessment, and therefore the majority of individuals use comparable levels of healthcare resources.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> We did not find differences in healthcare utilization between the 2 groups. Although it is reassuring that these costs were comparable, the findings highlight opportunities to explore how HIV treatment should be provided as we move toward universal access to ART.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p>The study demonstrates the relatively high costs incurred by patients when accessing HIV care. Individuals incurred a cost of approximately US$3 during their assessment for ART eligibility and US$13 during the first year following ART initiation. The majority of Malawians live on less than $2 a day.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Antiretroviral therapy is provided free, but those accessing care incur costs of transport or because of taking time off work to attend clinics.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> These costs can also have a negative impact on adherence to therapy.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> ART can be effectively provided in people's homes through community distribution models.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Further work is needed to explore the risks and benefits of home provision of treatment.</p><p>HRQoL as measured by the EQ-5D has been shown to be responsive to change among HIV-positive patients in high-income settings,<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> but few studies have used this measure in sub-Saharan African settings.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The EQ-5D utility score provides an objective assessment of HRQoL for cost-utility analysis, with the VAS scores reflecting respondents' own assessments of their HRQoL. We found that EQ-5D utility scores to be significantly associated with an HIV-positive individual's CD4 count, with improvements after initiation of ART. Participants also reported higher VAS scores after ART initiation. The findings support the beneficial impact of ART on both quality and quantity of life and illustrate the importance of reaching those not in care before their disease advances. The mode of HIV testing had no independent impact on HRQoL outcomes.</p><p>This study is not without its limitations. The numbers recruited into the study were small, and many were lost to follow-up. Although we undertook multiple imputation to account for this, our findings may be limited because those lost to follow-up are potentially a sicker population, with poorer HRQoL, and, had they remained in care, higher healthcare resource use. We were not able to include healthcare resources used as a result of hospitalization because there was no routine medical record keeping or linking of records between community, outpatient, and inpatient services. Furthermore, some of the unit costs estimated for the healthcare resource inputs, for example costs of consultations with a healthcare worker, represent average costs for average reported duration of consultations. These information system issues reduced our ability to detect differences in economic outcomes, but are unlikely to bias our findings.</p><p>A further limitation is that the EQ-5D tool only evaluates HRQoL across 5 health dimensions and may therefore not capture all relevant aspects of HRQoL. The lack of a Malawian tariff led us to use the Zimbabwean tariff to derive EQ-5D-3L utility scores. However, the EQ-5D tool is widely used for health economic analyses, and it is accepted practice to use tariffs from another country where none exists for the country of interest provided the 2 populations would value health comparably.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A final study limitation is that the recent change in ART initiation guidelines<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> means that we are unable to comment on the economic outcomes of those who would in the future start treatment with early HIV disease.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that once HIV self-testers link into HIV treatment services, the costs of providing HIV care and improvements in HRQoL from ART are no different to those identified through facility-based HTC. The findings add to the growing literature supporting the scale-up of HIVST in the region. Full economic evaluations are needed to explore whether implementing HIVST is cost-effective. Our assessments of economic costs and preference-based HRQoL outcomes can help inform such analyses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the community members who participated in the study and the patients and staff at Ndirande Health Centre, Chilomoni Health Centre, and Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre.
