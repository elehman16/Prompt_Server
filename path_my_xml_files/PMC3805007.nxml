frequent reading, assignment correction, computer use and writing on a board put them at
risk of developing occupational related neck pain. Available studies of neck pain
experienced by teachers are limited. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
training of deep cervical flexor muscles with pressure biofeedback has any significant
advantage over conventional training for pain and disability experienced by school
teachers with neck pain. [Subjects] Thirty teachers aged 25&#x02013;45 years with neck pain and
poor craniocervical flexion test participated in this study. [Methods] A pretest posttest
experimental group design was used in which experimental group has received training with
pressure biofeedback and conventional exercises while control group received conventional
exercises only. Measurements of dependent variables were taken at baseline, and after 2
and 4 weeks of training. Pain intensity was assessed using a numeric pain rating scale and
functional disability was assessed using the neck disability index. [Results] The data
analysis revealed that there was significant improvement in pain and disability in both
the groups and the results were better in the experimental group. [Conclusion] Addition of
pressure biofeedback for deep cervical flexor muscles training gave a better result than
conventional exercises alone. Feedback helps motor learning which is the set of processes
associated with practice or experience leading to permanent changes in ability to
respond.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neck pain</kwd><kwd>Disability</kwd><kwd>Teachers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neck pain (NP) is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. Estimates indicate that 67%
of individuals will suffer neck pain at some stage of their life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. NP is a significant health problem not only for adults but
also for the young. The onset and course of NP is affected by multiple factors with
physical, psychosocial and individual factors interacting in the development of these
disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Teaching is one of the professions in which NP is very common. It was found that 69.3% of
secondary school teachers suffer from it<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The lifetime prevalence of NP in secondary school teachers is 68.2%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The job nature of secondary school teachers involves a lot
of head down posture, such as in frequent reading, assignment correction, and writing on the
blackboard<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, secondary school
teachers are at risk of developing occupationally related NP and upper limb pain. High
workload, low colleague support, high anxiety and some psychological factors have been found
to be significant risk factors for the development of NP in teachers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The transition from conventional to modern methods of
teaching is a major cause of teachers developing NP. Available studies of NP and its causes
among teachers are limited. According to one study back pain, neck pain and headache, are
the most common ailments of the workers in the school environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study of nursery school teachers found 26.5% of
them complained of neck stiffness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The learning environment for children is progressively being facilitated by new forms of
information technology (IT). Traditional methods of teaching, such as school textbooks, are
gradually being enhanced and replaced by new forms of IT such as internet sources and
interactive multimedia software. These initiatives have resulted in an increase in the
number of classes that involve computing. Several studies have shown associations between
physical exposures and neck/upper extremity symptoms during computer work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Long duration of computer work is associated with prolonged periods of holding a static
posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is most pronounced in
the neck and shoulder region, resulting in increased forward neck flexion and increased
static muscle tension in this region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increased forward neck flexion may result
in increased tension in posture, stabilizing muscles as well as increasing compression
forces in the articulation of the cervical spine, resulting in a higher risk of work related
muscular disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Deep Cervical Flexor muscles (DCF) are considered to be an important stabilizer of the
head-on-neck posture. It has been theorized that when muscle performance is impaired, the
balance between the stabilizers on the posterior aspect of the neck and the DCFs will be
disrupted, resulting in loss of proper alignment and posture, which is then likely to
contribute to cervical impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore DCF training is recommended for increasing the endurance of these postural
muscles, leading to improvement in NP. Research recommends that training that emphasizes the
correct use of DCF, before introducing strengthening of the global cervical spine
musculature, is more effective in the rehabilitation of the cervical spine than nonspecific
strengthening of neck muscles. The craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) regime appears to be
an ideal strategy for specifically activating DCFs and reducing augmented activity of the
SCM muscle. There is evidence that restoration of the supporting capacity of DCF parallels
reduction in neck pain and cervicogenic headache. Hence, DCF muscle training is recommended
for the clinical management of neck pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Jull et al. endorse a specific craniocervical flexion exercise (CCFEx) protocol in the
supine position. This program initially involves retraining a static holding contraction of
the target muscles at a submaximal level to improve their tonic postural function. The type
of training employed is based on the nature of the dysfunction presenting in these
muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as their normal functional role<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercises constituted the conventional exercises of
our study.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether, there is an improvement in pain and
disability of school teachers with NP after 4 weeks of deep cervical flexor training with
pressure biofeedback.</p><sec><title>Significance of study</title><p>In India, the teacher is considered equivalent to God. Thus future of students depends
more or less on teachers. If teachers suffer, it directly affects the future of students
as well. So, we need to make teachers physically, mentally and functionally better so that
they can focus on the betterment of students. This study also emphasizes the role of DCF
training in decreasing pain and disability among teachers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty teachers (24 females and 6 males) aged group 25 to 45&#x02005;years participated in this
study. The subjects were teachers of the Central Board of Secondary Education affiliated
schools who had more than 5&#x02005;years of experience. The teachers were included if they had a
neck pain score on the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) of greater than 5, mild to moderate
disability scores on the neck disability Index (NDI) and poor CCF test results. Subjects
were excluded if they had undergone any cervical spine surgery or reported any neurological
signs. Subjects with a history of congenital or acquired postural deformity, spinal cord
compression, tumor, instability, fracture, inflammatory disease or infection were also
excluded.</p><p>The proposal for the study was presented before the Review Committee of Hamdard University
and received approval.</p><p>A pretest, posttest experimental group design was used in the study. After selection,
subjects were randomly allocated to one of the two groups with 15 subjects in each: Group A:
the experimental group received deep cervical flexor muscles training with pressure
biofeedback and conventional exercises. Group B: the control group received deep cervical
flexor muscles training with only conventional exercises.</p><p>The independent variable in the study was DCF muscles training and the dependent variables
were pain (P) on NPRS, and functional disability (D) on NDI.</p><p>We used a pressure stabilizer, Pressure Biofeedback Unit (Stabilizer TM, Chattanooga Group,
INC., Chattanooga, TN), a height adjustable bed, markers and papers.</p><p>A letter was sent to the principals of CBSE affiliated schools with details of the research
and their consent was obtained. The study was conducted on school premises in the medical
room. The teachers were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, their
informed consent was sought. Selected subjects were randomly allocated to the two groups.
Subjects were informed about nature and procedure of study and all their questions were
answered.</p><p>Baseline information of the dependent variables was taken at the beginning of study, on day
1 (P0, D0), before commencement of the training protocol. Data were collected at the end of
2 weeks of training (P14, D14) and at the end of 4 weeks (P28, D38). NPRS and NDI were used
to evaluate the level of pain and functional disability, respectively.</p><p>Both experimental and control groups performed conventional exercises. In addition the
experimental group also performed deep cervical flexor muscles training using pressure
biofeedback. The exercise session was conducted under the supervision of the examiner.
Subjects were asked not to receive any other specific intervention for neck pain. Training
was done for 4 weeks, 4 days a week with 2 minutes rest between sets. Exercise duration did
not exceed 20 minutes per day. The CCFT exercise program included 3 sets in a session 10
repetitions per set.</p><p>The data was analyzed using SPSS software. The independent t test was used to compare age
and baseline values of pain and disability between groups. The paired t test was used to
compare pain on NPRS and Disability on NDI within groups. All dependent variables were
compared between baseline, their values at 2 weeks and their values at end of 4 weeks. The
independent t test was used to compare pain on NPRS and disability on NDI between the
groups. The values of both groups, group A and group B, were compared at baseline and for
the difference from baseline, at the end of 2 weeks and at the end of 4 weeks. We used 95%
CI and the results were accepted as significant if p&#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty teachers, 24 females and 6 males, participated in the study. Subjects had a mean age

using pressure biofeedback on neck pain and disability experienced by school teachers with
neck pain. The results of our study show that there was a significant change in both pain
and disability in both the groups after the intervention. However, the experimental group
showed better results than the control group in terms of reduction of pain and
disability.</p><p>The amount of NP and disability were not significantly different between the members of the
two groups at the start of the study (baseline measurement). This could be attributed to the
same nature of the duties performed by teachers at school.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study in which craniocervical flexion training was
given to teachers having neck pain. Therefore the lack of literature in this area limited
the scope for direct comparison with other studies. The results of our study can be compared
to other studies in a general way only, due to differences in treatment protocols, subject
population, measures taken, and duration of treatment.</p><p>The level of pain decrease in both the groups was significant. This is explained by
research on mechanisms of pain reduction through exercises. The increase in endorphins that
occurs after training and better neuromuscular control may decrease pain. Muscle
contractions activate muscle ergoreceptors (stretch receptors). Afferent from these muscles
cause endogenous options to be released and also the beta-endorphins from the pituitary
gland. These secretions may cause both peripheral and central pain to be blocked<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neck exercises may allow the
musculotendinous proprioceptors to downgrade their stretch reflex responses using operant
conditioning techniques and multiple practice sessions. The intrafusal fibers may be reset,
discontinuing the cycle of muscle tension, impaired circulation with metabolite accumulation
and pain associated with myogenic (myofascial) pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The neck disability index in our study showed significant changes in both groups. This
result may be explained by the reduction in pain intensity which can bring about improvement
in disability. Herman et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup> also
proposed that the relationship between pain and neck disability index is quite strong as
pain intensity is one of the ten areas addressed in NDI. A relationship between these
variables would be expected.</p><p>Literature on NDI reports that the minimal detectable score and the minimal clinically
important difference is 5 points. Moreover it is recommended that the NDI be used at
baseline and for every 2 weeks thereafter to measure the progress of therapy. This protocol
was followed in this study.</p><p>Deep cervical flexor training as a treatment for neck pain and resulting disability is
based on the rationale that deep cervical flexors, the longus colli muscle in particular,
have a major postural function in supporting cervical lordosis, since in the functional
mid-ranges of the cervical spine the lose their endurance capacity in patients with neck
pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is thought that pressure biofeedback specifically
targets DCF muscles and decreases neck pain.</p><p>Our results are supporting the initial hypothesis, are in agreement with those obtained in
a randomized controlled trial conducted by Jull et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, to determine the effect of 6 weeks of low-load craniocervical
flexion exercise on cervicogenic headache patients. The results showed that the treatment
significantly reduced the pain associated with neck movements and joint palpation.</p><p>A single case study done by Grant et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, also reported that the endurance of the deep cervical flexors
improved and there was a reduction in mechanosensitivity of selected neural, muscular and
articular structures of a screen based keyboard operator after four weeks of active
stabilization training of the deep cervical flexors and lower scapular muscle group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A possible explanation for our findings is that the factors influencing the school teachers
are multifactorial. No one single factor contributes to their pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Anthropometric
variations, the possible adverse developmental effects of prolonged exposure to postural
stresses, computer furniture, mental stress and reports of pain and vision factors can all
influence school teachers&#x02019; posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Most of the teachers complained that they didn&#x02019;t have the time to take care of themselves
due to school work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly a
dedicated 20&#x02005;min for exercises at school itself as a part of their schedule for 4 weeks may
have had a good psychological impact on them, indirectly resulting in pain relief apart from
the physiological effect. Therefore, a multidimensional approach may be needed if
sustainable improvements are to be made including psychological assurance.</p><p>The experimental group may have shown better results because doing exercises with constant
feedback encourages patients doing the exercise to perform it correctly and gets them more
involved in the treatment. There are two types of extrinsic feedback- knowledge of results
(KR) and knowledge of performance (KP). Pressure biofeedback is a type of KP, which is given
during and after performance of a task and is related to how the task is performed. A
therapist provides the information through the apparatus and by attending to the information
the patient forms a &#x0201c;closed loop&#x0201d;. Feedback helps in motor learning which is a set of
processes associated with practice or experience leading to permanent changes in the
capability of responding. Patients become more motivated. Biofeedback techniques are used to
augment the patient&#x02019;s sensory feedback mechanisms through precise information about body
processes that might otherwise be inaccessible. Positive reinforcement is the operative
learning model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The treatment duration of the deep cervical flexor training protocol we used in our study
was modified to four weeks, four days a week, once a day with every session monitored by a
therapist following an original protocol prescribed by Jull et al., which was performed by
patients at home with pressure biofeedback, twice a day for 6 weeks and monitored by
therapist only once a week<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose
of modification was to inculcate the treatment protocol in teachers&#x02019; school timetable and to
suit their schedule. Also conducting every session under supervision of therapist was
considered more suitable for teachers than unsupervised performance with biofeedback at
home. This could have psychologically assured the teachers and contributed to the positive
results.</p><p>This study may help to prevent neck pain or arrest it in the early stages in the teaching
population. It may also improve the functional status of teachers. Once the teachers feel
better this would make their job easier and more productive.</p><p>Given that computer use in schools is increasing day by day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, the risk of development of
musculoskeletal disorders within the teaching population has also increased resulting in a
potentially greater number of disorders. Musculoskeletal disorders have been associated with
a decline in productivity in adults and seriously affect work performance. Supposing that
these symptoms now emerge earlier in a lifespan than in previous generations, we should
expect increasing sick leave and early retirement. This study is a step towards prevention
of such possibilities in the future.</p><p>This study was performed on limited number of subjects, 15 subjects in each group.
Furthermore, subject and researcher blinding was not implemented, and teacher&#x02019;s posture was
not included in the study. Also the effect of DCF muscles training on posture and endurance
of DCF muscles was not evaluated, and due to limitation of time we could not conduct a
follow up of the patients.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study in which deep cervical flexor training was used
for teachers having neck pain. To give this protocol a more grounded base of practice,
further studies need to be carried out on this group with larger samples.</p><p>Further studies using 6 weeks or longer duration with subsequent follow up are recommended,
and the relationship of forward head posture and NP in this group also needs documentation.
Electromyography could be used to provide additional information on muscle activation
associated with any observed postural changes. Moreover, future studies could be designed to
address the potential contribution of various factors, including musculoskeletal imbalances,
that might possibly influence neck pain and forward head posture in this group. More
dynamic, objective and functional outcome measures should be taken that better reflect the
improvement in the postural endurance of deep cervical flexors resulting from therapy.</p><p>The results of this study show that there was significant improvement in pain and
disability after 4 weeks of deep cervical flexor training for school teachers with neck
pain. Moreover training using both pressure biofeedback and conventional exercises was found
to be superior to training which only used conventional exercises.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud
