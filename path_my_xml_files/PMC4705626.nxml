Nearly 500,000 of these patients have severe asthma with severe symptoms and frequent exacerbations that are inadequately controlled with available treatments. The burden of severe asthma on the NHS is enormous, accounting for 80&#x000a0;% of the total asthma cost (&#x000a3;1 billion), with frequent exacerbations and expensive medications generating much of this cost.</p><p>Of those patients with severe asthma, 70&#x000a0;% are sensitised to indoor aeroallergens, and the level of exposure to allergens determines the symptoms; patients exposed to high levels are therefore most at risk of exacerbations and hospital admissions.</p><p>The LASER trial aims to assess whether a new treatment, temperature controlled laminar airflow (TLA) delivered by the Airsonett&#x02122; device, can reduce the frequency of exacerbations in patients with severe allergic asthma by reducing exposure to aeroallergens overnight.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This multicentre study is a placebo-controlled, blinded, randomised controlled, parallel group trial. A total of 222 patients with a new or current diagnosis of severe allergic asthma will be assigned with a random element in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an active device for one year or a placebo device. The primary outcome is the frequency of severe asthma exacerbations occurring over a 12-month period, defined in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines. Secondary outcomes include changes in asthma control, lung function, asthma-specific and global quality of life for participants and their carers, adherence to intervention, healthcare resource use and costs, and cost-effectiveness. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to elicit participant&#x02019;s and their partner&#x02019;s perceptions of the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Effective measures of allergen avoidance have, to date, proved elusive. The LASER trial aims to address this. The study will ascertain whether home-based nocturnal TLA usage over a 12-month period can reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve asthma control and quality of life as compared to placebo, whilst being cost-effective and acceptable to adults with poorly controlled, severe allergic asthma. The results of this study will be widely applicable to the many patients with allergic asthma both in the UK and internationally.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN46346208">ISRCTN46346208</ext-link> (Date assigned 22 January 2014).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Severe asthma</kwd><kwd>Temperature-controlled laminar airflow</kwd><kwd>Exacerbation</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Cost effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Asthma affects over 5.4 million people in the United Kingdom, with nearly 500,000 experiencing severe symptoms and frequent exacerbations that are inadequately controlled with available treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The burden of severe asthma on the National Health Service (NHS) is enormous, accounting for 80&#x000a0;% of the total asthma cost (&#x000a3;1 billion; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/facts-and-statistics/">https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/facts-and-statistics/</ext-link>) with frequent exacerbations and expensive medications generating much of this cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Current treatments including oral corticosteroids, &#x02018;steroid-sparing&#x02019; immuno suppressants and monoclonal antibody therapies are often of limited efficacy and have potentially serious side effects (steroids, immunosuppressive agents) or are prohibitively expensive (monoclonal antibodies). The adverse effects of long-term oral steroids include adrenal suppression, decreased bone mineral density, diabetes, and increased cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The anti-IgE treatment Omalizumab&#x02122; has been shown to reduce exacerbations by up to 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and improve the quality of life in severe allergic asthma but can cost as much as &#x000a3;26,640 per year, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which is substantially more than the current annual rental cost of a TLA device (&#x000a3;2,088).</p><p>The 2011 British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) national asthma guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and 2010 WHO consultation on severe asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] have highlighted an urgent need for research in severe asthma, acknowledging the limitations of available treatments in severe asthma and the dearth of clinical trials upon which to base management recommendations.</p><p>More than 70&#x000a0;% of severe asthmatic patients are sensitised to common aeroallergens and/or moulds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the level of allergen exposure determines symptoms; those exposed to high allergen levels are at an increased risk of exacerbations and hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Allergen avoidance has been widely recognised as a logical way of treating these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In controlled conditions, long-term allergen avoidance in sensitised asthmatics reduces airway inflammation with consequent symptomatic improvement, further supported by high-altitude, clean-air studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].Unfortunately, effective methods of allergen reduction have proved elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] with current measures being unable to reduce allergen load sufficiently to yield a consistent clinical improvement, thus leaving a significant gap in the potential strategies for reducing asthma severity through allergen reduction.</p><p>At night, airborne particles are carried by a persistent convection current established by the warm body, transporting allergens from the bedding area to the breathing zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Proof-of-concept studies have shown the TLA device reduces the total number of airborne particles and significantly reduces the increase in particles generated when turning in bed at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. When compared to a best-in-class traditional air cleaner, TLA is able to reduce exposure to potential allergens by a further 99&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We postulate that this highly significant reduction in nocturnal exposure, targeted to the breathing zone, explains why TLA may succeed in an area where so many other measures, including air filters, have failed.</p><p>The TLA device, when compared to a placebo, has proven efficacy on asthma-related quality of life and bronchial inflammation (measured by exhaled nitric oxide) in a pan-European multicentre Phase III study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;282, age range 7 to 70&#x000a0;years). The greatest benefit was seen in the more severe asthma patients who required higher intensity treatment and in patients with poorly controlled asthma. Whilst not powered to ascertain an effect on exacerbations, a post-hoc analysis showed a decreased exacerbation rate in more severe patients treated with TLA compared with placebo, with a trend towards significance (mean 0.23 TLA; 0.57 placebo <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07).</p><p>A further pragmatic, patient-centred RCT of this novel non-pharmacological treatment in severe allergic asthma is now warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary aim</title><p>The primary aim of the trial is to determine whether home-based nocturnal treatment with a temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) device can reduce the frequency of severe asthma exacerbations over a 1-year period. Exacerbations are defined according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria, that is, an acute deterioration in asthma that requires treatment with systemic corticosteroids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary aims</title><p>The secondary aims include assessing the impact of nocturnal TLA treatment on additional aspects of asthma control including symptoms, reliever use, airway obstruction, and on the risk of future adverse asthma outcomes, including an accelerated decline in lung function and the side-effects of treatment over the 12-month period. The impact of the treatment on the quality of life of the patients and their carers will be assessed using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and a generic health-related quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) for trial participants and the Adult Carer Quality of Life questionnaire (ACQoL) for participant&#x02019;s adult carers. The impact of the treatment on both the NHS and social costs, that is, healthcare utilisation, will be measured using patient questionnaires and a review of patient&#x02019;s records and education/work days lost, which will be assessed using the Work Productivity Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI) in both participants and their adult carers. These data will be further analysed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, using a cost-utility analysis to determine the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Finally, we aim to qualitatively evaluate the perceptions, values and opinions of the participants and their partners relating to the device to identify potential modifications that may improve patient acceptance and will inform future implementation of the device within the NHS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Exploratory aims</title><p>We will explore the possible associations of patient and environmental factors that may be associated with a treatment response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This is a multi-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial comparing an active TLA device with a placebo device over a 12-month period. The device is installed in the participant&#x02019;s home and each participant is required to attend six study visits at their usual referral hospital. Qualitative and health economics methods have been incorporated to the trial. A summary of the study design is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The trial includes a 4-month internal pilot to assess the recruitment and retention of participants, data collection methods and quality, and participant and partner experience of the trial through qualitative methods. Study recruitment commenced in May 2014. The plan is to conduct the trial in as many as 15 centres in the UK.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1134_Fig1_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Selection of participants</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Recruitment and informed consent</title><p>As both new and prevalent severe asthma patients can be included in the trial, a variety of approaches will be used for recruitment. Some referral centres have cohorts of well-characterised asthma patients with detailed clinical and biological information, who can be contacted directly by the research team and invited to local study information events or a screening visit in the clinic. Potential participants will also be identified through existing clinic registers and referrals to severe asthma clinics. Following advertisement and launch of the website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lasertrial.co.uk/">http://www.lasertrial.co.uk/</ext-link>), a mechanism will be in place for patients to self-refer to the study team for screening. Participant&#x02019;s adult carers and or their adult partners will also be requested to attend events/visits where possible because they will be recruited to participate in the trial. Participant information sheets will be made available to potential participants prior to their screening visit. Separate information sheets for Carers and Partners will also be available. Participants invited to the screening clinics will have been &#x02018;pre-screened&#x02019; for known exclusion criteria such as age, smoking, co-morbidities and concomitant use of excluded asthma treatments.

The reduced temperature allows the filtered air to descend in a laminar stream, displacing allergen-rich air from the breathing zone reducing allergen exposure without creating draft or dehydration. The device is installed next to the participant&#x02019;s bed by a qualified engineer from the company. The device is pre-programmed to turn on and off at times specified by the trial participant but can be turned on and off by manual override if the participant wishes to use the device for an extended period or turn the device off when not in use. The device is easy to use with no identified safety concerns in previous trials. The device is CE marked and licensed for use in the UK for allergic asthma. The device uses the same amount of electricity as a 60&#x000a0;W light bulb and has an anticipated life-span of 5&#x000a0;years with filter changes required every 6&#x000a0;months. Participants will be asked to sleep under the device for at least 5 nights per week except when on holiday during the 12-month treatment period. Participants will record whether they have used the device or not and number of hours used on a daily basis, recorded in a &#x02018;LASER&#x02019; diary. Any additional hours used during the day will also be recorded in the diary.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The temperature-controlled Laminar Airflow (TLA) device (Airsonett.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1134_Fig2_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Control arm</title><p>The control treatment consists of a placebo device that appears physically identical to the intervention device to the study participant. These devices are adjusted to deliver isothermal air, instead of slightly cooled air, and holes in the filter effectively bypass it whilst still maintaining an equivalent sound and airflow level to an active device. This allows the placebo device to deliver a laminar flow of non-filtered, non-descending, isothermal air which, when mixed with the warm body convection, will ascend towards the ceiling and thus have no effect on the normal air flow pattern around the breathing zone. No difference exists in the air delivery rate, perceived air movements or sound level between an active or placebo device. The human body is not able to detect an absolute temperature difference of 0.75&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and as such, no perceptible temperature difference exists when sleeping beneath an active or a placebo device. Electricity usage is the same as for active devices, and the filter is changed at 6&#x000a0;month intervals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Measurement of primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome, severe asthma exacerbations, are defined according to ATS/ERS guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] as a worsening of asthma requiring systemic corticosteroids&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;mg prednisolone or equivalent daily (or&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;% increase in dose if maintenance 30&#x000a0;mg prednisolone or above), for 3 or more days.

Confidentiality of participant data will be assured according to GCP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size</title><p>Based on an estimated rate of two severe asthma exacerbations per participant over the 12-month period in the placebo group, a minimum of 222 participants (111 per group) will be required to provide 80&#x000a0;% power (at 5&#x000a0;% two-sided significance level) to detect a clinically meaningful 25&#x000a0;% reduction in the average exacerbation rate in the group using the TLA device.</p><p>This sample size is based on a Poisson regression model, with the treatment group as the covariate and a 10&#x000a0;% overall dropout rate. A review of comparative interventions of proven efficacy in severe asthma gave effect sizes ranging from 21 to 63&#x000a0;%, with a mean of 41&#x000a0;%. Given that this is a pragmatic trial where we expect our intervention to be less effective than an efficacy trial, we have chosen a deliberately more conservative effect size of 25&#x000a0;%. This represents on average, one less severe exacerbation every 2&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Clinical outcomes analysis</title><p>The primary statistical analysis will be carried out on the basis of intention-to-treat (ITT). The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, the rate of clinically significant exacerbations over the 12-month period, will be analysed using a Poisson regression model to compare the rate of asthma exacerbations between the two groups with log of time used as an offset variable. Further analysis will adjust for the baseline characteristics including the ACQ score, age, body mass index (BMI) and sex.</p><p>Continuous secondary endpoints which involve repeated measures at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months (including measures of lung function, composite asthma control scores and health-related quality-of-life measures) will be analysed using longitudinal analysis methods, including mixed effect models to determine any effect of the TLA device over time. Continuous variables with only baseline and 12&#x000a0;months data, (including lung function and carer quality of life measures) will be analysed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the 12-month outcome adjusted where appropriate for baseline, minimisation factors and other important factors as detailed for the primary outcome.</p><p>Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves and log-rank test will be used to compare the time to first asthma exacerbation between the two groups. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to evaluate the effect of TLA device on the time to first asthma exacerbation, adjusting for the same covariates as in the primary analysis. Since the analysis of only time to first exacerbation leaves out much of the data, analysis incorporating multiple time-to-event (recurrent exacerbations) methods will also be used, including the Andersen&#x02013;Gill extension.</p><p>The proportion of participants experiencing severe exacerbations over the 12-month follow-up period will be compared using a continuity-corrected Chi-squared test. The duration of severe exacerbations, the total number of days in an exacerbation state over the 12-month follow-up period, and the number of health care utilisations will be compared between the two groups using two-sample independent t-tests.</p><p>Exploratory sub-group analyses will include an assessment of factors associated with an improved treatment response including objective markers of bronchial and systemic allergy and inflammation, lung function, asthma and rhinitis control, quality of life and level of indoor air quality. The predictive effect of the biomarkers on exacerbations will be assessed by including the biomarker as an independent covariate together with the biomarker-treatment interaction using Poisson regression modelling in a multivariate framework (as described for the primary outcome).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Missing data</title><p>We will attempt to minimize the missing data due to item non-response during the long follow-up period by ensuring timely contact with the participants and robust follow-up procedures. The expected participant&#x02019;s dropout has already been factored into the sample size calculation. Missing data will be reported with reasons given where available, and the missing data pattern, explored. In order to be consistent with the ITT, missing data for the primary endpoint will be imputed using multiple imputation (MI) techniques. Our imputation model will be sufficiently general to include all the baseline variables thought to be important predictors of the response indicator of each target variable to be imputed. This will improve the validity of the imputation model under the missing at random (MAR) assumption on which the MI is based. In addition, an ignorable likelihood-based analysis will be applied for the mixed effect models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Interim analysis and criteria for early study termination</title><p>No interim analysis is planned; however, the DSMC will perform regular reviews of all study outcome and adverse event data to ensure that there is no difference in rates of hospitalisation or exacerbation in either group. The DSMC will determine final criteria for early study termination, which may be based on clear-cut evidence of worsened safety in one of the trial arms, and in the case of evidence beyond reasonable doubt of clear-cut benefit in the primary outcome measure, an effect size which would change clinical practice in the presence of the current literature and understanding of the disease area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>The perspective adopted in the economic evaluation will be that of the National Health Service (NHS) and social services; therefore, productivity losses and over-the-counter medication costs will not be included in the base case analysis. However, in a sensitivity analysis, we will assess the impact of including these costs on the cost-effectiveness results.</p><p>A within-trial cost-utility analysis will explore the incremental cost per QALY gained by TLA usage when compared to sham-TLA usage. Cost and effect results will be reported as means with standard deviations, with mean differences between the two patient groups reported alongside 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CI). Incremental cost-effectiveness will be calculated by dividing the difference in costs by the difference in effects. Uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be explored using non-parametric bootstrapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Building on the results of the trial and subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis, a Markov model will be constructed to determine the costs and outcomes, over the life-time of the patient, of TLA usage. The model structure will be informed by results from this trial, and from previously published studies, with experts within the team advising on the final structure of the model. The analysis will determine the cost per life year gained and cost per QALY gained when nocturnal TLA treatment is compared to placebo. The model will be run over the patient lifetime, with costs and benefits discounted at a rate of 3.5&#x000a0;%. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted to deal with uncertainty in model parameters and cost-acceptability curves presented, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and will be extended to consider the application of value of information (VoI) techniques, which are included in economic evaluations to inform policy decisions about the value of further research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>Informed consent for participation in the qualitative study will be sought at Screening Visit 1. All participants taking part in the LASER trial will be invited to take part in the qualitative study, although this is not mandatory.</p><p>During the initial 4-month pilot phase of the trial, telephone interviews will be conducted with participants. Telephone interviews will follow a topic guide developed in conjunction with the PPI members and will focus on the study procedures to elicit aspects of the study that may be improved. We will also gather information about participant&#x02019;s experience of using the TLA device. The qualitative interviews will help to identify potential barriers to recruitment, treatment adherence and device acceptability. Telephone interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. Results of the telephone interviews will be used to inform subsequent development and refinement of trial processes. The interviews will also be used to strengthen the frequently asked questions area of the website. Key themes identified during the telephone interviews will be used to inform the topic guide for the later focus group interviews.</p><p>Following completion of their 12-month treatment period, participants who have consented to participation in the focus group interviews will be invited to attend. Focus groups will be held for both satisfied and non-satisfied users. All interviews will be digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and entered into NVivo10, a qualitative software package for systematic and transparent data management. Contributions by participants will remain anonymous. An identification using a pseudonym will be assigned to each participant at recruitment. No &#x02018;real&#x02019; names will be included in any reports. Care will be taken to always ensure any direct quotes used in study report or papers to illustrate the findings will not be directly attributable to individuals.</p><p>We will use Framework Analysis, a three-stage analytic process, to analyse the data. This involves identifying initial themes by indexing the content of the data; this then guides the formation of a framework within which transcribed material is synthesised. Key categories are then identified to help describe the data. Finally, patterns of association are explored and attempts made to explain why those patterns occur.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Patient public involvement</title><p>Patient public involvement has been sought throughout.

The trial team considered alternative &#x02018;add-on&#x02019; treatments in severe asthma (for example, omalizumab and bronchial thermoplasty), but these vary greatly in indication, use and delivery; are not suitable for every patient; and would therefore not be able to be used consistently or safely in an &#x02018;active&#x02019; control group. As the TLA device is unique in its design and purpose and is intended as an addition to standard asthma treatment, the use of a placebo device is warranted here and was deemed acceptable by the service users consulted on the study design.</p><p>Throughout the trial, participants in both treatment arms will receive standard asthma care in accordance with the national BTS/SIGN guidelines for the management of asthma in adults. No treatments or care will be withheld at any point in the study, with all participants (in either arm) able to receive any care considered appropriate by the treating physicians.</p><p>All participants completing at least 6&#x000a0;months of the trial follow-up period will be offered the option of having an active device in their home for a further 4&#x000a0;years, provided and maintained by the manufacturers Airsonett&#x02122;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Funding source, sponsor and trial oversight</title><p>This study has been funded through a competitive grant application to the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) funding stream.

They recommended that if further studies were to be considered that they should be methodologically rigorous and use other methods than those used so far.</p><p>In designing the LASER Trial, we have attempted to address the question of whether this novel allergen intervention can reduce the frequency of severe exacerbations and improve asthma control and quality of life as compared to placebo, whilst being cost-effective and acceptable to adults with poorly controlled, severe allergic asthma. Using a rigorous methodological approach and with our primary outcome guided by our Patient Public Involvement members, we hope that we will be able to answer an important research question whilst keeping outcomes relevant to patients, clinicians, policy makers and commissioners.</p><p>In designing The LASER Trial, we have attempted to maintain a pragmatic approach to ensure as wide as possible external applicability of the results. We have had engagement from our PPI members at all stages of trial development from grant application through to trial design and delivery.</p><p>PPI members highlighted the importance of exacerbation frequency as our primary outcome measure as they are so important to patients with severe asthma, proving a constant threat to their ability to lead a normal life. PPI members guided the decision to collect diary data and peak flow recordings for 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to each follow up visit rather than throughout the 12-month treatment period in an attempt to reduce the burden on trial participants.</p><p>PPI members have also been integral in the design of the trial paperwork (participant information sheet, consent forms and diaries) and trial website.
