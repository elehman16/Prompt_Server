Patients can self-refer or be signposted by practice staff. We prospectively compared individuals accessing co-located advice at eight GP sites with a propensity score weighted comparison group. Individuals were recruited over 8 months and followed up for 3 months.

In line with recommendations from prior reviews of research with &#x02018;hard to reach&#x02019; groups,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> individuals were offered &#x000a3;15 supermarket vouchers per survey.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Comparison group</title><p id="P15">We identified individuals aged 18+ years from which to generate a propensity score weighted comparison group.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The propensity score estimates the probability that a given individual would receive co-located advice, summarising a range of variables associated with receiving advice into a single probability value.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Weighting reduces confounding from selection bias by assigning more weight to controls whose propensity scores are closer to those of advice recipients.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p id="P16">We contacted potentially eligible comparator participants in three ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, online supplement DS1). In each, no identifiable data were disclosed to researchers before individuals provided informed consent. First, individuals of similar age group, ethnicity and gender to those accessing local co-located advice services in the past 12 months (assessed using Citizens Advice data) were identified from practice lists of nine local general practices. These practices did not host advice services but were in areas with similar levels of social disadvantage.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Based on an anticipated response rate of 10%, 5419 patients over all practices were identified and posted recruitment packs on behalf of their practice. Packs included information sheets, consent forms, baseline surveys and two return envelopes for consent forms and surveys (addressed to different locations). We expected that responders to these contact attempts may differ to advice recipients. Therefore, we worked with a local housing association to contact 490 tenants comparable with advice recipients in terms of age group, gender and ethnicity. Finally, as Black African and Caribbean individuals were underrepresented in GP-based returns, and to achieve the required sample size, we worked with community organisations to advertise the study.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Advice and comparison group sample flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="390f1"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Data collection</title><p id="P17">Surveys were self-report, taking approximately 15 min to complete.

After survey refinement, baseline data were collected from advice recipients at general practices prior to their advice session and from controls by post. We collected follow-up data from both groups by post 3 months later. This follow-up period was chosen first, to increase confidence in a direct association between advice receipt and changes in mental health, particularly in a multiply disadvantaged population in which other factors could influence outcomes and override the benefits of advice.

Nearly all reported a preference to see a GP-located adviser. Open-ended responses indicated that this was because the service was easier to access (for example because of mobility problems or travel anxiety), nearer home or more convenient (129, 64.8%); or, because it was a more familiar or less anxiety-provoking environment (42, 21.1%). If the service had not been available almost half of recipients would either not have sought advice at all, or would have spoken to their GP/other practice staff. Two-fifths of recipients had already spoken to their GP about their advice issue. Of these, over half said this was because it was affecting their mental health or was otherwise health related.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S26"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P42">To our knowledge, this is the first controlled prospective summative evaluation of co-located welfare advice services in healthcare settings. The provision of co-located advice led to significant improvements in mental health and well-being. Specifically, CMD caseness reduced among women and Black/Black British advice group recipients; and, those with a positive advice outcome also reported improvements in well-being. The strongest evidence was for a significantly greater reduction in perceived financial strain among the advice group compared with controls. This was reflected in an average financial gain of &#x000a3;2689 per capita among recipients. Compared with controls, advice recipients also reported enhanced coping strategies for dealing with financial strains; however, they were also more likely to report not knowing where to go to for support with financial strain or the health impact of such strains over time. No differences in self-reported consultation frequency were found.</p><sec id="S27"><title>Explanations for the findings and comparison with literature</title><sec id="S28"><title>Mental health and well-being</title><p id="P43">Our hypothesis that improvements in mental health and well-being linked to advice receipt would be mediated by reductions in perceived financial strain was partially borne out. Thus, financial strain was associated both with poor mental health and receipt of advice; and, where a significant impact of advice on mental health and well-being was found, this was partially accounted for by adjustments for financial strain. The hypothesis was not supported among Black individuals. This suggests there may be other underlying mechanisms between receipt of advice and improved symptoms of CMD in this group or that financial strain insufficiently captured any reductions in stress. A generalised measure of perceived stress may be a more useful gauge of the impact of advice and may also capture improvements linked to other non-directly financial outcomes (for example, housing circumstances). Improvements in mental health may also arise from other psychosocial factors such as perceived social support and/or from material changes in circumstances.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p id="P44">Reduction in indebtedness may also underlie changes in mental health and well-being. We found a significant reduction in reported use of a credit card or overdraft if income did not cover costs among advice recipients, relative to the control group. This may be linked to debt management outcomes of advice and/or to budgeting information provided. This is important since use of credit cards and unauthorised overdrafts incur high interest rates, further increasing the likelihood of indebtedness, which is prospectively associated with poor mental health.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Consultation frequency</title><p id="P45">It is possible that a reduction in appointments was not found because of the short follow-up period and/or recall bias, although validity of self-reported healthcare use has been reported as fair.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Previous research using routinely collected medical record data found small reductions in GP consultation frequency and antidepressant prescription 6 months before and after receipt of co-located welfare advice.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> However, this research was small and uncontrolled, precluding causal inference.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Financial support-seeking</title><p id="P46">In contrast to the advice group, controls were more likely to talk to their GP about the impact on health or functioning of financial strain, and less likely to seek advice from the welfare agencies if unable to meet payments. Further, there was an increase among advice recipients of not knowing where to seek help. Since many recipients had been directed to the co-located service from high street Citizens Advice, these findings could be related to concurrent closures of such local services.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Impact on GP non-health workload</title><p id="P47">Our findings are in line with two recent UK GP surveys,<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> in which GPs reported patient health, GP workload and practice staff time demands had been adversely affected by greater patient financial hardship and welfare provision changes. Our results suggest that reductions in financial strain could reduce practice burden and that co-location in health settings can target individuals less able to self-manage. This was evidenced by the proportion of advice recipients who would talk, or had already spoken, to their GP about their advice issue; by a preference to access advice at their general practice; and, by the proportion reporting that they would have gone to their GP, or would have not have sought advice, had the service not been there.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="P48">A major strength of our research was the robust comparator group, allowing us to infer causality. Second, unlike previous research<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> our study was sufficiently powered to detect significant differences over time. Third, we achieved similar or higher follow-up rates than have previously been reported.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Fourth, we demonstrated that changes in perceived financial strain may be one, although not the only, underlying pathway linking advice to mental health. Fifth, by collecting data on health outcomes, service use and financial benefits accrued, we could provide data of direct value to commissioners.</p><p id="P49">This was a multisite study that increases the external validity of our results. However, all the sites examined were in London and served areas with high levels of multiple social disadvantage. Although these services are likely to be similar to other inner metropolitan areas, other urban and rural populations have differing sociodemographic population profiles and welfare needs. Nonetheless, co-located services provided in less urban UK locations also report that welfare benefits and debt are the main presenting issues and the income gain per capita is in line with other services.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> This supports the generalisability of our findings but further empirical testing is required.</p><p id="P50">Self-reported consultations data may be less accurate than those extracted from practice records. Capacity to extract such data was limited as appointments were not routinely recorded. Reduced accuracy (underreporting) has been linked to older age, longer time frame of recall, more frequent service utilisation and use linked to stigmatised issues.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Although participants in both groups reported frequent GP consultations, the short recall time frame would have minimised inaccuracies. Further, as analyses compared change between the two groups (rather than absolute numbers), we have no reason to believe that the accuracy of self-report would have differed systematically over time. However, given the importance of this outcome to commissioners, future work should assess any change in service use over longer periods using objective measures.</p><p id="P51">As a quasi-experimental study, residual bias may arise if unmeasured variables exerted different influences on change over time in either group. However, we consider this risk to be small given the short follow-up and that the direction of change in the primary outcome was the same in both groups.</p><p id="P52">A potential disadvantage of the 3-month follow-up period is underreporting of the benefits of welfare advice. Data extracted from the Citizens Advice IT platform demonstrated that some individuals receive several episodes of advice over a longer period. We may therefore have collected outcome data for individuals in whom issues of concern are not fully resolved or for whom benefits may accumulate over time. Further, any impact of reduced financial strain on mental health and well-being may take longer to fully emerge and/or be muted among those chronically exposed to such stressors.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Finally, our approach to assessing return on investment may underestimate the value of co-located welfare advice since analyses excluded non-monetised benefits, such as from mental health or housing improvements.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Implications</title><p id="P53">Co-located welfare advice can reach people who would not otherwise have sought advice or may otherwise turn to their GP for support. Advice recipients may experience improvements to short-term mental health, reduced financial strain and receive considerable financial returns. Although this study focuses on primary care, provision of advice services may benefit secondary mental healthcare service users at risk of underclaiming entitled welfare benefits, financial, housing and employment instability and poor financial capability.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Pathways for the impact on reduced NHS and social care costs for this group have been hypothesised but not yet empirically tested.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Further research on the impact of advice in different health settings and within new models of care that include aims to address wider determinants of health and health inequalities (such as multi-speciality community providers and primary and acute care models), using objective measures of service use is needed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p><p>None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>This research was funded by <funding-source>Haringey Council</funding-source> and the <funding-source>School for Public Health Research</funding-source>.
