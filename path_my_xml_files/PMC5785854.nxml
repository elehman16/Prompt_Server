However, this test is rarely performed routinely in clinical practice because of various practical issues, e.g. the lack of a standardized matrix preparation. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a convenient DBPCFC matrix, that can easily be implemented in daily clinical practice. The focus of this study was the blinding of hazelnuts, whereby the hazelnuts retained as much as possible their allergenicity and could be mixed homogenously in low-doses to the matrices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">A basophil-activation test (BAT), microbial tests and an LC-MS/MS test were performed to assess respectively the allergenicity of the used hazelnuts, the microbial stability of the novel developed matrices and the homogeneity of the hazelnuts in the matrices. A sensory test was conducted to validate the blinding of the hazelnuts in the matrices. A pilot DBPCFC study included eight patients as proof of concept.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">The BAT-test gave the first insights concerning the retained allergenicity of the hazelnuts.

This is however not common practice in the daily clinical setting due to several limitations, such as the lack of standardized preparation of the matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One of the limiting factors of the DBPCFC is that the clinical staff must be able to prepare the matrices by themselves, so too labor-intensive preparations (e.g. baking, etc.) are not likely to be used in the routine.</p><p id="Par13">However, from the clinical perspective, this test is useful to e.g. exclude/confirm a possible food allergy when other in vivo<italic>/</italic>in vitro tests are producing contradictory or inconclusive results, evaluate if patients have outgrown their allergy and to assess the severity of their reactions. For scientific reasons, it can be used to estimate the global prevalence of relevant food allergies, to assess the predictive value of other diagnostic methods and to determine specific threshold levels. However, proper validation of these matrices has only been performed in limited studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Further, low allergen dose matrices are needed to determine e.g. the minimum eliciting doses (MED&#x02019;s) of the patients and to include safely severe allergic patients in this test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As reported in 2014 by the Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling 2.0 (VITAL) initiative, the MED in 1% of the hazelnut allergic population (ED<sub>0.1</sub>) is estimated to be 0.1&#x000a0;mg hazelnut proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, limited studies have yet been conducted to develop lower dose vehicles whereby the homogeneity was determined.</p><p id="Par14">For hazelnuts, as far as we know, only a low-level matrix was developed using defatted hazelnuts (starting with 3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g hazelnut proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, defatting removes oil-body associated allergens which can also provoke severe allergic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The high-fat content of hazelnuts (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;61%&#x000a0;w/w) however makes homogenization and hence masking of the non-defatted nuts difficult.</p><p id="Par15">This project focused on the development and validation of a novel, easy-to-use DBPCFC matrix for raw hazelnuts at low-level, which can be used in a standardized way in daily clinical practice and by multiple centers to allow comparison of test results. This study reports to our knowledge, the first validated matrix containing low doses of raw, non-defatted hazelnuts and no other major allergenic ingredients listed in the Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of the DBPCFC matrices</title><p id="Par16">We developed a powder mix that results in a cold chocolate dessert after the addition of water.

Of the consumer&#x02019;s panel, 30% (whereof 26% guessed) and 35% (whereof 30% guessed) detected hazelnut in the verum and placebo samples respectively, so no significant difference was shown (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.263). Also for smell and taste, no difference was seen (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.581 and 0.154).

During the pilot study, patients 1, 3 and 5 experienced very mild and subjective allergic symptoms at the highest hazelnut dose.

Patients 8 and 9 experienced no allergic reaction during the test. When results were negative (patients 8 and 9) or questionable (patients 1, 3 and 5), open provocation tests were done which were all positive. However, these reactions were very mild (for patients 3 and 5 e.g. only a mild tingling on the lips or a raw feeling in the throat was experienced after consuming 5 raw hazelnuts).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>DBPCFC results of the eight patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="4">Results challenge</th></tr><tr><th align="left">Patient no.</th><th align="left">Dose</th><th align="left">Signs and symptoms<sup>a</sup></th><th align="left">Test outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">Verum 3&#x02013;9</td><td align="left">Very mild tingling on the lips</td><td align="left">+/&#x02212;; Only mild OAS symptoms; open provocation test needed</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Placebo 1&#x02013;9</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td><td align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Open provocation: &#x000bd; hazelnut</td><td align="left">Mild tingling on tongue and lips</td><td align="left">+/&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">Verum 4&#x02013;5</td><td align="left">Tingling of the lips, Pruritus<break/>Mild urticaria/angioedema of the lips (11&#x000a0;min after verum 4)</td><td align="left">+; Test is stopped after dose 5 because of inconvenient allergic complaints</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Placebo 1&#x02013;9</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td><td align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">Verum 9</td><td align="left">Very mild tingling on the lips</td><td align="left">+/&#x02212;; Only mild OAS symptoms; Open provocation test needed</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Placebo 1&#x02013;9</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td><td align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Open provocation: 5 hazelnuts</td><td align="left">Raw feeling in the throat</td><td align="left">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">Verum 2&#x02013;7<break/>Verum 8&#x02013;9</td><td align="left">Pruritus, urticaria lesion in the neck<break/>Sneezing, itchy nose</td><td align="left">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Placebo 1&#x02013;9</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td><td align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">Verum 9</td><td align="left">Very mild tingling of the lips</td><td align="left">+/&#x02212;; Only mild OAS symptoms; Open provocation test needed</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Placebo 1&#x02013;9</td><td align="left">&#x02013;</td><td align="left">&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left">Open provocation: 5 hazelnuts</td><td align="left">Raw feeling in the throat</td><td align="left">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">Verum 1&#x02013;9</td><td align="left">Very mild tingling of the lips</td><td align="left">Verum and placebo challenges gave both mild OAS symptoms.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par29">The main purpose of this work was the development of a DBPCFC matrix for hazelnuts which had to fulfill several criteria like the sufficient masking of the hazelnuts and maintaining as much as possible the allergenicity. Further, easy logistics and preparation, long stability and sufficient palatability of the matrices are required. To include as much as possible different food allergic patients in this test, no other major allergenic food allergens listed in the Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 were used as ingredients during the recipe development of these matrices.</p><p id="Par30">In this work, blanched hazelnuts (protein content: 14.5% w/w) were used because the dark testa is difficult to mask, both visually and in taste. For this reason, these were also used in other DBPCFC studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The nuts were kept at 100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 8&#x000a0;min to remove this testa. Reduced allergenicity of the heat-labile hazelnut Cor a 1 and 2 allergens was only noticed at &#x0003e;&#x000a0;140&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but not much is known concerning the impact of blanching hazelnuts. Minor or no differences in allergenicity were seen in other blanched tree nuts, however [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For the three patients tested, basophil activation was shown, even for the least sensitive patient, presuming a retained allergenic potential of the blanched hazelnuts. However, further research should examine the significant impact of blanching on the hazelnut allergenicity.</p><p id="Par31">To limit the potential impact of further processing on the hazelnut allergenicity, a cold matrix preparation was chosen. The fat content of the verum and placebo matrices were kept at &#x0003c;&#x000a0;25% of the total energy (resp. 13 and 19% of the total energy) so delayed absorption due to a high-fat content will be minimized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The rolled hazelnuts could be mixed in the powder without leaving visible particulates.</p><p id="Par32">The stability of the preparations was assessed by determining the a<sub>w</sub>-values and the microbial contamination. The a<sub>w</sub>-value can predict the growth of bacteria, yeast, and molds over time. For the hazelnuts and powder mix, these were low enough to inhibit bacterial and mold growth (resp. a<sub>w</sub>&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;0.91 and 0.8). In addition, no relevant microbial spoilage was observed by organisms typically associated with confectionery-related food products with low water activity, like hazelnuts, after 1&#x000a0;year of storage at room temperature (20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), so an easy logistics of both the powder mixes and rolled hazelnuts can be guaranteed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Instead of the most frequently applied triangle test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which focuses on differences between matrices whatever the attribution of difference is, the sensory test performed in this study was specifically adapted for its purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which was comparable with earlier performed sensory tests for DBPCFC matrix validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], whereby one placebo and verum sample were offered. In this test, the samples were offered sequentially instead of simultaneously, as done in the study of Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Mancebo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. When small differences are not linked to the presence of the allergenic ingredient, the samples can be offered sequentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This represents how a DBPCFC is carried out in clinical practice, whereby the matrices will be given on separate days. We can conclude that considering the followed procedure and the results obtained, the hazelnuts were successfully blinded in our developed matrices. Consequently, the newly developed DBPCFC matrices will minimize the psychological placebo-effects for the patients and the healthcare professionals.</p><p id="Par34">As a proof of concept, DBPCFC&#x02019;s with eight patients were conducted in the clinical setting. The dosage schedule was a combination of semi-logarithmic and logarithmic increases, as performed in an earlier DBPCFC study in 2012 for hazelnuts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], whereby similar protein portions were administered. This schedule was performed to achieve the top dose with acceptable increments in an acceptable period when starting with low-level protein portions.</p><p id="Par35">The most sensitive patient had already subjective symptoms after the first dose and developed objective signs after the second hazelnut dose (corresponding to 5 and 54&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of hazelnut proteins, respectively). These findings were comparable with those found earlier whereby 30&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of hazelnut proteins was the lowest eliciting dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, other factors, which were not included in this study, like exercise, alcohol consumption, asthma and anxiety might exacerbate the allergic reactions, so follow-up studies are necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Further, the challenges were performed during September&#x02013;November, and pollen-related food allergies can be worse during and just after pollen season (for birch pollen: &#x000b1;&#x000a0;middle of March until the middle of May) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Different explanations could reason the absence of allergic symptoms for the two negative responders, like possible matrix/processing effects, too low doses of hazelnuts and the removing of the testa. Open provocation tests are therefore of utmost importance at the end of the test. However, psychological effects cannot be excluded then. Since patients with anaphylaxis and children were excluded from this DBPCFC study, further research should be conducted including younger and more severe allergic patients. During the challenges of this work, the patients nor health care professionals could discover the verum series. Most of the patients found the deserts easy to consume.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">To conclude, this study reports the production and validation of a novel DBPCFC matrix for raw hazelnuts at low doses, in a format that allows easy logistics and implementation in the common clinical setting.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec12"><title>Additional file</title><p>
