On the other hand, not only depression treatment enhances capacity of affected women for sensitive parenting, but also management of this psychological disorder prevents developmental retardations (MRs) (such as poor language or low IQ), which may occur in the infants of the depressed parents. Management of this dilemma requires continuous and efficient care; nevertheless, neither primary care nor tailored treatment is applied for depressed individuals.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Treatments of depressive symptoms are based on pharmaceutical and/or psychological approaches while psychotherapy efficacy resembles the former approach.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as a novel discovery, which is applied in the scope of psychotherapy has proved its efficacy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Indeed, CBT exerts ameliorations of self-concept, pessimistic view toward the world, and negative thoughts of the future, which are defined as Beck triad of depression.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This therapeutic approach generally pursued face-to-face methods; nevertheless, these procedures failed to promote thorough achievement.

Our protocols were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, and informed consent was obtained from the patients (Project number = 393454).</p><p>Our study was conducted in rural health centers of Isfahan district, Iran. These centers were allocated to three trials, which included (1) control, (2) booklet, and (3) booklet and text messaging. Patient's demographic information, which included age, sex, marital status, and level of the literacy, was recorded by trained paramedics. Our survey outcomes comprised depression intensity and treatment compliance.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>This experiment was conducted on individuals affected by depressive symptoms, who inhabited in rural areas of Isfahan district in Iran. The patients whose ages were over 18 years old and had accessibility to cell phones met our inclusion criteria. Not met criteria consisted of mental retardation (MR), visual disability leading to reading impediments, dementia, suicide attempt history, electrotherapy, and receiving the psychological intervention, as well as drug abuse and alcohol addiction. Our exclusion criteria were a patient disinclination to continue our treatment strategy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sampling and randomization</title><p>Initially, we divided Isfahan district, which was comprised 24 rural health centers, into eight clusters in accordance with their cultural, economic, and social likeness.

Furthermore, suitability of questionnaire reliability was previously documented (sensitivity: 70%, specificity: 38.9%, and Cronbach's &#x003b1; = 0.94).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Interventions</title><p>This clinical trial was based upon two interventions (bibliotherapy and text messaging).

In fact, we concomitantly treated one trial of our patients with text messaging and booklet, whom we requested to study in accordance with the daily text messaging. After these procedures, we ask them to reply Beck II and MARS questionnaires two more times. Obviously, these questionnaires were responded three times: (1) Before the intervention (2) immediately after cessation of our intervention (3) 3 months after the cessation of our intervention.</p><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Content of the booklet</title><p>Our booklet content was based on educational points documented by World Health Organization and other valid websites. These points were previously applied and cited by different articles while the overall context of our booklet was original.

The first chapter of the booklet, represented depression signs and symptoms, and the patient decided to find psychotherapy help to eliminate his depressive symptoms. A psychologist provided the patient with some description regarding psychotherapy and advantages of pharmaceutical treatments. In the second chapter, this psychologist depicted some negative ideas and thoughts (such as anger, contempt, disgust, and guilt) for the patient. In addition, the therapist provided the patient some efficient coping strategies against insomnia. The third chapter concerned appropriate solutions for overcoming the negative thoughts. The patient was also instructed in sleep hygiene. Fourth chapter tried to persuade the patient to find and conduct some suitable hobbies. Moreover, it promoted appropriate strategies, which aimed to overcome the patient's insomnia. The fifth and sixth (last) chapters tried to ameliorate the patient's capacity in problem dealing. Our booklet was not only fictional but also it was illustrated through the pictures to motivate our depressed individuals.</p><p>Importantly, we made further improvements of the booklet contents in accordance with ideas suggested by one psychologist, as well as one psychiatrist and two community medicine specialists. Additionally, a pilot study, which was preceded our study, provided us with patient's notions to ameliorate booklet's size, writing font, and pictures, as well as its vague contents.</p><p>The booklet contents tried to introduce the most current negative thoughts (such as black and white thinking, labeling, minimizing positive thoughts, emotional reasoning, etc.), which could potentially lead to depressive symptoms. The booklet encouraged the patient to check his/her negative thoughts with others and different perspectives. Not only the patients were fortified about the instructive strategies, which aimed at taking an observer role, but also these individuals were coaxed to break habits, which make them feel worse.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Text messages</title><p>Our text messaging contents, which were daily delivered (at 10 o&#x02019;clock am), included either persuading passages, which tried to cajole the patients to study some special pages of the booklet, or aphorism (words of wisdom). Each sort of the text messaging was discretely delivered in odd or pair days. Importantly, we urged two community medicine specialists to review and validate all of the messages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical analyzing</title><p>All analyses performed by using SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

This application showed the insignificant impact of gender distribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of this study showed that the treatment approaches significantly decreased depressive symptom intensity in rural areas. Indeed, in comparison with our control group, depressive symptom intensity of the booklet, and the text messaging trials obviously ameliorated. Accordingly, the above-mentioned instructive interventions, are potent treatments for depression disorder while by comparison with the major city inhabitants, neither psychologists nor mental health services is easily available for the individuals residing in rural areas.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In most parts of the world, patients hardly access for CBT unless they reside in areas being close to the major academic center.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In addition, the majority of the patients, who are living in rural areas, are affected by a strong culture, which hampers face-to-face mental health services. In turn, the rural communities seem to have a propensity for self-reliance and self-managing.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, depressive symptom intensity, in either of the groups, significantly varied in different times. To elaborate, patients treated through bibliotherapy were quickly recuperated and the recovery process was on a continuum during the follow-up (3 months after the intervention). Immediately after the intervention, patients allocated in text messaging group achieved significant recovery; nevertheless, their recuperation process declined after the treatment. Three months after the intervention, our control group achieved obvious recovery when intensity of their depressive symptoms was compared with before the treatment; nevertheless, in comparison with the other groups, decline of depressive symptom intensity was negligible. This recovery might be ascribed to pharmaceutical approaches, which were recommended by primary health care. However, different studies addressed rural poverty as an unsolved problem and political debate in developing countries; therefore, low cost of CBT, especially when it is performed through bibliotherapy, can potentially diminish treatment expenditure.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] For example, Tucker <italic>et al</italic>. postulated that high cost was recognized as a major treatment impediment for nearly over half of the rural area inhabitants. Not surprisingly, CBT-based bibliotherapy could be efficiently applied in rural areas challenging with economic problems.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Neither of our treatment strategies significantly affected treatment compliance. Moreover, treatment adherence changes of each group were insignificant in different times; on the contrary, time-group interaction significantly affected patient compliance. It seems that our CBT method could efficiently impact rural area inhabitants. Indeed, we tried to provide our clienteles with appropriate bibliotherapy being in accordance with the current belief of our patients, which discourage them to apply appropriate medications.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In addition, stigma more significantly impedes current pharmaceutical treatments in rural areas; therefore, our instructive interventions could be practically applied for community health promotion.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>This research and previous ones documented that cognitive dysfunction should be assumed as crucial risk factor contributing toward treatment in compliance and exacerbation of depressive symptoms intensity. Indeed, individuals affected by depressive symptoms commonly challenge cognitive dysfunction, which jeopardizes seeking of treatment recommendations.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Moreover, beliefs concerning medication side effects could negatively affect medical adherence.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Not surprisingly, many researches were undertaken to utilize CBT for depressive symptoms. For example, Baumel demonstrated that CBT obviously resulted in remission of depressive symptoms.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In another study, patients significantly recuperated from depressive symptoms when pharmaceutical approaches were associated with CBT.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] In addition, CBT cost-effectiveness was shown in refractory depressive symptoms, which were resistant to conventional pharmacotherapy.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>Accordingly, our research, as well as the previous ones, demonstrated that CBT mitigated patient's depressive symptoms.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] It seems that this effectiveness could be attributable to indirect and direct impacts of CBT, which were conducted through the promotion of treatment compliance and psychological approaches respectively.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>Our instructive interventions aimed to regulate self-conscious emotion through alterations of thoughts and behaviors stemmed from consciousness and experiences. In fact, these instructions, which were mostly performed through the booklets, encouraged the patients to alter their negative opinions behaviors and self-conscious emotions. &#x0201c;Identification of negative thoughts,&#x0201d; as well as the &#x0201c;changing negative thought patterns and behaviors&#x0201d; were recognized as our proposed mechanisms, which led to the above-mentioned goals. Hence, bibliotherapy can be applied in health promotion system of different communities when it train people to harness frequencies, intensities, and durations of their negative moods.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p><p>The results of this study showed indirect instructions, which was conducted in our interventional groups, decreased depressive symptom intensity. Our text messaging group and the booklet one, however, did not differ significantly in depressive symptom intensity. Furthermore, depressive symptom intensity of text messaging trial that was sought in following up period was not ameliorated. On the contrary, patients of the booklet trial, which did not receive text messages showed significant amelioration in the following period. It seems that CBT instructed through booklet had the most pivotal and persistent role in the reduction of depressive symptom intensity. These findings were in accordance with some of the previous studies, which well documented that bibliotherapy persistently diminished depressive symptom intensity. For example, Songprakun and McCann achieved persistent treatment gains while their CBT approach based upon bibliotherapy. They postulated that this kind of interventional method was convenient and could be easily applied by their patients at any time.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</p><p>Though many researchers documented positive impacts of text messages in different mental and health related issues (such as smoking, alcohol abuse, depression medical incompliance, aggressive behaviors, and diabetes self-managements), some bodies of literature proved that the efficacy of this kind of intervention was evanescent. For instance, Agyapong <italic>et al</italic>. postulated that positive outcomes of text messaging, which aimed at CBT of patients affected by depressive symptoms, were not sustainable beyond the intervention.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</p><p>The results of our study were in accordance with the above-mentioned articles when the supportive impact of text messaging could not be found beyond the CBT intervention. It seems that the subjects allocated to text messaging group were contingent upon text message; hence, in comparison with the other subjects, they had less concentration and dependency on booklet while text message was being discontinued. However, further investigations are indispensable to elaborate definite causes of unsustainable impacts of text messaging.[<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Limitations</title><p>We could not evaluate text messaging impacts during the following period due to the cessation of the text messages. Gender distribution was unequal while male's frequency was rare; thus, data analysis of gender subgroups was impractical; besides, the results could not be generalized to males.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>CBT, which is a nonpharmaceutical approach, should be noticed as well as the other conventional treatments. It seems that the above-mentioned procedure could be utilized as a complementary methodology aiming treatment of depressive symptoms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was funded by research chancellor of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) as a dissertation project (no = 393454).
