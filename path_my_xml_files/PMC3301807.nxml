E-selectin is expressed by activated endothelial cells and interacts with circulating neutrophiles. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine, produced by various cell tvpes. Both markers are elevated in the blood of patients with septic shock; E-selectin possibly plays a role in permeability alterations and organ damage, IL-6 is a predictor of outcome and severity. Stress-dose hydrocortisone improves the clinical situation of patients in septic shock. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies could show that corticosteroids inhibit the endothelial expression of adhesion molecules including E-selectin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>As a part of a double blind controlled cross-over study with stress dose hydrocortisone (10 mg/h) E-selectin and IL-6 levels were monitored for six days in 20 patients with septic shock. For the first 3 days patients received either hydrocortisone or placebo as a continuous intravenous infusion, for the next 3 days medication was switched. Blood was taken before starting and then once every day. Both IL-6 and E-selectin were measured by an ELISA technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found a decrease in IL-6 and E-selectin levels under application of hydrocortisone compared to the placebo group as 2 well as to the primary values. After switching to placebo, values increased again.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We could show that stress-dose hydrocortisone given to patients in septic shock markedly decreases soluble E-selectin and IL-6 levels. In addition to the hemodynamic effects of this therapy, there also seems to be an immunmodulating and anti-inflammatory effect, which might be organ protective.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figures 1-2.</label><caption><p>IL6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and E-selectin levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">2</xref>) in septic shock patients, who received hydrocortisone therapy (see text).
