Importantly, the difference between the two treatments was both statistically significant and clinically relevant and, moreover, achieved with less laxative use with OXN PR (20% less). In fact, there was already a statistically significant benefit in BFI score for OXN PR, compared with OxyPR, after 1 week. Overall, achieving this improvement in BFI with reduced laxative use in the OXN PR group, in such a short time frame, is encouraging, considering the severity of underlying disease and the negative impact of constipation on the lives of cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311418869">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311418869">10</xref></sup> Primary efficacy findings were underlined by significant differences in PAC-SYM domain scores in favour of OXN PR.</p><p>With respect to the co-primary endpoint of pain relief, OXN PR was non-inferior to OxyPR, as measured by BPI-SF. Rescue analgesic use was low and comparable between groups throughout the double-blind phase, showing that patients were effectively titrated to a stable dose of study medication, and that comparable analgesic efficacy of OXN PR and OxyPR was not influenced by differential use of rescue analgesic medication.</p><p>General QoL results using EQ-5D and EORTC QLQ-C30 were similar for OXN PR and OxyPR treatments over time. However, results of the specific EORTC QLQ-C30 constipation subscore indicated that OXN PR patients had a superior outcome, compared with OxyPR patients. This could contribute towards an improved quality of life for many patients with chronic cancer pain treated with OXN PR.</p><p>There were slightly more dropouts due to AEs in the OXN PR group, although the overall incidence of AEs was comparable between treatment groups. Most frequently reported ADRs were consistent with the known safety profile of the opioid analgesic class of drugs, and with those seen in previous Phase III trials of OXN PR in patients with non-cancer pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311418869">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311418869">27</xref></sup> There were slightly more total GI disorders observed in the OXN PR group; however, the incidence of the most frequent AEs such as abdominal pain, worsened constipation, diarrhoea and vomiting were comparable, whilst nausea was reported less commonly in the OXN PR group. Therefore, the slightly higher number of total GI disorders in the OXN PR group is explained by the sum of less frequent AEs. It is possible that GI-related AEs indicate return of more active bowel function (as is aimed for when treating constipated patients), which has also been documented after use of other peripherally acting opioid antagonists, such as methylnaltrexone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216311418869">46</xref></sup> In a study comparing methylnaltrexone with placebo, in patients receiving the active drug, abdominal pain also occurred more frequently. In addition, more flatulence and nausea were reported for methylnaltrexone;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216311418869">46</xref></sup> this was not seen with OXN PR in the study described here. There were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory values or vital signs related to study medication. Mean modified SOWS values were low and comparable in both groups. In summary, the results suggest that switching from other opioids to oxycodone &#x02013; as either OXN PR or OxyPR &#x02013; was generally safe and well tolerated by patients in this trial, with switching to OXN PR giving the added benefit of reduced OIC complications.</p><p>The findings of this study should be interpreted within the context of the trial design and patient population. The double-blind phase had a duration of 4 weeks to allow for assessment of analgesic effect, consistent with European Medicines Agency guidelines on clinical studies of chronic moderate/severe cancer pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269216311418869">47</xref></sup> This timeframe is also deemed adequate for observing differences in constipation based on previous Phase II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269216311418869">48</xref></sup> and Phase III data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311418869">27</xref></sup></p><p>Although the demographic profile of both treatment groups was generally similar there was a slightly higher percentage of patients aged&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;65 years in the OXN PR group than in the OxyPR treatment group. However, this difference is not clinically relevant, as results from previous clinical studies have demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of OXN PR in older patients is similar to that in younger patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269216311418869">49</xref></sup> Additional assessments showed that there was no correlation between BFI score at study end (LOCF) and age (data not shown).</p><p>Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is common and adds to the burden of living with chronic pain. Current oral and rectal laxatives are often ineffective and do not have a good evidence base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311418869">15</xref></sup> The new targeted approach of administering peripherally acting opioid antagonists is effective and is supported by extensive clinical trial data. Previous attempts to use immediate-release naloxone were unsuccessful because of reversal of analgesia; and the only other licensed peripherally acting opioid antagonist, methylnaltrexone, has to be given by injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311418869">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216311418869">46</xref></sup> The present trial has shown that oral OXN PR tablets are well tolerated and can effectively and conveniently provide targeted treatment of OIC at a dose range which includes a substantial proportion of patients with cancer pain.</p></sec><sec id="section17-0269216311418869"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study of patients with OIC and moderate/severe cancer pain, patients who were switched directly from other opioids to OXN PR experienced a similar analgesic effect as well as a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in bowel function, compared with those switched to OxyPR. Overall, these data are in line with results of previous Phase III trials demonstrating analgesic efficacy and tolerability of OXN PR, suggesting that the combination of oxycodone and naloxone is suitable across the spectrum of patients with cancer and non-cancer pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the investigators from all 64 study sites in Australia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Netherlands, Poland and UK for taking part in this study.
