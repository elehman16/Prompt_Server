Even though metformin was effective in the short-term over 16 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), it remained unknown whether this effect was durable until the results of the TODAY (Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) trial showed &#x0003e;50% failure rates on metformin over an average follow-up of 3.86 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). TODAY was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial that compared metformin monotherapy (M) with metformin plus rosiglitazone (M+R) or metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention (M+L) on time to treatment failure, i.e., loss of glycemic control defined as either HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8% over a 6-month period or inability to wean from temporary insulin therapy within 3 months of acute metabolic decompensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The results revealed that the combination of M+R was superior to M in sustaining durable glycemic control, and M+L was intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Similar to adults, the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in youth involves peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance, together with impaired &#x003b2;-cell function, which progressively worsens over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The deterioration in &#x003b2;-cell function in youth appears to be accelerated compared with that observed in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Cross-sectional observations, including the TODAY study, show an inverse relationship between HbA<sub>1c</sub> and &#x003b2;-cell function but not insulin sensitivity, suggesting that residual &#x003b2;-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity is a determinant of glycemic control in youth with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Based on the TODAY outcome of better glycemic durability with M+R, we hypothesized that the combination of M+R was superior in improving &#x003b2;-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity compared with M or M+L. We describe the temporal changes in measures of &#x003b2;-cell function and insulin sensitivity derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) over a 4-year period among the three treatments of TODAY.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>Detailed description of the TODAY protocol and the primary outcome results have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In brief, the TODAY trial consisted of a screening phase and a run-in phase followed by the randomized clinical trial. After initial screening, eligible participants entered a 2&#x02013;6-month run-in period with goals of weaning from nonstudy diabetes medications, tolerating metformin up to a dose of 1,000 mg twice daily but no less than 1,000 mg/day, attaining HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;8.0% for at least 2 months on metformin alone, and demonstrating adherence to study medications and visit attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). After the run-in phase, 699 overweight youths, 10&#x02013;17 years of age, with a mean duration of diagnosed type 2 diabetes of 7.8 months, were randomly assigned to receive M, M+R, or M+L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). HbA<sub>1c</sub> was obtained at screening, randomization, and every study visit thereafter. OGTTs were performed after a 10&#x02013;14-h overnight fast, at randomization, and at 6 and 24 months and annually thereafter, and blood samples were analyzed for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. This report uses temporal data related to measures of insulin sensitivity, secretion, and glycemic control from the randomized participants.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Assays and calculations</title><p>All assays were performed at the TODAY central laboratory (Northwest Lipid Research Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). HbA<sub>1c</sub> (high-performance liquid chromatography), C-peptide (two-site immunoenzymatic assay), and insulin (double-antibody radioimmunoassay) were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Insulin sensitivity was calculated as 1/fasting insulin (1/I<sub>F</sub>), which correlates strongly with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp&#x02013;derived in vivo insulin sensitivity in obese youth with or without type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). During the OGTT, the insulinogenic index (&#x025b3;I<sub>30</sub>/&#x025b3;G<sub>30</sub>) and C-peptide index (&#x025b3;C<sub>30</sub>/&#x025b3;G<sub>30</sub>) were calculated as the ratio of the incremental insulin, C-peptide, and glucose responses over the first 30 min of the test, as reported for the TODAY baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These indices reflect similar trends in first-phase insulin from the hyperglycemic clamp in obese youth across the glucose tolerance spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The oral disposition index (oDI), a measure of &#x003b2;-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, was calculated as the product of insulin sensitivity multiplied by the insulinogenic index (1/I<sub>F</sub> &#x000d7; &#x025b3;I<sub>30</sub>/&#x025b3;G<sub>30</sub> and 1/I<sub>F</sub> &#x000d7; &#x025b3;C<sub>30</sub>/&#x025b3;G<sub>30</sub>). In obese youth, the oDI correlates strongly with clamp-derived DI, identifies comparable decrements in &#x003b2;-cell function across the glucose tolerance groups (as does the clamp DI), and has analogous predictive power to that of clamp DI for the 2-h glucose concentration of the OGTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). We used the C-peptide index of insulin secretion (&#x025b3;C<sub>30</sub>/&#x025b3;G<sub>30</sub>) in addition to the insulinogenic index (&#x025b3;I<sub>30</sub>/&#x025b3;G<sub>30</sub>), since some participants had received insulin prior to screening/enrollment in TODAY, which could have potentially resulted in circulating insulin antibodies interfering with the insulin assay. In addition, differences in insulin clearance in different racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) could confound the insulinogenic index data. Metabolic assessments performed after participants reached the primary end point of treatment failure are not reported because accurate assessment of &#x003b2;-cell function is hindered by the impact of exogenous insulin therapy on the parameters of insulin secretion. Thus, treatment group differences in the above measures over time may be influenced by the successive removal of subjects reaching treatment failure. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the potential impact of bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Of the 2,043 insulinogenic index values obtained through the 4-year visits, 75 (3.67%) were &#x02264;0, and for the C-peptide&#x02013;based index, 74 (3.61%) were &#x02264;0. Although mathematically possible, such values were judged biologically implausible and were treated as missing values, similar to approaches used in adult type 2 diabetes trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These improbable responses were observed in 64 subjects (average of 1.13 per such subject), of whom 18 had a response &#x02264;0 at baseline, necessitating their exclusion from the longitudinal analyses. There were a total of 74 missing oDI values due to the combination of 72 missing insulin sensitivity values and insulinogenic index &#x02264;0.</p><p>Kruskal-Wallis or <italic>F</italic> tests were used to compare baseline variables among the treatment groups for continuous variables, and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for categorical variables. Longitudinal linear models were used to estimate mean levels of the parameters over time within groups over the follow-up period using all available data. Analyses of the reciprocal of fasting insulin, insulinogenic index, and oDI used the natural log transformation to better approximate a normal distribution. Mean change from baseline to 6 months, describing the acute effects of therapy on the outcomes, and the average rate of change from 6 months to 48 months were estimated from linear contrast of the model-estimated means over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Data in the figures are presented as baseline adjusted geometric means &#x000b1; SE asymmetric limits (obtained as exp[mean &#x000b1; SE of the log values]).

Thus, therapeutic approaches that directly improve or preserve &#x003b2;-cell function or those that improve insulin resistance and consequently lessen the burden on the &#x003b2;-cell are desirable. Limited longitudinal data in youth using clamp methodology show that there is a relatively rapid deterioration of &#x003b2;-cell function over time with no significant change in peripheral or hepatic insulin sensitivity in the absence of weight or BMI change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). After a median duration of 20 months of diagnosed diabetes, youth with type 2 diabetes lost on average 20% per year of their first-phase insulin or C-peptide secretion measured with the hyperglycemic clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These data are consistent with the TODAY data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), which show 20&#x02013;35% decline in &#x003b2;-cell function per year, depending on treatment group. These data in youth and adolescents contrast with adult data showing a lower rate of decline in &#x003b2;-cell function. The ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) study of drug-naive adults with type 2 diabetes showed that the insulinogenic index declined at a rate of &#x0223c;7&#x02013;11% per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, the estimated rate of decline of &#x003b2;-cell function, using the homeostasis model assessment %B index, was &#x0223c;7% per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The TODAY study allowed the prospective evaluation of changes in glucose metabolism over 4 years in patients randomized to M, M+R, or M+L. In the first 6 months, M+R improved insulin sensitivity by &#x0223c;20%. Even though this change was statistically significant, it is uncertain if it was clinically meaningful, especially bearing in mind the severity of insulin resistance in youth with type 2 diabetes (50% lower in vivo insulin sensitivity compared with age-, BMI-, and adiposity-matched nondiabetic controls) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This acute improvement in insulin sensitivity in the M+R group may have translated to lowering the short-term secretory burden on the &#x003b2;-cells. Whereas the insulinogenic index did not differ among the three treatment groups, either in the short- or long-term, the &#x003b2;-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity remained relatively stable in the M+R group but deteriorated (&#x0223c;25%) in the M and M+L groups in the short-term (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). After the first 6 months, there were no significant group differences in the decline in oDI; all showed continued deterioration. Similar to our data, results from the adult ADOPT study showed that, during the first 6 months, insulin sensitivity increased more in the rosiglitazone group than the metformin group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, contrary to our findings, the ADOPT study showed a continued increase in insulin sensitivity in both groups after the first 6 months, whereas in TODAY, there was continued and comparable deterioration in insulin sensitivity in all three groups. The mean percent change in insulin sensitivity with metformin monotherapy in TODAY was remarkably lower (&#x02212;4.93% [95% CI &#x02212;12.3 to 3.1]) than that in ADOPT (&#x0223c;13%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This could be indicative of a more severe impairment in peripheral insulin sensitivity in youth with type 2 diabetes that may not be adequately managed with the hepatic insulin sensitizer metformin, but may require more potent peripheral insulin sensitizers.</p><p>In the TODAY cohort, M+R provided superior durability of glycemic control compared with M, with significantly lower treatment failure rates (38.6 vs. 51.7%), whereas M+L was intermediate (46.6%) and not significantly different from either of the other two groups. These treatment failure rates are in stark contrast to adult studies showing lower failure rates; 21% with metformin monotherapy and 15% with rosiglitazone monotherapy at 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). These higher failure rates in youth despite combination therapy (M+R) in TODAY are suggestive of a more severe disease process in youth.</p><p>Irrespective of treatment group assignment, those who ultimately failed to maintain glycemic control were metabolically in a more advanced disease state at baseline, characterized by higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting glucose levels, lower insulinogenic index, and &#x0223c;50% lower &#x003b2;-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, with no difference in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Moreover, logistic regression analyses revealed that both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and oDI were significant independent baseline predictors of glycemic failure. For every 0.5% increase in HbA<sub>1c</sub> at the time of randomization, the OR for failure increased to 1.83, and for every doubling of oDI, the OR decreased to 0.84. Analyses of longitudinal data between those who failed to maintain glycemic control and those who did not fail demonstrated a lack of beneficial effects of treatment among those who failed. Whereas the pattern of insulin sensitivity over time was similar between those who failed and those who did not fail, insulinogenic index deteriorated rapidly and relentlessly in those who failed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), with a similar pattern of progressive deterioration in oDI over time in those who failed (&#x0223c;27% by 6 months, &#x0223c;56% by 24 months, and &#x0223c;67% by 36 months). Thus, when &#x003b2;-cell impairment is far advanced, as was the case in those who failed to maintain glycemic control, none of the three treatments proved effective in maintaining glycemic durability.</p><p>Studies of youth with type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between HbA<sub>1c</sub> and &#x003b2;-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In the TODAY study, at screening and randomization, insulin secretion indices declined with increasing HbA<sub>1c</sub> quartiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This inverse relationship between HbA<sub>1c</sub> and &#x003b2;-cell function may either reflect the impact of deficient insulin secretion on the outcome of glycemic control or could be viewed as a glucotoxic phenomenon impairing &#x003b2;-cell function. In the current study, the group that failed to maintain glycemic control already had significantly impaired oDI at randomization compared with the group that did not fail, and did not show beneficial effects of treatment. This observation, combined with our findings that both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and oDI are predictors of glycemic failure, would suggest that treatment before significant &#x003b2;-cell impairment and deterioration in glycemic control occur may be prudent in achieving better therapeutic success in youth with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Since it was not feasible to institute clamp experiments across the many participating clinics in TODAY, we used surrogate estimates of insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function derived from the OGTT. These surrogate estimates correlate strongly with clamp-measured parameters in youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). A potential limitation of TODAY is that in 3.6% of the tests, the value for the insulinogenic index was &#x02264;0. This is in complete agreement with previous adult trials of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and is reported in individuals with normal and impaired glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Because of the high failure rates, statistical analysis was not possible past the 36-month visit in the cohort that failed since the number of subjects became very limited (15 subjects at 48 months). Lastly, despite the favorable therapeutic outcome of M+R in TODAY, a limitation is the use of rosiglitazone. However, TODAY was designed and initiated prior to the discovery of the adverse effects of rosiglitazone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>In summary, changes in insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity in the first 6 months of treatment appear to be responsible for the different degrees of glycemic durability observed with M+R, M, and M+L. The former provided favorable, albeit short-term, changes in both parameters, translating to the lowest treatment failure rates in TODAY. However, initial &#x003b2;-cell reserve and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were important determinants of glycemic durability. Regardless of treatment assignment, those youth who failed to maintain glycemic control had severe impairment of &#x003b2;-cell function at the beginning of the trial and experienced progressive and faster loss of &#x003b2;-cell function compared with those with durable glycemic control.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
