Although many conditions or behavioral habits are associated with an increased risk for gingival recession, the common etiological factor appears to be the development of inflammation within the gingival connective tissue. This inflammation is thought to result in the degeneration of gingival connective tissue, this eventually undermines the gingival tissues, resulting in shrinkage and recession of the gingival tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The resulting exposure is not aesthetically pleasing and may lead to root hypersensitivity and root caries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Since mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, different techniques like free autogenous grafts, pedicle grafts including rotational flaps, coronally advanced flaps (CAFs), semilunar flaps have been advocated to cover denuded root surfaces. Combination techniques using autogenous or allograft and guided tissue regeneration membranes were developed later to correct muco-gingival defects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] A recent innovation in dentistry is the use of second-generation platelet concentrate which is an autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) gel with growth factors and cicatricial properties for root coverage procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Therefore, the present research was undertaken to study the additional benefits of PRF when used along with a CAF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifteen subjects aged between 18 and 35 years who visited the outpatient Department of Periodontics, St. Joseph Dental College and Hospital, Eluru, Andhra Pradesh, and having bilateral buccal Miller's class I and class II gingival recessions with no radiographic interdental bone loss were selected for the study. The benefits and drawbacks of the study explained to the patients and upon signing an informed consent, the patients were recruited for the study.

</p><p>A randomized split mouth clinical design was used with 30 sites in 15 patients (2 sites in each patient) and the selected sites were divided into two groups which were categorized as Group-I (Control group-15 sites were treated with CAF alone) and Group-II (Test group-15 sites treated with coronally advanced flap + platelet-rich fibrin membrane). All subjects received clinical periodontal examination by a single examiner to avoid inter-examiner variability. The following periodontal parameters like plaque index (Loe and Sillness 1962), recession depth (RD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized gingiva (WKG), and the percentage of root coverage were recorded at base line, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively using William's periodontal probe [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>]. The RD was measured at mid-facial region of the tooth from CEJ to the free gingival margin. The clinical attachment level was measured from a fixed reference point (CEJ) to the base of the sulcus using customized stent. The WKG was determined by subtracting the RD from the CEJ- MGJ (mucogingival junction). The percentage of root coverage was calculated according to the following formula.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Two weeks postoperative view</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-631-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>6 month postoperative</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-631-g002"/></fig><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-631-g003.jpg"/></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Preparation of PRF membrane</title><p>Preoperatively, 10 ml of intravenous blood was collected in a syringe, later transferred into a test tube and centrifuged immediately without the addition of anticoagulant at 3000 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes.

In control sites, the surgical site was prepared by placing two vertical incisions beyond the mucogingival junction followed by placing an internal bevel incision. Mucoperiosteal flap was raised and coronally advanced so that its gingival margin lies 1 mm coronal to the cementoenamel junction and sutured using sling sutures. The surgical area was protected using a non-eugenol dressing (Coe-Pack, GC America Inc., USA) [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>]. In test group sites, the surgical sites preparation was similar to control sites and the prepared PRF membrane was placed over the denuded root surface just below the CEJ [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>].

Studies on this surgical challenge is mostly concerned with the treatment of Miller's class I and II recession defects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Fifteen systematically healthy subjects aged between 18 and 35 years presenting with identical bilateral isolated Miller's class I and II were enrolled into the study.
