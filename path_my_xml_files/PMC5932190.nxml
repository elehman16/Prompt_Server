Eligible participants were ART-naive adults and children aged at least 5 years with confirmed HIV infection and a CD4 cell count of fewer than 100 cells per &#x003bc;L, who were initiating ART at the facilities. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to initiate ART either with (RUSF) or without (no-RUSF) 12 weeks' of peanut-based RUSF containing 1000 kcal per day and micronutrients, given as two 92 g packets per day for adults and one packet (500 kcal per day) for children aged 5&#x02013;12 years, regardless of nutritional status. In both groups, individuals received supplementation with RUTF only when severely malnourished (ie, body-mass index [BMI] &#x0003c;16&#x02013;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or BMI-for-age <italic>Z</italic> scores &#x0003c;&#x02013;3 for children). We did the randomisation with computer-generated, sequentially numbered tables with different block sizes incorporated within an online database. Randomisation was stratified by centre, age, and two other factorial randomisations, to 12 week adjunctive raltegravir and enhanced anti-infection prophylaxis (reported elsewhere). Clinic visits were scheduled at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48, and included nurse assessment of vital status and symptoms and dispensing of all medication including ART and RUSF. The primary outcome was mortality at week 24, analysed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes included absolute changes in weight, BMI, and mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC). Safety was analysed in all randomly assigned participants. Follow-up was 48 weeks.

RUTF has similar composition to RUSF, but might be prescribed in different quantities. If RUTF was not available, malnourished participants randomly assigned to RUSF received that instead; those assigned to no-RUSF did not receive any supplementation in accordance with local clinical practice.

Universal RUSF was associated with increased gains in weight, BMI, and MUAC during the supplementation period that were not sustained afterwards. The large size of the REALITY trial, and similar mortality risks between the RUSF and non-RUSF groups, does not suggest that the null result was because of an absence of statistical power. In fact, 24-week mortality was higher than anticipated (10&#x000b7;5% rather than 7%), meaning that the trial had 80% power to detect reductions from 10&#x000b7;5% to 6&#x000b7;5% (HR 0&#x000b7;6).

Participants were randomised to receive a lipid-based nutritional supplement with or without additional vitamins and minerals (150 kcal per day for 2 weeks, then 1400 kcal per day) from referral for ART until 6 weeks after starting ART. Participants were more malnourished than in our trial (mean BMI 16&#x000b7;4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), although their mean CD4 cell count was higher (around 135 cells per &#x003bc;L). 365 participants (19%) died 12 weeks after starting ART, with no differences in mortality between randomised groups (rate ratio 0&#x000b7;99, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;80&#x02013;1&#x000b7;21), and no differences in changes in BMI or incidence of serious adverse events. Those allocated RUSF with micronutrients had a modestly greater increase in CD4 cell count. In the second trial,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> 491 Malawian adult men with BMI less than 18&#x000b7;5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomly assigned at ART initiation to receive either RUSF or a blend of corn and soy, both providing 1360 kcal per day. Mean baseline BMI and CD4 counts were similar to those in the NUSTART trial: 16&#x000b7;5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 131&#x02013;142 cells per &#x003bc;L). Participants allocated RUSF gained more BMI and lean mass than those allocated the blend of corn and soy, but there was no difference between groups at study end in participants categorised as moderately or severely malnourished. Mortality to 14 weeks was similar in the two groups (26% and 27%). At 12 months, both groups had similar BMI, fat-free body mass, number of admissions to hospital, and mortality.</p><p id="para330">Another trial (ARTFood)<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> in Ethiopia included an unsupplemented control group, but was not designed to assess mortality. In this study, 282 adults initiating ART with BMI greater than 17 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomly assigned either early supplementation with immediate whey-based or soy-based RUSF (1100 kcal per day for 3 months), or delayed supplementation, 3 months after ART initiation. The median baseline BMI (19&#x000b7;8&#x02013;20&#x000b7;0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was similar to that in our trial, but the median CD4 counts were higher (181&#x02013;191 cells per &#x003bc;L). Early RUSF supplementation was associated with gains in weight and lean mass (+2&#x000b7;1 kg total, +0&#x000b7;9 kg lean body-mass; BMI changes not reported) and a small increase in grip strength. There were no differences in viral load or CD4 cell counts and only four participants were reported to have died. At 12 months, there was no difference in weight gain between groups.</p><p id="para340">Compared with the ARTFood trial, in REALITY we enrolled only profoundly immunocompromised individuals at much higher risk of mortality. The differential short-term weight gain with RUSF (+0&#x000b7;9 kg total; +0&#x000b7;4 kg fat-free mass) was somewhat smaller than that noted in the ARTFood trial. We also showed, unlike in ARTFood, that grip strength improved irrespective of allocation to RUSF. These two findings probably reflect differences between the participants in the ARTFood and REALITY trials. Any wasting and weakness in our trial might have been more because of the effects of HIV (as indicated by their severely immunocompromised status) than primary undernutrition,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> with corresponding differences in the metabolic responses to ART and nutritional supplementation. Additionally, although only 40% of participants in our trial had BMI less than 18&#x000b7;5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, we noted no evidence that the effect of RUSF varied by BMI at baseline, whether this was considered as a continuous factor, or when stratified by common thresholds to define malnutrition or undernutrition (ie, 18&#x000b7;5 or 20&#x000b7;0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="para350">In 2015, a systematic review<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> of nutritional assessment, counselling, and support in people living with HIV did not identify any further trials with a mortality endpoint. The review concluded that studies were of variable and largely poor quality and the effect of nutritional supplementation on mortality, morbidity, and disease outcomes was uncertain.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> In 2013, a Cochrane review<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> identified 11 trials including a total of 1725 HIV-infected adults with different disease stages, ART status, and nutritional status, comparing various supplements with placebo, no supplementation, nutrition counselling alone, or usual diet. No trials were identified assessing the effect of macronutrient interventions on mortality as a primary outcome. Meta-analysis showed a significant effect of supplementation on increasing energy and protein intake, but no evidence of efficacy of nutritional supplementation on clinical, anthropometric, or immunological outcomes.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p id="para360">The major strengths of our trial were its large size, the mortality primary endpoint in a well defined, high-risk population, and having a non-supplemented comparison group aside from a small proportion who were severely malnourished. For generalisability, we included a large number of participants at eight HIV clinics across four African countries. Our limitations included that the results cannot inform on the potential effect of RUSF provision on retention in clinic follow-up in a real-world setting since the design included defaulter tracing because this was a clinical trial. Other limitations included the absence of precise data on actual home use or sharing of RUSF, and on feeding frequency and dietary diversity. We also recruited fewer children than planned, limiting our ability to assess effects in this subgroup; we planned to enrol 300 children older than 5 years but found few children with CD4 cell counts less than 100 cells per &#x003bc;L, potentially as a result of increasing coverage of ART to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. By contrast, we recruited adults much faster than expected, suggesting trial results are generalisable to the population presenting with low CD4 cell counts.</p><p id="para370">Consistent with results from previous trials, those from our REALITY trial showed that increasing weight gain by universal lipid-based supplementation, which occurred across all baseline BMI subgroups, did not lead to reductions in mortality. This finding suggests that there is not a direct causal relation between BMI and mortality. Instead, the main drivers of mortality seem to be opportunistic infections as a result of immuno-suppression and systemic immune activation,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> which, together with reduced appetite and feeding or swallowing difficulties, lead to low BMI, and might not be directly improved by nutritional rehabilitation.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Besides reducing viral load and preventing opportunistic infections, new strategies to reduce immune activation might improve outcomes.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Systemic inflammation in HIV particularly arises from the gastrointestinal tract,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> thus interventions targeting gut dysfunction, inflammation, microbial translocation, and the microbiota are promising targets for further research.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p id="para380">Both undernutrition and nutritional supplementation have been reported to change the pharmacokinetics of ART. In one study of Ugandan women,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> exposure to lopinavir, ritonavir, and efavirenz was lower in those who were undernourished, ascribed to decreased bioavailability. Fat might increase efavirenz absorption; however, in another study of Ethiopian adults,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> allocation to lipid-based nutritional supplementation did not affect efavirenz plasma concentrations, although plasma nevirapine concentrations were lower. In our trial, ART regimens were well balanced across the groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>) and we showed no evidence of differences in viral load suppression, thus there was no suggestion of clinically significant changes in the bioavailability of antiretroviral drugs with RUSF.</p><p id="para390">Among severely immunocompromised adults and older children initiating ART, the REALITY trial provides evidence that universally providing lipid-based RUSF increases bodyweight in the short-term, but does not improve mortality, disease progression, viral load, or immunological recovery compared with selectively prescribing RUSF or RUTF to severely malnourished individuals according to current protocols. Although individuals with severe malnutrition should continue to be identified and treated, a change in policy to provide lipid-based nutritional supplements to all severely immunocompromised individuals starting ART is not warranted.</p><p id="para390a"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10a"><p id="para390b"><bold>This online publication has been corrected.
