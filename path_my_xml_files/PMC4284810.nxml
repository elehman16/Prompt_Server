The primary end point was time from start of initial treatment to start of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was a hazard ratio of 1.3 with one-sided significance of 5&#x00025;. We randomly assigned 255 children with an initial episode of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome to either 2 - or 6-month treatment of which 246 were eligible for final analysis. The total prednisolone exposure counted both initial and relapse prednisolone treatment administered over 24 months. Median follow-up in months was 36.7 in the 2-month and 38.2 in the 6-month treatment group. Time to frequent relaps was similar in both groups; however, the median was reached only in the 6-month group (799 days). The hazard ratio was 0.86 (90&#x00025; confidence interval, 0.64&#x02013;1.16) and met the non-inferior margin. Time to first relapse was also similar in both groups: median day 242 (2-month) and 243 (6-month). Frequency and severity of adverse events were similar in both groups. Most adverse events were transient and occurred during initial or relapse therapy. Thus, 2 months of initial prednisolone therapy for steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, despite less prednisolone exposure, is not inferior to 6 months of initial therapy in terms of time to onset of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>initial treatment</kwd><kwd>nephrotic syndrome</kwd><kwd>pediatric nephrology</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>steroid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a disorder affecting the kidneys that is mainly characterized by high excretion of protein in the urine. Pediatric idiopathic NS is understood to be the most common cause of primary glomerular diseases, and it frequently occurs in infants aged 2&#x02013;6 years. Most patients are presumed to have minor glomerular abnormality. Cellular immunologic abnormalities are believed to contribute to the condition, although its pathology remains unknown. In Europe and the United States, two in 100,000 children will develop idiopathic NS in a single year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> An 8-week corticosteroid regimen is the standard initial treatment for children with idiopathic NS, as outlined by the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Although corticosteroids induce the remission of proteinuria in more than 80&#x00025; of children with idiopathic NS, &#x0223c;60&#x00025; undergo proteinuria relapse. Previous research has shown that a high number of children undergo frequent relapse, and corticosteroid toxicities occur after repeated therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Although some controlled studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> and a meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> show that long-term corticosteroid treatment up to 7 months maximum leads to a longer sustained remission of NS than ISKDC-recommended administration, the optimum dose and duration of initial therapy are still unknown. A Cochrane review concluded that a well-designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trial is required to establish the optimum dose and duration of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 2 months of initial prednisolone therapy (ISKDC regimen) is not inferior to 6 months of initial therapy with an increasing cumulative dose, and to compare adverse events between treatment regimens.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>The study was conducted from September 6, 2007 until February 8, 2013. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the trial profile. We assessed 255 patients from 90 hospitals (61 general, 7 children's, and 22 university hospitals) for eligibility. We randomly assigned 128 patients to the 2-month prednisolone group and 127 patients to the 6-month prednisolone group. We excluded nine patients from the analysis: six did not receive trial medication because of either early relapse after remission during the initial 4-week prednisolone treatment, or withdrawn consent, and three were excluded owing to a lack of participant data. Thus, we analyzed data for 246 patients. Median follow-up was 36.7 months in the 2-month group (interquartile range 27.8&#x02013;46.4 months) and 38.2 months in the 6-month group (interquartile range 28.6&#x02013;48.5 months). There was no difference in characteristics between the two groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Primary end point</title><p>The primary end point was defined as the duration from start of initial treatment to diagnosis of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS), or &#x02018;time to FRNS'. By the end of the 24-month intervention period, we observed 54 events in the 2-month group (comprising 46 FRNS [definition 1, 28; definition 2, 18], and 8 requiring immunosuppressant administration) and 58 events in the 6-month group (comprising 45 FRNS [definition 1, 23; definition 2, 22], and 13 requiring immunosuppressant administration). Twenty-one patients required immunosuppressants owing to steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant relapse. Times to FRNS were similar in both groups: however, the median duration of time to FRNS was reached only in the 6-month group (at 799 days). The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.86 (90&#x00025; confidence interval (CI), 0.64&#x02013;1.16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and noninferiority of the 2-month group was confirmed significantly, with an HR margin of 1.3 (<italic>P</italic>=0.01). Post-hoc analyses showed that age groups did not affect the median duration of time to FRNS. The HRs (95&#x00025; CI) were 0.92 (0.59&#x02013;1.45), 0.86 (0.41&#x02013;1.84), and 0.74 (0.31&#x02013;1.77) for the age groups 1&#x02013;5 years, 6&#x02013;10 years, and 11&#x02013;15 years, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary end points</title><p>Times to first relapse were similar in both groups: the median was 242 days and 243 days in the 2-month and 6-month treatment groups, respectively (HR=0.97; 95&#x00025; CI, 0.72&#x02013;1.31; <italic>P</italic>=0.86; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The number of relapses per person-year during the trial intervention period was 1.25 times in the 2-month group and 1.33 times in the 6-month group, and the ratio was 0.94 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.71&#x02013;1.22; <italic>P</italic>=0.65, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The median cumulative dose of prednisolone during the 2-year trial period in the 2-month group was also significantly lower than in the 6-month group (4621.9 [interquartile range=2191.3&#x02013;7472.5] vs. 6484.8 [interquartile range=3701.0&#x02013;9577.9], <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>Frequency and severity of adverse events were similar in both groups (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Most adverse events were transient and occurred during initial therapy or relapse therapy. In our study, steroid dependency did not greatly affect the occurrence of adverse events. Two patients in the 2-month group had severe adverse events requiring hospitalization. One patient discontinued because of acute kidney failure during relapse (month 10) and recovered in 22 days. Another patient had pneumonia with influenza infection on the last date of the 2-month prednisolone treatment and recovered in 10 days. Height standard deviation scores show a significant decrease in growth at 2 months of follow-up compared with baseline (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.003). In both groups, this was restored within 9 months after initial treatment commenced. Notably, one patient in the 6-month group was diagnosed with possible adrenal insufficiency owing to steroid withdrawal according to clinical symptoms (mild headache and mild nausea) when the patient switched to trial medication after the initial dose of prednisolone. Symptoms disappeared on the same day of onset without further treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Extension of initial steroid treatment for more than 3 months to decrease the risk of relapse in children with steroid-sensitive (SS) NS has been widely described in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> However, 80&#x02013;90&#x00025; of children diagnosed with SSNS who are given new corticosteroid treatments continue to relapse, and &#x0223c;50&#x00025; relapse frequently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Therefore, initial approaches to SSNS therapy are likely to be substantially different.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Our results demonstrate that extending initial steroid treatment, and even increasing the total dose of prednisolone (2240 vs. 3885&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>), does not improve clinical outcomes (time to FRNS, time to first relapse, the number of relapses, total prednisolone dose, and adverse events) for pediatric NS. Our results add to the Cochrane review by Hodgson <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> by comparing treatment regimens of 2 vs. 6 months.</p><p>Our findings build on a 2013 study from the Netherlands. This well-designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of children with NS clearly showed no improvement in clinical outcomes when the initial prednisolone treatment was extended from 3 to 6 months without an increasing cumulative dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> However, despite the results of this trial, the most effective duration and dosage of prednisolone treatment for an initial episode of SSNS is still under debate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Although our study has demonstrated that increasing the total dose in 2-month or 6-month regimens does not improve clinical outcomes, further investigation is still required to determine the most effective duration and dosage regimen for initial SSNS.</p><p>A key strength of our trial is its unique design. This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for noninferiority that compares the efficacy of the 2-month ISKDC regimen with a 6-month, long-term prednisolone regimen. The most important clinical objective of initial treatment of SSNS is to prevent frequent relapses. Consequently, the primary end point was set to time to FRNS rather than initial relapses.</p><p>Our data from several analyses consistently support noninferiority of the ISKDC regimen. In the current trial, a HR threshold of 1.3 for noninferiority of the primary end point is slightly high given the feasible study size. However, the posterior probability that a HR would be smaller than 1.1 and 1.2 (HRs that are commonly used as an upper equivalence margin) was 91 and 97&#x00025;, respectively.</p><p>In our trial, noninferiority was found in FRNS (primary end point) and first relapse (secondary end point) between the ISKDC and 6-month regimens. This means that many patients relapse even while taking tapering-dose prednisolone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Previous studies vary in their observation of (frequent) relapses from either the start or end of initial therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> However, if analyses are performed from the end of initial therapy, relapses during tapering-dose prednisolone cannot be counted, possibly resulting in an inadequate interpretation. Therefore, we selected observations primarily from the start of initial therapy. In our study design, steroid-dependent NS was predicted to occur more frequently because of its definition in the 6-month regimen. This is one reason why we selected FRNS as a primary end point, and not steroid-dependent NS. In fact, time to steroid-dependent NS was significantly higher in the ISKDC regimen group (data not shown).</p><p>No significant difference in adverse events was observed between the two regimens in our large-scale trial, which is a similar finding to previous small-scale trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Most adverse events were transient and occurred during initial or relapse therapy. However, because the ISKDC regimen is generally less likely to cause adverse events owing to the lower dosage and the shorter duration, its use can be recommended.</p><p>A limitation of our trial is the open-label design, which may have introduced preconception bias. However, as our trial design is a noninferiority trial with regular visits, and relapses are measured objectively, we cannot assume positive placebo effects. Therefore, the open-label design of this study may have limited impact on preconception bias. Moreover, the results of this trial may partially be due to the relatively high rate of relapse compared with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> The high rate of relapse may be owing to our definition of relapse (proteinuria 2&#x0002b; or higher). It still remains unknown whether long prednisolone therapy consisting of a dose of 60&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day for 6 weeks, followed by alternate-day doses of 40&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> per 2 days for 6 weeks, is more effective against time to FRNS compared with the ISKDC regimen for treating idiopathic NS. In our study, only one patient withdrew consent. A low rate of consent withdrawal is common in Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Cultural differences between countries may account for variations in rates of consent withdrawal.</p><p>In our study, steroid sensitivity was confirmed by day 21 in order to ensure time for eligibility screening. Generally, remission after 3 weeks is uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Therefore, as the effect of early confirmation of steroid sensitivity was slight, we decided to confirm steroid sensitivity by day 21.</p><p>We conducted a meta-analysis to address the differences between corticosteroid regimens in children with an initial episode of SSNS. We searched randomized controlled trials that compared durations of steroid therapy in children and reported the number of FRNS cases within 2 years (see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Information</xref> online for a detailed search strategy). Meta-analysis of our study and five studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> showed a risk ratio (long vs short) of 0.99 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.68&#x02013;1.44, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref> online), whereas meta-analysis of our study and the published studies only showed an risk ratio of 1.15 (95&#x00025; CI: 0.95&#x02013;1.40, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref> online). This result might indicate that long-term treatment is not superior but almost equivalent to ISKDC-standard therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows that extending initial prednisolone treatment from 2 to 6 months with an increasing dose does not improve clinical outcomes for pediatric NS. The original ISKDC regimen is not inferior to 6 months of initial therapy with an increasing cumulative dose. We assert that the ISKDC regimen is recommended as an initial treatment for pediatric idiopathic NS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design and patients</title><p>We conducted a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority, open-label trial at 90 hospitals in Japan and compared prednisolone treatment of 2 months (ISKDC regimen) with 6 months for children with a first episode of idiopathic NS. We diagnosed idiopathic NS and remission according to the ISKDC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> NS was defined as a urinary protein&#x02013;creatinine ratio &#x02a7e;1.8 and albumin levels &#x02a7d;25&#x02009;g/l in serum. Remission was defined as a negative dipstick analysis for 3 consecutive days.

Patients, patients' guardians, treating physicians, and individuals assessing outcomes and analyzing data were not blinded to the patients' treatment assignments.

Follow-up started at diagnosis and was truncated when the last enrolled patients finished the 24-month intervention.</p><p>All patients diagnosed with a first episode of idiopathic NS started initial therapy of 60&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> oral prednisolone in three divided doses (maximum of 80&#x02009;mg/day) daily for 4 weeks. Patients underwent a screening examination and were registered after their eligibility, including remission, was verified.

However, relapse treatment given during the 6-month initial treatment was adjusted according to the initial treatment regimen in the 6-month group.</p><p>Participant characteristics (age, sex, physical characteristics, blood, and urine test results) were recorded at baseline. Clinical assessment and urine tests (urinalysis, qualitative and quantitative proteinuria, quantitative creatinine) were performed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after enrollment and every 3 months thereafter, and also on diagnosis of relapse. Blood analysis (complete blood cell count, blood chemistry) was performed at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months after enrollment, at the end of treatment, and at diagnosis of relapse only.</p><p>Adverse events were recorded throughout the trial period and assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Within 4 weeks of starting initial treatment, participants were screened for glaucoma by an ophthalmologist.

Briefly, name of diagnosis, severity, seriousness, date of onset and disappearance, outcome, and assessment of causal relationship to the study drug were investigated at the start of study treatment and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months after the start of study treatment (each within &#x000b1;2 weeks).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end point was defined as the duration from start of initial treatment to diagnosis of FRNS, or &#x02018;time to FRNS'. Diagnosis of FRNS was based on the relapse dates according to the ISKDC. In our study, FRNS was defined as two relapses within 6 months of initial remission (definition 1), or four relapses within any 12-month period (definition 2), which included relapses during initial tapering treatment but excluded relapses with spontaneous remissions. Patients were observed for at least 2 years, on the basis of the Cochrane review, which states that the risk of relapse after 1&#x02013;2 years was lower after long-term prednisolone treatment relative to the ISKDC regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Relapse was defined as proteinuria 2&#x0002b; or higher on dipstick analysis for 3 or more consecutive days or proteinuria 2&#x0002b; or higher on dipstick analysis and serum albumin &#x02a7d;25&#x02009;g/l. Immunosuppressant administration was prohibited in the protocol. However, if administration was undertaken for clinical necessity, e.g., steroid dependency, it was treated as an event in the primary analysis. Data for patients who did not experience these events were considered censored at the last examination. Important secondary end points were time to first relapse, the number of relapses per person-year, total prednisolone dose, and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary objective of this trial was to confirm noninferiority of initial therapy with 2-month treatment compared with 6-month treatment, with respect to time to FRNS. The noninferiority margin of HR for the 2-month to 6-month group was predefined to 1.3, and the significance level was set to 5&#x00025; (one-sided). The former was determined based on surveys conducted among practicing pediatric nephrologists and other specialists before the protocol was developed.</p><p>On the basis of results from a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> we assumed an event rate of 15 and 19&#x00025; at 1 year in the 2- and 6-month groups, respectively. With a sample size of 125 patients in each treatment group, an HR test with a one-sided 5&#x00025; significance level would have 70&#x00025; power to confirm noninferiority. Accrual and follow-up times were specified to be 3 and 2 years, respectively.</p><p>As the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> was conducted more than 10 years earlier, it is possible that the current event rate of our study is lower than the previous study. We scheduled an interim analysis to take place just before the accrual completion date, which was performed in October 2010. A statistical test regarding the primary end point was not performed. The number of events observed matched that of the assumption, and the study plan was not changed.</p><p>Statistical analyses followed the protocol and the intention-to-treat principle. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to test noninferiority and estimate the HR with a 90&#x00025; CI of the primary end point. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to summarize time to FRNS. These methods and the log-rank test were used to analyze time to first relapse. The number of relapses per person-year was calculated as the total number of relapses divided by the total observed person-years in each treatment group (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A permutation test was used to compare the number of relapses per person-year between groups. We compared the prednisolone total dose using the Wilcoxon test. The number of adverse events was compared using Poisson regression. For baseline characteristics, we compared distributions of continuous variables between groups using the <italic>t</italic>-test or Wilcoxon test, depending on the shape of the distribution. We analyzed categorical variables using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Posterior probability was calculated with the improper flat prior and the normal distribution to which log-HR was approximated. Except for noninferiority testing of the primary end point, we regarded a two-sided <italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05 to indicate statistical significance. We analyzed data using SAS software (version 9.3) and calculated the sample size using the SAS POWER procedure.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all our patients, their families, and the site investigators.
