Participants were seen three times per week for six weeks, receiving 0, 6, 12, or 18 sessions of SMT, and a light massage control on visits without manipulation. Data were collected until 52 weeks after randomization. Outside care outcomes included prescription and non-prescription use, and treatments outside of the study including the following healthcare providers: chiropractor, primary care physician, surgeon, neurologist, psychiatrist, naturopath/homeopath, nurse practitioner, acupuncturist, physical therapist / occupational therapist, or massage therapist. Preliminary analysis used the chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test of categorized data as appropriate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Abstinence from prescription use for prevention of cLBP, within the past four weeks, was greater than 75% of participants using none at any time point. The abstinence from non-prescription medication, within the last four weeks, was greatest in the 18 SMT visit group from week 6 through week 39 follow-up time points with the greatest incidence of non-use at 54% at week six. Seeking care from a chiropractor during the follow-up phase did not differ between groups at any time point with average chiropractor seeking behavior across all four groups reaching a maximum at 52 weeks of 10.6%. Differences between groups seeking outside care from a massage therapist were observed at 18 and 52 weeks, with more SMT associated with less massage care, but this was not consistent across all time points.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Preliminary analysis of outside care shows that care was balanced across all four dose groups during treatment phases including use of prescription and treatment visits to non-study medical providers and classes. Results from adjusted models will be presented.</p></sec></body></article>
