After the subjects were enrolled, they were provided a study serial number in chronological order.

Isometric exercise involves daily and athletic activity, which significantly increases blood pressure, heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output; this enhanced physiological activity requires a fit cardiorespiratory system. A study in children and adolescents suggests that low cardiorespiratory fitness is strongly associated with the clustering of cardiovascular disease risk factors in children, independent of country, age, and sex.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Cardiorespiratory endurance is generally recognized as a major component of physical fitness. The maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> max) is considered by many as the most valid measure of cardiorespiratory fitness.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The test for VO<sub>2</sub> max is perhaps the most commonly employed procedure in exercise physiology. This measurement determines an athlete's ability to take in, transport, and utilize oxygen and is probably the best assessments of the athlete's endurance capabilities. The maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> max) is a measure of long-term aerobic and cardiovascular endurance parameters. VO<sub>2</sub> max represents a long-term aerobic and cardiovascular endurance and is considered to be a gold standard for measuring the cardiorespiratory fitness level.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Endurance activities characteristically require high repetitions and low resistance.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] A study states that 20 m shuttle run test is valid and reliable for prediction of the VO<sub>2</sub> max of male and female adults.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The 20 m shuttle run test is as a valid test of cardiorespiratory endurance as other distance run tests in American Students of 12&#x02013;15 years old.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In this study, 20 m shuttle run test was used to measure VO<sub>2</sub> max levels which in turn depicted the cardiorespiratory endurance. It was observed that there was a significant increase in VO<sub>2</sub> max by the end of 8 weeks and by the end of 12 weeks as compared to placebo group. The data of the present study defined an excellent range of VO<sub>2</sub> max following administration of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>.</p><p><italic>Ashwagandha</italic> is known as an &#x0201c;adaptogen,&#x0201d; as it increases resistance to physical, chemical, and biological stressors, builds energy and general vitality.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Previous studies assessing physical and cardiorespiratory endurance of healthy adult subjects have also reported similar beneficial results with the use of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>, underscoring the significant increase in VO<sub>2</sub> max and muscle strengthening.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] <italic>W. somnifera</italic> administered in the form of aqueous extract in capsules with gradual escalating doses from 750 to 1250 mg/day was found to be safe and well tolerated.

It beneficially influences Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent ATPase activity and reduces the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity in the mitochondria of granulation tissue of carrageen induced air pouch granuloma as demonstrated in an experimental study.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In agreement with the fact that exercise endurance capacity is largely determined by the functional mitochondrial content of muscle, this study confirms the energizing effect of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>. It has been shown that <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> increased both the red blood corpuscles (RBC) and hemoglobin count. The increase in RBC results in an increased capacity of the blood to transport oxygen directly to the exercising muscles; thus, enhancing the aerobic capacity of the athletes.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] These findings suggest a possible mechanism of the ergogenic effect of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> root extract.</p><p>An animal study reported a 2&#x02013;3-fold increase in free radical (R<sup>&#x02022;</sup>) concentrations of muscle and liver following exercise to exhaustion.

There are no reported Phase-I or Phase-II studies being conducted due to its known knowledge of safety and efficacy. In view of the fact that <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> is an herb which is extensively used traditionally in Ayurveda, Phase-I and Phase-II trials may not be necessary. The herb under investigation is being clinically evaluated for the same indication for which it is being used or as has been described in ancient texts. Furthermore, the design of the trial is appropriate to provide the expected outcomes for the traditional medicine.</p><p>The WHO-QOL questionnaire is used to evaluate a given subject's QOL. It comprises 26 items, which measures the following broad domains: Physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and the environment (WHO-QOL Questionnaire, 1996).[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The procedure entails each question being read out to the subjects, along with the response options. In this study, QOL was checked by self-reported WHO-QOL Questionnaire. <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> was shown to improve all subdomains of the QOL (physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environmental factors) of the healthy athletic adult subjects as compared to placebo. The data of the present study showed significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) improvement in physical and psychological health and these domains have a greater contribution in the QOL than the other domains of social relationships, and environmental factors.

In this study, oral administration of a high concentration root extract of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> led to increased VO<sub>2</sub> max, enhanced cardiorespiratory endurance, and improved QOL in healthy athletic adults. Findings of this study suggest that <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> root extract improves the cardiovascular dynamics by increasing the VO<sub>2</sub> max levels thereby enhancing the cardiorespiratory endurance, and also brings an improvement in QOL in healthy adults. However, due to the limited cross-section of the population considered in this study, the findings may not generalize to all populations. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Conflicts of
