The main pathology of the disease is the existence of some demineralization areas (CNS) that causes a physical performance disorder. Clinically speaking, the CNS stricken areas appear gradually. The disease initially starts with some vision problems like dimness, body balancing problem, stinging, and numbness in various organs. It then develops through its natural course as recurring, recovered, and primary and secondary progressive stages. If the brain stem gets involved, it will have some symptoms like dizziness, hearing problems, sensation disorder in the V nerve path and moving in the direction of VII nerve.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>MS can cause some damages to the protective cover of the axons nerve. Although, it is possible that some of the damage to the myelin protective layer be recovered but any kind of damage to the axon nerve will be permanent and irrecoverable. If the brain cannot neutralize the damage to the nervous path, the physical activity under the control of that nerve may permanently be lost.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The unharmed nerve path with healthy myelin cover, transfers the neural signal in the specific path quickly and without any energy waste, but a nerve with deteriorated myelin cover, this neural signal is transported with delay, energy waste, and out of the intended path. This will cause problems in harmonic, quick, coordinated movements of the person's body.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The balance or positional stability is the ability to maintain a state and showing reaction to a permanent force. Many of our body's physical characteristics allow us to show reactions.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In all forms of standing, sitting, and lying down, having balance is essential for doing coordinated moves. To maintain the balance for a good body performance, many parts of the brain areas are needed to cooperate with each other. Cerebellum is the main center for controlling balance, eyes, ears and all the nerves that go through hands and legs are also important for keeping a balance. Any problems in any of these areas can create some disorder in body's balance.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Having balance is a sample reactive movement that is dependent on the integrity of the receptive stimuli from the sight senses and movement systems.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Balance is also referred to as the ability of the body for combining the visual data with the data from the semi-circle channels inside the internal ear and the data from the muscular receptors.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Our visual sense reports to us in what status our body is. The sensing-moving data from our internal body receptors tell us in what position our body limbs and body parts are with respect to each other.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In fact, body balance relates to vestibular, coordination intact visual.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Weak balance and frequent fallings cause patients to develop a fear of falling down and eventually will affect the quality of the patient's life. These disorders will lead to an increase in the patient's dependency on others for doing their daily routines, and reducing their social relationships and loss of confidence for being able to do their daily chores.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Balance disorders in MS patients are very common and restrain them from doing exercise activities. The balance reduction in MS patients is due to a weak judgment and power reduction and control of movements. The bone fracturing danger due to falling downs is 2 to 3.5 times more common in MS patients than in healthy people.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>There are many ways for controlling the problems caused by balance disorders. Aiding equipment, doing exercises in water, or doing exercises in sitting position instead of standing are among examples for effective solutions that can be useful. Since there are many factors involved in adjusting the body balance, it is important to notice that almost all exercise activities have high positive effect on maintaining the body balance.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Arian and colleagues[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] conducted a study on the body balancing in MS patients using clinical-practical experiments. In this study, 40 patients with MS from the MS society of Khoozestaan province (south west of Iran) and 40 healthy patients, as the control group, were evaluated and compared. The results of this study showed that the MS patients are weaker in all the balance tests than the patients in the control group. In fact, these patients have some balance disorders.</p><p>Soltani and colleagues[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] studied the effect of selected aerobic exercises in water on balance improvement in MS patients. The samples were divided into two experimental (15 people), and control (10 people) groups. The experimental program for the experimental group was applied for 8 weeks and three sessions per week. In the end, the researchers concluded that doing selected aerobic exercises in water will lead to some improvements in multiple sclerosis patients.</p><p>Freeman and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in their research, called &#x0201c;training the central strength based on the Pilates exercises in MS patients&#x0201d; focused on the effects of Pilates exercises on lack of balance and activity in MS patients, and concluded that these exercises in comparison with the control group are effective on improvement of the physical status of the MS patients.</p><p>Masoodi Nejad and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in their research, studied the effect of selected composite exercises on women MS patients' balance and performance. Their findings showed that those composite exercises were effective on improving their balance and performance.</p><p>Sosnoff and colleagues investigated the movements, balance, and neural and muscular coordination in patients with MS They studied 52 patients for 12 weeks.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The study's results showed that by passing time, the physical disability in patients will increase and the muscular stamina, walking speed, balance, and nervous-muscular coordination will be reduced. An intervention is needed to prevent this to happen.</p><p>Charlton and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in an article called &#x0201c;the results of a structured evaluation of effects of exercise in MS patients&#x0201d;. This pilot program included some power, endurance, and flexibility exercises assigned to 11 MS patients. The findings showed that all the participants were content with the class. They enjoyed the class and had a lot of motivation for continuing the class. In addition, their flexibility, strength, balance, coordination, and psychological mood showed improvement.</p><p>Cattaneo and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] observed the effect of a balancing exercise program on MS patients. The results of the study indicated a significant progress in static balance of the examinees. The dynamic balance of patients, after a period of exercise did not have a significant progress, but the probability of their falling downs was reduced.</p><p>Jakson and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in a semi-experimental study and by using the ANOVA statistical method for repeated data, selected 14 MS patients who had not had any other special diseases and any other exercise program participation. These patients followed a 6-week exercise program with some supervision and control and a 6-week exercise at home. The balance level of the patients was measured before and after the exercise periods. The results showed that the balance was significantly improved in patients with low to moderate level of the disease, after the completion of the exercise period.</p><p>Kath and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in their study concluded that sport exercises is positively correlated with physical and mental health of the people and that patients, who had physical exercises, had better social performance and physical performance for doing their daily routines.</p><p>Hitherto, a number of researches have been conducted on the effects of water activities on patients with MS, but there have not been any studies on the effects of Pilates exercises on MS patients and more specifically on the dynamic balance of MS patients. Considering the fast growth in the number of MS patients in Iran, and especially in Isfahan, the researchers are much interested in discovering the effects of these two types of exercise on the dynamic balance of the MS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study is a clinical practical and semi-experimental and focuses on the effect of 12 week of Pilates exercises and aquatic training on the muscular strength of women with MS sampling was conducted randomly and 57 women with MS with a disability index (Expanded Disability Status Scale-EDSS) of less than 4.5, who visited Kashai hospital in Esfahan, were selected.

This is while doing exercises has a close relationship with the quality of physical and mental health of the people and patients who had had some physical activities, had a better performance in their social and personal duties.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, the pre-experiment scores for dynamic balance has a significant relationship with those of the post-experiment and also the dynamic balance scores of the examinees of the experiment group were different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Therefore, we can say that Pilates exercises and the exercise in water causes a significant increase in the dynamic balance of the examinees in the post-experiment stage. This is while the dynamic balance before conducting the study in the three groups showed no significant difference. These findings were in compliance with those by Freeman and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] MasoodiNejad and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Charlton and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Jackson and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Soltani and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Kath and colleagues,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and not in compliance with those by Kateno and colleagues.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Of course, in his studies, following some exercise interventions, the static balance of the examinees showed a significant increase but the dynamic balance did not have any significant changes. Considering the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, the paired comparison of the dynamic balance of the examinees indicate that the Pilates exercises, given the control group data, had significant effect, and we can say that doing Pilates exercises cause a significant increase in the MS patient's dynamic balance, compared with the control group. This increase in dynamic balance of the patients in this research can be the result of doing Pilates exercises and the 12-week exercise period. This is also the result of determining the Pilates exercise level, since the exercises started from level 4 and in the second month considering the patients conditions and the principle of overload downgraded to level 3 and in the end of the month to level 2. In the end, the physical condition of the patients and the dynamic balance of the patients increased. These results were in compliance with those by Freeman and colleagues[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and MasoodiNejad and colleagues[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] based on the effectiveness of sport exercises on the dynamic balance of the MS patients. In addition, sport exercises In water, considering the data from the control group, had a significant effect and we can say doing sport exercises in water causes a significant increase in the dynamic balance of the MS patients, compared with those in the control group. This is compliant with the results by Soltani and colleagues.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The reason for the improvement in the patients' dynamic balance in this research may be the result of doing exercises in water and selecting the exercise period to be 12 weeks. Thus, participating in these exercise programs in a collective form and considering the overload principle and with some supervision on the way for performing the exercises in MS patients seems to be essential. This is because the physical constraints, lack of balance and balance in walking make walking in water easier. Lower body weight in water makes doing exercise programs easier and the water resistance helps improve the patient's body balance. Eventually, exercise in water causes an increase in endurance and performance quality and ability for doing daily activities and better body balance.</p><p>The findings of this study show that doing exercise in water and Pilates exercises by MS patients is completely possible and easy. By doing these techniques, a significant improvement occurs in the dynamic balance of the patients, in such way that doing exercise in water and Pilates exercises will lead to higher body balance in patients. Thus, it can be claimed that both types of the exercises have had positive effects on increasing the dynamic balance of the patients; however, there is no significant difference between the results of the two types of exercises. In conclusion, the specialists in the field are recommended to use these exercises as a supplementary treatment along with medicinal treatment plans for MS patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors of this article would like to express their appreciation to the authorities and employees of the MS clinic in Kashani
