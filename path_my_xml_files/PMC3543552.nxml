Chronic suppuration can occur with (tympano-mastoid type) or without (tubo-tympanic type) cholesteatoma. The tubo-tympanic type is the usually safe variety and follows a benign course. It usually occurs as a complication of acute otitis media, where there is perforation of the tympanic membrane. The perforation is always central and can be of various sizes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Bacterial pathogens in the tubo-tympanic type CSOM vary considerably, and can be a combination of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. In CSOM, the bacteria may be aerobic (e.g., <italic>Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis</italic>, Klebsiella species, Escherichia species, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, etc.) or anaerobic (e.g., Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Proprionibacterium, etc.).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Bacteriological cultures may not be needed to establish the diagnosis of CSOM as exhaustive studies have established that 90&#x02013;100% of chronic draining ears yield two or more isolates consisting of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The choice of the antibiotic agent depends greatly on the knowledge of the type of bacteria most frequently implicated in CSOM and their sensitivity to antibiotics.</p><p>Since their introduction, systemically acting fluoroquinolones have opened up new therapeutic possibilities for using an orally administered antibiotic in the treatment of CSOM. Ciprofloxacin, in particular, has proven to be very active <italic>in vitro</italic> against a large number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Moreover, ciprofloxacin concentrations within the structures of the middle ear have been shown to exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the microorganisms responsible for CSOM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Cefpodoxime, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, has good antimicrobial activity against aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is also effective against anaerobic organisms. There are few studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of cephalosporins like cephalexin and ceftriaxone in acute exacerbation of chronic suppurative otitis media (AECSOM), and results have shown that they can be considered as an effective agent for the treatment of AECSOM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Against this backdrop, the present study was planned to compare the effectiveness and safety of cefpodoxime with ciprofloxacin in AECSOM. The objective of this study was to demonstrate equivalence between cefpodoxime (test drug) and ciprofloxacin (comparator) with respect to their effectiveness in AECSOM. Another objective was to compare their safety and tolerability profile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, open-labeled study. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and conducted according to the ICMR guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects, 2006, and the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were recruited in the ENT Outpatient Department of a tertiary care teaching hospital and the study was conducted between June 2011 and October 2011. The study was registered under Clinical Trials Registry - India (Registration Number - CTRI/2011/10/002079).</p><p>The objective of the study was to demonstrate equivalence in the effectiveness between the two treatment groups. A difference of 10% in clinical cure rates was assumed to be the largest clinically acceptable effect for which equivalence could be accepted (equivalence limit). Considering the true mean difference between the two treatment groups as zero and the expected standard deviation of 10% in the study population, 90% power and &#x003b1; = 0.05, the number of subjects required in each treatment group was 21. The sample size was calculated by using primer of biostatistics software (version 5.0).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Adults of either sex, aged between 18 and 60, were considered. Clinically documented cases of tubo-tympanic-type CSOM, defined as long-standing chronic suppuration of middle ear cleft and its muco-periosteal lining resulting in discharging ear and deafness presenting with clinical symptoms and signs of acute exacerbation of the disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and baseline otological symptom score[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] of &#x0003e;4 but &#x02264;8 were included in the study.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Otological symptom score[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPP-3-320-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Female patients who are pregnant or lactating were excluded. Severe cases of AECSOM for which hospitalization or parenteral antibiotic treatment is required and patients with otological symptom score of &#x02264;4 and &#x0003e;8 were also excluded from the study. Patients with foul-smelling discharge and those who received antibiotic in the preceding 4 weeks of screening were left out.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Effectiveness parameters</title><p>Number of subjects achieving &#x0201c;treatment success&#x0201d; in each treatment group was considered to be the effectiveness parameter. Treatment success was based on changes in the otological symptoms scores at day 14 visit. It was subdivided into two categories: (a) &#x0201c;clinical cure&#x0201d; if the otological symptom score was &#x0003c;3 at day 14 visit or (b) &#x0201c;clinical improvement&#x0201d; if the otological symptom score was between 3 and 5 on day 14. &#x0201c;Treatment failure&#x0201d; was declared if there was no change or increase in the baseline otological symptom score on day 14.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study visits</title><p>Each patient was evaluated for 2 weeks. The first week was the active treatment period. The following week was treatment-free follow-up. Patients were evaluated clinically at baseline (day 0) and at subsequent follow-up visits on Days 3, 7 and 14. Otological symptom score was recorded at every visit.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Grouping</title><p>Patients who fulfilled the selection criteria were randomly allocated in both treatment groups. Randomization was done by coin toss. Patients in group A received cefpodoxime (Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. Mumbai, India) tablet (200 mg) and group B received ciprofloxacin (Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. Mumbai, India) tablet (500 mg). Study medications were dispensed twice during the study period: first during baseline visit for 3 days and next during day 3 visit for the next 4 days. Patients were advised to take each of their respective study medications orally twice daily after food for the first 7 days. Compliance was assessed by the traditional pill count method at each follow-up visit and at the end of the study.</p><p>Patients with worsening clinical conditions or treatment failure were withdrawn prematurely from the study. Apart from the study drugs, no concomitant medication was administered to the patients. All patients were advised to stop smoking and consumption of alcohol during the study period. Patients were monitored continuously throughout the study for any adverse event (AE). Safety monitoring was performed continuously throughout the study. All AEs spontaneously reported by the subjects or elicited by the investigators were recorded and causality analysis was done as per the World Health Organization-Uppasala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) criteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed as per modified intention to treat basis.

Thus, it can be suggested that both cefpodoxime and ciprofloxacin are effective in the treatment of AECSOM. An intergroup analysis of the otological symptom scores showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the baseline, day 3 and day 7 and day 14 otological symptom score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].

Therefore, the safety and tolerability profile of both the study drugs were good without any reported cases of serious AE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Several published studies have shown the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of AECSOM in adult patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Few studies have also proved the effectiveness of cephalexin and ceftriaxone in adult patients with AECSOM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] But, there is no published comparative controlled trial that evaluated ciprofloxacin with an oral third-generation cephalosporin in adult patients with AECSOM. The results of our study showed that cefpodoxime and ciprofloxacin are equally effective in clinically diagnosed cases of AECSOM, both in terms of effectiveness and in terms of safety. After treatment with a 7-day course, the clinical success rates were comparable, i.e. 95.6% in the cefpodoxime group and 90.9% in the ciprofloxacin group. The incidence of AEs was also minimal, i.e. two in the cefpodoxime group. These AEs were nonserious in nature and did not require dose modification or withdrawal of drug therapy. Patient compliance in both the groups was also good.</p><p>Baba <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a clinical trial that showed that ceftriaxone was effective in 65% patients with acute otitis media and 72% patients with AECSOM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Another trial by Baba <italic>et al</italic>. reported that cephalexin has a 35.5% failure rate in patients with AECSOM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Clinical cure rate with cefpodoxime in our study is significantly higher compared with those two trials with other cephalosporins. Very few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of oral third-generation cephalosporins in patients with otitis media.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] A study reported by Block <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] compared the effectiveness of cefdinir with cefprozil, and the results showed that the overall clinical cure rate with cefdinir was 80% versus 82.5% with cefprozil in the treatment of pediatric acute otitis media. Another study by Kafetzis showed that the overall clinical cure rate with cefixime was 85% in patients with acute otitis media.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Our study suggests that cefpodoxime has higher cure rates (95.6%) compared with other oral third-generation cephalosporins.</p><p>Some limitations of this study were as follows. A double-blind study could not be conducted due to financial constraints and logistic problems. Secondly, we did not perform bacteriological culture of the cases as exhaustive studies have established that 90&#x02013;100% of chronic draining ears yield two or more isolates consisting of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Another reason is that, very often, clinicians start antimicrobial therapy at outpatient setting before the bacteriological culture report arrives, which takes about 72 h. Therefore, we conducted this study mainly to provide information to clinicians on the comparative effectiveness of these two antibiotics as initial antibiotics for AECSOM patients based on clinical assessment scores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this study demonstrated that a 7-day course of cefpodoxime is comparable to ciprofloxacin in terms of both clinical effectiveness and safety for the treatment of AECSOM in an outpatient setting. Although cost of drug therapy was higher with cefpodoxime compared with ciprofloxacin, it should not be considered as a drawback. Future trials are warranted to evaluate the bacteriological cure and relapse rates of these two drugs to provide additional supportive scientific evidence.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil,</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Verhoeff</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Veen</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name><name><surname>Rovers</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanders</surname><given-names>EAM</given-names></name><name><surname>Anne</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Schilder</surname><given-names>AGM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chronic suppurative otitis media: A review</article-title><source>Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol</source><year>2006</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16198004</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brobby</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name><name><surname>Zadik</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bacteriology of otitis media in Ghana</article-title><source>Trop Doct</source><year>1987</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>91</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3576696</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fairbanks</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antimicrobial therapy for chronic suppurative otitis media</article-title><source>Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol Suppl</source><year>1981</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>S58</fpage><lpage>62</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Chronic suppurative otitis media-Burden of Illness and Management Options.
