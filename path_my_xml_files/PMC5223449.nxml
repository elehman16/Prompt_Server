However, countries such as Uganda continue to have a persistently high TFR partly attributed to strong preferences for large family sizes. We explored the factors that influence fertility desire among married or cohabiting individuals in Rakai, a rural district in southwestern Uganda.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This cross-sectional study of fertility desire (desire to have another child) was nested in a cluster-randomized demand-creation intervention trial for the promotion of couples&#x02019; HIV counseling and testing uptake among married or cohabiting individuals that was conducted in Rakai district between March 1 and April 30, 2015. A total of 1490 married or cohabiting individuals, resident in three study regions with differing background HIV prevalence, were enrolled into the study. Data were collected on socio-demographic, behavioral and fertility-related characteristics. We used a modified Poisson regression model to generate prevalence ratio (PR) as a measure of association for factors that were independently associated with fertility desire. We adjusted for clustering at community level and used STATA version 14.0 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, fertility desire was high (63.1%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;940); higher in men (69.9%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;489) than women (57.1%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;451). More than three-quarters (78.8%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1174) had 3+ biological children while slightly more than two-thirds (68.5%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1020) reported an ideal family size of 5+ children. Only 30% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;452) reported that they had attained their desired family size. After adjusting for potential and suspected confounders, the factors that were negatively associated with fertility desire were: age 30&#x02013;39 (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.86) and 40+ years (aPR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.71); having six or more biological children (aPR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.97); being HIV-positive (aPR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.95) and ever use of any family planning methods (aPR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.93, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.99). Being male (aPR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.19, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.33); having primary education (aPR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.21, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.44) and having not yet attained the desired family size (aPR&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.34, 95% CI: 3.50, 5.38) were positively associated with fertility desire.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Having not yet attained one&#x02019;s desired family size, being male and having primary education were positively associated with fertility desire in this population.

However, in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, women still produce more than four children, but more importantly, many women with as many as four children still want to produce more. While the reasons for desiring to have (more) children have been documented in other previous studies, these studies have largely focused on HIV-positive individuals and HIV-discordant couples; but not the general population. In this paper, we explore the reasons for the high desire for children among 1490 married or cohabiting individuals living in Rakai, a rural district in south-western Uganda. Overall, we found that both men and women reported a higher number of living biological children (78.8% had 3 or more children) but on top of this, 68.5% of all individuals interviewed reported that they wanted to have a family size of 5 or more children. Only 30% (452 of 1490) reported that they had attained the number of children that they intended to have. We found that the fact that an individual has not yet attained their desired number was one of the major reasons for the high numbers of children alongside having primary education and being a man. Our findings suggest a need to target those who are still &#x0201c;looking out&#x0201d; for children to attain their desired numbers, individuals with primary education and men in order to regulate fertility levels in this rural population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p>There is evidence to show that total fertility rates (TFR) are declining in the developed and much of the developing world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], although the trend in some developing countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa, shows stable or increasing fertility rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Globally, TFR declined from 4.97 children per woman in 1950&#x02013;1954 to 2.53 in 2005&#x02013;2010; in much of the developing world, the changes were even more dramatic over this period, from a TFR of 6.08 to 2.69. However in sub-Saharan Africa, the changes in TFR were much smaller, from 6.53 to 5.39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The desire for more children, heavily entrenched into strong cultural preferences for large families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], desire for sons rather than daughters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] together with low levels of contraception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], seem to be the driving force for the high fertility rates in sub-Saharan Africa. In support of this observation, a review of reproductive preferences in 60 countries based on data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 1998 and 2008 found that, compared to other countries, the number of children desired remained highest in western and middle Africa with an average of 6 children desired during that period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Westoff found that in countries such as Zambia, Tanzania and Uganda, the proportion of women with four or more children who wanted to have another child was more than half of the women interviewed while in Eritrea and Mozambique, between 68 and 78% of women with 4 or more children wanted to have another child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that fertility desires remain high in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, thereby partly explaining the high fertility rates observed in these countries.</p><p>Fertility desire can be influenced by a number of factors that operate at the societal and personal/individual levels. At the societal level, fertility desire is largely driven by social cultural pressures and the need to maintain stability of the union [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. At the personal/individual level, several factors have been associated with fertility desire including age of individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], number of living children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], male sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; enrolment on antiretroviral therapy (among HIV-positive individuals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; partner&#x02019;s desire to have a child or believing that one&#x02019;s partner wanted more children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; and knowledge of one&#x02019;s HIV-positive status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, although there is clear documentation of the factors affecting fertility desire in different settings, most studies (with the exception of demographic and health surveys) have been conducted among HIV-positive individuals (and especially among HIV-positive women) and HIV-discordant couples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; few studies have explored fertility desire from a general population perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], including among married or cohabiting individuals. This presents a missed opportunity for understanding the factors that influence fertility desire among married or cohabiting individuals who constitute more than half of the adult population in most countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, we explore the determinants of fertility desire among married or cohabiting individuals enrolled in a population-based study that was conducted in rural Rakai district, southwestern Uganda.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a cross-sectional study that was nested within a cluster randomized demand-creation intervention trial aimed at promoting couples&#x02019; HIV counseling and testing (couples&#x02019; HCT) uptake among married or cohabiting individuals with no prior couples&#x02019; HCT experience in Rakai, Uganda. Details about the cluster-randomized demand-creation intervention trial have been reported elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study site</title><p>The study was conducted in three study regions that are part of the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) in Rakai district. The RCCS is a population-based cohort that was established in 1994 for a randomized community intervention trial of sexually transmitted infections control for HIV prevention in Rakai district, southwestern Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The cohort consists of 11 study regions; each with approximately 1500 eligible participants (age range: 15&#x02013;49 years). Previous to data collection, the eleven study regions were grouped into <italic>low</italic> (9.7&#x02013;11.2%), <italic>medium</italic> (11.4&#x02013;16.4%) and <italic>high</italic> (20.5&#x02013;43%) HIV prevalence strata based on HIV prevalence data obtained from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Each stratum had at least three study regions; one was purposively selected to represent each stratum. The selected study regions were: Buyamba (HIV prevalence&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.7%, representing low HIV prevalence strata), Katana (HIV prevalence&#x02009;=&#x02009;12%; representing medium HIV prevalence strata) and Kasensero (HIV prevalence&#x02009;=&#x02009;43%, representing high HIV prevalence strata).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study context</title><p>The majority of the population in Rakai district belongs to the Baganda ethnic group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As described by Seeley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the descent system among the Baganda is patrilineal with virilogical marriage where women move into the husband&#x02019;s home upon marriage, in many cases at some distance from their natal home. Similar to other patrilineal societies in Uganda and elsewhere, in Rakai, marriage transfers rights over a female&#x02019;s sexuality from her family to her new husband. Women are expected to have produce children in their new marriage; failure of which can result into marital instability. Sometimes, women look at child bearing as a form of social protection; believing that this will minimize chances of marital disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In Rakai, fatherhood and marriage are part of respectable norms. In a qualitative study conducted to explore how masculine ideals and practices relating to marriage and fertility desires shape young men&#x02019;s HIV risk, Mathur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] found that the desire to become a father was instrumental in establishing men&#x02019;s masculine role and identity within the family in particular and the community in general. Evidence from other studies suggests that having children is an important aspect in men and women&#x02019;s conceptualization of a long-term relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, our study of fertility desire among married or cohabiting individuals was conducted in an area where having children is part and parcel of societal expectations of those who are married or in long-term sexual relationships.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study population</title><p>The study was conducted among 1490 married or cohabiting individuals (aged 15&#x02013;49 years) who were resident in each of the three HIV prevalence strata.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection procedures</title><p>Data were collected on socio-demographic (e.g. age, education, religious affiliation), behavioral (e.g. previous receipt of HCT, marital duration) and fertility-related characteristics (e.g. ideal family size, number of living children, whether or not individuals intended to have another child, how long individuals intended to wait before having another child (for those who expressed the desire to have another child), age at first marriage, discussion about how many children a couple should have; and who should decide how many children a couple should have) were collected from all married or cohabiting individuals. All respondents had their data linked to the pre-existing RCCS HIV database to ascertain HIV status (where HIV status information was available) but no fresh blood samples were collected for HIV serology. Data collection took place between March 1 and April 30, 2015.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Measurement variables</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was fertility desire. This was defined as the need to have another child in future as expressed by married or cohabiting individuals at the time of interview. Initially, respondents were asked if they had any biological children to which all individuals responded in the affirmative. These individuals were then asked if they desired to have another child in the future. Those that desired to have another child in the future were asked about how far in the future (months/years) they wanted to wait to have another child, and the period of waiting was categorized as &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;year, 1&#x02013;2 years, 3&#x02013;4 years or 5 or more (5+) years. The question on whether or not individuals desired to have another child in the future was asked to all respondents regardless of whether the female partner reported that she was currently pregnant or the male partner reported that his [female] partner was currently pregnant. To determine fertility desire, we combined desire for children as expressed by those who were/whose partners were not currently pregnant and those who were/whose partners were currently pregnant and divided the sum by the total number of respondents. Thus, the term &#x02018;fertility desire&#x02019; as used in this paper refers to desire for another child in the future.</p><p>We used the term &#x02018;ideal family size&#x02019; to refer to the number of children that men and women would have liked to produce if they could go back in their reproductive life and start all over again &#x02013;after responding to the question: &#x0201c;<italic>If you could go back to the time you did not have any children and could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?</italic>&#x0201d; This question was adopted from the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey Questionnaire. We defined &#x02018;number of biological children&#x02019; as the number of living biological children that the respondents had at the time of interview. We used the term &#x02018;ever use of family planning&#x02019; to refer to use of <italic>any</italic> family planning method (including modern and traditional methods). We did not have a specific question on ever or current use of modern methods; so, this is not captured in this analysis. Finally, we created a variable, &#x0201c;achieved desired family size&#x0201d; by subtracting the ideal number of children from the number of biological children that individuals had. This variable was necessary to ascertain the extent to which fertility desire changes when the desired family size has been attained as opposed to when the desired family size has not yet been attained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We conducted descriptive analysis to assess the characteristics of married or cohabiting individuals enrolled into the study (stratified by sex) and used inferential statistics to ascertain the determinants of fertility desire among married or cohabiting individuals resident in the three study regions. At the bivariate analysis, we assessed the association between fertility desire and each of the independent correlates (socio-demographic, behavioral and fertility-related characteristics) and all variables with a <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 (i.e. sex, education, age-group, number of biological children, ideal family size, pregnancy status, age at first marriage, whether or not individuals attained their desired family size, and ever use of family planning methods) and suspected confounders (i.e. HCT receipt status; marital duration; HIV status at baseline) were considered for the multivariable model. The suspected confounders were selected based on evidence from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We used a modified Poisson regression model with a log link to assess the factors that were independently associated with fertility desire after adjusting for clustering at community level. A <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant at the multivariable analysis level. Analysis was conducted using STATA statistical software version 14.0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study was approved by the Higher Degrees, Research and Ethical Committee of Makerere University School of Public Health and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Respondent characteristics</title><p>Overall, 1490 respondents were interviewed for this study; 53% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;790) of whom were women (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study of fertility desire among married or cohabiting individuals in Rakai, Uganda, found that six in every ten married or cohabiting individuals desired to have another child. The observed fertility desire is higher than what has been reported in most studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] but closer to fertility desires previously reported in Rakai, Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The higher fertility desire in this population could be partly explained by the fact that majority of the respondents (64% of men and 82% of women) were below the age of 40&#x000a0;years (and were therefore still in the prime of their reproductive years) and partly due to the fact that majority of the women were married at a younger age (68.4% by 18&#x000a0;years), thereby increasing the reproductive life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The factors that were significantly associated with an increased desire to have another child were: being male, having primary education and having not yet achieved the desired family size. Ever use of <italic>any</italic> family planning methods, being HIV-positive, having six or more children, and age-group 30&#x02013;39 or 40+ years were associated with less desire for children in the future. The finding that being male was positively associated with fertility desire is in direct consonance with previous findings on this subject [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and is consistent with the belief, expressed by 43% of the respondents, that men should be the ones to decide the number of children that a couple should have. Studies show that men tend to desire to have large families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which supports the finding that men were significantly more likely to desire to have more children than women. However, since having a husband whose desired number of children is smaller than the wife&#x02019;s can increase the odds of having a small family size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], our findings suggest a need to engage men as an important target group in fertility regulation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The finding that individuals who had not yet attained their desired family size had a higher desire for children compared to their counterparts was not surprising given that there is already evidence showing that the ideal number of children that individuals would like to have is a significant predictor of fertility desire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The relationship between ideal and desired family sizes can be a straight one: if the ideal number of children that people wanted to have was high, it follows that fertility desire can increase to match with the high ideal numbers of children desired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thus, our findings have implications for fertility control programs and suggest a need to target individuals who have not yet attained their desired family sizes as well as non-users of family planning in order to ensure that those who do not desire any more children do not get unwanted pregnancies.</p><p>Related to ideal family size is the actual number of biological children that men and women have. Studies show a decreasing desire for children as the actual number of biological children increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For instance, findings from the most recent Uganda Demographic and Health Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] show that the proportion of women who would like to have another child soon decreased from 78.9% among those with no children to 8.6% among those with four children and 3.4% among those with six or more children. Similarly, the proportion of men who would like to have another child soon decreased from 77.5% among men with no children to 15.8% among those with four children and 9.6% among those with six or more children. We found that having 6 or more children was significantly associated with less likelihood of desiring to have another child. However, there was no significant difference in fertility desire between those who had 3&#x02013;5 when compared to those with 1&#x02013;2 children, possibly explained by the fact that, in this population, 68.5% of the respondents desired to have a family size of 5 or more children. In order to regulate population growth, our findings suggest a need for programs that promote contraceptive use to target individuals with fewer children who are also likely to be young and, by implication, to have high fertility desire.</p><p>Our finding that HIV-positive individuals were less likely to desire more children was consistent with other studies that found low fertility desires among HIV-positive individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, our findings are in sharp contrast with findings from other studies that have found increased fertility desire among HIV-positive individuals, particularly among those enrolled on antiretroviral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These contrasting findings suggest that other factors beyond a person&#x02019;s antiretroviral therapy enrolment status &#x02013; a partner&#x02019;s desire to have a child or the belief that a partner would like to have a child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], number of living children that men and women have [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], being male [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and lifetime history of not having a live birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] &#x02013; operate at a more proximal level to influence fertility desire among HIV-positive individuals. Thus, fertility regulation interventions targeting HIV-positive individuals should integrate components that focus on some of these proximal determinants to assist people living with HIV to make informed, rationale reproductive health decisions.</p><p>We found that having primary or post-primary education was positively associated with fertility desire at the bivariate analysis, suggesting that higher levels of education were associated with higher levels of fertility desire. These findings contrast previous findings on this subject that higher education is associated with lower fertility desire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. When these results were adjusted for potential confounders, having primary rather than post-primary education remained positively associated with fertility desire. We do not know why individuals with primary education were significantly more likely to have higher fertility desire than those with no formal education. It is also not particularly clear why fertility desire did not differ between those with no formal education and those with post-primary education. Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between level of education and fertility desire in this population.</p><p>This study had several limitations. Although fertility desire can be influenced by ART coverage levels, and there is already evidence that ART coverage is increasing in Rakai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], our study did not collect data on ART coverage; so, we did not adjust for the effect of ART availability on fertility desire in the final model. However, since our population included both HIV-positive, HIV-negative and individuals with unknown HIV status, our findings can still provide a general reflection of the fertility desire at population level. The other limitation was that we did not collect any fresh blood samples to determine HIV status but relied on HIV status data that were already available within the RCCS HIV results database. As noted in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, nearly six out of every ten respondents interviewed did not participate in HCT in the 12&#x000a0;months preceding the study, suggesting that the available HIV status data might not reflect the exact HIV status at the time of the study due to likely HIV sero-conversion among previously HIV-negative respondents. Finally, our inability to collect data on current use of modern family planning methods was a key limitation, since these methods control fertility levels. However, given the low levels of modern contraceptive use in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the fact that contraception tends to reduce with increased fertility desire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we can safely conclude that the fertility desire observed in our study population reflect a more realistic picture of the fertility levels in this rural population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study of fertility desire among married or cohabiting individuals in Rakai, Uganda, found that six in every ten married or cohabiting individuals desired to have another child.
