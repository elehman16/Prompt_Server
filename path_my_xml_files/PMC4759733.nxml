A small proportion of HFMD patients, typically those infected with enterovirus 71 (EV71), develop brainstem encephalitis with autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation and may progress rapidly to cardiopulmonary failure and death. Although milrinone has been reported to control hypertension and support myocardial function in two small studies, in practice, a number of children still deteriorate despite this treatment. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) is a cheap, safe, and readily available medication that is effective in managing tetanus-associated ANS dysregulation and has shown promise when used empirically in EV71-confirmed severe HFMD cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We describe the protocol for a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of intravenous MgSO<sub>4</sub> in Vietnamese children diagnosed clinically with HFMD plus ANS dysregulation with systemic hypertension. A loading dose of MgSO<sub>4</sub> or identical placebo is given over 20&#x000a0;min followed by a maintenance infusion for 72&#x000a0;h according to response, aiming for Mg levels two to three times the normal level in the treatment arm. The primary endpoint is a composite of disease progression within 72&#x000a0;h defined as follows: development of pre-specified blood pressure criteria necessitating the addition of milrinone, the need for ventilation, shock, or death. Secondary endpoints comprise these parameters singly, plus other clinical endpoints including the following: requirement for other inotropic agents; duration of hospitalization; presence of neurological sequelae at discharge in survivors; and neurodevelopmental status assessed 6&#x000a0;months after discharge. The number and severity of adverse events observed in the two treatment arms will also be compared. Based on preliminary data from a case series, and allowing for some losses, 190 patients (95 in each arm) will allow detection of a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in disease progression with 90&#x000a0;% power at a two-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the large numbers of HFMD cases currently being seen in hospitals in Asia, if MgSO<sub>4</sub> is shown to be effective in controlling ANS dysregulation and preventing severe HFMD complications, this finding would be important to pediatric care throughout the region.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01940250">NCT01940250</ext-link> (Registered 22 August 2013).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1215-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hand</kwd><kwd>foot</kwd><kwd>and mouth disease</kwd><kwd>brainstem encephalitis</kwd><kwd>magnesium sulfate</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007421</institution-id><institution>Li Ka Shing Foundation (HK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LG27</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wills</surname><given-names>Bridget</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Thrasher Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>TRF 11756</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wills</surname><given-names>Bridget</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>089276/Z/09/Z</award-id><award-id>089276/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabanathan</surname><given-names>Saraswathy</given-names></name><name><surname>Wills</surname><given-names>Bridget</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease, primarily affecting young children, caused by a number of enteroviruses belonging to the species <italic>Human enterovirus A</italic> and including coxsackievirus a16 (CA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71). Infection with EV71 is of particular concern because it can cause severe HFMD, sometimes resulting in death. Over the past 15&#x000a0;years, EV71-associated HFMD has emerged across Asia, with outbreaks thought to involve millions of people occurring in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. EV71-related HFMD has also increased markedly in Vietnam during this period, and in 2011, 170 deaths occurred among the 113,000 Vietnamese children clinically diagnosed with the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation and HFMD</title><p>During outbreaks, thousands of children can develop HFMD, and although most will have self-limited illness with fever and rash only, a small proportion will develop neurological and systemic complications that can be rapidly fatal. Neurological manifestations of EV71 infection include aseptic meningitis and acute flaccid paralysis, but the issue of most concern is brainstem encephalitis because autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation may occur, potentially with rapid progression to cardiopulmonary failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Clinical features indicating ANS dysregulation include high persistent fever, profuse sweating, mottled skin, tachycardia, tachypnoea, hypertension, and hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The Vietnamese Ministry of Health (MoH) has developed guidelines for clinical staging and suggested management of HFMD, according to the severity grade (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1). Briefly, Grade 1 represents classic HFMD without complications. Patients with Grade 2 disease show some evidence of central nervous system involvement, usually manifesting as myoclonus. In Grade 3 disease, evidence of ANS dysfunction is present, whereas patients with Grade 4 disease have cardio-pulmonary compromise.</p><p>Although the mechanisms underlying the ANS dysregulation have not been clearly defined, evidence exists that inflammation occurs in the medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord, causing increased sympathetic activity and resulting in severe systemic and pulmonary hypertension and eventually pulmonary edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The frequency of ANS dysregulation is also unclear because many of the signs are rather subjective and also can be present among children with high fever; however, the development of systemic hypertension in children with HFMD is considered to be unequivocal evidence of ANS dysregulation. The frequency with which this occurs is not known, however, because only severe cases are usually reported. In one study of 36 severe EV71 infection cases from Taiwan, more than 36&#x000a0;% developed systemic hypertension, whereas in 22 severe HFMD cases reported from China, 17 cases had hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Research has also revealed left ventricular dysfunction in patients with EV71-associated brainstem encephalitis/hypertension who later develop pulmonary edema. Although no histological or virological evidence of viral myocarditis was seen, catecholamine-associated cardiotoxic effects were found on histological examination of cardiac ventricular biopsies, together with high concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine in plasma from these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, high plasma catecholamine concentrations secondary to brainstem encephalitis are purported to have a direct effect on cardiac function, as well as to cause pulmonary edema by raising pulmonary pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Alternatively, or in addition, the impact of altered cytokine profiles on the cardiopulmonary system may influence the severity of HFMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In small studies, the severity of EV71 infection has been associated with altered concentrations of a number of different cytokines, including TNF&#x0221d;, INF&#x003b3;, IL6, and IL13, in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with evidence that cytokine levels correlate with the degree of injury to the brainstem and spinal ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, in a number of animal studies of neurogenic hypertension, associations have been demonstrated between inflammatory cytokine levels and enhanced vasomotor and cardiac sympathetic drive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Management of ANS dysregulation</title><p>Management of ANS dysregulation presents particular challenges. In one report from Taiwan, use of the phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, milrinone was said to control hypertension and support myocardial function in a group of 24 children with severe HFMD compared to historical controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, milrinone was shown to decrease mortality in HFMD patients with pulmonary edema in a small, open-label, randomized clinical trial in Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the basis of these small studies, milrinone has now become the recommended therapy for HFMD with ANS dysregulation in Vietnam, with MoH guidelines setting down indications for when the drug should be commenced in suspected HFMD cases. Currently, the MoH guidelines define the intervention level for use of milrinone to be when the systolic blood pressure (SBP) exceeds the 99th percentile for age plus 5&#x000a0;mmHg, which approximates to the internationally accepted definition of Stage 2 hypertension in children (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, clinical failures still occur despite high dose intravenous milrinone, and a number of children go on to require hemofiltration and ventilatory support, the next steps recommended in the Vietnamese MoH guidelines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 2). Secondly, there are few clinical or safety data available with respect to milrinone use in children, apart from a few small studies following cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recent reports suggest that milrinone use is an independent risk factor for clinically significant tachyarrhythmia after congenital heart surgery, and may be associated with development of acute renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Magnesium sulfate and ANS dysregulation</title><p>Autonomic disinhibition is also postulated to occur in severe tetanus. Elevated concentrations of circulating catecholamines have been observed, and urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion are increased proportional to disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial comparing magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) with placebo in patients with severe tetanus, the use of magnesium was associated with significantly reduced requirements for drugs to control muscle spasms and cardiovascular instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In patients undergoing tracheal intubation or surgery for pheochromocytoma, the use of magnesium was associated with a reduction in SBP and in plasma catecholamine concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Isolated reports exist of rapid and effective control of life-threatening autonomic hyperreflexia in patients with spinal cord lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In in vitro studies, magnesium has been shown to reduce catecholamine secretion from the peripheral nerve endings and the adrenal medulla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Intrapartum use of MgSO<sub>4</sub> in women with preeclampsia was associated with reduced cytokine levels in the women and their babies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, the use of magnesium in a small number of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage was associated with reduced serum levels of certain inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Formal safety data relating to the use of MgSO<sub>4</sub> in pediatric care are limited, but from its use in children with severe asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and in a small number of neonates with uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], adverse effects appear to be infrequent.</p><p>In summary, although HFMD has become one of the major contributors to childhood morbidity and mortality in Vietnam, current management strategies rely on guidelines that are based on expert opinion and only two small clinical studies. Vietnamese MoH guidelines currently indicate that milrinone should be used when Stage 2 hypertension develops, but evidence for the efficacy of this intervention is limited, and a number of children (approximately 20&#x000a0;%, personal communication Dr. Phan Tu Qui) treated in this way require additional interventions. In addition, milrinone is an expensive drug with a known toxicity profile and requires highly experienced staff to administer it. We hypothesized that early intervention with MgSO<sub>4</sub> in Grade 3 HFMD, when Stage 1 hypertension and ANS dysregulation first become apparent, might control cardiovascular instability more effectively and prevent progression to more severe disease. MgSO<sub>4</sub> is cheap, readily available, and generally considered to be safe. Given the very large numbers of HFMD cases currently being seen in hospitals in Asia, if MgSO<sub>4</sub> is shown to be effective in controlling ANS dysregulation and preventing severe HFMD complications, this finding would be important to pediatric care throughout the Asian region.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary objective of the trial</title><p>The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effects of MgSO<sub>4</sub> for the control of hypertension and progression to severe disease (shock, respiratory compromise, or death) in children with severe HFMD and ANS dysregulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary objectives of the trial</title><p>The secondary objectives of the trial are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To describe the clinical signs of autonomic dysfunction observed in children with severe HFMD; measure levels of biomarkers of sympathetic activity, including plasma and urine catecholamine levels and levels of inflammatory cytokines; and to assess the impact of MgSO<sub>4</sub> on these parameters.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine the relations between measures of cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with clinical signs of autonomic dysfunction and to assess the impact of MgSO4 on these parameters.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To evaluate the effects of MgSO<sub>4</sub> on long-term outcome from severe HFMD in survivors, by assessing neurodevelopmental status at 6&#x000a0;months.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study Design</title><p>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the efficacy and side effect profile of intravenous MgSO<sub>4</sub> when used in Vietnamese children with clinically diagnosed HFMD and signs of ANS dysregulation with systemic hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study sites</title><p>The Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) and Children&#x02019;s Hospital Number One (CH1) are two major hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, with 1600 in-patient beds in total. Each hospital functions as a first-level facility for the immediate local population and as a tertiary referral center responsible for the diagnosis and management of serious infectious diseases for a population of over 15 million children across southern Vietnam. The Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) is located on the HTD site, and together, the three institutions have established a number of fruitful research collaborations over more than 20&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendices 1-4 for definitions/additional details)</title><p>Vietnamese MoH guidelines indicate that all suspected HFMD cases with Grade 2 or more severe disease should be admitted to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) or High Dependency Unit (HDU) facility for close observation.

For patients with Grade 3 disease (that is, the group eligible for inclusion in this study), the pulse, BP, respiratory rate and pattern, oxygen saturation, and temperature must be monitored very closely, and the child should receive intravenous sedation with phenobarbitone, as well as a dose of 1&#x000a0;g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as soon as possible, with a second dose of IVIG 24&#x000a0;h later.</p><p>All patients aged 6&#x000a0;months to 15&#x000a0;years admitted to the PICU at HTD or the HDU on the Infectious Diseases Ward at CH1 in Ho Chi Minh City with clinically suspected HFMD (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1) are considered for eligibility for this trial.

Enrollment to this study is designed to be early, when hypertension is first identified (at Stage 1), so that in the event of treatment failure, the MoH treatment guidelines can be applied. A small number of patients who present with Stage 2 hypertension may also be enrolled; in such cases, very stringent BP criteria will ensure that, if the BP does not improve within 30&#x000a0;min of commencing the study drug, milrinone will be added. That is, all Stage 2 patients will be on milrinone within 1&#x000a0;h of presentation unless the BP falls to Stage 1 levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention / study medication</title><p>Detailed information on the use of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, the pharmacokinetics, the side effects profile, etc. is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 5.

Following introduction of new Vietnamese MoH management guidelines to commence intra-arterial BP monitoring early (at the first sign of autonomic disturbance), among 16 children managed in this way at HTD over a 2-month period, 12/16 patients developed Stage 1 hypertension, and seven of these 12 cases developed Stage 2 hypertension and were treated with milrinone. Based on this observation (that is, that 7/12 children with Stage 1 hypertension progressed), for the sample size calculation for this study, we estimated a progression rate of 50&#x000a0;% in the control arm.</p><p>With respect to the hypothesized treatment effect, little direct information exists for the actual scenario we plan to investigate, that is, the influence of MgSO<sub>4</sub> commenced at Stage 1 hypertension on subsequent control of SBP and progression to severe disease. In the case series described earlier, when MgSO<sub>4</sub> was added to the treatment regimen of patients with poorly controlled hypertension, despite high-dose milrinone, in all cases, the SBP reduced within 30 to 60&#x000a0;min and thereafter remained stable on a continuous MgSO<sub>4</sub> infusion. In the tetanus study mentioned above (in which the study drug was given to patients with severe tetanus requiring a tracheostomy), the requirement for additional therapy to treat ANS dysfunction was reduced from 14/97 (14&#x000a0;%) in the placebo group to 3/97 (3&#x000a0;%) in the MgSO<sub>4</sub> group, although the need for assisted ventilation was similar in the two groups. Thus, indirect evidence suggests that the effect size of the proposed intervention may be large; we therefore estimate that use of MgSO<sub>4</sub> could reduce the risk of progression by&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;%.</p><p>Based on 1:1 randomization, an anticipated relative reduction in the risk of progression of 50&#x000a0;% (from 50&#x000a0;% in the control arm to 25&#x000a0;% in MgSO<sub>4</sub> recipients), 90&#x000a0;% power, and a two-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level, 85 patients per treatment group are required.

An additional analysis will also be performed in the subgroup of patients with confirmed EV71 infection. The primary endpoint of disease progression will be compared between the two treatment arms based on logistic regression with the treatment assignment as the only covariate. As disease progression is evaluated in a short time frame, that is, within 72&#x000a0;h of study drug initiation, we expect to lose only a minimal number of patients to follow-up before that time point and will analyze these patients according to their last recorded disease status. We will also perform regression analysis, including a number of baseline covariates &#x02013; age, sex, BMI, day of illness at study entry, study site, and baseline severity assessed in terms of an internationally recognized score (PRISM III).</p><p>Predefined secondary endpoints and exploratory investigations will be compared between the two treatment arms based on linear regression for continuous endpoints, logistic regression for binary endpoints, and Cox regression for time-to-event endpoints. For laboratory markers, analyses will be adjusted for the pre-dose value of the respective marker. For host genetics analyses in this sample, putative severity alleles will be detected by filtering and comparison with reference data from control groups including the 1000 Genomes Project. For alleles with significant enrichment among severe cases, validation will be attempted using samples from other cohorts with severe HFMD.</p><p>The values for CO, SVR, catecholamine, and cytokine measurements will also be correlated with clinical information using descriptive statistical methods.

Those who agree to participate are asked to sign/date an Informed Consent Form, with a second copy to keep.</p><p>As indicated above, because HFMD may progress rapidly, the parents/guardians of potentially eligible patients are given study information shortly after admission, so later if the child fulfils the necessary enrolment criteria, the staff can discuss the study again, allowing the family at least 1 to 2&#x000a0;h to decide. Families of children presenting with Stage 2 hypertension are given up to 30&#x000a0;min to decide, but since insertion of the access lines necessary for standard care takes at least 30&#x000a0;min, this process does not result in delay. All families are given the opportunity to review the study information on the PIS with a study doctor at least once more 12 to 36&#x000a0;h after enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Confidentiality / participant protection</title><p>Personal information is recorded for the purpose of consent and to enable follow up of treatment outcomes. Access to identifying information is restricted to site-specific study staff and the clinical care team, and only anonymized data are entered into the study database. All other study documents are identified by the subject number and patient initials only. All documents are stored safely in secure, confidential locations. Data recorded on paper are entered on site into the database in accordance with standard operating procedures and are monitored for accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Patient benefits &#x00026; compensation</title><p>For all trial participants, the medical costs associated with diagnosis and treatment of HFMD are covered from the time that the parent/guardian agrees to allow their child to enroll in the study until discharge but do not include the medical costs related to previous treatment decisions made before enrollment. All trial-related procedures are covered by the study, and patients are reimbursed the cost of local transport to attend for the follow-up visit according to OUCRU compensation policy. This policy reflects the actual cost of transportation plus modest compensation for time lost from work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Withdrawal of participants from the study</title><p>Dedicated study staff members are employed to support parents/guardians to meet study visits and ensure that all trial outcome data are collected. Parents/guardians of the study participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason. If this occurs, the child will be managed in accordance with standard clinical care guidelines. With the agreement of the parent/guardian, a clinical assessment will be performed and recorded at the time of withdrawal, and the reason for withdrawal will also be recorded in the CRF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Communication/dissemination policies</title><p>The study protocol and materials will be made available via publication. The results of the study will be reported in international medical journals with authorship determined according to the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Participants will not be individually informed of the results. The overall study findings will be published in both English and Vietnamese and reported to the Department of Health of Ho Chi Minh City. The researchers will also convey the research results to the community in Vietnamese through the OUCRU website and through talks and articles written and published in the mainstream media.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Safety reviews</title><p>An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established, consisting of qualified individuals with the necessary knowledge of local treatment guidelines, clinical trials, and statistics, and operates in accordance with a written DSMB charter. The DSMB reviewed and approved the conduct of the study after enrollment of the first five, and subsequently, the first 20 patients. In due course the DSMB will perform a formal safety review after 30 patients have been enrolled (phase 1), including unblinded summary tables of SAEs, AEs, or event reports submitted to the DSMB, plus an analysis of overall clinical outcome based on the interim analysis plan. If no safety concerns are identified, recruitment will expand to include CH1 (phase 2). A further DSMB review will take place after 100 patients have enrolled in the study, with additional safety reviews performed annually or at the discretion of the DSMB based on available data and ongoing reporting. Unless the benefit of MgSO<sub>4</sub> is shown &#x0201c;beyond reasonable doubt,&#x0201d; no formal stopping rule for efficacy is foreseen; the Haybittle-Peto boundary, requiring <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 at interim analysis to consider stopping for efficacy, will be used as a guide.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although HFMD has become a major contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality in Vietnam, current management strategies rely on guidelines that are based primarily on expert opinion plus two small clinical intervention studies, one of which used retrospective controls. The efficacy of milrinone, an expensive drug with a significant toxicity profile, for management of ANS dysregulation in children with HFMD and brainstem involvement is unclear, and MgSO<sub>4</sub>, an alternative therapeutic agent that is cheap, safe, and easily available may be more effective.</p><p>The current Vietnamese MoH guidelines specify that milrinone should be given to children with HFMD and Stage 2 hypertension due to ANS dysregulation. Although a direct comparison of MgSO<sub>4</sub> with milrinone might have been illuminating, we were constrained to ensure that none of these very sick children be denied the possible benefit of milrinone. Thus, enrollment to this study was designed to be early, when hypertension is first identified (at Stage 1), so that in the event of treatment failure, the MoH treatment guidelines can still be applied. If MgSO<sub>4</sub> is shown to be effective in controlling ANS dysregulation at this early stage, and in preventing deterioration/development of severe complications, this would be important to pediatric care throughout the Asian region. Additionally, it might be possible later to consider a direct comparison between milrinone and MgSO<sub>4</sub> in HFMD cases with established severe hypertension (Stage 2).</p><p>Sample size estimates for a study of this nature, where reliable baseline outcome data are lacking, are always difficult to calculate. We used indirect evidence from use of MgSO<sub>4</sub> in other conditions, together with the data from the small, unblinded pilot study in severe HFMD cases that failed to respond to maximum dose milrinone, to estimate the effect size of the proposed intervention. We acknowledge that the proposed effect size is large, but it does appear reasonable based on this evidence. Moreover, given the epidemic situation in Asia, we chose not to delay starting the study further by doing a formal pilot study.</p><p>Vietnamese guidelines for the management of HFMD are regularly reviewed, and the MoH Guidelines Committee strongly supports the idea for this study. If the results are positive, it is likely that use of MgSO<sub>4</sub> would be incorporated promptly into the local guidelines, with the potential for rapid adoption by neighboring countries experiencing similar severe HFMD outbreaks.</p><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial status</title><p>To date, 21 cases have been enrolled (July 2015), all of whom survived and were discharged home. Long-term follow-up is in progress for these cases. Interim reports on the first five, and subsequently the first 20, cases were reviewed by the DSMB, which approved the conduct of the study and that no toxicity or danger signals were apparent in the data collected so far. The Vietnamese MoH also audited the trial in April 2015 (as part of a planned review of all intervention studies currently being performed at OUCRU) and approved the study to proceed without modifications. A formal interim analysis for safety is planned after the first 30 patients have been enrolled.</p><p>This protocol is based on the approved version 1.6 dated 14 SEP 13, with additions according to publication requirements.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec42"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1215_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
