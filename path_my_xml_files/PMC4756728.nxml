In 1990, a global incidence of 1.31 million was reported and was associated with 740 000 deaths.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Hip fractures constitute a heavy socioeconomic burden worldwide. The cost of this clinical problem is estimated at 1.75 million disability adjusted life years lost, 1.4% of the total healthcare burden in established market economies.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section8-2046-3758.51.2000473"><title>Existing knowledge</title><p>Hip fractures can be subdivided into intra and extracapsular fractures. Approximately half of all hip fractures are intracapsular, and the majority of these are displaced (Type AO/OTA B3).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The accepted treatment for a displaced intracapsular fracture is an arthroplasty. This includes hemiarthroplasty (HA), where the proximal femur is replaced, and total hip arthroplasty (THA), where both the femur and acetabulum are replaced.</p><p>The Thompson&#x02019;s prosthesis is a press fit hemiarthroplasty implant designed in the pre-cement era. It is now most frequently cemented, with improved clinical effectiveness compared with uncemented monoblock (Austin-Moore) stems.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Its offset is fixed as it rests just above the lesser trochanter. In addition, the placement of the neck cut can be varied. The prevalence of leg length discrepancy following the use of a Thompson prosthesis is unknown. The Orthopaedic Device Evaluation Panel (ODEP) produces ratings for hip arthroplasty prostheses used in the United Kingdom, based on length of follow-up and quality of evidence. The Thompson&#x02019;s stem currently does not have an ODEP rating, due to the relative paucity of implant survival data in this at-risk patient group.</p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) offers evidence-based guidance to clinicians in the United Kingdom. The recent NICE guidance on hip fracture management recommends the use of &#x02018;proven&#x02019; cemented stem designs with an ODEP rating of at least 3B (97% survival at three years), instead of the Thompson&#x02019;s prosthesis.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Recent evidence published since the NICE guidance however supports the use of the Thompson stem.</p><p>The Thompsons stem has been used extensively in the United Kingdom for over 50 years. Until recently, there has been a lack of evidence of implant survival but the implant is in common use in all the investigating units of this study and large series have recently been published demonstrating a low complication rate and excellent implant survival. One study of 430 patients followed to at least five years showed a dislocation rate of 1.4% and a revision rate of 1.2%.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Another recent series of 1670 patients followed to five years reported implant survival at 95.4% - equivalent to a higher ODEP 5 status.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>There are conflicting global trends for the use of Thompson&#x02019;s prosthesis in favour of newer stems. A well-constructed but underpowered study showed no difference in hip function, pain, complications or mortality at 12 months.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> A recent review of the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register has reported a decline in the proportion of Thompson&#x02019;s stems from 9% to 1% from 2005 to 2009 with an increasing number of unipolar modular prostheses being implanted.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The 2011 annual report from the Australian National Joint Registry found that the use of the Thompson&#x02019;s prosthesis had increased in 2010 (30.6% of all monoblocks, up from 20.9% in 2003), however the number of monoblock stems was declining compared with monoblock modular and bipolar implants.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The Exeter stem is a well proven design and is consistent with current NICE guidance.

They will undergo surgery on the next available trauma operating list. All patients with a fracture of the hip are in pain and have received opiate analgesia. It is therefore understandable that patients find the initial period of their treatment in hospital confusing and disorientating. Similarly, patients&#x02019; next of kin, carers and friends are anxious at this time and may have difficulty in weighing the large amounts of information that they are given about the injury and plan for treatment.</p><p>In this emergency situation, the focus is on obtaining consent for surgery (where possible) and informing the patient and any next of kin about immediate clinical care. It is often not possible for the patient/consultee to review trial documentation, weigh the information and communicate an informed decision about whether they would wish to participate.</p><p>Conducting research in this &#x02018;emergency setting&#x02019; is regulated by the Mental Capacity Act 2005.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2046-3758.51.2000473" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> As patients are likely to lack capacity as described above, and because of the urgent nature of the treatment limiting access to, and appropriate discussion with Personal Consultees, we will act in accordance with section 32, subsection 9b of the Mental Capacity Act following a process approved by the relevant research ethics committee. Those patients who have surgery on the next available trauma operating theatre will enter the study under presumed consent; we will not obtain consent prior to surgery, but will approach an appropriate consultee. Where a Personal Consultee is available, they will be provided with the study information. The Personal Consultee will be given the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the study, after which their oral agreement will be recorded. Where a Personal Consultee is not available, a Nominated Consultee will be identified to advise the research team. The Nominated Consultee will be the patient&#x02019;s treating Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgeon. If that surgeon is a member of the research team, another independent surgeon will be identified.</p><p>At the first appropriate time when the patient has regained capacity (this will usually be on the first day after surgery) the research associate will provide the patient with the study information. The patient will be given the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the study with their family and carers for as long as they require. They will then be asked to provide written consent for continuation in the study. If the patient does not wish to complete questionnaires for the study at this stage, they will be asked if they are happy to provide written consent for the research team to access and use any routinely collected NHS data, including those collected through the NHFD. Alternatively the patient can choose to decline participation completely. The original signed consent form will be kept in the investigator site file. Three copies of the consent forms will be made; one held in the patient&#x02019;s medical notes, one for the patient and one copy for the study team.</p><p>On occasion, patients may be able to provide consent before their operation; for example those whose surgery has been delayed for clinical reasons. These patients will be approached by the research team before their operation for consent to participate in the study. Some patients, whose surgery has been delayed, may still not have capacity, e.g., those who are acutely confused. In this case, the research team will approach a consultee for agreement that the patient participate in the study.
