Theory-based health education (TBHE) with health belief model (HBM) and duration of PA can be increased to reduce SLS and the prevalence of obesity and overweight.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This research used physical education program (PEP) to interfere in the current status of students and schools to modify the rates of HBM, PA, and body mass index (BMI) of participants. HBM is one of the behavior change theories that has been widely used in public health for understanding health behavior.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] HBM can explain the change in health behavior to be used as a basis for educational interventions.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] HBM is a health-specific social cognition model whose key components and constructs are perceived susceptibility (PSU), perceived severity (PSE), perceived benefits (PBE), perceived barriers (PBA), and self-efficacy (SE).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Behavioural obesity interventions are based on the assumptions that physical activity is the proximal mediator of body weight.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>This type of education increases students&#x02019; awareness of opportunities for increasing PA, expresses methods for removing barriers and negative attitudes about PA, and increases PA.</p><p>The results of this article showed that the application of PEP is useful to increase the scores of the components of HBM, perception of the first junior high school students about PA and work activity (WA), sports activity (SA), leisure activity (LA), and SLS to manage overweight and obesity. Hence, the present study hypothesizes that PEP can be effective in improving the HBM and PA and reducing the overweight and obesity of the students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study was a quasi-experimental, TBHE that took place in educational districts of the city of Urmia. After obtaining ethical clearance (ethical code number 393,847), the researcher entered the selected schools. Based on the sample size formula for <italic>t</italic>-tests, the probability of making Type I error was 0.05, the power of the hypothesis test was 0.8%, Cohen's d effect size was 0.7, and the minimum required sample size in each group was 32. A total of 80 junior high school male students whose age varied between 12 and 14 years old were studied.</p><p>Four high schools were randomly sampled from two districts in Urmia [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], and divided into two experimental high schools (<italic>n</italic> = 40 obese or overweight students) and two control high schools (<italic>n</italic> = 40 obese or overweight students) from the selected high schools participated in this study. The inclusion criteria were BMI &#x02265;25 and/or no limitation on exercising. The students that were used medications for 6 months known to affect body weight before the study and/or the participants who did not intend to continue the study were excluded from the study. The goal, its importance, and benefits of the study were explained to the participants. Students and their parents were told that participants&#x02019; profile will be used anonymously, and hence personal information will be strictly confidential. The participants and their parents were informed of the confidentiality of the information and they consented to participate in the study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design and participant flow in the intervention and control groups of students</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-7-115-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study instruments and variables assessment</title><p>A hybrid questionnaire was prepared by the researcher which includes variables such as father's education, mother's education, father's occupation, mother's occupation, family size, and rates of weight and height to determine BMI.</p><p>Overweight and obesity prevalence was determined by the International Obesity Task Force, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization standard criteria. Weight and Height properties have been determined on the basis of age and gender. Overweight and obesity are defined as follows for children aged between 5&#x02013;19 years: overweight is BMI-for-age greater than 1 standard deviation above the WHO Growth Reference median; and obesity is greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The components of HBM construct and Baecke <italic>et al</italic>. questionnaire for measuring PA habits in epidemiological studies, which in most studies of obesity and PA, have been used.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The PA was divided into three distinct dimensions: WA, SA, and LA. Weight was taken with light clothing with the aid of a weighing Seca 750 scale with the weights measured to the nearest 1 kg, and height was measured using a stadiometer. Then, BMI was calculated from weight (in kg) divided by a square of the height (in meters). Information was collected by a three-part questionnaire. The first part includes demographic data, the second part was a HBM-based questionnaire that included PSU (&#x003b1; = 0.836), PSE (&#x003b1; = 0.737), PBE (&#x003b1; = 0.773), and PBA (&#x003b1; = 0.885), and the third part was the Baecke <italic>et al</italic>. questionnaire that included WA (&#x003b1; = 0.726), SA (&#x003b1; = 0.675), and LA (&#x003b1; = 0.881).

Mauchly's test was used to investigate sphericity, and Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test was used to investigate the normality of the distribution for each quantity variable.

The most effective overweight and obesity reduction strategies for students at schools include prevention through theoretical health education and health promotion.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This finding supports the hypothesis that education based on HBM can be effective in increasing PA and weight loss in participants. Some studies determined educational need to increase the health belief model structures, lead to promoting preventive behaviors about overweight and obesity.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The findings of the present study indicate that the components of HBM (PSU, PSE, PBE, PBA, and SE) scores of the participants to reduce their overweight and obesity by the intervention in the intervention group significantly increased PA while little change in the behavior of the control group was created. These findings are consistent with the results of Masumeh <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Jennifer Robertson-Wilson <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Robertson-Wilson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Due to the prevalence of overweight and its complications, increasing rates of HBM is important. Thus, activities that encourage students to increase their PA causes to reduce overweight. The results of this study are consistent with the results of the TBHE programs based on HBM interventions which are focused on the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity that are appropriate to achieve the objectives of increasing rates of the HBM about PA. There was a significant difference between the mean scores in the intervention group compared with the control group about PA, and the interaction between the time trends is significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The increase in the performance of the participants in this study is also consistent with the findings of Jafari-Adli <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Tell

Considering that today's students would be the adults of the future, and given the low cost of prevention of obesity and overweight in comparison with the high cost of treatment, it is essential that educational efforts at the country level based on HBM implemented for all student groups.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was part of a PhD thesis
