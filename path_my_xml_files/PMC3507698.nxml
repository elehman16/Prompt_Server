The mechanism of action, however, has not always been clarified for every treatment form. Some treatments such as enzymatic chemonucleolysis have been abandoned due to their side effects <xref rid="pone.0050211-Nordby1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the mid-1980s various forms of laser disc decompression (PLDD) were established <xref rid="pone.0050211-Ascher1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The clinical results reported later were in part positive <xref rid="pone.0050211-Choy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and, unlike chemonucleolysis, PLDD was reported to have an extremely low complication rate <xref rid="pone.0050211-GrahoffH1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Gerges1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In July 2000 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nucleoplasty with coblation for use in the USA <xref rid="pone.0050211-Gerges1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Since then, some studies on the clinical efficacy of this procedure for the lumbar spine have been published <xref rid="pone.0050211-Gerges1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The procedure is safe and has come to be used on the cervical spine as well <xref rid="pone.0050211-Birnbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Chen et al. made individual measurements to experimentally demonstrate a reduction in intradiscal pressure as a potential underlying mechanism <xref rid="pone.0050211-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Various authors have pointed to the histological effects of nucleoplasty <xref rid="pone.0050211-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Based on experiences with other intradiscal procedures, we may assume that volume reduction has an effect on discal decompression as well <xref rid="pone.0050211-Case1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Additionally, only one neighboring disk pair (L3/L4 and L4/L5 for example) per spine was considered. Spines were assigned to either group using the SAS randomization program. Independent value pairs were chosen randomly in order to minimize the potential for systematic bias in the sample (disc disease in one of the pigs for example).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistics and Initial Tests of the Procedure</title><p>For statistical analysis the Wilcoxon test for independent samples (nonparametric) was applied. Also employed was the software SAS 9.1 TS (XP_PRO Windows NT-Server Version, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Calculated differences were considered significant when the probability of error remained below 5% (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>The reproducibility and accuracy of volumetric measurements were evaluated by determining intra- and interrater variability. This was done by repeated measurement of 20 preoperative nuclei pulposi after training of the raters and before the actual study started. In the actual study, the raters were blinded to the group and all other data. Pre- versus postprocedure volume data were matched after completion of the entire experiment. Intra- and interrater variability was determined using Bland-Altman analysis (MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium). Statistical parameters were calculated, and graphic analysis was performed. Analysis of both intrarater and interrater variability showed very good results without major variations. Systematic errors were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Animal for Experiments of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Greifswald. Ethical approval was not required because the pigs were not slaughtered for the purpose of our in vitro experiments. The experiment complied with the German Law on Animal Experiments. The animal parts were obtained from a research slaughterhouse and we obtained permission to use these animal parts from, FBN, Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>During our ex vivo procedure there were no complications. All porcine discs were found to be normal without signs of injury or degeneration. In both postoperative groups we were able to track the channels created by the device. Since the nondegenerated nucleus pulposus is a soft, elastic, gelatinous structure, we did not identify regions with more marked volume reduction within the nucleus.</p><p>The average nucleus volume for all 42 discs examined in our study was 0.994 ml (SD: 0.298 ml).</p><p>The independent group yielded the following results. The initial volumes in the placebo and nucleoplasty groups were 1.003 ml (SD: 0.333 ml) and 0.998 ml (SD: 0.318 ml), respectively; the difference is not statistically significant (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.919) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050211-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The postoperative volumes in the placebo and nucleoplasty groups were 1.078 ml (SD: 0.350 ml) and 0.906 ml (SD: 0.287 ml) respectively; the difference is highly significant (p&#x0003c;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050211-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In the nucleoplasty group, the nucleus pulposus volume (pre- versus post-procedure) showed a significant reduction of 0.087 ml (SD: 0.110 ml) or 7.14% (p&#x0003c;0.0001). In the placebo group, the instruments applied produced a volume increase (pre- versus post-procedure) of 0.075 ml (SD: 0.075 ml) or 8.94% (p&#x0003c;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050211-t001">Table 1</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050211-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Overall, nucleoplasty decreased nucleus volume by 0.162 ml (SD: 0.124 ml) or 16.08% compared with placebo treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050211-t002">Table 2</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050211-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The clinical efficacy has been investigated for many of the intradiscal procedures used for treating symptomatic discs <xref rid="pone.0050211-Kallewaard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Steppan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, for any clinical procedure to be truly accepted, an explanation of its mode of action is required. Moreover, the mechanism of action must be demonstrated in an experimental setting <xref rid="pone.0050211-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. While the mechanism of action for some procedures, chemonucleolysis for example, is well established <xref rid="pone.0050211-Dang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, for others it has not been clearly demonstrated experimentally. Decompression is the desired effect of PLDD. This decompression has been attributed to biophysical factors <xref rid="pone.0050211-Hellinger1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> but also to a reduced intradiscal pressure <xref rid="pone.0050211-Choy2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Choy3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The efficacy of most intradiscal procedures is tied to a particular discal volume, limiting their usefulness in cases of height loss or disc degeneration. Our study used only spines from young pigs, which showed no degenerative changes in the preoperative MRI.</p><p>Yielding good clinical results, Nucleoplasty yields good clinical results and is considered a safe procedure with only a small number of side effects <xref rid="pone.0050211-Kallewaard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Manchikanti1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In order to identify the potential risks of the procedure an elucidation of the underlying mechanism of action is necessary. Lee et al., in an animal experiment using sheep discs in vitro, showed that coblation, upon which nucleoplasty is based, does not produce any damage in the tissue outside of the plasma field that surrounds the electrode <xref rid="pone.0050211-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Chen et al., in their histological study on pig cadavers, also showed that nucleoplasty does not lead to any thermal damage in the surrounding tissue outside of the work field <xref rid="pone.0050211-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Kapural1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It is known, however, that nucleoplasty produces temperatures of more than 45&#x000b0;, the temperature of neurodegeneration <xref rid="pone.0050211-Kapural1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and also that local temperatures of 60 to 65&#x000b0;C, or sometimes even higher, can be reached in the 3&#x02013;4 mm margin surrounding the probe <xref rid="pone.0050211-Nau1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>An experimentally demonstrated correlate of the efficacy of nucleoplasty is the reduction in pressure inside the disc <xref rid="pone.0050211-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Using three human cadavers, the authors showed that the intradiscal pressure reduction, produced by nucleoplasty, is dependent on the degree of degeneration within the disc. Podhajsky et al. used an in vivo animal model to also demonstrate an intradiscal pressure reduction after application of monopolar radiofrequency energy <xref rid="pone.0050211-Podhajsky1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The pressure reduction effects persisted throughout the observation period of this experiment of 28 days. The reduction of nucleus pulposus volume we showed is the cause of the observed pressure effects. To our knowledge such quantitative lower lumbar volume effects have not been published before.</p><p>Coblation, induced by applying high-voltage bipolar radiofrequency current, can generate a plasma field, in which highly ionized particles, with enough energy to vaporize tissue, are generated <xref rid="pone.0050211-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Coblation has been applied in different conditions, such as tonsillectomy and chondroplasty, in which tissue degradation is indicated <xref rid="pone.0050211-Timms1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Yetkinler1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Using 19 human cadavers, Kleinstueck et al. described the effects of coblation on the stiffness and degree of movement in the segments treated <xref rid="pone.0050211-Kleinstueck1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Chen et al. described the volume-reducing effects of nucleoplasty qualitatively, based on a microscopic analysis of histological specimens <xref rid="pone.0050211-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050211-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The authors provide no quantitative data on the extent of ablation.</p><p>In our study we were able to show experimentally that, in a placebo-controlled setting, nucleoplasty reduces the initial volume of nucleus pulposus by a statistically highly significant degree. Our explanation for the volume increase in the placebo group is that the spine wand applied there pushed the nucleus aside. <xref rid="pone.0050211-Kasch1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> In the nucleoplasty group, on the other hand, the suppressed volume was reduced with the coblation current.</p><p>The average nucleoplasty-induced volume reduction (pre- versus post-procedure) in our animal experimental study was 0.087 ml (SD: 0.110 ml) or 7.14%. In a human disc a volume reduction of approx. 1 ml corresponds to a reduction of approx. 10 to 20% <xref rid="pone.0050211-Case1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. When considering the average total size, 0.994 ml, of the nuclei examined here, the reduction in volume produced by nucleoplasty is of a magnitude that can be therapeutically effective in treating herniated discs.</p><p>This ex vivo study clearly demonstrates that there is a volume reduction after nucleoplasty; however, it is not clear how this will change over time. This can only be investigated in an in vivo study.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, it was shown that nucleoplasty causes a volume reduction of the nucleus pulposus, suggesting volume reduction as a potential mechanism by which this procedure brings about clinically effective decompression. Our data demonstrate the volume-reducing effect of coblation in nucleoplasty. While this effect was demonstrated in an ex vivo experimental setting and remains to be verified in patients, it points to the potential benefit likely to be achieved in a clinical setting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Ralf Pfuhl from the Leibnitz Institute for Farm Animal Biology, Dummerstorf, Germany, for providing the specimens; ArthroCare Deutschland, Reimscheid, Germany for the technical equipment needed for nucleoplasty; and Mr. Stefan Hadlich from the Institute of Diagnostic Radiology and Neuroradiology at the University of Greifswald, Germany for his technical assistance in performing MR imaging.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0050211-Kallewaard1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
