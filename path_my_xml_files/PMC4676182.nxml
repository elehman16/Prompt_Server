Prevalence and severity of LUTS increase with age and the progressive increase in the aged population group has emphasised the importance to our society of appropriate and effective management of male LUTS. Identification of causal mechanisms is needed to optimise treatment and uroflowmetry is the simplest non-invasive test of voiding function. Invasive urodynamics can evaluate storage function and voiding function; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to support urodynamics becoming part of routine practice in the clinical evaluation of male LUTS.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A 2-arm trial, set in urology departments of at least 26 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK), randomising men with bothersome LUTS for whom surgeons would consider offering surgery, between a care pathway based on urodynamic tests with invasive multichannel cystometry and a care pathway based on non-invasive routine tests. The aim of the trial is to determine whether a care pathway not including invasive urodynamics is no worse for men in terms of symptom outcome than one in which it is included, at 18 months after randomisation. This primary clinical outcome will be measured with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). We will also establish whether inclusion of invasive urodynamics reduces rates of bladder outlet surgery as a main secondary outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The general population has an increased life-expectancy and, as men get older, their prostates enlarge and potentially cause benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) which often requires surgery. Furthermore, voiding symptoms become increasingly prevalent, some of which may not be due to BPO. Therefore, as the population ages, more operations will be considered to relieve BPO, some of which may not actually be appropriate. Hence, there is sustained interest in the diagnostic pathway and this trial could improve the chances of an accurate diagnosis and reduce overall numbers of surgical interventions for BPO in the NHS. The morbidity, and therapy costs, of testing must be weighed against the cost saving of surgery reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Controlled-trials.com - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN56164274">ISRCTN56164274</ext-link> (confirmed registration: 8 April 2014).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-1087-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>UPSTREAM</kwd><kwd>Urodynamics</kwd><kwd>Prostate</kwd><kwd>Surgery</kwd><kwd>Lower urinary tract symptoms</kwd><kwd>Bladder outlet obstruction</kwd><kwd>Benign prostatic obstruction</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000664</institution-id><institution>Health Technology Assessment Programme (GB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The protocol for this study, Urodynamics for Prostate Surgery Trial; Randomised Evaluation of Assessment Methods (UPSTREAM) for diagnosis and management of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in men, describes a major multicentre United Kingdom (UK) trial to establish whether a care pathway not including invasive urodynamics is no worse than one in which it is included in men who are considering further treatment where surgery might be an option for BOO. The study is designed to be as informative as possible, whilst remaining simple and pragmatic, both for those participating and for those involved in clinical care. Research nurses and urologists in each centre will identify and recruit men who are seeking further treatment, which might include surgery, for BOO and collect descriptive information, symptom assessment, flow rates and urinalysis. Those who are eligible will be invited to enter a randomised trial whereby treatment is based on two different diagnostic pathways; either routine information only (the &#x02018;non-urodynamic assessment&#x02019; control group) or routine information supplemented by urodynamic testing. All men will be followed up at 6, 12 and 18 months after randomisation.</p><p>Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) comprise storage symptoms (e.g. increased daytime urinary frequency, nocturia, urgency, incontinence), voiding symptoms (e.g. slow stream, intermittency, hesitancy, straining, dribbling) and post-voiding symptoms (e.g. post-micturition dribble). Ninety percent of men aged 50 to 80 years suffer from at least 1 LUTS, which can affect quality of life, occupation and other activities. Prevalence and severity increase with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and the progressive increase in the aged population group has emphasised the importance to our society of appropriate and effective management of male LUTS.</p><p>Identification of causal mechanisms is needed to optimise treatment. In men with voiding LUTS, benign prostate enlargement (BPE) with ageing causes partial BOO, a situation known as benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). BPO is a major contributor to LUTS. For such patients, prostate surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), has a good chance of improving LUTS. However, voiding LUTS can also be caused by bladder dysfunction: e.g. poor expulsion strength of the bladder muscle. This is called &#x02018;underactive bladder, or &#x02018;detrusor underactivity&#x02019;, as the main bladder muscle anatomically is called the detrusor. In such men, it is hard to justify prostate surgery if BPO is not present, especially in view of potential adverse effects associated with surgery, such as blood transfusion requirement, problems of sexual function, anaesthetic problems or incontinence.</p><p>Tests of lower urinary tract function are used in clinical practice to demonstrate the causes of voiding or storage problems. Symptom scores are recorded and a physical examination is performed followed by urinalysis. Uroflowmetry is the simplest non-invasive test of voiding function. It entails voiding into a recording device that measures the volume of urine passed and the rate of urine flow, with an ultrasound scan after voiding to see how efficiently the bladder has emptied. In addition, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on management of LUTS in men (CG97) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], states that invasive urodynamics may be used when invasive treatment is being considered, or for equivocal or more complex cases. Invasive urodynamics, which is also called multichannel cystometry, employs bladder catheterisation for both bladder filling and bladder pressure measurement, and rectal catheterisation for measurement of abdominal pressure. Concurrent subtraction of abdominal from bladder pressure by a computer calculates &#x02018;detrusor pressure&#x02019;, to demonstrate whether bladder contraction is occurring. Thus, invasive urodynamics can evaluate storage function (while the bladder is being filled) and voiding function (when the man passes urine). Observing high detrusor pressure associated with only a low urine flow rate is diagnostic of BOO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Low detrusor pressure with low flow implies that bladder contractility is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Without invasive urodynamics, it is uncertain for any given individual whether the bladder outlet is obstructed, and whether the bladder is overactive during storage or underactive during voiding.</p><p>Other diagnostic methods have been evaluated and reported with up to level-3 evidence. These include: penile cuff test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; urethral reflectography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; ultrasound measurement of bladder wall thickness and weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; intravesical prostatic protrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; resistive index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; and prostatic urethral angle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant any of these tests becoming standard practice in the clinical evaluation of male LUTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme</title><p>Despite the implicit merit of confirming that BOO is present before proceeding to surgery to relieve BOO, the lack of relevant research evidence means that many centres omit the test from the usual care diagnostic pathway. Invasive testing is perceived as unpleasant and service delivery has cost implications. NICE CG97 indicates that performing an invasive procedure is a balance of the possible benefits versus the possible risks, and that these must be explained to the patient during informed consent for the procedure, and appropriate advice given regarding potential adverse events.</p><p>The HTA addressed this with a commissioning brief asking the research question: In men considering surgery for bothersome LUTS, is diagnostic categorisation using results of invasive multichannel urodynamics worthwhile from the perspective of the men concerned and the National Health Service (NHS) compared to not using multichannel urodynamics?</p><p>This research was commissioned by the NIHR-HTA following prioritisation of research questions posed by the NICE Guideline Development Group for male LUTS, which indicated that research into the role of invasive urodynamics would clarify whether it could improve the outcome of surgery, and whether it should be recommended or not in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. They considered that improving the chance of an accurate diagnosis and identifying potential complications was the most important outcome when considering surgical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Population</title><p>Forty-four thousand new cases of symptomatic BPO are diagnosed each year. Since BPO is a disease of older men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the number of patients affected is likely to increase by almost 50 % by the year 2025, in line with population ageing.</p><p>Disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures are significantly worse in men with higher symptom severity ratings in population-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Severe LUTS may require surgical treatment, and 25,000 surgical procedures to relieve BPO are currently performed each year in the NHS. The most widely-used approach is TURP using monopolar or bipolar electrodes, or less commonly laser ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale for current study</title><p>The NICE clinical guideline group on male LUTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] was unable to identify any methodologically high-quality clinical or economic studies. The literature has been reviewed by Parsons and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and by various professional groups in the last decade: most recently the Cochrane Database Systematic Review, Invasive urodynamic studies (UDS) for the management of LUTS in men with voiding dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. None of these reviews was able to identify high-level evidence on the use of invasive urodynamic testing in male LUTS.</p><p>We reviewed evidence for the diagnostic role of invasive urodynamics in men with LUTS prior to surgery for BPO. We identified no published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with data comparing the standard practice investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (urine flow rate measurement (maximum urinary flow rate (Q<sub>max</sub>)) and ultrasound estimate of post-void residual urine (PVR)), with invasive urodynamics. One abstract did not have any useable data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Level-3 evidence exists to suggest that patient selection after invasive urodynamics maximises the outcome benefits to patients from surgery to relieve BPO, over and above that given by the standard investigations of Q<sub>max</sub> and PVR. The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend that the greater diagnostic benefits of invasive urodynamics over Q<sub>max</sub>/PVR are discussed with patients prior to the decision for prostate surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>From NHS reference costs data, 98,986 UDS were undertaken on men and women by 131 NHS Trusts in England in 2011&#x02013;2012 at a tariff cost of &#x000a3;16.7 million; no information for use of invasive urodynamics specifically in men is available.</p><p>NHS Health Episode Statistics show that approximately 25,000 TURPs are performed annually. For 100 procedures, the specific equipment and consumables cost of TURP is approximately &#x000a3;29,000. TURP has a median hospital stay of 2 days. Significant risks may be associated: reported mortality is up to 0.25 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and morbidities can include blood loss, erectile dysfunction or incontinence, resulting in considerable distress to patients. Late complications (urethral stricture and bladder neck contracture) are reported in up to 9.8 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additional NHS costs result from delayed discharge from hospital, re-admissions and increased primary care utilisation. These unwanted consequences will increase in the future, as surgery for BPO increases in line with the ageing male population, and because most operations are conducted on older men (in 2010&#x02013;11, 41 % of TURP operations were for men of 75 years or more in age). Thus, reduction in the number of surgical procedures offers direct cost savings, reduced resource use and supports the possibility of reconfigurations of surgical services. As the population ages, more operations will be considered to relieve BPO, some of which may not actually be appropriate. As a result, there is sustained interest in the diagnostic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Expressed need</title><p>The clinical benefit of invasive urodynamics is in ensuring that surgery to relieve outlet obstruction is used only in men who actually have BPO. Thus, the NICE clinical guideline on Male LUTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] recommended the following research question: What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of multichannel cystometry (invasive urodynamics) in improving patient-related outcomes in men considering bladder outlet surgery? They stated that this research would clarify whether invasive urodynamics could improve the outcome of surgery, by identifying which patients have BPO. In addition, level-4 evidence indicates that men are unlikely to proceed to TURP if they are shown not to have BPO. Thus, invasive urodynamics has the potential to reduce overall numbers of surgical interventions for BPO in the NHS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study aims and objectives</title><p>In men with bothersome LUTS, we hypothesise that diagnostic categorisation of BOO using invasive urodynamics improves patient selection for obstruction-relieving prostate surgery compared to a pathway with no invasive urodynamic testing. Consequently, this will make it less likely that the subgroup of men with LUTS who do not have BOO will elect to undergo surgery, thereby reducing risk of harm from surgery and potentially worse symptom outcomes.</p><p>The aim of the UPSTREAM trial is to determine whether a care pathway not including invasive urodynamics is no worse for men in terms of symptom outcome than one in which it is included, at 18 months after randomisation. This primary clinical outcome will be measured with the widely-used patient reported outcome, the IPSS at 18 months postrandomisation. We will also establish whether inclusion of invasive urodynamics reduces rates of bladder outlet surgery as a main secondary outcome.</p><p>The objectives are to answer the following questions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Does invasive urodynamics deliver similar or better symptomatic outcomes for LUTS measured by IPSS at 18 months after randomisation?</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Does invasive urodynamics influence surgical decision-making, as reflected in differing surgery rates in the two diagnostic pathways?</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; What is the cost effectiveness of the 2 diagnostic pathways, by calculating the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained at 18 months post randomisation?</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; What are the relative harms of invasive urodynamic tests, and surgical and conservative management?</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; What subsequent NHS services are required (including repeat surgery or catheterisation for acute urinary retention) for men in each arm?</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; What are the differential effects on other outcomes, such as quality of life and general health?</p></list-item></list></p><p>A qualitative component has been embedded within the trial to establish patient-perceived importance of different outcomes, explore patients&#x02019; and surgeons&#x02019; perspectives on experiences of procedures and acceptable inferiority margins (the minimum difference at which surgeons would perceive there is a difference between pathways), and determine reasons for failure resulting in crossover to alternative treatment.

The treatment decision is between the urologist and the patient and there are no treatment &#x02018;requirements&#x02019; imposed by the UPSTREAM study. We aim to capture urologist and patient opinions about treatment decisions in the relevant case report form(s) (CRF). As a pragmatic trial, standard practice for the centres will be followed, relating to type of surgery (providing it is a NICE-approved surgical procedure, e.g. monopolar or bipolar TURP, or laser), whether to stay on LUTS medications, antibiotic prophylaxis and other factors. Type of surgery will be recorded. All conservative and surgical management plans and actual treatment received will be documented. As this is a pragmatic study, surgeons may feel it necessary in some cases to conduct additional tests outside of the participant&#x02019;s allocated intervention group. Centres are asked to record, in the baseline CRF, whether the participant received the diagnostic assessments that they were randomly allocated to, and provide reason(s) if assessment was different to that allocated.

Hospital staff should complete trial-specific screening logs for all potentially eligible men and provide confirmation of the patient&#x02019;s outcome for the study; this will be one of three: 1) patient confirmed as ineligible; 2) patient was eligible but declined to take part; and 3) patient was eligible and consented to take part. These will be reviewed by the UPSTREAM Office Team (BRTC) on a monthly basis.</p><p>Due to variation in patient pathways in each hospital, these arrangements should be individualised according to local circumstances in each site. Those patients identified from referral letters will be sent a Patient Information Sheet (PIS), Assessment Information Sheet (AIS) and covering letter. Alternatively, the research nurse will describe the study to the patients at their clinical appointment and, if interest is expressed, provide further details of the study by means of the PIS and AIS. An approved study-specific poster can also be displayed in suitable clinic rooms, which provides the contact details of trial-related staff that interested men can contact for further information.</p><p><italic>If the patient agrees to the study</italic>, they will be given a chance to ask questions and should ideally have at least 24 hours to think about taking part before being consented and randomised. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients who agree to take part in the study. The PIS and the consent form will refer to the possibility of long-term follow-up and being contacted about other research if the man is willing. If the patient is happy to take part in the study without having been given PIS and study details over the previous 24 hours, and requests to provide written consent and complete baseline questionnaires at that time (i.e. to avoid having to return to the hospital for an additional appointment) this is possible. In such cases we suggest that the research centre completes written consent and baseline questionnaires, there and then, but does not randomise the patient until at least 24 hours have passed. After at least 24 hours, the centre should contact the patient by telephone to confirm whether they are still willing to proceed with the study, and if so, the centre can proceed with randomisation and inform the patient of his intervention allocation via the telephone. If the patient has changed his mind, however, and no longer wishes to be randomised, the research centre should complete the &#x02018;UPSTREAM Change of Permissions/Withdrawal Form&#x02019; accordingly, and follow essential reporting procedures specified on the form. For clarity, a copy of the consent form and completed Change of Permissions/Withdrawal Form should be kept at site, as well as forwarded to the UPSTREAM Office Team for records. All other data collected for such a patient, however, such as baseline questionnaires, should be suitably discarded by the research site; the trial has no need to retain this information as the patient has decided not to enrol (be randomised) into the trial. For men who are randomised, the research centre should also record that the patient opted for this consent and randomisation approach in their medical notes, and in the UPSTREAM Baseline CRF (Comments section). This alternative consent and randomisation process helps the patient to avoid returning the hospital simply for the purpose of the trial.</p><p><italic>Men who are not willing to be randomised, but who would otherwise be eligible</italic>, will be asked to consent to being contacted for qualitative research to explore reasons for non-participation.</p><p><italic>All men who enter the study</italic> will be logged with the central trial office and given a unique six-digit study (participant) identification number, and randomised.

Participants are informed in the PIS that they have the right to withdraw all personal data held by the study.

We do not feel it is necessary or ethical to perform sham catheterisation to conceal the nature of testing. Furthermore, knowledge of the results of urodynamic testing underpins the urologist&#x02019;s ability to make a management decision, in conjunction with his patient, so neither the man nor his urologist can be blinded to the intervention or its findings. However, outcome assessment is largely by participant self-completed questionnaire, so avoiding interviewer bias.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Methods to protect against bias</title><sec id="Sec32"><title>Urodynamic techniques</title><p>We will centrally monitor deviations from agreed protocols and review&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10 % traces from each research centre.

We will take very active measures to minimise loss of men from the study in line with Research Ethics Committee approval, such as reminder letters, phoning/texting/ emailing the men, obtaining back-up &#x02018;best contact&#x02019; addresses, using non-contingent retention incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and checks with their GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Purposive sampling will ensure that adequate numbers of interviews will be conducted with men from each of the possible randomised groups according to treatment allocation. Firstly, participants will be interviewed 1 week after a decision has been made regarding treatment. These interviews will consider and compare their views and experiences of the trial, explore participants&#x02019; experiences of LUTS, understanding and knowledge of BOO, views and experiences of invasive urodynamic testing, decision-making regarding surgery and information and support needs.</p><p>A second interview will be conducted with a second group of participants 18 months after randomisation (after treatment has been completed) to additionally explore views and experiences of treatment and recovery.</p><p>Telephone interviews will be conducted with a sample of men who withdrew from the trial. In addition, telephone interviews will be conducted with those who declined to be randomised in the trial. Health care professionals will also be interviewed at the end of the trial to gather data on their views and experiences of assessment with and without urodynamics, information and support needs and their attitudes to its future implementation.</p><p>Health care professionals (e.g. urologists, urodynamics technicians, nurses, etc.) involved in the trial will be purposively sampled in relation to (i) the trial site and (ii) length of time since qualification.</p><p>The sample sizes will be determined by the need to achieve data saturation, such that no new themes are emerging from the data by the end of data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

This is because the likely reduction in surgery rates in the former group due to more accurate diagnosis should not disadvantage them in terms of clinical improvement. We therefore calculated our sample size based on both the primary outcome and surgery rates: non-inferiority of symptoms at 18 months after randomisation; and a reduction in surgery rates in the intervention arm.</p><p>In Bristol, audit data for 5670 men presenting with LUTS suggestive of poor or obstructed urine flow show that 73 % to 83 % would have surgery. If an invasive urodynamics test was conducted on the same men, the data indicate that surgery would only be carried out in 60 %, based on the prevalence of impaired bladder contractility contraindicating surgery. Using the more conservative difference we expect the intervention to reduce surgery from 73 % in non-urodynamic assessment to 60 % in the intervention arm.</p><p>Symptom scores will potentially improve for those men in both arms who undergo appropriate surgery. Symptomatic outcome of surgery is confounded by a number of factors for which we cannot control. These include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Long-standing BPO might impair bladder contractility, reducing the symptom benefit of surgery</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; BPO-relieving surgery increases the calibre of the outlet channel regardless of whether BPO is present, and this might improve urinary stream in men who technically did not have BPO</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; A &#x02018;placebo effect&#x02019; is known to arise both from clinical contact and from the surgical procedure</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Whilst voiding LUTS (obstruction) typically improves after surgery, this advantage will be offset in some men due to deterioration in storage LUTS (e.g. incontinence, overactive bladder)</p></list-item></list></p><p>We therefore anticipate the overall IPSS at 18 months in both arms might be similar despite group differences in surgery rates.</p><p>However, to ensure that the men in the urodynamic arm are not disadvantaged by the reduction in surgery rates, we need to ensure that the primary outcome, symptom score, has adequate power to rule out non-inferiority. Therefore, assuming no difference between the groups, a trial of 310 men per arm will give 80 % power to rule out a non-inferiority margin of 1 point below the mean IPSS in the non-urodynamic arm, using a 1-sided <italic>t</italic> test (common standard deviation [SD] of 5) at the 5 % significance level. We have chosen 1 point on the IPSS as it is a conservative estimate of the level at which we would assume non-inferiority, since a change of 2 points is associated with a change in global impression in urinary condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>Loss to follow-up in our previous trial of conservative treatment for men with urinary incontinence after prostate surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] was 5 to 10 % at 1 year. However, a more conservative estimate of just over 20 % loss to follow-up has been used in the sample size calculations. Therefore, sample size will be 388 per arm to take into account 20 % loss to follow-up. Our recruitment target will be 400 per arm with the aim of achieving no less than 388 per arm at 18 months follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec60"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Baseline characteristics will be examined at baseline to ensure randomisation has provided the two pathways with patients that are comparable on equal terms. Any differences in excess of 0.5 SDs or 10 % or more will be controlled for in sensitivity analyses to ensure that the imbalance does not affect the overall result. If it does then both the adjusted and unadjusted results will be quoted in future reports and papers.</p><p>The analysis and reporting of the UPSTREAM trial will be in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] guidelines. All analyses will be on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis where men are assessed in the groups to which they were assigned at randomisation. For all analyses carried out, effects estimates will be presented along with confidence intervals and <italic>p</italic> values. All outcomes will be described and compared with the appropriate descriptive statistics where relevant: mean and SD for continuous and count outcomes, medians and inter-quartile range if required for skewed data and numbers and percentages for dichotomous and categorical outcomes (e.g, subjective recurrence of incontinence).</p></sec><sec id="Sec61"><title>Analysis of the primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome will be the IPSS score at 18 months post randomisation. This outcome is on a continuous scale and consists of 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms with a 6- point Likert scale response from 0&#x02013;5; therefore, with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 35. The difference between the scores for the two pathways will be evaluated using linear regression, adjusting for centre and IPSS score at baseline. To assess non-inferiority of IPSS the post-treatment difference at 18 months between the 2 arms will be used with a non-inferiority margin of 1.0. Between-centre effects will be examined and a mixed model approach with treatment group as a fixed factor and investigational site as a random effect will be considered.</p><p>The primary analysis will be based on the observed data supported by a sensitivity analysis where all missing data will be imputed at baseline using appropriate imputation methods and a range of assumptions. A sensitivity analysis will also be conducted to assess the treatment effect for those who fully comply with the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec62"><title>Analysis of secondary outcomes</title><p>All secondary outcomes listed in the &#x02018;outcomes&#x02019; section will be analysed using appropriate regression models, adjusting for centre and the baseline measure of the outcome (where possible). The main secondary outcome for this trial is the uptake of surgery in each pathway; this will be analysed using logistic regression. Other symptom scores such as the ICIQ-MLUTS, which is potentially more sensitive but less widely recognised, will be evaluated in a similar way to the IPSS primary outcome; adjusting for centre and baseline scores. Missing items on the health-related outcome measures will be treated as per the instructions for that particular measure and imputed if necessary. Acute urinary retention as a possible complication will also be examined as secondary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec63"><title>Planned further analyses</title><p>The effects of urodynamics may be more pronounced in groups of patients with certain characteristics. Subgroup analyses will, therefore, be carried out to assess the difference in treatment effect for pre-specified factors. These subgroup analyses will be carried out on the primary analysis (IPSS score) and main secondary outcome (surgery rate). Formal tests of interaction between the dichotomised variables and treatment pathway will be carried out to test whether treatment effect differs between the different subgroups of patients.</p><p>Of note, subgroup analysis will be carried out for men presenting with more and less substantial storage LUTS (urgency, increased frequency and nocturia), based on the IPSS storage subscore and/or the ICIQ MLUTS storage score.</p><p>Subgroup analysis will be undertaken for the differing clinical diagnoses reached at the &#x02018;Clinical Decision&#x02019; stage; all of the factors below are on a Yes/No basis:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Voiding dysfunction due to BOO, with or without reduced bladder contractility</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Voiding dysfunction due to reduced bladder contractility, with or without BOO</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Storage dysfunction (overactive bladder syndrome/detrusor overactivity)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Storage dysfunction (nocturia)</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec64"><title>Proposed frequency of analyses</title><p>Men will be followed up at 6 months (by post), 12 months (post), and 18 months (clinic), after randomisation. Men undergoing surgery will also attend clinic for flow rate testing 4 months after operation. They will be asked to consent to longer term follow-up although this is not funded. The main analysis will be performed when all 18-month follow-ups have been completed. An independent Data Monitoring Committee will review confidential interim analyses of accumulating data at its discretion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec65"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>The trial will include a formal economic evaluation comparing the costs and cost-effectiveness of the interventions from the perspectives of the NHS, personal social services and patients. The cost of the interventions and the use of primary and secondary NHS services by the men, personal and social service costs, costs to the men arising from their treatment (e.g. over-the-counter medication) will be estimated through the collection of resource&#x000a0;use data as outlined earlier and the valuation of these data.</p><p>NHS tariffs will be used to quantify the resource use information contained in the CRFs. All other resource use will be valued using routine sources and information from the patients themselves.</p><p>Differences in costs between the arms from each of the three perspectives will be evaluated using regression techniques adjusting for pre-specified baseline characteristics, randomisation variables and a centre effect. The same model specification will be used to evaluate the differences in QALYs.</p><p>For each of the three perspectives the difference in costs and in effectiveness in terms of surgery rates and IPSS scores will be examined. If neither arm is dominant: i.e. both cheaper and more effective, then incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated in relation to surgery rates and IPSS scores. The differences in costs and QALYs will be examined using the net benefit framework over a range of values for the QALY. This will facilitate the use of regression modelling to adjust for pre-specified baseline characteristics, randomisation variables and centre effects.</p><p>Uncertainty for all these analyses will be addressed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and sensitivity analyses. One aspect of uncertainty is likely to be that of missing data. In order to address this, a pre-specified analysis plan will be created in which the plausible assumptions about missing data will be created. These assumptions will then be tested within the sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec66"><title>Internal feasibility phase and recruitment rates</title><p>An internal feasibility phase, intended to verify that recruitment is possible, was first conducted in 4 centres between months 7 and 9 (October&#x02013;December 2014). Delays in centres being ready for the trial and additional work to improve recruitment amongst centres that were ready meant this initial verification window was too narrow. It was estimated that the equivalent of 12 recruitment months (4 centres&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 recruiting months each) should yield 48 participants out of the overall accrual target of 800; however, a more realistic assessment of actual recruitment time meant a revised target of 17 patients, of which we recruited 13. The initial cumulative accrual prediction was based on a relatively simple linear trend assumption without incorporating differential recruitment over time by centres or different recruitment rates within centres. Therefore, at the request of the TSC, we revised the accrual projections based on a more realistic assumption conditioned both on differential recruitment by centres over time and recruitment capacity.</p><p>Subsequently, a further internal feasibility phase was conducted between February and April 2015 with a revised target of 42 participants from 4 centres, with additional reporting to the TSC upon conclusion to gain a realistic assessment of recruitment. Between 1 February and 30 April the 4 centres recruited 58 participants, exceeding the agreed target by 16.</p><p>Strategic findings from the second feasibility phase, and implications for the trial overall, are outlined in the discussion section of this paper (pages 23&#x02013;24).</p></sec><sec id="Sec67"><title>Patient panel &#x02013; contribution of patient and public involvement (PPI)</title><p>An expert panel (patient panel (PP)) of service users will be invited to advise as we proceed through the preparation for, and the main recruitment period of, the study.

If successful, trial results could rationalise the diagnostic process and ensure its acceptability to patients and advocate whether urodynamics should be recommended or not in the future in relation to BOO; a conclusion the NICE Guideline Development Group indicated was pertinent and timely.</p><p>Here, we briefly discuss some of the key challenges we encountered during the first year of this trial, including strategic findings from our internal feasibility assessments, to provide valuable insight for research groups conducting future similar trials.</p><sec id="Sec78"><title>Patient diagnostic care pathways</title><p>The second feasibility phase in particular, clearly showed that hospitals of any type (teaching or district general) receive sufficient inward referrals to expect delivery of projected recruitment. However, what came to light is that care pathways vary between each of the participating hospitals; more so than originally anticipated. All hospitals are structured differently and needed diverse approaches in terms of implementing successful identification of patients and recruitment strategies. Finding out where inward referrals to the urology department are triaged has proved helpful for screening patients, as is finding where medical notes go to after general clinics; this helps to avoid missing potentially eligible patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec79"><title>Involvement of urologists as well as research nurses</title><p>Recruitment rates were enhanced greatly by including urologists (local PIs and research fellows) in the identification of patients rather than relying solely on research nurses. We observed that the more engaged the PI was with the trial, the smoother the initial recruitment phase. This included the PI helping the research nurses the first time they screen notes, regularly screening themselves and generally encouraging the other consultants and nurses and also involving the surrounding clinical care team. Once patients are identified, the large majority of men agree to participate, as the randomisation is between two standard NHS diagnostic pathways, at the end of which the patient chooses his treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec80"><title>Importance of site initiation visits and ongoing communication</title><p>We found that face-to-face site initiation visits, and follow-up visits, were crucial to getting recruitment started in each centre promptly and successfully. Many of the hospital research teams work on various studies simultaneously, so receiving direct training and encouragement helped to get them to keep pushing for UPSTREAM recruitment. Having a urology-trained lead research nurse dedicated solely to UPSTREAM has been invaluable; besides assisting with on-going communication and the monitoring of research centres, the dedicated lead research nurse provides a direct point of contact for nurses especially, to offer trouble-shooting, general support and encouragement.</p><p>Furthermore, sending out a monthly newsletter comparing sites&#x02019; recruitment figures and indicating monthly recruitment targets has also proved to be a useful tool to keep sites&#x02019; focus on recruitment. This created a positive element of competition amongst centres. Useful &#x02018;hints and tips&#x02019; documents on recruitment strategies, and other relevant training materials, have also been well received.</p><p>Using multiple methods of communication (such as newsletters, emails, trial-specific website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], Twitter and telephone calls) has proved essential to cater for a wide variety of preferences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec81"><title>Regular monitoring</title><p>Finally, it has been fundamental to the trial to ensure consistent monitoring of recruitment progress, continued understanding of the trial, and all operating procedures. Problems have been dealt with swiftly as a result and suitable modifications implemented.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec82"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment began in October 2014.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec83"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_1087_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
