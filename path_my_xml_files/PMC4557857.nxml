The effect of physical activity may be partially mediated by concordant weight loss. We studied the effect on serum sex hormones, which are known to be associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, that is attributable to exercise by comparing randomly obtained equivalent weight loss by following a hypocaloric diet only or mainly by exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Overweight, insufficiently active women were randomised to a diet (<italic>N</italic> = 97), mainly exercise (<italic>N</italic> = 98) or control group (<italic>N</italic> = 48). The goal of both interventions was to achieve 5&#x02013;6 kg of weight loss by following a calorie-restricted diet or an intensive exercise programme combined with only a small caloric restriction. Primary outcomes after 16 weeks were serum sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Body fat and lean mass were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both the diet (&#x02212;4.9 kg) and mainly exercise (&#x02212;5.5 kg) groups achieved the target weight loss. Loss of body fat was significantly greater with exercise versus diet (difference &#x02212;1.4 kg, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In the mainly exercise arm, the reduction in free testosterone was statistically significantly greater than that of the diet arm (treatment effect ratio [TER] 0.92, <italic>P</italic> = 0.043), and the results were suggestive of a difference for androstenedione (TER 0.90, <italic>P</italic> = 0.064) and SHBG (TER 1.05, <italic>P</italic> = 0.070). Compared with the control arm, beneficial effects were seen with both interventions, diet and mainly exercise, respectively, on oestradiol (TER 0.86, <italic>P</italic> = 0.025; TER 0.83, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007), free oestradiol (TER 0.80, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002; TER 0.77, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), SHBG (TER 1.14; TER 1.21, both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and free testosterone (TER 0.91, <italic>P</italic> = 0.069; TER = 0.84, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). After adjustment for changes in body fat, intervention effects attenuated or disappeared.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Weight loss with both interventions resulted in favourable effects on serum sex hormones, which have been shown to be associated with a decrease in postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Weight loss induced mainly by exercise additionally resulted in maintenance of lean mass, greater fitness, greater fat loss and a larger effect on (some) sex hormones. The greater fat loss likely explains the observed larger effects on sex hormones.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01511276">NCT01511276</ext-link>.

Together, these factors contribute to approximately 15 % of breast cancer cases that develop after menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More important, these are two of the few known lifestyle-related risk factors, and, therefore, exposure is modifiable. Because the prevalence of both overweight or obesity and physical inactivity in the Western world are increasing, this subject is an important one to consider in devising breast cancer prevention strategies.</p><p>One of the pathways by which these lifestyle factors may influence postmenopausal breast cancer risk is through effects on serum sex hormones (i.e., oestrogens, androgens and the protein sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Observational, prospective studies have consistently shown a higher breast cancer risk of up to twofold in postmenopausal women with endogenous sex hormone levels in the highest versus the lowest quintile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In a previous randomised controlled trial, the Sex Hormones and Physical Exercise (SHAPE) study, we assessed the effect of a 1-year physical activity intervention on serum sex hormones in insufficiently active postmenopausal women. In contrast to observational studies, in which an effect of physical activity is often also observed after adjustment for differences in body mass index (BMI), we did not find an effect of exercise in the SHAPE study. However, in a subgroup of women who lost more than 2 % body fat, larger effects were observed with exercise compared with the control group. These results were supported by two other intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We hypothesised then that weight or fat loss is essential for any beneficial effect of physical activity on sex hormones. But the question remained whether it was purely the weight loss that induced the beneficial effects on sex hormones or whether physical activity itself contributed additionally to the breast cancer risk&#x02013;lowering effects. To answer this question, we designed the SHAPE-2 study, in which we are investigating the effects of an equivalent weight loss obtained by following a hypocaloric diet or mainly with an exercise programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We expect that adding exercise to diet&#x02013;induced weight loss will result in a more favourable body composition (i.e., a decrease in body fat mass and a preservation or increase of lean body mass) and thereby lead to larger decreases in serum sex hormone levels compared with equivalent diet-induced weight loss. Furthermore, we hypothesise that exercise might have an effect on serum hormone levels, independent of the body fat pathway (e.g., via insulin and glucose). This hypothesis is also based on results from observational studies in which adjustments for weight still show beneficial effects of physical activity on future breast cancer risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and study population</title><p>The SHAPE-2 study is a three-armed, randomised controlled trial in which postmenopausal women are allocated to a diet-induced weight loss intervention, to a combined diet- and exercise-induced weight loss intervention or to a control group. The study ran from February 2012 until June 2013 in eight municipalities in the Netherlands. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Details of the study design were reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Women, aged 50&#x02013;69 years were recruited via mass mailings and media publicity. Women who responded were contacted by telephone by a study nurse to assess their eligibility. Eligibility was checked again during a screening visit at which weight and height were measured. Level of physical activity was further evaluated during this screening visit by focusing on sports, means of transportation and leisure time activities.</p><p>Women were eligible if they were postmenopausal (&#x0003e;12 months since last menses), overweight or obese (BMI 25&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and insufficiently active (&#x0003c;2 h/wk of &#x02265;4 metabolic equivalents [MET] activity) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The computer programme contained an automatically generated random sequence with block sizes of 5 (2:2:1 ratio of interventions to control).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention and control group procedures</title><p>Both weight loss intervention programmes, which were aimed at achieving a 5&#x02013;6-kg weight loss, were delivered by physiotherapists and/or dietitians, who also closely monitored body weight by supervised weighing. When participants reached the target weight loss, or after a maximum of 14 weeks, they entered a period of weight maintenance (2&#x02013;6 weeks) wherein diet was adapted to stabilise body weight.</p><p>Steps were taken to increase and monitor compliance throughout the study period. Women filled out 3-day food diaries (in all three study groups), kept an exercise log (only in the mainly exercise group), performed weekly (only in the diet group) or biweekly (only in the mainly exercise group) self-weighing and had frequent contacts with their dietitian or physiotherapist (in the diet and the mainly exercise groups).</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Diet group</title><p>Women in the diet group were prescribed a caloric restriction of 3500 kcal/wk (or 500 kcal/day) as compared with their estimated needs and habitual intake (standardised diet during the run-in period). They were asked to maintain their habitual physical activity levels. Individual contacts with the dietitian included two individual consultations of 30 minutes and telephone consultations every other week for monitoring and motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. During these contacts, diet was assessed by dietary history and/or by checking the food diaries. The diet was adjusted when needed. In addition, five 1-h group sessions (maximum of 12 women/group) were scheduled to provide nutritional education, self-management training and behaviour change techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mainly exercise group</title><p>The mainly exercise group followed an intensive 4 h/wk combined endurance and strength exercise programme. These women also were prescribed a relatively small caloric intake restriction of 1750 kcal/wk (250 kcal/day) to ensure achievement of the 5&#x02013;6-kg weight loss goal within 14 weeks. Because in this group the main focus was on exercise, we refer to this group as the &#x02018;mainly exercise induced weight loss&#x02019; or &#x02018;mainly exercise&#x02019; group for short.</p><p>The exercise programme included two 1-h group sessions of combined strength and endurance training at the physiotherapy centre and two 1-h sessions of moderate to vigorous Nordic walking per week. Nordic Walking is a form of fitness walking enhanced by the addition of walking poles. Compared to regular walking, Nordic walking makes more use of the entire body resulting in significant increases in energy expenditure.</p><p>For a 58-year-old woman, whose weight is 78 kg and height is 1.65 m, corresponding to the average SHAPE-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] participant with a BMI &#x02265;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the prescribed four exercise sessions resulted in an average energy expenditure of approximately 2530 kcal/wk based on corrected MET values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The caloric restriction was 1750 kcal/wk. The total targeted weekly energy deficit from exercise and diet in the mainly exercise group was, therefore, approximately 4280 kcal/wk.</p><p>We chose a combination of aerobic exercise and strength training because strength training leads to preservation of, or even an increase in, muscle mass and bone mineral density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is important in postmenopausal women to improve health and enable an active lifestyle. Furthermore, we expected that strength training would support loss of body fat by increasing the basic metabolic rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Group sessions included 20&#x02013;25 minutes of endurance training, 25 minutes of strength training and 5&#x02013;10-minute warm-ups and cool-downs. Heart rate monitors were worn while exercising. Training intensity was gradually increased during the study: for endurance training, from 60 % to 90 % of the heart rate reserve [HRR]), and for strength training, based on repetition maximum tests. The 1-h Nordic walking sessions were performed at 60&#x02013;65 % of HRR.</p><p>Women were strongly encouraged to join supervised classes given by a Nordic walking instructor. However, for feasibility reasons, women were also allowed to perform these sessions without guidance. Furthermore, women were instructed to increase their energy expenditure in daily activities, for example by taking the bike for shopping and by climbing stairs.</p><p>Participants kept an exercise log that the physiotherapist regularly checked.</p><p>Losing substantial weight just by increasing physical activity levels is difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Other studies have shown that compensatory mechanisms, both physically and mentally, withhold persons from losing weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To ensure substantial weight loss, a dietitian-prescribed caloric restriction of 1750 kcal/wk was added to the exercise programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The targeted total average weekly deficit for the mainly exercise group was larger than that for the diet group (4280 kcal vs 3500 kcal) to compensate for the gain in muscle mass (i.e., body weight) induced by the combined endurance and strength exercise programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Control group</title><p>Women in the control group were asked to maintain a stable weight by continuing to follow the standardised diet and their habitual physical activity patterns. To keep them from starting any attempts to lose weight during the study period, women in the control group were offered an alternative exercise weight loss programme to be started after study completion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>Outcomes were measured at baseline (i.e., before randomisation) and at 16 weeks after baseline. Body weight, height and waist and hip circumferences were measured according to standard procedures by trained study personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Fat and lean mass were assessed by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (Lunar iDXA, Prodigy; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Cardiorespiratory fitness (according to peak oxygen uptake [VO<sub>2peak</sub>]) was measured by having the women perform a maximal cycle exercise test during which respiratory gas analysis was done using a ramp protocol. Physical activity was measured by administering the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing Physical Activity (SQUASH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and objectively during 7 consecutive days by having the women wear a GT3X+ activity monitor (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Serum sex hormone analyses</title><p>Participants were asked not to perform moderate to vigorous physical activity in the 48 h preceding the blood sampling. Serum was collected and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. After trial completion, all samples were sent, frozen, to the laboratory for analyses. Multiple samples from each individual were analysed in the same batch. Oestradiol, oestrone, androstenedione and testosterone levels were determined by liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC-MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in the University Hospital of South Manchester laboratory, Manchester, UK. Free fractions of oestradiol and testosterone were calculated by using the total hormone levels, SHBG and a constant for albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. SHBG was measured by using commercially available double-antibody radioimmunoassay kits (SHBG-03052001, cobas; Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK). The assays were performed in the SHO Velp laboratory, Velp, The Netherlands. Inter- and intra-class coefficients of variation were &#x0003c;10 % for androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], &#x0003c;7 % for oestrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and &#x0003c;2 % for SHBG.

<sup>a</sup>TER represents the overall intervention effect on hormone change (adjusted for baseline), estimated by linear regression analysis. Because the linear regression models were based on log-transformed hormone data, the presented treatment effect is the antilogarithm of the original estimate. Therefore, the TER is a ratio that indicates how many times the level in one group is higher (TER &#x0003e;1) or lower (TER &#x0003c;1) than a reference group. For example, TER intervention vs control of 0.9 indicates that the hormone level in the intervention group is, on average, 10 % lower than in the control group</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>When we compared both intervention groups with the control group, our secondary comparison, we found that all hormone levels had decreased and SHBG had increased (beneficial), except for testosterone in the diet group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Of these changes, statistically significant effects were found for oestradiol (bound and free) and SHBG in both the diet and mainly exercise groups and for free testosterone in the mainly exercise group. Borderline statistically significant changes were found for free testosterone in the diet group versus the control group and for androstenedione in the mainly exercise group versus the control group.</p><p>After adjustment for changes in body fat percentage, the observed intervention effects on (free) oestradiol, oestrone, free testosterone and SHBG were attenuated or disappeared (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

A per-protocol analysis of women adherent to the exercise prescription (n = 168) showed larger intervention effects on all hormones. We defined adherence as &#x0003e;80 % attendance at all exercise classes for the mainly exercise group. For the diet and control groups, adherence was defined as &#x0003c;60 min/wk increase in moderate to vigorous activities (&#x02265;4 MET), based on the SQUASH questionnaire or, if missing, on the ActiGraph activity monitor data.</p><p>The additional effect of exercise on SHBG compared with diet increased to a significant level, whereas the additional effects of androstenedione and free testosterone disappeared (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that, in postmenopausal women, 6&#x02013;7 % weight loss induced mainly by exercise resulted in a more favourable body composition (i.e., larger loss of body fat and preservation of lean mass), better physical fitness and larger effects on free testosterone, as well as suggestive effects for androstenedione and SHBG compared with a similar amount of weight loss induced by following a hypocaloric diet only. The exercise intervention consisted of a combination of endurance and strength training. Furthermore, both weight loss interventions resulted in significant favourable effects on oestradiol, free oestradiol, androstenedione (exercise only), free testosterone and SHBG compared with the control group. After adjustment for changes in body fat, most intervention effects were attenuated or disappeared. These findings support the hypothesis that the greater loss of body fat induced by exercise compared with diet largely mediates the effects of physical activity on sex hormones.</p><p>A modest and sustained body weight reduction of 3&#x02013;5 % has been shown to result in clinically meaningful improvements in health, and the degree of weight loss is directly proportional to health benefits regarding cardiovascular outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Large cohort studies also suggest that modest weigh loss (5&#x02013;10 %) results in breast cancer risk reductions of 25&#x02013;50 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Our results show that a reduction in body fat, more than a decrease in body weight in general, is an important factor in inducing changes in sex hormones. These findings contribute to the body of evidence in this field derived from the previous exercise or weight loss intervention studies in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms connecting physical activity and decreased breast cancer risk. After menopause, fat tissue is the most important source of oestrogens because the enzyme aromatase, present in adipose tissue, converts androgens to oestrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, abdominal fat is associated with higher levels of insulin, inhibiting SHBG production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In our study, both intervention groups experienced a decrease in fat tissue, but more so in the mainly exercise group than in the diet group, despite comparable weight loss. The fat loss induced a decrease in sex steroid hormone levels and an increase in SHBG, resulting in less unbound and biologically active oestradiol and testosterone. Two randomised, low-fat dietary intervention studies demonstrated small weight losses (3&#x02013;6 %), and these trials also showed significant improvements in SHBG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and testosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], but not in oestradiol.</p><p>A study comparable to ours is the Nutrition and Exercise for Women (NEW) trial, a 12-month study of postmenopausal women in the United States in which researchers are investigating the combined and individual effects of a diet and aerobic exercise intervention on sex hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Unlike SHAPE-2, the aim of that trial was not equivalent weight loss, and SHAPE-2 also included resistance training in addition to aerobic exercise. In the NEW trial, the combined exercise and diet group (most comparable to our mainly exercise group) had the largest losses in body weight (&#x02212;9.8 kg) and body fat (&#x02212;6.4 %), whereas diet alone resulted in &#x02212;9.1 kg weight loss and &#x02212;5.0 % fat loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In the exercise-alone group, these figures were &#x02212;2.8 kg and &#x02212;2.1 %, respectively. All three intervention groups showed significant effects on sex hormones compared with the control group. The exercise-only group showed the smallest effects. The diet and the diet with exercise group showed larger changes in sex hormones. Except for the changes in androgens, changes in oestrogens and SHBG in the NEW diet intervention groups were larger than in our study (5&#x02013;10 % difference on average). For example, free oestradiol was reduced 21 % in the NEW diet group versus 18 % in our diet group and by 26 % in the NEW diet with exercise group versus 19 % in our mainly exercise group. These findings are in agreement with their larger losses in fat mass compared with the SHAPE-2 data, indicating a dose&#x02013;response relationship for oestrogens. However, in the NEW trial, none of the differences between the diet group and diet plus exercise group reached statistical significance.</p><p>We found additional effects of exercise compared with diet alone on androgens and SHBG. For oestrogens, we observed small differences (3&#x02013;4 %) that were not statistically significant. Our study was powered to detect a difference of 8 % as a minimum, which could explain the non-significance of these findings. The NEW trial researchers concluded that greater weight loss produced stronger effects on oestrogens and SHBG. The SHAPE-2 trial adds to their conclusion that, more specifically, fat loss produces stronger effects on sex hormones, including androgens.</p><p>Losing weight mainly by exercise instead of by diet alone resulted in a larger loss of fat, the target tissue for relevant biomarkers, and preservation of lean body mass, which is important for prevention of other chronic diseases. It is known that sarcopenia, characterised by a loss of lean mass, often affects elderly persons and is responsible for high morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Exercise can be roughly divided into two types: endurance and strength training. Endurance training is most likely to result in weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, especially strength training is associated with a more favourable body composition regarding total fat and muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, to achieve weight reduction, we recommend a combination of diet with exercise, supporting current recommendations on lifestyle behaviour change to reduce obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, no previous researchers have reported on effects of strength training alone on sex hormones in postmenopausal women. In our study, all women in the mainly exercise group engaged in both types of exercise; thus, we are not able to disentangle separate effects of endurance and strength training.</p><p>Most observational studies show an independent effect of physical activity, after adjusting for body weight, on breast cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Some also have found an independent effect on serum sex hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This may reflect residual confounding because adjustment for weight or BMI does not fully cover the adjustment for fat, the most relevant tissue. Another explanation is that exercise affects other breast cancer risk&#x02013;related mechanisms which are not (fully) fat-dependent, such as insulin sensitivity or the immune system and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The direct impact of our study results on breast cancer risk remains speculative. We used aromatase inhibitor and BMI studies to estimate the clinical impact. Aromatase inhibitors reduce oestradiol by 83&#x02013;89 % in patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], whereas researchers in two randomised trials in healthy high-risk women observed a 53&#x02013;65 % breast cancer risk reduction associated with these drugs during 5 years of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Extrapolating these data to our study, wherein we observed a 13 % decrease in oestradiol, would reveal an 8&#x02013;10 % reduction in breast cancer risk. The observed two-unit reduction in BMI as a starting point would reduce breast cancer risk by approximately 5 % because every five-unit gain in BMI shows a relative risk of 1.13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although these different estimation methods and cohort studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] indicate a 5&#x02013;10 % risk reduction, the direct and long-term impacts of weight loss on breast cancer risk are still unclear, leaving a challenge for future research.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. First, we used a strong design with the unique aim of reaching comparable weight loss between the two intervention groups, which was largely accomplished in both groups. In addition, our study design incorporated a run-in period during which all women were prescribed a standardised diet. Therefore, food components that might potentially influence sex hormones, such as alcohol and dietary fibre, are unlikely to have affected the results. Another strength is the high adherence to the study protocol in all three groups. Adherence of the control group is often challenging in lifestyle-related trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]; therefore, we offered an alternative weight loss programme after trial completion. Finally, we used the LC-MS method, which is the reference standard because it is a highly sensitive technique to measure hormone levels that is less prone to cross-reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>There are also some limitations which we need to acknowledge. Despite the fact that both intervention groups achieved the weight loss target, there was a difference of 0.6 kg in favour of the mainly exercise group. Although this is a clinically small difference, it may have affected the outcomes related to the exercise&#x02013;diet comparison slightly. However, the difference in fat loss we observed to be most influential on sex hormones was much larger between the two groups. Furthermore, as weight loss represents mainly fat loss, additional adjustment for weight change has no added value.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that a modest reduction in body weight (6&#x02013;7 %) either by following a hypocaloric diet or mainly by exercise led to beneficial effects on sex hormones and SHBG. Moreover, this amount of weight loss induced mainly by exercise led to a more favourable body composition (less fat and preservation of lean mass) and free testosterone, androstenedione (lower) and SHBG (higher). Body fat largely mediated the effects of exercise on these hormones, suggesting that fat loss in particular is most important in influencing sex hormone levels which are associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13058_2015_633_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
