Sleep&#x02013;wake cycle disturbance is one of the important symptoms of MDD. The most frequently reported sleep disturbances are nocturnal and early morning awakenings.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In the last 20 years, new antidepressant classes have been introduced in therapy, i.e. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, continuous stimulation of SSRI and SNRI receptors leads to adverse effects such as sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, weight gain, and somnolence. These side effects limit the use of SSRIs and SNRIs in the community.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Agomelatine {<italic>N</italic>-[2-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl) ethyl acetamide]} is an antidepressant that was approved in India by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) on 10<sup>th</sup> September 2012 for the treatment of MDD in adults.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has potent melatonin agonist (MT1 and MT2 receptors) with 5- hydroxytryptamine<sub>2C</sub> (5-HT<sub>2c</sub>) antagonist action.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Antidepressant action is due to increased norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex by 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> antagonism and sleep enhancement is by MT1 and MT2 agonism.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The antidepressant property of agomelatine is also proved in number of animal models of depression[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] with reported advantages over SSRIs, i.e. absence of sexual dysfunction, weight gain, serotonin syndrome, suicidal tendencies, cardiovascular effects, and discontinuation syndrome.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In the Indian population, very few published reports are available regarding the efficacy and safety of agomelatine over SSRIs/SNRIs in depression. Hence, this study was planned with the following objectives: (i) To compare the clinical efficacy of agomelatine with escitalopram in the treatment of MDD; (ii) to compare the efficacy of agomelatine with escitalopram in improving various aspects of sleep in MDD patients; and (iii) to study the adverse drug effects profile of agomelatine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, comparative, open-label, phase IV study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Eligible subjects were of either sex who attended psychiatry outdoor clinic with clinical diagnosis of MDD as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth edition, Text revision (DSM-IV-TR) and fulfilled the criterion of Hamilton Depression Rating Score (HAMD-17) &#x02265;22.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Other inclusion criteria were: (i) Age between 18 and 65 years with normal liver function and (ii) should be newly diagnosed MDD patient, i.e. patient havine first consultation with the psychiatrist for the complaints suggestive of MDD. Exclusion criteria were: (i) Pregnant or nursing women; (ii) patients with high risk of suicidal tendency or previous suicide attempt within 6 months, bipolar disorder, anxiety symptoms such as panic attacks, obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug abuse or dependency, previous depression resistant to antidepressants, and those who had taken treatment with electroconvulsive therapy in the previous 3 months or formal psychotherapy within 1 month; (iii) patients on other antidepressants; and (iv) patients with neurological disorders (dementia, seizures, stroke), obesity with functional impairment, serious or unstable organic disorders (neoplasia, cardiovascular, pulmonary, uncontrolled type 1 or 2 diabetes).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their legally acceptable relative (LAR) as applicable. The trial was registered retrospectively with Clinical Trial Registry India (CTRI/2014/08/004904).</p><p>Eligible patients were randomized using computer-generated randomization method with allocation ratio of 1:1 to receive either agomelatine 25 mg/day or escitalopram 10 mg/day once daily for a period of 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of treatment, doses of both drugs were doubled if inadequate improvement of depressive symptoms was observed. The follow-up period was 24 weeks and total duration of study was 18 months. Subjects had to take one tablet (depending on allocation of drug group) daily in the evening around 8 pm.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The study medications were bought by the department for study purpose. Both study drug and comparator were from same manufacturer. The manufacturing company had no role in study design, data collection, and analysis, or preparation and publication of manuscript.</p><p>The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to the last post-baseline value in Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD<sub>17</sub>) and Leeds sleep evaluation questionnaire scale (LSEQ). The HAMD<sub>17</sub>, a 17-item scale, was used to check the severity of depression and evaluate the depressive symptoms.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The LSEQ comprises 10 points self-rating 100 mm line analog questions concerned with the aspects of sleep and early morning behavior. This visual analog scale consists of 100 mm horizontal line with two extreme states defined at the end of line. The subject responds by placing vertical mark on a line to indicate his present self-evaluation. It contains 10 questions pertaining to four consecutive aspects of sleep: (i) Getting to sleep, (ii) quality of sleep, (iii) awakening from sleep, and iv) behavior following wakefulness.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The response to treatment was assessed by &#x02265;50% decrease in HAMD<sub>17</sub> score and the rate of remitters was defined as those who achieved HAMD<sub>17</sub> total score &#x02264;7 during treatment. The HAMD<sub>17</sub> score &#x0003c;6 was defined as &#x0201c;no depression.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study visits</title><p>HAMD<sub>17</sub> score was assessed at weeks 0 and 2, then every 4 weeks up to week 24.

Hence, it is started from 2 weeks. The safety assessment included the adverse effects reported by the participants and also elicited by the clinician at every visit. Laboratory investigations such as liver function tests [serum glutamic&#x02013;pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic&#x02013;oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and serum bilirubin], kidney function tests (blood urea and serum creatinine), and bodyweight were done at baseline, 10<sup>th</sup> week, and 24<sup>th</sup> week.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was based on changes in primary outcome variable, i.e. changes in baseline to post-baseline value in HAMD<sub>17</sub> score.

A total of 32 patients per treatment group allowed the detection of a group difference of 2 points with 80% power for a standard deviation of 2.8 points.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, by considering 10% dropout, the study was planned on 35 patients in each treatment group. Sample size was calculated using PS: Power and Sample Size Calculation version 3.1.2, 2014 by William D. Dupont and Walton D. Plummer.</p><p>Efficacy analysis was done by intention-to-treat analysis, i.e. patients who had baseline and at least one post-baseline data of HAMD<sub>17</sub> and LSEQ were included. The last observation carry forward strategy was applied for substituting missing data. For safety analysis, all randomized patients who had received at least one dose of the study medications were considered evaluable. Continuous variables were compared within group by paired <italic>t</italic>-test and between groups by unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test. Non-parametric variables were compared between groups by Mann&#x02013;Whitney test and within-group comparison was performed by Friedman analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by <italic>post-hoc</italic> Dunn's multiple comparison test.

Twenty-five (78.12%) patients in escitalopram group and 18 (56.25%) patients in agomelatine group fulfilled the criterion of &#x0201c;no depression,&#x0201d; i.e. HAMD<sub>17</sub> score below 6.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, mean HAMD<sub>17</sub> score of escitalopram was less than agomelatine, which signifies that the efficacy of escitalopram was better than that of agomelatine in controlling MDD symptoms at the end of 24<sup>th</sup> week (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). This is contradictory to the study findings of Corruble <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Quera-Salva <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Moreover, escitalopram showed faster onset of response and remission compared to agomelatine. We could not find any relevant study comparing the onset of action between these drugs in terms of response or remission. The probable reason for this difference between the response and remission as effected by the two drugs may be attributed to their respective mechanism of action in relieving depression. Escitalopram causes the antidepressant effect through serotonin transporter (SERT) blocking action and also by functional desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptor on chronic administration in dorsal raphe nuclei.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Thus, together produces therapeutic effect by increasing the serotonin level in synapse which elevates the mood and causes reversal of MDD. The antidepressant effect of agomelatine is due to inhibition of 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor that leads to rise in noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the synapse, rather than serotonin.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] As there is no report available on the kinetics of the two receptor actions (5-HT1A, SERT for escitalopram and 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> for agomelatine), it may be possible that the serotonergic mechanism used by escitalopram has faster kinetics compared to the noradrenaline and dopamine mechanism utilized by agomelatine for its antidepressant action. However, further studies are required to reveal the truth.</p><p>In this study, agomelatine showed better improvement in sleep aspects than escitalopram with respect to their mechanisms. Agomelatine has melatonergic action (MT1 and MT2 receptor agonist).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These receptors are located in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) which is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm of the body. As circadian rhythm disruption is involved in the pathophysiology of depression, patients may have delayed sleep, shortened latency to the first episode of rapid eye movement sleep, fragmented sleep, and early wakening.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Thus, due to melatonergic action, agomelatine helps in restoration of disturbed circadian rhythm and improves the quality of sleep.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Escitalopram is less efficacious in improving sleep aspects, which may be due to lack of melatonergic mechanism. This observation is in line with Quera-Salva <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Martinotti <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Kasper <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Lemoine <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In our study, clinically significant elevation in SGPT and SGOT values, i.e. above the upper limit of normal range, was observed only in agomelatine group at the end of 24<sup>th</sup> week. These are in consensus with the report of Hale <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but not with that of Martinotti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The values regarding kidney functions and weight were within normal range in both groups at the end of study. However, no study is available which monitored blood urea and serum creatinine level in patients treated with agomelatine. Moreover, in case of weight measurement, three studies (Quera-Salva <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hale <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Lemoine <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) are in agreement with our study results. Headache and drowsiness due to both drugs were well tolerated in the present study. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two drugs in relation to these adverse effects.
