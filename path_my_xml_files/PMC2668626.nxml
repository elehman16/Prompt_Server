The infection is transmitted through the bites of blackflies (<italic>Simulium</italic> spp.) carrying infective third-stage larvae, which have developed in the vector from microfilariae (mf) acquired from other humans during a preceding blood meal. The female adult worms measure up to 60&#x000a0;cm in length and have an average life expectancy of 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], producing millions of mf. The mf migrate to the skin, causing dermatitis and atrophy, or to the eye, where they cause inflammation leading to reduced vision and blindness. Apart from blindness, dermatitis has been identified as a separate factor that significantly reduces the lifespan of infected people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For many years, onchocerciasis was thought to have affected 17 million people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since more attention has recently been paid to remote areas in Central African countries, the estimated number of infections has risen to more than 37 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>There has been a longstanding effort to reduce the burden imposed by onchocerciasis using vector control and mass treatment. Efforts were made to improve the dosage scheme of ivermectin (IVM), either to include albendazole, or to develop new drugs such as amocarzine. Current elimination programmes are based on mass administration of the antifilarial drug IVM. The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) relies on a strategy of annual mass treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, IVM is mainly a microfilaricidal and temporarily sterilising drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which has to be given for many years until all adult worms are sterile or dead. Some studies indicate that after several rounds of IVM treatment, female worms are no longer inseminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. But insemination and fertility of worms did resume after interruption of IVM administration before all worms had died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Macrofilaricidal activity of IVM has been reported after frequent doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The recent Conference on the Eradicability of Onchocerciasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] concluded that eradication would not be feasible at coverage rates of 65% for 35 or more number of years. In addition, there is concern that in some geographic areas worm populations exist that may exhibit some degree of resistance to IVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Equally important are the costs to individuals, who, in the absence of a long-acting drug, are faced with the prospect of remaining infected for a decade or more with the necessity of repeated IVM treatments to prevent ocular or dermal damage due to the mf. Therefore, it has been a long-standing aim to identify a non-toxic macrofilaricidal principle against onchocerciasis. Recently, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbiotic bacteria have been exploited as targets for antifilarial drugs with high efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An earlier, open study showed that a 6-week administration of 100-mg/day doxycycline to onchocerciasis patients led to a depletion of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from adult worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This was associated with a long-term cessation of embryogenesis that was still observed 18&#x000a0;months after doxycycline treatment. In lymphatic filariasis due to <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic>, administration of 200-mg/day doxycycline for 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks led to more than 80% of macrofilaricidal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>We therefore undertook a placebo-controlled, randomized study with 200&#x000a0;mg/day of doxycycline, administered for 4-6&#x000a0;weeks, to onchocerciasis patients. The results confirmed a depletion of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> as well as interruption of embryogenesis that led to a cessation of production of new mf at 20 and 27&#x000a0;months after the onset of doxycycline treatment. We also observed a macrofilaricidal activity of more than 60% in the 6-week treatment arm at these points of time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study site</title><p>In the Central Region of Ghana, the area south of the Offin and west of the Pra rivers is endemic to onchocerciasis but not for other human filarial infections. Both rivers are breeding sites of the vector blackflies <italic>Simulium sanctipauli</italic> that have flight ranges of up to 12&#x000a0;km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The study participants were recruited in three neighbouring villages in Assin district situated where the Offin flows into the Pra. The distance between the villages and Offin is less than 1.5&#x000a0;km. In 1999, the focus was found to be hyperendemic during a rapid assessment of 30 men aged more than 19&#x000a0;years in each village: 75, 86 and 93% nodule carriers and 80, 89 and 90% mf carriers were found (R. Horstmann, Bernhard Nocht Institute, personal communication). Mass treatment with IVM started in 1999 in the district. This focus lies south of the area of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP) and transmission is ongoing. Due to the remoteness of the villages the coverage of IVM mass treatment was rather low until the end of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A reduction in the infection rates of the flies was not observed by Garms and colleagues in 2002 (for a detailed map and vector epidemiology see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). During another assessment of the transmission in 2006 the <italic>Simulium</italic> infectivity parameters closely resembled those from other hyperendemic areas without intervention. The entomologists concluded that a person might easily receive one or several infective bites per week (R. Garms, Bernhard Nocht Institute, unpublished report). The nodule loads found during recruitment for this study in September 2003 also indicated a high endemicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethical aspects and study design</title><p>The design of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was approved by the Committee on Human Research and Ethics of the School of Medical Sciences of the Kumasi University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana, as well as by the Ethics Committee of the University of Liverpool. The latter acted as a control body for several studies on anti-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> treatment in onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, which were carried out by a network of groups funded by the European Union (ICA4-2002-10051). The study conformed to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 (last amended 2002). A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) as well as a Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) were established. The trial is registered at Current Controlled Trials and has the registration number ISRCTN 71141922.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Informed consent</title><p>During a meeting with the village elders and interested villagers the study was explained in English and then in the local language Twi. The participants were requested to ask questions and these were answered. During a survey persons identified as eligible to the study were informed individually first in English by the study physician and then in Twi by an experienced teacher and biologist, who was a team member since 1999. Informed, signed/thumbprinted, or witnessed consent was obtained from all participants. Before nodulectomies, the surgeon again explained the procedure in Twi, in the ward, and answered questions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment and examination of patients</title><p>Individuals eligible for participation were: nodule carriers of both sexes, aged 18&#x02013;62&#x000a0;years, with a body weight of more than 40&#x000a0;kg, in good health, and without any clinical condition requiring chronic medication. Physical examinations by SM and MB included inspection and palpation of onchocercomas. Onchocercal skin disease was recorded as papular and lichenified dermatitis and depigmentation (&#x0201c;leopard skin&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The mf density was assessed by two skin snips as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Before doxycycline resp. placebo treatment and again 3&#x000a0;weeks after treatment onset, hepatic and renal functions as well as pregnancy were assessed by dipstick chemistry using venous blood. Exclusion criteria were: palpation of less than two onchocercomas, abnormal hepatic and renal enzymes (AST [0&#x02013;40 IU/l], ALT [0&#x02013;45 IU/l], and creatinine [3&#x02013;126&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l]), pregnancy, breast-feeding, intolerance to doxycycline, and alcohol or drug abuse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients were treated in September2003 and October 2003 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Participants received two 100&#x000a0;mg capsules of Vibramycin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or matching placebo supplied by Pfizer. The treatment was monitored by a trial physician (MB) as daily-observed treatment (DOT). This included daily monitoring in the villages of adverse side effects on a hardcopy standardized patient form.

Six months after the beginning of the study and after this first round of nodulectomy, the patients received 0.15&#x000a0;mg/kg IVM to more quickly deplete skin mf.</p><p>Based on the results of previous studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and unpublished data), patients were nodulectomised 20 and/or 27&#x000a0;months after the start of the study in May2005 and November 2005. In addition, three patients who had been absent before, and one patient who had not been completely nodulectomised, were operated after 39&#x000a0;months in November 2006. For the nodulectomies patients were admitted at the district hospital in Dunkwa for two or more days. The nodules were excised aseptically under local anaesthesia in a separate room by an experienced surgeon (PK) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Treatment of the wounds was started in the hospital and continued in the villages by the trial physician. During drug and wound treatment the patients and a few other villagers were also treated for other medical conditions such as respiratory and intestinal infections, fungal infections of the skin, fever assumed to be caused by malaria, fresh wounds and old ulcers. Additionally, four study patients underwent hernia operations.</p><p>The study patients had been asked not to participate in IVM mass treatment between September 2003 and November 2005.

Two and 3&#x000a0;weeks of doxycycline were not sufficient in the previous studies (unpublished data). (2) To assess a potential macrofilaricidal activity of doxycycline on <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the assessment of sustained effects of doxycycline treatment on worm fertility and worm survival. Worm fertility was measured (1) by observation of the presence or absence of normal or degenerated embryos in female worms and of mf in the human nodule tissue using histology, and (2) by analysis of the presence and quantity of skin mf. Worm survival was measured as the proportion of living and dead worms detected by histology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated for the presence of mf in the patients&#x02019; skin. Applying Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, the power calculation resulted in a sample size of 20 patients per treatment arm for a power of 90% at a significance level of 0.001, in order to observe a significantly higher proportion of doxycycline-treated patients without skin mf compared to placebo. Allowing a dropout rate of 20% the calculation suggested starting treatment with 25 patients for each arm. This sample size was also suggested on the basis of histological analysis of female worms in extirpated onchocercomas: Twenty patients with two or more nodules containing two or more female worms would result in the examination of about 100 female worms, a number found to be sufficient in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The random allocation sequence was computer-generated by AH (StatView<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 4.5. for Macintosh). Simple randomisation without restrictions was used. The random allocation sequence was implemented by packing tablet containers according to the consecutive running numbers to which the mode of treatment had been allocated and which had been assigned to the patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Blinding</title><p>Blinding was assured by the exclusion of persons involved in randomisation or tablet packaging in any clinical or laboratory assessments as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. At the beginning of the study and during drug treatment all members of the team and the patients were blinded. Patients were blinded to group allocation. A few nodules were excised from patients with many onchocercomas at 6&#x000a0;months after the beginning of the study to confirm the depletion of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. These patients had been selected by AH without giving information on treatment to other members of the team (only a list with patient identification numbers was provided). All persons involved with the assessment of nodules and skin biopsies in the laboratory were kept blinded until the end of the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Laboratory methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Nodule preservation</title><p>For histological analysis, we used either complete small nodules or more than half of medium or large nodules to allow assessment of worm numbers and status. Definitions of &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;large&#x0201d; were diameters of 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mm and more than 10&#x000a0;mm, respectively. For histology the nodules or portions of them were fixed in 80% ethanol or 4% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde solution. For PCR analysis the minor portions or total small nodules were placed immediately into ice-cold RNA<italic>later</italic> solution (Ambion, Cambridgeshire, UK), kept at 4&#x000b0;C overnight and then frozen until further processing. The presence of worms was verified by worm actin PCR. If possible, cuts were made such that the piece that was cut away for PCR constituted the minor portion of worm-containing tissue (&#x0201c;worm nest&#x0201d;) of which the larger one corresponded to the piece used for histology. Since this could not always be guaranteed macroscopically we analysed the pieces of the nodules for PCR and histology independently.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Histology</title><p>Samples were embedded in paraffin and several sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin. For selected sections, Giemsa stains and Gomori&#x02019;s method for iron were used. For immunostaining, the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique (APAAP) was applied according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany). To demonstrate the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, a rabbit anti-serum against <italic>Dirofilaria immitis Wolbachia</italic> surface protein (<italic>Di</italic>Wsp) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Worm vitality was assessed with rabbit anti-serum against a cathepsin D-like lysosomal aspartic protease of <italic>O. volvulus</italic> (APR) at a dilution of 1:1,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As secondary antibody, an anti-rabbit mouse monoclonal antibody was used (clone MR12/53, DakoCytomation). Fast Red TR salt (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) was applied as the chromogen, and hematoxylin functioned as a counter stain (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).</p><p>Assessment criteria were as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Criteria for dead filariae were worm portions calcified without cuticle or nearly completely absorbed. Further characteristics for death of a worm included loss of body wall integrity, loss of nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and absence of APR-staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Very degenerated worms, still APR-positive, were classified as moribund according to Duke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and grouped in the category &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d;. But this criterion was used rarely, mainly for worms with neoplasms. &#x0201c;Living&#x0201d; means alive at the time of nodulectomy. All developmental stages from the stage of two cells to the stretched mf in the uterus were classified as &#x0201c;embryos&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. When only the stretched mf were degenerated and the other embryos were not, embryogenesis was recorded as &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; for the purpose of this doxycycline-oriented study. It was assumed that degenerated stretched mf were due to IVM treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

New information based on the results of the studies that we had performed in 2000&#x02013;2003 led to some deviations from the original study protocol. The time for nodulectomy was postponed from 4, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months to 6, 20 and 27&#x000a0;months for a better assessment of worm fertility and survival. Patients of the 4&#x000a0;weeks group were not nodulectomised at 6&#x000a0;months in order to save their nodules for later follow-up times since data analysis from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] suggested that 4&#x000a0;weeks of doxycycline might be the optimal regimen, and it was clear that the anti-parasitic effect of doxycycline would be best observed at later points of time. We also decided to include patients who had taken one or two doses of IVM and those with less than 10&#x000a0;mf/mg, since we knew that we could differentiate between the effects of doxycycline and of IVM taken before recruitment, as long as IVM had not been taken more than one to two times. We also accepted patients older than 50&#x000a0;years with many nodules.</p><p>Since IVM was planned to be given after the first round of nodulectomies, it had to be administered at 6&#x000a0;months instead of 4&#x000a0;months. Since skin snipping without the prospect of nodulectomy would have led to reduced compliance at later follow-up times, we omitted mf analysis at 6&#x000a0;months in the 4-week doxycycline group. Sonography was used to detect onchocercomas and these results will be published elsewhere.</p><p>A third objective mentioned in the protocol was the analysis of whether treatment with IVM several months after the end of the doxycycline treatment led to a reduction of adverse reactions to IVM. Severe side effects as described by Awadzi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and as we had seen in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], were not observed.

Deviations of the original protocol are described in the section, &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; In September 2003 during surveys in the three villages, 76 patients who met the clinical inclusion criteria were recruited from a potential 81 candidates. Five of the 81 had at least one exclusion criterion in clinical chemistry when tests were performed subsequent to clinical examination. The 76 patients were randomly allocated to the 3 treatment arms, and 67 patients completed the allocated treatment. Adherence to treatment was generally high. Two to four individuals in each treatment group failed to complete the course of doxycycline or placebo. The failure was usually due to absence from the village. In one case the treatment was stopped after bloody diarrhoea on day 3. A number of patients who had received placebo or doxycycline for 6&#x000a0;weeks underwent a nodulectomy on one site of the body 6&#x000a0;months after recruitment. The excised nodules contained 29 and 32 living females (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), enough filariae to assess the early activity against the <italic>Wolbachia.</italic> The main points of time for the assessment were 20 and 27&#x000a0;months after the beginning. Four of the patients absent at that time were offered another chance for nodulectomy and were nodulectomised 1&#x000a0;year later in November 2006. Including these, a total of 22 of 23 placebo patients, 19 of 22 patients treated 6&#x000a0;weeks with doxycycline, and 14 of the 22 patients of the 4-week group were nodulectomised. Most of those who did not undergo nodulectomy had moved since study onset. The nodules excised in 2005 permitted an assessment of 149 females and 48 males filariae in the 6-week group and 171 females and 53 males in the placebo group, providing more worms than needed for a judgement of worm vitality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Baseline data</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the characteristics of the three groups of patients that completed the allocated treatment.

In contrast, only 3 of 27 (11%) and 3 of 42 (7%) of the female worms were found with normal embryogenesis in the 4 and 6&#x000a0;weeks doxycycline treatment arms, respectively. No mf were found in the 98 onchocercomas excised at 20&#x000a0;months from the patients of the doxycycline arms. Equivalent differences were seen at 27&#x000a0;months and were already observed at 6&#x000a0;months in the 6&#x000a0;weeks doxycycline group. At 39&#x000a0;months after doxycycline, 2 of 21 female worms showed embryogenesis and 2 of 20 nodules from four patients contained mf, respectively (data not shown). These data were in accordance with those of our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Since doxycycline does not show a fast microfilaricidal activity, no side effects known to occur with DEC or IVM were observed during the treatment or reported later by the patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec34"><title>Selection of villages and treatment with placebo</title><p>The three neighbouring villages selected for the study were located in an area with ongoing transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This probably led to the acquisition of new worms during the study, presenting a problem for the diagnosis of worm vitality (see below). However, performing the study in an area with strongly reduced or interrupted transmission would have biased the results, as older worm populations present more degenerated and dead worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This would also present a bias for the diagnosis of any macrofilaricidal activity. Differing from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] the present study was placebo-controlled and randomised. The recruitment of placebo patients in a randomized way from the same villages is nowadays necessary, since comparison to historical data sets may be biased due to IVM mass treatment or vector control, resulting in a different age pattern of the worms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Remaining living worms and acquisition of new worms after doxycycline</title><p>At 20 and 27&#x000a0;months after doxycycline treatment, the tables show a few living worms with many <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), female worms with normal embryogenesis (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and approximately 40 and 50% surviving females in the 6 and 4-week groups, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). To explain these findings we consider three hypotheses, which probably are all true for some of the filariae:</p><p>(1) Some worms survive for longer periods without the endobacteria but they do not resume mf production for several years or for the rest of their lives. Such survival of worms after treatment is well known for <italic>O. volvulus</italic> after suramin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Cure rates at this extent are also known from other tissue-dwelling helminths and are accepted provided a reduction of the worm load is achieved. For example, <italic>Schistosoma</italic> cure rates of 60&#x02013;95% are accepted by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Also for loiasis and lymphatic filariasis for some patients several courses of DEC are needed for a cure. (2) Not all endobacteria have been eliminated from the filariae and these may multiply over a period of time, as it is known from <italic>Rickettsia</italic>. We suppose that survival of a few bacteria in degenerated oocytes or embryos might happen when suboptimal doses of the antibiotic are used. (3) Based on our observations we are convinced that the worms with many bacteria (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and with either undisturbed oogenesis or embryogenesis were newly acquired after the doxycycline administration. Given that a female worm&#x02019;s average life span is 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the worm load in adult humans in areas with ongoing transmission such as the study area, is rather stable, one has to consider a yearly turnover of approximately 10% of the total adult worm load. Therefore, during an observation period of up to 27&#x000a0;months, a rate of 20% of newly acquired young worms would have to be expected. These young female worms can be differentiated from older worms by their morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The young female worms are characterized by: a smaller diameter, no thickening of the cuticle, prominent lateral cords and somatic muscles, lack of inclusion bodies or other signs of degeneration in hypodermis, muscles, and epithelia. Most are still nulliparous. Little or no intense brown or blue staining is seen in the gut and none in other organs because of less iron deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In accordance with these results, the APR-positive lysosomes are not found in immature worms, and they are rare in the gut and more so in the other tissues of young worms compared to the older ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Applying these criteria and subtracting these newly acquired living worms from the total, the proportion of dead female worms would be higher, around 70% in the 6-week doxycycline group at both months 20 and 27, compared to only 30% in the placebo group. In particular, the alternating logistic regression analysis for the rates of living female worms per nodule at 20&#x000a0;months is disproportionately affected by the newly acquired worms, as most of the nodules in the doxycycline group with living worms are comprised only of new worms. In addition, some dead worms may have been absorbed. Assuming that 70% or more worms have died, up to 30% of the female and a higher percentage of male worms would have survived without endobacteria, albeit sterile and degenerated. This represents a considerable reduction of the adult worm load and together with the complete sterilisation (except for new worms) apparently meets the criteria of cure applied for other helminths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Interdependency issues</title><p>The primary outcome of this study was the assessment of sustained effects of doxycycline treatment on worm fertility and worm survival. This outcome was evaluated also by taking into consideration possible interference, since worms aggregate in nodules, arguably in order to enhance their chances to mate and produce offspring, and to survive. Therefore, we used alternating logistic regression to compare, between the treatment arms, the rate of nodules with normal embryogenesis, the rate of nodules with mf, and the rate of nodules with living female worms. Interestingly, the results for alternating logistic regression showed almost identical proportions of living and dead female worms compared to the analysis of individual worms, as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. However, analysed by alternating logistic regression, the data on this are now comparable to the mode of analysis by Duke and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Macrofilaricidal activity of doxycycline</title><p>It may be asked whether the macrofilaricidal effect seen in this study in the patients who received doxycycline has only been achieved in conjunction with the administration of IVM. A preliminary answer to this may be given from the analysis of the small number of nodules from patients who had received only doxycycline, because they had missed the IVM administration in our study. The findings from these nodules allowed the assumption that doxycycline is macrofilaricidal on its own. This was confirmed by the data of another study where the patients did not receive IVM (Hoerauf et al., in preparation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Safety of doxycycline treatment</title><p>Doxycycline for bacterial infections has been used by millions of people against bacterial infections, including probably tens of thousands with filarial co-infections. It is a safe drug as long as the contraindications are observed. We have used it previously to treat bacterial infections of onchocerciasis patients. Considering the large number of treated people, it was certainly not an objective of this study to assess the safety of doxycycline in general. However, we did consider which side effects might be expected regarding anti-filarial activity of doxycycline. Since doxycycline has no or at least no fast microfilaricidal activity, adverse side effects known from DEC or IVM were not to be expected. Therefore we assumed that an ophthalmologic examination was not needed for this study. Regarding the macrofilaricidal activity, subcutaneous abscesses and rarely perforation tissue b moribund or dead filariae may occur, as with suramin treatment of onchocerciasis or DEC with <italic>Brugia</italic> infections. This did not occur during our study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study showed that doxycycline not only interrupts embryogenesis in the long-term, but also has a macrofilaricidal activity in human onchocerciasis. The treatment has a low toxicity except for pregnant and lactating women and children below the age of 9&#x000a0;years. The sustained absence of embryogenesis, of skin mf and the macrofilaricidal activity seemed to be better after 6&#x000a0;weeks as compared to 4&#x000a0;weeks of doxycycline administration (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.07 for the combined 20 and 27&#x000a0;months groups, Chi-square test); simulating the same proportions of dead and living worms with higher numbers would result in a statistically significant difference. Therefore, doxycycline should rather be used for 6&#x000a0;weeks, if possible. Larger studies may show that the 4-week regimen is equivalent for certain indications, such as long-term sterilisation.</p><p>The new chemotherapeutic principle is beneficial to the treatment of individual patients, who have left a transmission area and thus can achieve a strong reduction of the adult worm load and a clearance of mf. The new regimen may also be considered in areas where there has been evidence for a sub-optimal performance of IVM as in the Asubende focus in Ghana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Worm populations that might have acquired some degree of resistance may thus be eliminated with an existing drug to prevent resistance from further spreading. Doxycycline without IVM may also be considered for treatment in areas with co-endemicity of onchocerciasis and loiasis. In addition, the elimination of onchocerciasis in the Americas has reached &#x0201c;end-game&#x0201d; scenarios where transmission has apparently been interrupted and there are only a limited number of people infected with onchocerciasis in some foci. Administration of doxycycline to these people has been suggested ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and F. Richards, Atlanta, personal communication) on the basis of its long-term embryotoxicity. The new data on the macrofilaricidal effect further underscores this argumentation. In these foci children are usually no longer infected and pregnant and lactating women can be treated later. The anti-wolbachial chemotherapeutic principle may also be exploited for the search of new macrofilaricidal drugs, which can be focussed on <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-depleting antibiotics. Indications have been dealt with in more detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>In summary, anti-wolbachial chemotherapy of human onchocerciasis with doxycycline can be orally applied for special indications to sterilise the female filariae and to reduce the adult worm load. It cannot replace IVM for mass treatment in areas with ongoing transmission.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>APR</term><def><p><italic>O. volvulus</italic> aspartic protease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMI</term><def><p>Geometric mean index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVM</term><def><p>Ivermectin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Mf</term><def><p>Microfilaria(e)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DiWsp</term><def><p><italic>Dirofilaria immitis Wolbachia</italic> surface protein</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Achim Hoerauf and Sabine Specht contributed equally to the study.</p><p>The trial registration number is ISRCTN 71141922 (Current Controlled Trials).</p></fn><fn><p>An erratum to this article is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00430-007-0072-z">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00430-007-0072-z</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>This study received major funding by the European Commission (ICA4-2002-10051).
