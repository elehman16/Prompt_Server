The first cause of cataract is aging, but other reasons include systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, ocular trauma, drugs (such as steroids), radiotherapy, and congenital and hereditary anomaly diseases.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Cataract surgery by replacement of the innate lens with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is the most commonly used surgical technique worldwide.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Toric IOLs were presented by Shimizu <italic>et al</italic>. in 1994 to correct preexisting corneal astigmatism.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Nearly 60% of cataractous eyes have at least 0.75 D of corneal astigmatism.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Correction of corneal astigmatism can be achieved with various techniques including selective location of the phacoemulsification incision, corneal relaxing incisions, limbal relaxing incisions, or excimer laser keratectomy. All these methods have restrictions including the amount of astigmatism that can be treated and long-term mechanical instability.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Toric IOLs offer a more stable and predictable method for correction of pre-existing corneal astigmatism.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies have reported the clinical results of implantation of different forms of toric IOL.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Effective visual outcomes depended on both careful alignment of the toric IOL with its proposed axis and insignificant postoperative rotation. Nearly 3% of cylindrical power is lost for every 1&#x000b0; of rotation from the axis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The aim of this prospective study is to assess the refractive and visual consequences of the AcrySof toric IOL (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA) and Hoya toric IOL (Hoya, Naka-Ochiai, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan) implantation in cataract patients with astigmatism, and to compare the results of these two IOLs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In the present study, we examined 55 eyes of 45 patients who underwent cataract surgery with placement of AcrySof toric IOL and Hoya toric IOL between 2011 and 2013.</p><p>The criteria for consideration were visually significant cataract that needed surgery and regular astigmatism, documented with topography, of more than 1.00 D. The exclusion criteria were irregular astigmatism, macular degeneration and retinal disease, history of glaucoma, corneal disease, previous corneal or intraocular surgery, and history of ocular inflammation.</p><p>For all patients, we performed complete ophthalmic examinations before cataract surgery, including slit-lamp examination, tonometry with Goldmann applanation tonometer, ophthalmoscopy with dilated pupil, and manifest and cycloplegic refraction if possible. Elevation based topography (Scheimpflug Pentacam; OCULUS Optikgerate GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) was done to rule out irregular astigmatism for all patients. Keratometry and axial length were measured with automated keratometer (IOLMaster; Carl Zeiss Meditec Jena, Germany).</p><p>Furthermore, logMAR corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDA) were measured for all patients. For each eye, in order to define the axis of IOL and proper IOL model, we entered preoperative patient information such as steep and flat <italic>k</italic> values and their axis to online toric IOL calculator, as proposed by the manufacturer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.acrysoftoriccalculator.com">www.acrysoftoriccalculator.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.hoyatoriccalculator.com">www.hoyatoriccalculator.com</ext-link>). SRK/T formula was used for spherical IOL power for emmetropia in all patients. Phacoemulsification was done by two skilled surgeons under topical anesthesia. Before each cataract surgery, the horizontal meridian of the cornea was marked by use of ink in an upright position. On the operating bed, IOL axis was marked on the cornea by means of Mendez gauge and toric marker. Phacoemulsification was done through a 2.8-mm clear corneal incision. After phacoemulsification, toric IOL was injected into the capsular bag and IOL was rotated carefully to align the cylinder axis with signed steep meridian. IOL axis alignment was checked again after softly washing the ophthalmic visco-surgical device (OVD).</p><p>There are seven types of AcrySof toric IOL: SN6AT3, SN6AT4, SN6AT5, SN6AT6, SN6AT7, SN6AT8, and SN6AT9. AcrySof toric IOL has been approved by Food and Drug Association (FDA) for seven cylindrical powers, 1.50 D, 2.25 D, 3.00 D, 3.75 D, 4.50 D, 5.25 D, and 6.00 D, at the IOL plane.</p><p>The manufacture's information about all the lens models, cylindrical powers, and suggested corneal astigmatism correction range is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.
