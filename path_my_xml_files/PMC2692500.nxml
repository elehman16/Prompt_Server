The decision to switch was left to the discretion of the attending physician. Outcome parameters of a 4 month control phase before intervention were compared with the equivalent 4 month period during the intervention phase to control for seasonal confounding (before&#x02013;after study; April to July of 2006 and 2007, respectively): 250 episodes (215 patients) during the intervention period were compared with the control group of 176 episodes (162 patients). The main outcome measure was the duration of iv therapy. Additionally, safety, adherence to the checklist, reasons against switching patients and antibiotic cost were analysed during the whole year of the intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 698 episodes).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In 38% (246/646) of episodes of continued iv antibiotic therapy, patients met all criteria for switching to oral antibiotics on the third day, and 151/246 (61.4%) were switched. The number of days of iv antibiotic treatment were reduced by 19% (95% confidence interval 9%&#x02013;29%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001; 6.0&#x02013;5.0 days in median) with no increase in complications. The main reasons against switching were persisting fever (41%, <italic>n</italic> = 187) and absence of clinical improvement (41%, <italic>n</italic> = 185).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>On general medical wards, a checklist with bedside criteria for switching to oral antibiotics can shorten the duration of iv therapy without any negative effect on treatment outcome. The criteria were successfully applied to all patients on the wards, independently of the indication (empirical or directed treatment), the type of (presumed) infection, the underlying disease or the group of antibiotics being used.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>stewardship</kwd><kwd>policy</kwd><kwd>guidelines</kwd><kwd>antimicrobials</kwd><kwd>internal medicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents is crucial for patients&#x02019; safety and public health,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C5">5</xref></sup> particularly in view of increasing drug resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C6">6</xref></sup> Hence, antimicrobial stewardship programmes were developed as an essential field of work for infectious diseases (ID) specialists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C7">7</xref></sup> with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes and minimizing the unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, i.e. toxicity, the selection of pathogenic organisms, emergence of resistance and high costs.

The study was conducted on two general internal medicine wards with &#x0223c;2500 admissions yearly and annual antibiotic costs of about &#x020ac;300 000.</p><p>Seven interns and residents with two senior physicians were in charge of the two study wards on weekdays. On weekends, only two interns or residents of the same team were in charge, with a senior physician on call. An ID service was available at all hours.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Cantons Basel-Stadt and Basel-Land (EKBB, Nr 126/06), which waived the patient consent, since the study was part of a quality improvement project.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population</title><p>All adults who were receiving iv antibiotics at the time of the study were enrolled at the moment they were admitted to one of the study wards. We excluded patients who were referred to the wards with iv antibiotic treatment that had already lasted longer than 3 days, patients on iv antibiotics who were transferred to other wards or hospitals before the third day of treatment and patients who were receiving prophylactic iv antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a before&#x02013;after design study with an <italic>a priori</italic> defined time frame consisting of a 4 month control phase from 1 April 2006 through 31 July 2006 and an intervention phase from 1 April 2007 through 31 July 2007. To eliminate seasonal confounding, only these 4 months were compared although the intervention was performed during 1 year (1 August 2006 through 31 July 2007).</p><p>All patients were consecutively screened for enrolment. The patients in the control phase were enrolled retrospectively using the same criteria as for patients during the intervention phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of a printed checklist of criteria for switching to oral antibiotics, adapted from Laing <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C14">14</xref></sup> and Senn <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C35">35</xref></sup> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DKP131F1">1</xref>). The checklist was placed in the patient's chart. On day 3 of iv antibiotic therapy, the physician in charge of the patient was to complete the checklist and make a decision on the basis of the checklist criteria about whether to switch to oral antibiotics. The protocol allowed the physician to complete the checklist before the third day if switching to oral antibiotics. The final decision to switch to oral antibiotics, however, was left to the discretion of the treating physician.</p><fig id="DKP131F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The checklist.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dkp13101"/></fig><p>If the reason for not switching to oral antibiotics was only the patient's inability to swallow tablets or fluids or was a presumed impairment in gastrointestinal absorption, a clinical pharmacist was consulted to recommend other alternatives to iv therapy if possible.</p><p>When a physician did not switch a patient to oral antibiotics despite the patient meeting all checklist criteria for doing so, he was asked to indicate the reason in a free text box on the checklist. Otherwise, there were no additional interventions by, or formal consultations with, the study team. If a physician did not complete the checklist by the end of the third day on iv therapy, he was asked to complete the checklist with respect to the target day indicated on the checklist.</p><p>We defined an episode as one uninterrupted course of antibiotic treatment. The primary antibiotic was defined as the iv antibiotic that was applied for the longest duration.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome parameters</title><p>The primary endpoint was the duration of iv therapy in days. Secondary endpoints were the total number of times iv antibiotics were administered during an episode of treatment and the associated workload for nurses, the length of hospital stay, the costs and consumption of the antibiotics and the incidence of complications during iv therapy, i.e. phlebitis. We used the following indicators for assessing the safety and efficacy of the antibiotic treatment regimen: re-initiation of iv antibiotic treatment, in-hospital mortality and readmissions within 90 days of discharge.</p><p>The safety of the intervention, the adherence to the checklist's criteria and the reasons for physicians not switching patients were analysed over the entire year of the intervention (1 August 2006 to 31 July 2007). The antibiotic consumption in &#x02018;defined daily doses&#x02019; (DDD) and costs were compared with those in the 2 years before the start of the intervention and with the year after the stop of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>The baseline assessment consisted of demographic data, the Charlson Co-morbidity Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C38">38</xref></sup> and the presumed or documented ID.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We analysed the primary endpoint using the first treatment episode for each patient only.

For the primary analysis, we fitted a univariate and a multivariate adjusted linear regression model for the log-transformed response and used treatment as covariate.

A total of 698 patients received iv antibiotics over the 1 year intervention. Because one application of iv antibiotics takes a mean of 10 min [according to the standardized system of workload measure &#x02018;Leistungserfassung in der Pflege&#x02019; (LEP), LEP AG], the estimated total reduction in nurses' workload was 350 h/year, equal to 2 month's salary for a nurse (&#x020ac;5438).</p><p>The total costs for antibiotics on the two study wards in the years before the intervention were &#x020ac;240 724 (August 2004 to July 2005) and &#x020ac;280 706 (August 2005 to July 2006).

This reduction in treatment duration was associated with a drop in the workload and the costs of antibiotics. We found that the most frequent switch criteria not met were the absence of clinical improvement or no abatement of fever.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Effectiveness of using the checklist</title><p>The checklist proved to be an effective method for reducing the median duration of iv therapy from 6.0 to 5.0 days (&#x02212;19%), which is comparable to results in other related studies (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DKP131TB1">1</xref>). The difference was even more significant if only the first episode of iv antibiotic treatment was being analysed. The overall rate of switching patients to oral antibiotics on the third day of iv therapy was 30%, which was comparable to results noted by Laing <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C14">14</xref></sup> We chose the third day of treatment as the primary day of the intervention, because at that time the culture results and the initial clinical course allow a reassessment of the treating plan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C23">23</xref></sup> Nevertheless, many patients were switched earlier according to our criteria.</p><p>The effect of the checklist on the duration of iv therapy was probably diluted, because the analysis contained all episodes, including those not fulfilling the switch criteria and patients with infections with strict indication for iv treatment. The effect would have been more notable if only patients fulfilling all switch criteria on the third day of iv therapy in the two groups were compared. However, this was not the aim of our study, and a retrospective evaluation of the inclusion criteria for early switch of the patients in the control phase would have been insufficiently reliable and was therefore not performed.</p><p>The rate for switching patients with pneumonia to oral antibiotics was higher (42%), which was comparable to studies where intervention was limited to patients with CAP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C11">11</xref></sup> Consequently, the highest rate of switching patients to oral antibiotics was observed during the winter months (34.9%); this fact emphasizes the importance of controlling for seasonal confounding, which was not done in other studies (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DKP131TB1">1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C36">36</xref></sup> During the intervention phase, a reduction of the duration of iv antibiotics was observed in most subgroups of infections. Nevertheless, the reduction was significant only in the subgroup of lower respiratory tract infections, which may be due to the low number of episodes in most other subgroups. As assumed, there was no reduction in patients with endocarditis or infections of bones or joints, as these patients need to be treated iv for a certain time according to guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Safety of switching patients from iv to oral antibiotics</title><p>There was no significant increase in patient relapse or hospital readmissions during the intervention phase, and all infection-related fatalities occurred in patients who were still being administered iv antibiotics. A meta analysis by Rhew <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C15">15</xref></sup> showed that in terms of outcome in CAP, switching earlier to oral antibiotics was as effective as continued iv therapy. Therefore, the British and American guidelines for the treatment of CAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C41">41</xref></sup> suggest switching early to oral therapy if possible.

Therefore, although it was not suggested by the checklist, physicians also switched to oral antibiotics in 16 patients with neutropenia or haematological malignancies, with successful outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Criteria against switching to oral antibiotics</title><p>Sevinc <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C12">12</xref></sup> observed a persisting fever in 6% and neutropenia in 1% of patients as the main reason against switching to oral antibiotics; in our study, persisting fever and haematological malignancies or neutropenia were more frequent (41.1% and 21.5%, respectively). This contrast highlights the relevance of co-morbidities in patients, and how important the differences in the case-mix of patients can be in evaluating the criteria for switching to oral antibiotics.</p><p>Overall, of 246 cases that met all criteria on the checklist, only 151 (61.1%) patients were switched to oral antibiotics. The adherence to our checklist by physicians on the medical wards increased over the duration of the intervention (from 48% to 68.7%), approaching the rate of general adherence to guidelines in other Swiss hospitals (71%&#x02013;75%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C52">52</xref></sup> If we had actively disseminated the information to physicians, rather than having the checklist available only with the patients&#x02019; chart, and had collaborated more closely with other specialists, the adherence rate may have been even higher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C53">53</xref></sup> The increase in the rate of adherence to the checklist criteria by physicians over time emphasizes the relevance of information and teaching in order to rely on switch criteria. In addition, many of the reasons presumed by physicians as appropriate for not switching patients to oral antibiotics were incorrect, as was noted in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C55">55</xref></sup> This means that in addition to the printed guidelines themselves, continuing education is crucial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C56">56</xref></sup> The increase in ID consultations at the beginning of the intervention was, perhaps, part of this need for additional help and teaching. During the intervention phase, there was no longer any statistically significant increase, and thus the reduction of iv treatment was not due to additional ID consultations during the intervention phase.</p><p>A precise recommendation on how to switch from iv antibiotics with no direct oral equivalent formulation was not offered. The decision was left to the discretion of the physician in charge of the patients. Indeed, we found that patients switched to oral antibiotics on day 3 were initially treated less frequently by an iv formulation which was not available as an oral formulation (e.g. piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem). This may indicate that, in general, less ill patients were more frequently switched or alternatively, that the physicians in charge were uncertain about which oral antibiotic they could switch patients receiving antibiotics that were not available as an oral formulation to. Consequently, one may speculate that the rate of early switch may be increased by offering precise guidelines regarding which oral antibiotics may be used in specific conditions, or by an ID consultation.</p><p>In our study, the need for a physician to consult a clinical pharmacist was rare; there were only 11 consultations in 698 cases (1.6%). Antibiotic stewardship programmes are mainly conducted by ID specialists in Switzerland, in contrast to the USA, where pharmacists can be specially trained in the field of ID.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Effect of switching to oral antibiotics on the workload and antibiotic consumption</title><p>The number of hours required for administering iv antibiotics was estimated to be reduced by 350 hours annually on the two study wards. In contrast to studies optimizing antibiotic treatment through consultations with ID specialists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C57">57</xref></sup> and studies using laboratory parameters to reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C58">58</xref></sup> the implementation of the checklist does not generate additional indirect costs. The checklist criteria may also be used as part of a computerized decision support system with integrated, automatic-reminder procedures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C28">28</xref></sup> which may be as effective as the checklist chosen for this intervention.</p><p>The consumption of antibiotics overall in DDD per 100 patient-days was slightly, but not significantly, increased in the study year compared with the previous year. However, the costs were reduced in part because of an increase in the consumption of the cheaper oral application forms by 5%. For the most frequently used antibiotic, amoxicillin/clavulanate, which is available in oral and iv application forms, the increase in the consumption of the oral form was even more impressive (10.9%). To exactly evaluate an intervention, the data must be analysed at an individual level because the consumption at the ward level is influenced by too many other factors, e.g. number of patients in need of iv antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Effect of switching to oral antibiotics on length of hospital stay</title><p>Various studies have shown that an immediate discharge of the patient from the hospital after stopping iv therapy can be safe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C62">62</xref></sup> A reduction in the length of hospital stay is one of the major areas of potential cost savings in using switch criteria;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C64">64</xref></sup> this has been achieved for patients with lower respiratory tract infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C65">65</xref></sup> or other types of infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C66">66</xref></sup> However, like Laing <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C14">14</xref></sup> we did not observe an overall reduction in length of hospital stay despite an overall reduction in the duration of iv antibiotic treatment in our study population. One explanation may be the case-mix of patients, which required further diagnostic workup or involved concomitant medical conditions, a possibility corroborated elsewhere in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP131C67">67</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>There was a difference in the number of observations in the control and intervention phases, which reflects the usual fluctuation of the patient case-mix on general medical wards. It is unlikely that this difference was due to the retrospective analysis of the control phase, because all patients for this phase were selected by using the same criteria that was used for the intervention phase and the patient characteristics were similar in both phases. A selection bias also is unlikely, because all patients were consecutively screened for enrolment for the study.</p><p>The results of the intervention may have been less significant if the physicians from the study team had not also been present sometimes on the wards and reminded the physicians in charge of the wards to complete the forms when they forgot to do so. Nevertheless, in most instances in which the checklist was not completed on time and the criteria for switching the patient to oral antibiotics were met, switching was performed before we were able to remind the physician to complete the checklist.</p><p>The number of applications of antibiotics per day is influenced partly by what antibiotic is being used and by the renal function in the patient. Therefore, the reduction in the cumulative number of antibiotic applications per patient does not depend only on a reduction in duration of iv antibiotic treatment. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences noted over time in the classes of antibiotics that were administered. The calculation of the workload was an estimate and the precision is therefore limited.</p><p>We used a before&#x02013;after design, of which the main limitations are regression to the mean and inadequate control for confounding. The case-mix was comparable in both phases and we tried to further minimize possible confounding effects by statistical adjustment for possible confounders. A regression to the mean may have influenced the drop of antibiotic costs. A causal interpretation of the results is possible, bearing in mind that other unknown or unmeasured confounders may exist that were not accounted for in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Strengths of the study</title><p>To assess the effect of our intervention, the two groups, control and intervention phases, were analysed during the same months in the year to avoid a seasonal bias. The observation period of 1 year was the longest, and the number of patients the highest, of any study to date that has evaluated criteria for switching to oral antibiotics on medical wards. In addition, we have collected data on the safety of switching to oral treatment. Importantly, we have included all patients in the study to evaluate the safety of the checklist and have therefore not excluded patients who are not eligible for an early switch, e.g. patients presenting with infective endocarditis.</p><p>Further investigation of various issues may be performed in the future. For example, the checklist may be used as an automatic, computerized reminder if antibiotics are prescribed electronically. In addition, the checklist may be evaluated in other patient populations, e.g. surgical patients. In our hospital, the criteria have been implemented routinely since September 2008 on all Internal Medicine wards.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study shows that on general medical wards, a simple, printed checklist with bedside criteria for switching from iv to oral antibiotics can shorten the duration of iv therapy and reduce treatment costs without any negative influence on the outcome of treatment. The criteria were successfully applied to all patients, independently of the indication (whether empirical or treatment of documented infection), the type of (presumed) infection, the underlying disease or the group of antibiotics being used. The setting for our study represents daily medical practice on a general hospital ward, without direct intervention by ID specialists, thus making it possible to generalize the results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by a non-restricted grant from the <grant-sponsor>&#x02018;Stiftung Forschung Infektionskrankheiten, Basel&#x02019;</grant-sponsor>, Switzerland.
