<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Given the uncertainty, most guidelines recommend that men should be fully informed of the potential advantages and disadvantages of screening prior to having a PSA test.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although individuals vary in the degree to which they want to engage themselves with the evidence about their health concerns, a majority consistently report an interest in sharing healthcare decisions with their treating doctor.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, providing the complex information relevant to men who are interested in PSA screening remains challenging.</p><p>Citizens&#x02019; deliberation methodologies such as community juries can facilitate the communication of complex evidence and aim to elicit &#x02018;informed&#x02019; community perspectives for the purpose of guiding services and public policy. A range of community jury processes have been described, but the common features are (1) participants are drawn from the lay public; (2) the jury deliberates on a question requiring an ethical or value-based decision (as opposed to a problem requiring a technical solution); (3) the jury is provided with information on the relevant issues and possible positions from expert &#x02018;witnesses&#x02019;, with the opportunity to ask them questions and (4) the jury then engages in a deliberation phase with participants discussing their preferences, opinions, values and positions, and attempt to reach a consensus position.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Community juries have been conducted on topics such as public health priorities,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> mammography screening<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and health research.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A recent review of deliberation methodologies found only four unique studies that compared deliberative methodologies with a control group; only two of these were in relation to health topics.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> While theoretically sound,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> community juries are a resource-intensive process and it is uncertain whether the views of those participating are better &#x02018;informed&#x02019; than those of a public provided with reading material on the same topic. It is also unclear whether and how being informed influences a jury's conclusions. If community juries are to be used to inform screening policy, it is essential to understand the capacity of a community jury process to support better-informed conclusions by its participants.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the degree to which participants of a community jury on PSA screening of asymptomatic men were better &#x02018;informed&#x02019; than other citizens and, based on the ERSPC<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and PLCO<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> trials together with the general practice guidelines, whether evidence-informed deliberations of the benefits and harms of PSA screening impact on men's intention to be screened for prostate cancer. We conducted a randomised controlled trial that compared a community jury with men allocated to receive typical information. As part of the community jury process, men were also asked to deliberate on two community-focused questions:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Should government campaigns be provided (on PSA screening) and if so, what information should be included in those campaigns?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What do you, as a group of men, think about a government organised invitation programme for testing for prostate cancer?</p></list-item></list></p><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial of a deliberative democracy process on the topic of PSA screening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><p>We recruited men in the target age group of 50&#x02013;70&#x02005;years from the Gold Coast region (Australia) who had no previous diagnosis of prostate cancer, using media advertisements, radio interviews and community groups. Men with a family history of prostate cancer were not excluded from participating. Eligible and available respondents attended a session on a Friday evening to receive a full briefing on the study; all agreed to participate and completed a consent form, before being randomly allocated to either a community jury group or a control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005691F1">figure 1</xref>). Random allocation occurred by each man selecting a piece of paper with the name of either group from an opaque container.

<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition to the factsheets, men in the community jury group also received a Cochrane Collaboration plain language statement,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> information from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners&#x02019; Guidelines for &#x0201c;Preventive Activities in General Practice&#x0201d; pertaining to screening for prostate cancer,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the Executive Summary of &#x02018;PSA Testing&#x02019; from the Urology Society of Australia and New Zealand.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Men in both groups received $20 gift cards as reimbursement for their time at the introductory session and for each survey. The community jury group received an $80 gift card as reimbursement for attending the community jury weekend. Men in the control group were given a follow-up survey with a return-stamped envelope to be mailed after the weekend.</p><p>The community jury weekend and a qualitative analysis of the jury deliberations have been described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In brief, the community jury consisted of an iterative process of education and deliberation. Three experts presented to the community jury on day one: a neutral scientific advisor discussed medical information regarding the role of the prostate, screening tests (including PSA and digital rectal examination), explanations about changes to PSA levels, how cancer is detected, and treatment options and potential outcomes (Jim Dickinson, Professor of Family Medicine, University of Calgary). Two further experts, a urologist and expert in prostate cancer (RG) and an expert in evidence-based medicine (PG) presented the benefits and harms of being screened for prostate cancer. Although both speakers aimed to give balanced presentations, one emphasised the benefits of PSA screening, in particular selective screening (RG <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://youtu.be/9vPt3NAcG8g">http://youtu.be/9vPt3NAcG8g</ext-link>) and the other the harms (PG <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://youtu.be/nifkjdZKmsU">http://youtu.be/nifkjdZKmsU</ext-link>). Both presentations focused on the evidence from the two trials of PSA population screening. However, both presenters also made reference to lower levels of evidence relating to the risks of metastases if a cancer remains undetected due to a lack of screening and the consequences of treating a localised disease detected during screening. After each presentation, the men were able to deliberate on the information and could ask the experts any questions. The men reflected on the information overnight and then returned on Sunday to deliberate and discuss the information presented the day before, including asking any further questions to the expert witnesses by phone.</p><p>A nominal group technique was used on both days to elicit individual thoughts prior to group deliberations. After the final deliberations on Sunday, including the community-level decisions, the men in the community jury completed the postassessment survey. Men in the control group were contacted on Monday and either completed the postassessment survey by phone or mailed the survey back to researchers the same week. Three months after the community jury weekend, all men in both groups were recontacted and completed a follow-up survey.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Non-protocol extension</title><p>Since they indicated a strong desire to have the experience of the community jury weekend, after their 3-month follow-up survey the control group was offered the same community jury experience. Six of the 14 men randomised to the control group participated in the second community jury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005691F1">figure 1</xref>). The two primary experts were the same as for the original community jury group; however, the scientific advisor was changed to a female general practitioner and professor of clinical epidemiology (JD). A final postjury survey was conducted with the second community jury.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Measures</title><p>We collected demographic information, history of previous PSA testing and information sources for PSA screening at the introductory session. In each of the three surveys, the men were asked to nominate on a scale 0&#x02013;10 (0=<italic>not at all</italic>, 5=<italic>maybe</italic> and 10=<italic>absolutely</italic>), whether they intended, while symptomless, to undergo PSA screening for prostate cancer in the future. They were also asked to nominate how informed they considered themselves to be in relation to the harms and benefits of screening for prostate cancer on a scale 0&#x02013;4 (0 = <italic>not at all</italic> and 4=<italic>very)</italic>. We asked four knowledge questions in each survey that assessed (A) the men's knowledge about the recommendation on PSA screening in the Australian general practice guidelines,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> (B) the accuracy of the PSA test and (C) two questions about the treatment options and side effects of prostate cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>). Australia has a primary care-based system, requiring a referral from a general practitioner to see a urologist. General practitioners are therefore responsible for the majority of the PSA screening tests requested in Australia. For this reason, we were interested in the participants&#x02019; knowledge of current general practice guidelines.
