One of the largest Vitality programmes is HealthyFood (HF), an incentive-based programme designed to encourage healthier diets by providing up to 25% cashback on healthy food purchases. We randomised adults with type 2 diabetes to 1 of 5 arms: (1) control, (2) a diabetes-specific message, (3) a message with a recommendation of HF written from the perspective of a HF member with diabetes, (4) a message containing a physician's recommendation of HF, or (5) the diabetes-specific message from arm 2 paired with an &#x02018;enhanced active choice&#x02019;(EAC).

HF, one of the largest Vitality initiatives, is a three-tiered incentive programme designed to encourage a healthier diet by offering monthly cashback payments on healthy food purchases (examples of eligible foods are included in an online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref>). On initial HF activation, members are eligible for 10% cashback monthly. By completing an online health risk assessment and an in-person health screening, members can increase their monthly cashback amount to 25%. While this benefit is available at no additional cost to all Vitality members, immaterial of age or health status, there is particular interest in increasing current engagement in HF among individuals with high-risk, diet-sensitive health conditions such as diabetes. Currently, less than half of Vitality's &#x0223c;31&#x02005;000 South African members with type 2 diabetes are enrolled in the HF programme.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012009.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary appendix</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012009supp_appendix.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Tackling barriers to HF enrolment is a necessary first step to increasing programme engagement and, hopefully, improving diets. Improved messaging about HF to increase its salience for individuals with diabetes could be a low-cost way to increase HF programme enrolment. Past work demonstrates the importance of message content and framing on promoting subsequent health behaviours, ranging from organ donor registration to vaccine adherence.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> Targeted and tailored messages, for example, those designed for and sent to individuals with a certain condition, are more effective at shifting behaviour than more generic messages.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The effectiveness of messages can also vary by whether a message is gain-framed or loss-framed (framed to emphasise the potential gains or losses relating to performing or not performing the targeted health behaviour).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> While some messaging studies targeting low-risk behaviours such as dietary changes or exercise suggest that gain-framed messages may be more effective than loss-framed messages,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> when financial losses are a highlighted consequence of not engaging in the targeted behaviour, the reverse pattern has been observed.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>These types of message framing strategies may also prompt more immediate action. Given the financial benefits of enrolling in HF, some members may intend to enrol but postpone the task assuming the process is overly time-consuming or complex. To combat this present bias (the natural tendency to overweight the upfront &#x02018;costs&#x02019; of something compared with the future or long-term benefits),<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> we tested a behavioural economics-based approach that asked participants to make an immediate &#x02018;active choice&#x02019;. This choice was further &#x02018;enhanced&#x02019; by both gain-framing and loss-framing that highlighted the relative benefit of the preferred option (HF enrolment) and the losses of the non-preferred option (not enrolling).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Past work using &#x02018;enhanced active choice&#x02019; has shown success in increasing health-related behaviours ranging from influenza vaccination to automated pharmacy refill enrolment.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In this study, we compared the effectiveness of diabetes-focused messaging strategies in increasing HF enrolment among Vitality members with type 2 diabetes.

No formal consent process was required given the existing language in the Vitality membership agreement. The study statistician generated a randomisation list that was sent to Vitality who then linked it with the eligible member database according to the study ID. Using a simple randomisation scheme, participants were assigned to one of five study arms with equal chance. Automated email messages were generated and sent according to arm assignment. The analytic team had no contact with the study participants. Since this study addressed alternative messages by study arm, participants were not blinded to the assigned intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population</title><p>Eligible participants lived in South Africa, were Vitality members aged 18&#x02005;years or older with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, were not yet enrolled in HF, and were registered on the Vitality website (reflecting internet access and an available email address).

The diabetes-specific message with an &#x02018;enhanced active choice&#x02019; included the following choices, which were designed to make more salient the advantages/disadvantages of enrolling/not enrolling: &#x02018;Yes!

The initial sample was identified several months before the launch to allow study participants ample time to have learnt about HF from other sources (eg, Vitality website and marketing communications) and enrol if interested. The primary end point of interest was a binary indicator of enrolment; pairwise hypothesis tests of enrolment rates were planned across the five arms, for a total of 10 possible comparisons. The anticipated sample size of 3500 provided 80% power to detect a 3% pairwise difference between the proportions of participants who enrolled in HF with significance testing conducted at the Bonferroni-corrected significance level of 0.005 (0.05/10) to account for the 10 pairwise between-arm comparisons and pessimistically allowing for up to 10% further exclusions. The baseline monthly enrolment rate was estimated at &#x0223c;1%/month. We compared the proportion enrolled between arms using a Fisher's exact test.

This simple, no-cost messaging approach could be used more widely to help people take action to address their underlying risks. &#x02018;Enhanced active choice&#x02019; is well suited to conditions where people must make an affirmative choice (because defaults are seen as too presumptuous), yet most people would see clear advantages of a particular path if those were highlighted. In the context of enrolment into an automatic pharmacy refill programme, for example, default enrolment might be seen as too aggressive, because credit cards would be charged on prescription refills and some people would find that too invasive. However, encouraging participants to actively select automatic referrals is a middle ground.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Moreover, encouraging an immediate choice (eg, by preventing people online from proceeding to the next page without accepting or declining) prevents potential procrastination. Note that we stopped short of actually requiring participants to make a decision; in many contexts, such as in signing up for benefits, it would be relatively easy to do that, but here we took the less paternalistic approach of simply encouraging participants to make a decision and highlighting some of the relevant advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>While an enrolment rate of 12.6% (the highest observed rate in the &#x02018;enhanced active choice&#x02019; arm) may seem to some a small step towards achieving 100% HF enrolment, the results must be viewed in the context of past Vitality HF marketing campaigns and the cost of the tested interventions. Past Vitality HF marketing campaigns have resulted in enrolment rates of only 1&#x02013;3%, well below the rates seen in all of the intervention arms. So while an &#x02018;enhanced active choice&#x02019; messaging strategy is unlikely to result in 100% enrolment among members with diabetes, it could be a first resource-conserving step if 12.6% of the currently unenrolled population enrolled in HF without prompting from a paper mailer or a personal phone call. Given the &#x02018;light touch&#x02019; nature of the tested interventions, we focused only on differences in programme enrolment. Still, HF enrolment is a potential first step towards dietary change; past work (analyses of member surveys and grocery scanner data) has demonstrated that HF enrollees make positive changes in their food choices, increasing healthy choices and decreasing unhealthy ones.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It is important that future studies explore the downstream effects of HF enrolment, specifically programme usage, dietary changes and health outcomes.</p><p>The study design had several limitations. First, the generalisability of the study findings to other contexts was limited by the current uniqueness of Vitality and the HF programme, as well as the sparse demographic information available. We had limited information on member characteristics. For example, <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012009TB1">table 1</xref> presents the age and gender of the primary Vitality members, but we did not collect any information about who received the study emails or who regularly does the household grocery shopping. Second, the use of a non-active control did not allow for direct comparisons between the tested diabetes-specific messages and less targeted messages. Third, we were not able to assess message opening or partial enrolment. Fourth, this study was limited to those who had already established an online account with Vitality, who may already be more motivated to participate and are easier to reach electronically. Vitality members without established accounts might benefit even more from such interventions but are harder to reach.</p><p>This study also has strengths. The design of this study reveals how real-time operational systems can become laboratories for health behaviour change; this study was conducted pragmatically, in the same setting in which it would be later implemented. This design lends the findings a high degree of external validity with regard to the ability to successfully incorporate these types of framed messaging strategies into Vitality's health promotion outreach efforts for similar populations.</p><p>While many interventions to improve health are operationally intensive and costly, some, like those tested here, are not. The results of this trial demonstrate that targeted, framed messages can help nudge individuals with diabetes to enrol in a healthy food programme. This step could be the first one towards healthier food choices, an essential contributor to ideal diabetes management and reduced cardiovascular risk.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Elle Alexander for her assistance with initial study design and conception.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the listed authors have met the requirements for authorship. AG, the lead author, was responsible for overseeing study conception and design, communication between team members, data analysis and interpretation, manuscript construction and manuscript revision. JP, DP and CB, who are all affiliated with Vitality, were responsible for day-to-day study operations (eg, sending of the email messages and abstracting enrolment data from internal Vitality tracking systems to send to the Penn team). Given their affiliations with Vitality, the study's funder, JP, DP and CB were not involved with data analysis and interpretation and only provided general feedback on the manuscript (ie, they had no influence on how findings were presented and interpreted). PAS, the study's lead biostatistician, oversaw all statistical planning, data transfer from the Vitality team, data analysis and interpretation, and provided critical feedback on the manuscript. JF and AMB contributed to study conception and design, result interpretation, and provided detailed feedback on the manuscript. ABT and DAA contributed content expertise in the areas of biostatistics and behavioural economics, respectively, and both were actively involved in manuscript preparation. KGV served as the principal investigator on the study. He contributed his significant expertise in behavioural economics and randomised interventions to study conception and design, data interpretation and manuscript construction. KGV is the guarantor of this manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The study was funded by an unconditional award from Vitality USA.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer:</bold> The study topic, research question and study design were at the discretion of the lead author and not the funder.

JP and DP are employees of Discovery Vitality, and CB is an employee of Vitality USA. Given these relationships, these three individuals were not involved in data analysis but provided only operational support and expertise. DAA and KGV are both principals at the behavioural economics consulting firm, VAL Health. KGV also has received consulting income from CVS Caremark and research funding from Humana, CVS Caremark, Discovery (South Africa), Hawaii Medical Services Association and Merck.
