Most recent findings have shown that the hypothalamic administration of insulin increases brown adipose tissue thermogenesis by direct inhibitory effects on warm-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Moreover, studies in rodents have demonstrated that in addition to its direct inhibitory effect on hepatic gluconeogenesis, insulin acts in the hypothalamus to decrease glucose production in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), thus establishing an insulin-driven brain-liver axis that controls systemic glucose homeostasis. We examined whether insulin acting in the human brain exerts comparable effects on energy homeostasis by administering intranasal insulin that bypasses the blood-brain barrier and reaches the brain compartment along the olfactory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), modulating central nervous functions in the absence of relevant peripheral effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Notably, intranasal insulin reduces food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and body fat content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) in healthy men, indicating that following intranasal administration, the hormone accesses neuronal networks relevant for energy homeostasis. Against this background, in the present study we assessed the effects of intranasal insulin on the glucoregulatory and thermoregulatory response to food intake in humans.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Nineteen healthy men (mean &#x000b1; SEM age 23.2 &#x000b1; 0.6 years and BMI 23.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who were free of medication participated in the experiments. They gave written informed consent to the study, which conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee.</p><sec><title>Experimental protocol.</title><p>Each subject participated in two conditions (insulin and placebo) spaced apart by at least 4 weeks. The order of conditions was balanced across subjects.

Throughout the experiment, subjects rested in bed in a supine position in a quiet room of constant temperature (23&#x000b0;C). At 9:10 <sc>a.m.</sc>, sixteen 0.1-ml puffs (eight per nostril) of insulin and placebo, respectively, were intranasally administered in 2-min intervals, amounting to a total dose of 1.6 ml insulin (160 IU Insulin Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Mainz, Germany) or vehicle (HOE 31 dilution buffer; Aventis Pharma, Bad Soden, Germany). Insulin and placebo were administered using precision air pumps (Aero Pump, Hochheim, Germany) that fill the nostrils and the nasal cavity with aerosol, thus enabling the solution to effectively target the olfactory epithelium. The dose of intranasal insulin used here has previously been shown to be functionally effective in healthy humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Following postinsulin administration measurements (see below), subjects consumed 600 ml of a standard liquid meal (Fresubin energy drink, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) at a dose of 20 ml/min (totaling 900 kcal, 33.6 g protein, 34.8 g fat, and 112.8 g carbohydrate) from 10:15&#x02013;10:45:00 <sc>a.m.</sc>, and subsequently assessments were continued until 4:00 <sc>p.m.</sc></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>Experimental schedule.

The parallel treatment-induced reduction in postprandial serum insulin concentrations while plasma glucose levels were comparable between conditions indicates that following intranasal insulin administration to the brain, lower circulating levels of the hormone are sufficient to dispose of meal-related increases in plasma glucose. In line with findings in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), our results support the notion that brain insulin signaling in humans is involved in the control of whole-body energy homeostasis.</p><p>In keeping with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), intranasal administration of 160 IU insulin induced a transient and mild increase in serum insulin concentrations accompanied by a slight drop in prefood intake plasma glucose that clearly remained within the euglycemic range. Due to the relatively high dose administered here compared with that in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), a small ratio of the hormone may have entered the circulation via the nasal mucosa. However, the transient nature and limited size of these immediate effects argues against an involvement of systemic uptake of intranasal insulin in its impact on postprandial thermogenesis and glucose metabolism. This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that immediate and postprandial effects were not statistically related.</p><p>The balanced regulation of nutrient intake and energy expenditure relies on the hypothalamus as a major integrator of nutritional and hormonal signals from the body periphery, including glucose and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Direct injections of insulin into the preoptic area of the hypothalamus induce a dose-dependent increase in core body temperature due to stimulation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis that is assumed to be mediated by inhibitory insulinergic action on warm-sensitive hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In our experiments, intranasal administration of the hormone to the brain did not affect resting energy expenditure but evoked a distinct increase in postprandial thermogenesis. Increased postprandial energy expenditure due to enhanced brain insulin signaling adds to the reduction in food intake previously observed after intranasal administration of the hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), suggesting that the catabolic impact of central nervous insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) is mediated not only by anorexigenic but also by thermogenic effects of the hormone. Still, further studies on this issue are needed and should include measurements of body temperature, brown adipose tissue activity, and relevant vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure to elucidate the effect of brain insulin signaling on energy expenditure in humans.</p><p>A most remarkable finding of our study is the intranasal insulin&#x02013;induced reduction in postprandial serum insulin concentrations while the food intake-induced rise in plasma glucose remained unaffected, suggesting that intranasal insulin improves postprandial insulin sensitivity. A regulatory effect of central nervous insulin on hepatic glucose metabolism has been indicated by animal studies showing that a selective decrease in hypothalamic insulin receptors reduces hepatic insulin sensitivity and results in marked increases in hepatic glucose production in the presence of plasma insulin concentrations equaling those of control animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Fittingly, insulin hyperpolarizes glucose-responsive hypothalamic neurons by opening ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) which triggers a decrease in hepatic glucose production that is mediated by vagal efferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This pattern suggests that enhancing brain insulin signaling by intranasal administration of the hormone may act on glucose homeostasis in the body periphery by supporting hepatic insulin action. Nevertheless, given that postprandial liver glucose production accounts for approximately one-fifth to one-half of fasting values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), improved insulin-dependent metabolization of ingested glucose may also have contributed to the intranasal insulin-induced decrease in postprandial serum insulin levels. Such an effect could basically be supported by the observed decrease in prandial FFA levels due to intranasal insulin inasmuch as FFAs are known to impair insulin-stimulated muscle uptake of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, FFA effects on peripheral insulin-stimulated glucose uptake slowly develop over some hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), which, in conjunction with the lack of a significant correlation between the decreases in prandial FFA and postprandial insulin concentrations, makes this view unlikely. Furthermore, a contribution of enhanced noninsulin-mediated glucose disposal, i.e., glucose effectiveness, to our effects cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Although the present results suggest that insulin administration to the human brain enhances the efficiency of the glucoregulatory brain-liver axis in response to nutrient intake, our observations should be corroborated in future studies that rely on more refined measurements of insulin sensitivity, e.g., euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps. It is also noteworthy that most recent animal data hint at divergent effects of hypothalamic insulinergic signaling on peripheral glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure depending on the involvement of agouti-related protein or proopiomelanocortin neuronal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In this regard, general enhancements in brain insulin signaling as performed in our study do not permit differentiations. Taken together, our findings indicate that intranasal insulin acutely increases postprandial thermogenesis and improves the glucoregulatory response to food intake, suggesting that boosting brain insulin signaling in humans enhances the body's ability to cope with calorie consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Against the background of studies indicating that obesity and peripheral insulin resistance are associated with reduced central nervous insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), enhancing brain insulin signaling may emerge as a useful approach in the therapeutic management of disorders hallmarked by disturbed glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
