The 3000 and 3001 phase 3 clinical studies of intravenous bapineuzumab assessed safety and efficacy in patients with mild to moderate AD recruited in over 26 countries. This article describes the long-term safety and tolerability of bapineuzumab in the extension studies for these two protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The long-term safety and tolerability of intravenous-administered bapineuzumab in patients with AD was evaluated in apolipoprotein E &#x003b5;4 allele noncarriers (Study 3002, extension of Study 3000) and apolipoprotein E &#x003b5;4 allele carriers (Study 3003, extension of Study 3001). Those receiving bapineuzumab in the parent study were continued at the same dose; if receiving placebo, patients began bapineuzumab. Bapineuzumab doses were 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg in both studies and also 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg in the noncarrier study. Clinical efficacy of bapineuzumab was also assessed in exploratory analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Because of lack of efficacy in two other phase 3 trials, the parent protocols were stopped early. As a result, Studies 3002 and 3003 were also terminated. In total, 492 and 202 patients were enrolled in Studies 3003 and 3002, respectively. In apolipoprotein E &#x003b5;4 carriers (Study 3003), treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 70.7&#x000a0;% of the patients who originally received placebo and 66.9&#x000a0;% of those who originally received bapineuzumab. In noncarriers, treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 82.1&#x000a0;% and 67.6&#x000a0;% of patients who received placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg, respectively, and in 72.7&#x000a0;% and 64.3&#x000a0;% of those who received bapineuzumab&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg, respectively. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions were the main bapineuzumab-associated adverse events in both studies, occurring in approximately 11&#x000a0;% of placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab and 4&#x000a0;% of bapineuzumab&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab groups overall. Exploratory analyses of clinical efficacy were not significantly different between groups in either study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In these phase 3 extension studies, intravenous bapineuzumab administered for up to approximately 3&#x000a0;years showed no unexpected safety signals and a safety profile consistent with previous bapineuzumab trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Noncarriers (Study 3002): ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00996918">NCT00996918</ext-link>.

Although the exact etiology of AD remains unknown, overproduction or inadequate clearance of accumulated amyloid-beta (A&#x003b2;) peptide is thought to be an essential component in its pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One of the therapeutic approaches to halting disease progression in AD is passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against A&#x003b2;, which are thought to reduce A&#x003b2; accumulation and promote its clearance from the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This approach was shown to reduce cerebral A&#x003b2; deposits, improve behavioral measures, and reverse memory loss in animal models (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]), suggesting that removal of A&#x003b2; from the brain using mAbs may provide similar benefits in humans with AD. Bapineuzumab, a humanized mAb specific to the A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub> protein, has been evaluated in a total of four similarly designed phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of patients with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a result of phase 2 findings of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions (ARIA-E), the bapineuzumab phase 3 development program stratified patients according to apolipoprotein E (ApoE) &#x003b5;4 allele status (carriers or noncarriers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. ARIA-E are detected as an increased signal intensity on FLAIR or other T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, and are thought to arise from an increase in permeability of brain capillaries to serum proteins, leading to extravasation of fluid into the extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Incidence of ARIA-E was dose dependent, and 10 of the 12 cases were observed in ApoE &#x003b5;4 carriers in the phase 2 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which guided dose selection for the phase 3 trials in carriers and noncarriers. Studies 301 (noncarriers) and 302 (carriers) were conducted primarily in the United States, and Studies 3000 (noncarriers) and 3001 (carriers) were conducted at sites in more than 26 countries to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous (i.v.) bapineuzumab or placebo in patients with mild to moderate AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the first two of these studies to be reported (Studies 301 and 302), no significant difference was found between the bapineuzumab and placebo groups in the primary clinical efficacy endpoints (Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale&#x02014;Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog/11) and Disability Assessment Scale for Dementia (DAD)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ARIA-E were a primary safety finding in these studies in patients treated with bapineuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Based on the lack of clinical efficacy observed in the 301 and 302 studies, all ongoing bapineuzumab trials were terminated early by the sponsors in August 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Results from the terminated phase 3 parent studies (3000 and 3001) were presented in 2013 at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease symposium; consistent with the results of Studies 301 and 302, neither showed a clinical benefit of bapineuzumab therapy.</p><p>In this report, we detail findings from the 3002 and 3003 phase 3 extension studies of bapineuzumab in patients with AD who participated in the respective parent studies 3000 and 3001. The primary objective of the extension studies was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of i.v.-administered bapineuzumab in subjects with AD, as it is not known how the rate of adverse events (AEs) and particularly ARIA-E evolves with the duration of therapy beyond the term of the phase 3 studies. The 3002 study evaluated ApoE &#x003b5;4 allele noncarriers and the 3003 study evaluated ApoE &#x003b5;4 allele carriers. Additional exploratory evaluations of cognitive, behavioral, and functional efficacy were conducted using validated assessment scales.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>Both studies were phase 3, multicenter, long-term safety and tolerability extension trials of i.v. bapineuzumab once every 13&#x000a0;weeks in patients with AD. Prior to enrollment in either study, the protocols were reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional review board or ethics committee, and all patients (or their legally acceptable representative) and patient caregivers provided informed consent. A complete list of all ethical bodies that approved the ApoE &#x003b5;4 carrier and ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarrier studies are listed in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, respectively. Both studies were conducted in accordance with principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and according to good clinical practices established by the International Conference on Harmonisation. The 3002 study enrolled ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarriers who had completed Study 3000. If they received bapineuzumab in the main study, patients continued on bapineuzumab at the same dose (either 0.5 or 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg); if they received placebo, patients were randomized to receive either bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg or 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg. Patients who had originally received the discontinued bapineuzumab 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg dose in the parent study were reassigned to 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg during that study and continued to receive the 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg dose in the extension study. All participants were aware that all patients were receiving bapineuzumab in the 3002 study, while treatment assignment from the 3000 study remained blinded to patients and to site staff, including the dose. The 3003 study enrolled ApoE &#x003b5;4 carriers who had completed Study 3001. All patients were assigned to bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg whether they received bapineuzumab or placebo in the parent study. All participants were aware that all patients were receiving bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg, but treatment assignment from the 3001 study remained blinded to patients and to site staff. The transition of patients who received placebo in the parent studies to bapineuzumab treatment in the extension studies resulted in the formation of two subgroups: a bapineuzumab-to-bapineuzumab (bapineuzumab&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab) &#x0201c;early start&#x0201d; group; and a placebo-to-bapineuzumab (placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab) &#x0201c;delayed start&#x0201d; group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The initial planned duration of patient participation in the extension study was 2&#x000a0;years, which was extended to 4&#x000a0;years (208&#x000a0;weeks) per a protocol amendment dated July 2011. The first patient enrolled in the ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarrier (3002) study in February 2010 and in the ApoE &#x003b5;4 carrier (3003) study in December 2009. Both studies were terminated in August 2012.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of treatment group assignments between parent and extension studies. <sup>a</sup>Delayed-start treatment groups. <italic>PBO</italic> placebo</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13195_2016_193_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients had to have been enrolled in the parent studies (either 3000 or 3001) and completed all six infusions specified in the parent protocol; if the study drug had been suspended temporarily, the patients had to have completed all visits through week 78 and be eligible to resume investigational treatment. Patients met the inclusion criteria for AD in the parent studies (3000 and 3001) if they had: a diagnosis of probable AD according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke&#x02013;Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria; Rosen Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;4; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 16&#x02013;26, inclusive; and a screening brain MRI scan consistent with the diagnosis of AD. A brain MRI scan administered at week 71 of the parent study had to be available for local and central radiologic evaluation and remain consistent with a diagnosis of AD. Patients also had to have had a MMSE score &#x02265;10 at screening (i.e., week 78 of the parent study). At each study center, the protocol and informed consent form and any amendments to these studies were reviewed and approved by a duly constituted institutional review board or independent ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained before any screening procedures specific to the extension studies were performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Main exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients were excluded if they had any medical or psychiatric contraindication that, in the investigator&#x02019;s opinion, could increase the risks associated with the patient&#x02019;s continuation in or completion of the extension studies or might preclude an evaluation of response. Patients were also excluded if the brain MRI scan administered at week 71 in the parent study (3000 or 3001) was indicative of any significant abnormality, which for the extension studies included the following: four or more microhemorrhages (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;mm), history or evidence of a single prior hemorrhage &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>, two or more lacunar infarcts, evidence of a single prior infarct &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>, and any abnormality detected in the MRI scan that was consistent with exclusion criteria in the parent studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Concomitant AD medications</title><p>Patients who were receiving cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine for AD in the parent study (3000 or 3001) were allowed to continue at the same stable doses during the extension studies (3002 or 3003). Experimental medications for AD, all other experimental medications, and the use of herbal preparations containing ginkgo biloba were prohibited. Initiation of treatment with, or change in stable doses of, drugs with the potential to affect cognition, including cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, over-the-counter drugs, and nutritional supplements, was prohibited unless medically indicated (e.g., side effects due to such drugs required dose reduction, or use of such drugs was temporarily stopped and restarted for medical reasons).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Both studies were continuously monitored by the same independent safety monitoring committee that functioned in the parent studies. The safety variables assessed comprised the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) throughout the study; safety laboratory variables, including clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis (all analyzed centrally), and serum anti-bapineuzumab antibody; clinically important changes in vital signs, weight, and electrocardiograms (ECGs; with readings/interpretations performed centrally); and physical and neurological examinations. Brain MRI scans were radiologically assessed both centrally and locally. Both radiology reports were reviewed by the investigator prior to subsequent investigational product infusion. After the first year, MRI scan frequency was decreased from 13-week to 26-week intervals. Other safety variables included suicidality assessment and local reactions at the infusion site. ARIA-E, intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage, seizure, and deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) were considered AEs of special circumstance, to be reported within 24&#x000a0;hours whether or not they were considered serious.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Exploratory efficacy and biomarker assessments</title><p>The following clinical efficacy variables were assessed in both studies: ADAS-Cog/11, DAD, MMSE, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Three health outcomes measures were also explored: Dependence Scale, Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite version, and Health Utilities Index. Biomarkers were assessed in a subset of patients in both studies, including change from baseline in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), whole brain volume on volumetric MRI (vMRI), and [<sup>11</sup>C]-Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), as in the parent studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Patient disposition and exposure</title><p>Patient disposition and exposure in the 3002 and 3003 studies are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In the ApoE &#x003b5;4 carrier study, 506 patients were screened and 492 patients were enrolled; 216 patients had been randomized to placebo in the parent study (3001) and thus were identified as the placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg group (placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5), and 276 patients had originally received bapineuzumab and thus were identified as the bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg group (bapineuzumab 0.5&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5). The safety population was comprised of the 215 and 275 patients who were treated in the placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5 and bapineuzumab 0.5&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5 groups, respectively. In each treatment group, one patient was randomized but did not actually receive a dose of study medication, which accounts for the lower numbers in the safety population. The principle reason for withdrawal from treatment was sponsor decision; 76&#x000a0;% in the placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5 group and 79&#x000a0;% in the bapineuzumab 0.5&#x02009;+&#x02009;bapineuzumab 0.5 group were withdrawn from treatment because the sponsors discontinued the study. Another 7&#x000a0;% and 4&#x000a0;% of patients, respectively, withdrew because of AEs.

The long-term safety and tolerability profile was generally similar in ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarriers and carriers in the extension studies, except for a higher incidence proportion of treatment-emergent death in carriers. There was a higher incidence proportion of ARIA-E (vasogenic edema) observed with onset during the study in both noncarrier and carrier patients who first received bapineuzumab in the extension studies than in those who had received bapineuzumab from the beginning of the parent studies. This finding further supports the observations during the double-blind studies that ARIA-E tends to occur early in the course of bapineuzumab exposure (most often between infusions 1 and 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with a decline in the incidence of ARIA-E over time with continued bapineuzumab exposure during the double-blind studies. This finding is consistent with a reduced risk of ARIA-E after longer exposure. However, in patients who continued on bapineuzumab in both extension studies, ARIA-E was still seen after the sixth dose in 3.6&#x000a0;% of carriers and 4.1&#x000a0;% of noncarriers, and the latest ARIA-E occurred after the twelfth dose of bapineuzumab. There was also evidence of a dose effect for ARIA-E in the noncarrier study, consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated that the risk of ARIA-E increased with bapineuzumab dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Efficacy</title><p>To date, a clinical benefit of amyloid-targeted immunotherapy with bapineuzumab or any other mAb has not been observed for patients with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently reported findings from pivotal phase 3 studies of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate AD failed to show a significant difference in clinical endpoints of ADAS-Cog/11 and DAD scores or other clinical endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Among ApoE &#x003b5;4 carriers (but not noncarriers), bapineuzumab was associated with reduced CSF p-tau concentrations, a marker of neurodegeneration.

Gantenerumab, a fully human mAb that binds to two regions of monomeric and fibrillar A&#x003b2;, reduced brain amyloid burden in a multiple ascending dose study, findings that were not correlated with cognitive measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

They were also similar between the two dose groups in the noncarrier study, suggesting no adverse effect of the higher dose on cognitive measures. Despite the lack of efficacy in patients with mild to moderate AD, it has been speculated that the earlier use of these therapies in mild AD, or in asymptomatic patients with A&#x003b2; accumulation, may be of benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

The safety and tolerability profile of bapineuzumab was similar to that observed in previous studies of bapineuzumab, and no new or unexpected safety concerns were identified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AD, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease; ADAS-Cog/11, Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale&#x02014;Cognitive Subscale; AE, adverse event; ApoE, apolipoprotein E; ARIA-E, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions; A&#x003b2;, amyloid beta; BAP, bapineuzumab; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; DAD, Disability Assessment Scale for Dementia; DVT/PE, deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism; i.v., intravenous; LS, least squares; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NPI, Neuropsychiatric Inventory; PBO, placebo; PiB-PET, Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography; p-tau, phosphorylated tau; SAE, serious adverse event; SE, standard error of the mean; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event; vMRI, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13195_2016_193_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>is a list of independent ethics committees or institutional review boards that approved the ApoE &#x003b5;4 carrier studies.
