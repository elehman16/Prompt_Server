Effective methods are needed to increase and maintain their fruit and vegetable consumption. Goal setting has been an effective behavior change procedure among adults, but has had limited effectiveness among youths. Implementation intentions are specific plans to facilitate goal attainment. Redefining goal setting to include implementation intentions may be an effective way to increase effectiveness. Video games offer a controlled venue for conducting behavioral research and testing hypotheses to identify mechanisms of effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Objective"><title>Objective</title><p>This report describes the protocol that guided the design and evaluation of Squire&#x02019;s Quest!

II is a 10-episode videogame promoting fruit and vegetable consumption to 4th and 5th grade children (approximately 9-11 year old youths). A four group randomized design (n=400 parent/child dyads) was used to systematically test the effect of two types of implementation intentions (action, coping) on fruit and vegetable goal attainment and consumption of 4th and 5th graders. Data collection occurred at baseline, immediately post game-play, and 3 months later. Child was the unit of assignment. Three dietary recalls were collected at each data collection period by trained interviewers using the Nutrient Data System for Research (NDSR 2009). Psychosocial and process data were also collected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Results"><title>Results</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first research to explore the effect of implementation intentions on child fruit and vegetable goal attainment and consumption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This intervention will contribute valuable information regarding whether implementation intentions are effective with elementary age children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Trial Registration"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01004094</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>video game, nutrition, fruit, vegetable, children, intervention, action implementation intention, coping implementation intention, goal setting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Consuming adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables (FV) is part of a healthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and has been associated with decreased risk of chronic diseases such as certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]. National guidelines recommend that 9-13 year old youths consume 7-11 servings of FV each day, based on calorie needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]. However, less than 4% of children meet the minimum guideline, and fewer than 20% consume at least five servings each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. Since adolescent dietary behaviors track into young adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>], increasing and maintaining youths&#x02019; FV consumption prior to adolescence could have substantial and sustained public health significance.</p><p>Video games are popular among youths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. Many youths have ready-access to cell phones, game consoles, and computers on which video games can be played [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. High-speed home Internet access has increased among households with youths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. Therefore, online video games may be a familiar and convenient method to reach youths with health-enhancing programs. They also offer a mechanism for ensuring consistent intervention delivery, thus controlling for potential lack of fidelity to standardized content and implementation procedures potentially introduced by live instructors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>].</p><p>Serious video games, ie, video games designed to entertain as well as achieve change of some type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>], is an emerging genre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>], with some reported success at changing health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]. Squire&#x02019;s Quest! increased FV consumption among 4<sup>th</sup> grade children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]; however post-study consumption was still well-below recommended levels, suggesting additional investigation was needed. Secondary analyses revealed that goal setting was weakly related to goal attainment and FV consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>], suggesting that enhancing the goal setting component of Squire&#x02019;s Quest! may offer a mechanism to further enhance participants&#x02019; FV consumption.</p><p>Implementation intentions are specific plans that identify how to achieve a goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]. They can take two forms: (1) action intentions, a specific plan of how a goal will be attained (ie, what, when, who), and (2) coping intentions, an if/then plan that identifies what solution an individual will enact if a specific obstacle or problem is encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]. When forming an implementation intention, an individual determines in advance how to meet a goal by examining possible situations and selecting the ones most likely to lead to goal attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]. Environmental cues rather than conscious thought trigger a goal-directed response, thereby automating behavior and increasing the likelihood the goal will be attained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]. Implementation intentions have enhanced goal attainment across a variety of adult health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]. There is some evidence they may be effective with youths - ie, adolescents who formed implementation intentions prior to initiating an academic goal were more likely to achieve the goal than adolescents who did not form an implementation intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>].</p><p>Long-term behavior change is the ultimate goal for behavioral interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]. However, little research has specifically addressed the issue of maintaining dietary behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]. While some dietary change interventions have occurred over a two-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>], no conceptual distinction was made between initiation and maintenance of change. Desired changes in targeted dietary behavior in the intervention group relative to the control group have shown mixed effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]. Among adults, outcome expectancy was conceptualized to be related to behavior initiation, while perceived satisfaction with behavioral change was conceptualized to be associated with maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]. Satisfaction is a continual assessment of whether the &#x0201c;benefits&#x0201d; of change were worth the effort to make and/or continue the change. Since high expectations may be more likely to lead to dissatisfaction, high outcome expectancies were hypothesized to be associated with greater behavioral initiation, but lower maintenance, while more modest expectations, were hypothesized to be associated with lower behavioral initiation, but greater maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>].</p><p>Squire&#x02019;s Quest! II: Saving the Kingdom of Fivealot (SQ!2) is a 10-episode online video game designed to increase FV consumption among 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade children (roughly 9-11 year old youths). It is an updated and enhanced version of an earlier video game, Squire&#x02019;s Quest!, evaluated in 1999 and 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]. SQ!2 was supported by a parent component which included electronic newsletters and access to a parent-only website. The primary aim of SQ!2 was to test the effect of implementation intentions on FV goal attainment and consumption in pre-adolescents. An exploratory aim was to examine factors associated with maintenance of consumption. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Baylor College of Medicine (H-18488) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01004094). This report describes the study protocol that guided the design and evaluation of the SQ!2 randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This evaluation used a four-group, randomized design, with three data collection periods (baseline, post 1, post 2). Following baseline assessment, children were randomized to one of four groups: goal setting only (simple), goal setting + action intentions (action), goal setting + coping intentions (coping), or goal setting + action and coping intentions (both). Youths had up to three months to play all 10 episodes of the video game, where the appropriate goal-setting/implementation intentions were embedded in four versions of the game. Post 1 data collection occurred immediately upon completion of the 10 episodes or approximately 3 months after beginning game-play, whichever occurred first. Post 2 data collection occurred approximately 3 months after post 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>). The study was conducted from November 2009 through March 2011.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Research design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="resprot_v1i2e19_fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Eligibility criteria for participants included: (1) a child in the 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> grade at time of enrollment, (2) fluent in English, (3) had access to a computer with high speed Internet, and (4) had a parent (or legal guardian) fluent in English or Spanish who was willing to participate in the study. Recruitment methods included standard procedures (ie, flyers and attendance at community events) and the volunteer database at the Children&#x02019;s Nutrition Research Center. Prior to participation, eligible parents and children provided written informed consent and child assent. The child was the unit of randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size and Power</title><p>Sample size requirements were based on a power analysis (the number of participants needed to find an actual group difference)&#x000a0;&#x000a0;with FV as the primary outcome variable. A repeated measures analyses of variance with a 4-group design and 3-measurment periods was assumed. Allowing for a 30% attrition rate, a sample of 400 parent/child dyads (100 per group) provided adequate power (&#x0003e;80%) to detect a small effect size (ES=0.17) using a standard deviation of 1.5 from the original Squire&#x02019;s Quest!&#x000a0;and a two-sided alternative with type I error rate of 0.05. This effect size (ES=0.17) translates to a detectable 0.51 or greater serving (ie, a half of a serving per day) group difference.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Characteristics</title><p>Four hundred multi-ethnic parent/child dyads were enrolled in the study. Fifty three percent of children were girls, while 47% were boys; racial/ethnic distribution was 37% White, 27% Hispanic, 26% Black, and 10% Other. Most parents were female (96%), and parent racial/ethnic distribution was similar to that of the children (41% White; 26% Hispanic; 26% Black; 7% Other).</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Parents and children participated in separate intervention and data collection activities electronically (Internet or telephone) from locations of their choice (home or community). There were no face-to-face sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention had both child and parent components. The child played a 10-episode online video game, while the parent received electronic newsletters and access to a parent website which was updated with new information10 times, corresponding to the 10-episode video game. The intervention was guided by a theoretical framework that incorporated social cognitive (behavioral and environmental factors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>], self determination (motivation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>], the elaboration likelihood model (information processing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>], behavioral inoculation (resistance to temptation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>], and maintenance theories (long-term behavior change) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]. The conceptual model that guided the intervention is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>. It provides an overview of how the intervention promotes short and long term FV consumption. The story, characters, and game mechanics (eg, interactivity) promote immersion, which increases exposure to the behavior change components (ie, program dose). Setting a goal and/or creating an implementation intention, developing core knowledge and skills, and engaging in key behavioral procedures (eg, schemas, decision making, resisting temptation, motivation, and character modeling) contribute to FV self efficacy and outcome expectations. FV self efficacy and outcome expectations influence short and long term FV consumption (maintenance). Outcome expectations also influence satisfaction, which influences long term consumption. In addition, the parent component (newsletters, website), coupled with child asking behaviors and recipe preparation, influence parent involvement; parent involvement, FV tasting, and FV preferences influence FV home availability and accessibility and short and long-term FV consumption.</p><fig id="figure2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Conceptual model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="resprot_v1i2e19_fig2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Child Component: Video Game</title><sec><title>Development</title><p>Multi-ethnic 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade children provided information for the development and initial testing of the video game. Children (n=15) provided feedback on behavior change components, the storyline, and the characters. Children (n=10) also participated in alpha and beta testing sessions. An experienced 4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher reviewed materials to assess developmental appropriateness and comprehension of key components. Children and their parents (n=20 dyads) also participated in a pilot study, which served as a final test for the intervention components, procedures, and data collection activities of the video game.</p></sec><sec><title>Storyline</title><p>The story, written by a professional writer, was designed to appeal to 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade youths (ie, humor appropriate for children). It integrated the behavior change components into the action, which, in turn, advanced the storyline. The &#x0201c;backstory&#x0201d; (ie, the history) provided context for the storyline.</p></sec><sec><title>Backstory</title><p>The medieval kingdom of Fivealot is a happy one; its prosperity is based on ancient knowledge of healthy nutrition and an abundance of good food, under the gentle guidance of King Brocwell and Queen Nutritia. Recently, Fivealot entered a truce with their underground-dwelling enemy, the Mog &#x02013; or so they thought.</p><p>A nation of subterranean serpents and myopic moles, the Mog were jealous of Fivealot&#x02019;s good fortune. Although Brocwell and Nutritia had offered to share their country&#x02019;s bounty, the Mog who were raised on a diet of sweets and fried foods, stubbornly refused to change their ways. The Mog King Snake, Sssynster, instead insisted that Fivealot change <italic>their</italic> habits &#x02013; and the struggle was on.</p><p>Discovering that their army of fattened moles and slovenly snakes were no match for the energetic knights of Fivealot, Sssynster withdrew, realizing he could never best Brocwell and Nutritia in open conflict. His best hope was treachery.</p><p>The King and Queen of Fivealot&#x02019;s Head Chef, Supremo, was preparing to go to market one day. With the truce in effect, he suspected nothing &#x02013; certainly not the tunnel dug into his kitchen by the Mog. Unbeknownst to Brocwell and Nutritia, Supremo simply disappeared, spirited away to the land of Mog.</p><p>Then came the second part of Sssynster&#x02019;s plan: a double agent, Moledred, had been placed on the kitchen staff, waiting for the opportunity to advance to the Head of the Kitchen. With the majority of knights away spreading the bounty of Fivealot, Moldred&#x02019;s mission was to prepare his specialty - fattening, unhealthy meals - for the King and Queen, and thus bring the kingdom to ruin. But what Sssynster and Moledred had not counted on was a Squire answering the King and Queen&#x02019;s call for brave young men and women to train in the ways of Fivealot and become knights themselves. A Squire&#x02026;like you.</p></sec><sec><title>Quest</title><p>To become a knight, the Squire had to acquire the coveted knowledge and skills of the Fivealot Knights. This is where the game began. In the quest for knighthood, the Squire had to overcome challenges. The challenges involved attaining &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; FV consumption and recipe goals. As the Squire (ie, the participant) met their challenges, they earned badges and progressed in their journey towards knighthood. Because children typically consume well below the recommended level of daily FV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>], promoting a more modest goal appeared prudent; therefore, the goal promoted in the game was to ultimately consume at least 5 daily servings of FV.</p></sec><sec><title>Characters</title><p>The protagonists included six characters that were &#x0201c;human&#x0201d; in appearance (King Brocwell; Queen Nutritia; Merlin the Wizard; Knights Alex and Julie; Chef Supremo) and a robot (M.I.C.H.A.E.L.), who assisted with kitchen tasks. The antagonists were snakes (King Sssynster, a cobra; the snake army) and moles (Moledred, the imposter chef) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="figure3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Characters.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="resprot_v1i2e19_fig3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Game Content and Structure</title><p>The genre was action adventure.

After completing baseline data collection, players were randomly assigned to one of four versions of the game. Their username automatically routed them to their assigned version. The only differences between the groups were the implementation intentions described in the goal review and goal setting sections below.</p></sec><sec><title>Goal Review and Problem Solving</title><p> Goal review appeared in episodes 2-10. It occurred at the beginning of each episode and was led by the Wizard. Players reported whether they met the two types of goals set during the previous episode: a FV consumption goal and a FV recipe preparation goal. In the video game, goals were referred to as challenges to be consistent with the &#x0201c;quest&#x0201d; towards knighthood. Players in one of the three groups that created an implementation intention reported whether they followed it. Players, regardless of group assignment, also reported whether they used the skills learned in the video game (ie, self monitoring, problem solving, and asking/negotiation) to help them meet their goals. For each unmet goal, the player participated in a problem solving sequence to identify the problem that kept them from meeting their goal. Players received feedback statements (tailored to their level of success in meeting their goals and/or whether they used skills to help them meet their goals). Players were then asked whether the effort they put into eating FV was worth it (an assessment of satisfaction). To reinforce goal commitment, they were then encouraged to type in a positive self statement (eg, &#x0201c;Setting and meeting my challenges shows I&#x02019;ve got what it takes to be a winner!&#x0201d;) and read it out loud with conviction.</p></sec><sec><title>Badges</title><p>Badges were awarded in episodes 2 - 10 for meeting the goals set in the previous episode. Players could earn up to two badges each episode, one for meeting the FV goal and one for meeting the FV recipe goal. Total number of badges earned determined level of knighthood. There were five levels, ranging from the lowly Honorary Knight to the coveted Platinum Knight. Badges appeared on the player&#x02019;s coat of arms (or shield) displayed in the castle foyer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="figure5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Shield with badges.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="resprot_v1i2e19_fig5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Cut Scenes</title><p>The cut scenes were animated video clips that presented the story. The story was told from the second person perspective. The cut scenes provided an opportunity for the characters to serve as role models through dialogue and action. To make the player feel &#x0201c;part of the action&#x0201d;, the characters &#x0201c;spoke&#x0201d; to the player by referring to him/her as &#x0201c;Squire&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Knowledge + Mini-Game</title><p>This component appeared in episodes 1 - 10. It presented basic knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] about fruit, 100% juices, and vegetables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and then reviewed, refined, and reinforced it in a timed &#x0201c;mini-game&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

The group&#x02019;s main effect allowed investigation of group differences, regardless of whether it was post 1 or post 2. The group-by-time interaction term allowed investigation of group differences over time, thus identifying if the treatment was maintained. Univariate outcomes (the number of goals achieved, number of newsletters read, etc) were analyzed using a univariate one between-group factor design. Secondary analyses included investigation of trends in goal attainment, FV consumption, and psychosocial factors across study weeks through the use of Chi-square analyses for ordinal repeated measures. A dose-response analysis was also planned.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This report provides a description of the protocol, procedures, and assessment tools for a video game designed to increase FV consumption among children. This research has several strengths. First, it is based on an earlier video game that successfully increased FV consumption in 4<sup>th</sup> grade children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]; it was designed within a multi-theoretical framework; and it systematically varies only one component, implementation intentions. Strengths also include a large sample size, a focus on both parents and children, and examination of maintenance effects. Finally, it uses a strong measure of dietary data collection (3, 24 hour dietary recalls at each data collection period). However, this study is conducted in one specific geographic region, thus limiting its generalizability.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to test the effect of implementation intentions on FV goal attainment and consumption and to examine the relationship between satisfaction and maintenance of behavior change in pre-adolescents. The intervention includes a parent and child component designed within an integrated theoretical framework to maximize the likelihood of behavior change. The successful implementation of this intervention will generate valuable information regarding the effectiveness of this approach for young children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work is a publication of the United States Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Center (USDA/ARS), Children's Nutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.
