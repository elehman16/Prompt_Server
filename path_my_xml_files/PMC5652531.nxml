The MILESTONE (Managing the Link and Strengthening Transition from Child to Adult Mental Healthcare) study evaluates the longitudinal course and outcomes of adolescents approaching the transition boundary (TB) of their CAMHS and determines the effectiveness of the model of managed transition in improving outcomes, compared with usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a cohort study with a nested cluster randomised controlled trial. Recruited CAMHS have been randomised to provide either (1) managed transition using the Transition Readiness and Appropriateness Measure score summary as a decision aid, or (2) usual care for young people reaching the TB. Participants are young people within 1&#x02009;year of reaching the TB of their CAMHS in eight European countries; one parent/carer and a CAMHS clinician for each recruited young person; and adult mental health clinician or other community-based care provider, if young person transitions. The primary outcome is Health of the Nation Outcome Scale for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) measuring health and social functioning at 15 months postintervention. The secondary outcomes include mental health, quality of life, transition experience and healthcare usage assessed at 9, 15 and 24 months postintervention. With a mean cluster size of 21, a total of 840 participants randomised in a 1:2 intervention to control are required, providing 89% power to detect a difference in HoNOSCA score of 0.30 SD. The addition of 210 recruits for the cohort study ensures sufficient power for studying predictors, resulting in 1050 participants and an approximate 1:3 randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the UK National Research Ethics Service (15/WM/0052) and equivalent ethics boards in participating countries.

In the UK, almost half of the service users reaching the transition boundary of their CAMHS do not go on to receive adult care.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 16</xref> The Transition from CAMHS to Adult Mental Health Services (TRACK) study found that less than 5% of patients undergoing CAMHS to AMHS transition experience continuity of care.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> There is also a concern that despite recognition of ongoing mental health need, few young people are referred, with fewer than one-third in one study.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Continuity of care is hampered by a multitude of reasons, including differences between adult and child models of care; differing referral criteria; lack of a planned, purposeful and needs-based assessment of those who reach the boundary; communication and information transfer problems between services caused partly by different beliefs, attitudes, mutual misperceptions and lack of understanding of different service structures; lack of shared protocols/manuals for transition; lack of shared client planning between child and adult systems; young people&#x02019;s level of maturity and understanding; and adolescent and/or family resistance to transition.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> Furthermore, transition may differ widely across different regions and countries due to lack of or different procedures.</p><p>Problems at the CAMHS&#x02013;AMHS interface are accentuated by the fact that young people are simultaneously negotiating developmental and situational transitions, such as changes in housing and relationships and moving on to adult roles.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 17</xref> A lack of information about possible options, planning that takes too long and where no one professional takes charge to ensure decisions are acted on, compound the problem.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Those who slip through the care net are likely to present to adult services at a subsequent time, with more severe and enduring mental health problems.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> Disruption of care during transition adversely affects the health, well-being and potential of this vulnerable group,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;31</xref> and negative transition experiences adversely impact the young person&#x02019;s future engagement with mental health services.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Intervening at the level of transition represents one of the most important ways we can facilitate recovery and&#x000a0;mental health promotion and mental illness prevention in adulthood. Ensuring sustained treatment through the transitional period is very likely to be cost-effective, since the presence of mental illness during childhood leads to 10 times higher costs during adulthood.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;35</xref> However, there is currently no evidence for any effective model of appropriate transitional mental healthcare or any interventions to reduce these individual and societal costs.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Transitional care</title><p>Ideally, transition to adult mental health services&#x000a0;(AMHS) should be a planned, orderly, purposeful and patient-centred process that ensures continuity of care, optimises health, minimises adverse events and ensures that the young person attains his/her maximum potential.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;41</xref> Good transitional care starts with preparing a service user to leave the child-centred healthcare setting and ends when that person is received in, and properly engaged with, the adult provider or an appropriate alternative, or is discharged from care in a planned and managed fashion.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref></p><p>European research on transition from CAMHS to AMHS is sparse, with little information available on the quality of transition and transition experiences in different European Union (EU) countries in relation to long-term mental health outcomes. The organisation of CAMHS in the member states varies, including the age at which young people are transitioned to adult services, size and complexity, sources of funding, and service provision and care. There is some evidence though that transition is a problem across all EU states.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;46</xref></p><p>Barriers to good transition have been mapped,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> but the evidence of interventions for improving transitional care is scant. A recent systematic review of CAMHS to AMHS transition identified only three initiatives, all in the USA,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> including a case management model, a transition support model and an outpatient transition programme. Although all three programmes showed improved clinical and social outcomes for those with facilitated transition, none of these was a randomised trial and each model was deeply rooted within its own particular and specific healthcare context. There is no consensus as to who can be discharged on reaching the CAMHS transitional boundary, who should receive transitional care and how this care should be delivered. Furthermore, it is not clear what outcomes should be measured to assess clinical and cost-effectiveness of the model, what the outcomes of those who fall through the care gap are, and what the individual, organisational and societal costs of poor, inadequate or inappropriate transition are. A recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#x000a0;(NICE) review on transition from child to adult care across all specialties found that there was no robust evidence on models of transitional care.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>In the absence of a planned, purposeful and needs-based assessment of those who reach the boundary, clinical judgement on transition can be influenced by misperceptions of other services, time and resource constraints, poor communication between CAMHS and AMHS, and poor adherence to existing policies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Research has confirmed several information-gathering biases in unstructured clinical judgements, such as diagnostic biases, confirmation biases, ignoring conflicting information, and assumptions based on patient and service background.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> A recent study found that feeding back structured assessment results to clinicians led to improved clinical decision making.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p><p>Ideally all young people who reach a transition boundary would be assessed in a structured and standardised way to determine ongoing need for care. Those who need such care would make a transition to adult services in a planned and managed manner ensuring continuity of care across all domains. Those without ongoing need would be appropriately discharged. Despite the intuitive simplicity and clinical importance of such a structured decision process, a transition model incorporating this approach with regard to mentally ill patients has not been evaluated or reported in research or health practice literature, although its need has been articulated.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 14</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>The MILESTONE project</title><p>The 5-year MILESTONE project (February 2014&#x02013;January 2019) aims to improve the understanding of, and strengthen, CAMHS&#x02013;AMHS transitional care across different healthcare systems in the EU. In a series of work packages, it will (1) map current services and transitional policies across the EU; (2) develop and validate transition-specific outcome measures; (3) conduct a longitudinal cohort study of transition processes and outcomes across eight EU countries; (4) develop and test, in a cluster&#x000a0;randomised trial, the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an innovative transitional care model; (5) create clinical, organisational, policy and ethics guidelines for improving care and outcomes for transition age youth; and (6) develop and implement training packages for clinicians across the EU. This paper presents the protocol (V.2.2) for the work packages dealing with the longitudinal cohort study, the cluster randomised controlled trial&#x000a0;(cRCT) and the economic evaluation of the trial, which combined constitutes the MILESTONE study.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>MILESTONE model of managed transition</title><p>The model of transitional care we have developed consists of an evidence-based decision-making process and managed transition, incorporating key principles of continuity of care: adequate information transfer, appropriate joint working, therapeutic and relational continuity, and engagement with adult services.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref> The model of managed transition can be seen as one of the cornerstones of a planned and purposeful transition process and can lead to more effective joint working between services. It addresses the need to involve young people and parent/carers in the planning process, tailor transition support to individual needs, identify barriers to smooth transition and act on these, plan transition in a timely fashion, produce a succinct medical summary of the service user, and improve information transfer and communication with adult providers.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The model includes the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The establishment and/or confirmation of shared understanding of criteria for good-quality transitional care at the CAMHS&#x02013;AMHS interface, and managed ending of care, taking into account clinicians&#x02019; prior knowledge of good-quality transition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Systematic identification of all young people under CAMHS care who reach the transition boundary for their service.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Structured and standardised assessment of their mental health and social care needs using a bespoke Transition Readiness and Appropriateness Measure (TRAM), completed by the young person, their parent/carer if available and CAMHS clinician prior to, ideally 6&#x02009;months before, the transition boundary.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Feedback of TRAM results from all parties in a short, clearly presented report to relevant clinicians in CAMHS, allowing clinicians to identify areas in which attention should be focused to ease a young person&#x02019;s path to transition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Using the findings from the TRAM report to focus communication with service users and carers on issues surrounding end of care at CAMHS and potential transition to AMHS or other community-based service.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Incorporation of critical information by clinician to young person&#x02019;s care or transition plan, and designing goals for critical items that are achievable.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sending the TRAM findings, along with a referral letter, to the new adult service, if a referral to AMHS is made.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Structured and regular follow-up of all young people using the Transition Related Outcome Measure (TROM) to assess whether those who needed care were appropriately engaged with adult services and those who had been discharged or referred to other services had no unmet needs following cessation of care.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>TRAM and TROM</title><p>The TRAM, a decision support and assessment tool, uses the HealthTracker<sup>TM</sup> platform. The measure, together with the linked findings report, have been designed to help the clinician identify (1) high-risk, high-need cases for whom transition to AMHS is advisable and appropriate, (2) those who can be appropriately discharged in a planned manner from CAMHS to a general practitioner (GP), or (3) transitioned to another community-based service (such as social services, voluntary sector or other non-statutory agencies). Obviously, the clinicians will need to take their local service provision into account when making the decisions. The TROM provides information on outcomes post-transition, and on the transition process and experience.</p><p>The TRAM and TROM were developed using existing literature, expert input and focus groups on developing and validating Patient Reported Outcome Measures<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50 51</xref>; MILESTONE&#x02019;s group of young advisors also reviewed the scales and helped identify areas of duplication or unclear terms. The scales have been translated into Croatian, Dutch, Flemish, French, German and Italian languages, and provide a summary of all factors necessary to consider (including symptoms, functioning, risk and need for care) when making a transition decision and when assessing the outcomes of a transition. There are versions for young people pre- or post-transition, parents/carers and clinicians at CAMHS and AMHS, which can be completed online, via the HealthTracker<sup>TM</sup> platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.healthtracker.co.uk/index.php/our-platform/">https://www.healthtracker.co.uk</ext-link>), a web-based portal allowing measures to be completed remotely that has been used in other EU&#x02019;s Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7)projects.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p><p>The&#x000a0;TRAM and TROM contain 20 questions common to both scales for all participants; eight additional&#x000a0;questions are relevant only to the clinician and nine only to the young person and parent/carer&#x000a0;versions. All participant versions of TRAM contain 15 additional questions that are not in TROM, yet to&#x000a0;allow comparison of results over time, most of the domains present in TRAM are also present in TROM, with versions for AMHS and CAMHS clinicians and different follow-up time points (available from the corresponding author upon request).</p><p>The construct validity, content validity, inter-rater validity, test&#x02013;retest validity and sensitivity to change of TRAM and TROM were assessed in a substudy between June 2015 and April 2016.</p><p>The &#x02018;TRAM score summary report&#x02019;&#x000a0;presents the scores from the young person, parent/carer and clinician for each item, with graphs visualising differences or similarities in scoring. The report contains items that are relevant to the clinician&#x02019;s transition decision (symptoms, risk factors and disruption experienced by the young person) and those that can facilitate a smooth transition. It displays all information in a user-friendly, relevant and accessible format, helping identify young people requiring further care and allowing key facts to be easily transferred to care plans and referrals. It should complement a much more comprehensive evaluation, with the ultimate decision about transition being the outcome of a process involving key stakeholders.</p><p>The TRAM will be optimised on the HealthTracker<sup>TM</sup> platform based on decision-making algorithms derived from the study. If appropriately funded, this will be made available to serve as the platform for optimisation of transitions to adult mental health in the EU.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The overall aim of the nested cRCT is to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the model of managed transition in improving the health and social outcomes of young people, and their transition to adult roles, as compared with treatment as usual, in eight participating EU countries.

The study design is a modification of the Cohort Multiple Randomised Controlled Trial,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> by virtue of allocation to the intervention by cluster randomisation, with each distinct CAMHS comprising a cluster. The control arm clusters from the cRCT together with additional excess clusters form the longitudinal cohort study, with a follow-up period of 24 months. The cRCT is a superiority trial; the aim is to show that managed transition is superior to usual care in improving patient-reported outcomes. Usual care varies by CAMHS and may or may not include transitioning planning. The primary outcome endpoint is 15 months. The study flow diagram is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. All arms of the study undergo the same data collection. The trial has economic and qualitative components, addressing objectives 2 and 3, respectively. Detailed Statistical Analysis Plans have been developed for both the cRCT and longitudinal cohort study.

The study coordinator is responsible for the day-to-day coordination and the chief investigator (CI) for clinical aspects. The study is managed by a trial management group (TMG), including work package leaders (ie, country leads), and supported by MILESTONE research staff. The TMG speaks monthly by telephone conference chaired by the CI. The study conduct and progress are overseen by the independent MILESTONE Scientific, Clinical and Ethical Advisory Board (SCEAB) comprising five international experts and four patient and public involvement (PPI)&#x000a0;representatives. The SCEAB members are invited to the annual general meetings in order to monitor the progress of work, to assess the scientific quality and to give feedback to the Consortium members, but without a right to vote. The SCEAB will also review the main governance and any ethical issues that might require greater attention.</p><p>MILESTONE has strong PPI embedded throughout the project; young advisors, some with experience of transition in mental health services, provided feedback on the protocol and study documents, and designed the intervention leaflet. Their ongoing role includes attending and contributing to project steering committee meetings, developing&#x000a0;other promotional materials, and advising on recruitment and the engagement of young people. The first five PPI representatives have been from the UK; in the third year, service users from other participating countries will be involved.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Setting and site selection</title><p>The study is currently running in Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. Recruitment of participants is underway in 52 CAMHS clusters that fit the inclusion criteria below (October 2015&#x02013;December 2016, with last inclusions in January 2017). Face-to-face meetings with clinical and managerial leads were arranged at those sites that expressed an interest and the study was&#x000a0;explained in detail. Signed site agreements or equivalent were obtained from participating sites prior to the start of the study. The majority of sites received no funding from the EU grant (no 602442) for taking part in the study. However, two German recruiting sites received payments under subcontract to facilitate recruitment.</p><p>In most countries, other than the UK, there is no umbrella organisation to facilitate collaboration between AMHS and CAMHS. Furthermore, a single CAMHS may be linked with numerous AMHS (inpatient services, clinics, teams and individuals), making it difficult for AMHS clinicians to be engaged from the start, particularly given our limited resources. Also, we were not able to predict which AMHS would be involved, as this is dependent on transition decisions.</p><sec id="s3b1"><title>Cluster-level eligibility criteria</title><p>For a CAMHS to be eligible, it had to be a service delivering medical and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents with mental health problems and disorders, and/or neuropsychiatric/developmental disorders (eg, emotional/neurotic disorders; eating disorders; hyperkinetic disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism spectrum disorders); community-based, or provide outpatient or inpatient care; publicly or privately funded; have a formal upper <italic>age limit</italic> (the transition boundary) for providing care to young people; and be responsible for transfer of care to an adult service for those who reach the transition boundary. Forensic services and highly specialised national services, which cater to rare/unusual disorders and/or serve a national population, such as specialist clinics for rare metabolic disorders or long-term residential care for severe autism, were excluded. Eligible services could vary in size and complexity, ranging from single psychiatrists or psychologists (eg, Germany) or circumscribed teams, to services with multiple teams and localities offering multidisciplinary care (eg, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s3b2"><title>Baseline service-level data collection</title><p>Baseline service data were collected from the CAMHS manager or leading CAMHS clinician at all recruited CAMHS in the year preceding recruitment of study participants. The questionnaire covered (1) size (number of staff), structure and function of CAMHS; (2) transition boundary of the service (ie, age at expected transition); (3) the number and type of AMHS that operate within the CAMHS catchment area; (4) current transition policy and practice; and&#x000a0;(5) size of the catchment population. This information was used to establish the organisational structure of CAMHS and identify potential crossover and/or movement of staff between teams or units so that distinct units (clusters) could be identified. If one or more CAMHS teams share the same core clinicians, then these were classified as one cluster, becoming the unit of allocation.</p><p>The data revealed that the CAMHS&#x02013;AMHS transition boundary for most countries was 18 years, that is, the age of majority. In the UK, Belgium and France, there was more variation, the boundary ranging from 15 to 18 years. We also discovered that some services in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Germany adopt a more flexible approach to the boundary, and in these situations we agreed a nominal boundary (18 years), which reflects the age at which transitions most commonly occur and, in most instances, is also the official transition boundary.</p><p>On leaving CAMHS care, young people may be referred on to AMHS or another community-based service (eg, social services, voluntary sector or other non-statutory agencies offering support and therapeutic interventions for mental health needs), or discharged back to their GP. AMHS and community-based services will be invited to participate in the study, and service-level data will be collected once they are recruited.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Randomisation</title><p>As several countries only had three CAMHS clusters, this fixed the randomisation ratio at 1:2 and the randomisation was conducted in a two-stage process: First, randomly selected triplets of clusters within each country were identified for inclusion in the cRCT. These three clusters were further randomised in a 1:2 ratio between intervention and control arms. The excess clusters (those not selected during the first stage for the cRCT) were used for the cohort study only to enhance numbers. Overall, this two-stage process equates approximately to a randomisation ratio of 1:3. All randomisations were conducted by the trial statistician using the statistical software Stata V.14.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p><p>The CAMHS were informed of their allocation after randomisation. The study personnel were also aware of the allocation as they are involved in delivering the intervention and assessing outcomes. The young people and their parents/carers, who are recruited after randomisation, are informed of their allocation after they have consented to the study, yet only if they ask about this specifically.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Participant eligibility and recruitment</title><sec id="s3d1"><title>Young people</title><p>Individual recruitment targets were set for each CAMHS (cluster), based on local capacity, but with the constraint that in the cRCT there should be on average 21 participants per cluster. Databases of all participating CAMHS are scrutinised by CAMHS personnel to identify all young people approaching the service&#x02019;s transition boundary and meeting the inclusion criteria over a 15-month recruitment period (between October 2015 and December 2016).</p><p>Young people are eligible if (1) their age is within 1&#x02009;year of reaching the transition boundary of their CAMHS during the trial recruitment period and, in exceptional cases, not more than 3 months older than the transition boundary, if a decision about transition has not yet been made; (2) they have a mental disorder defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV-TR (4<sup>th</sup> edition text revision), or DSM-5 (5<sup>th</sup> edition), or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> revisions (ICD 10/11), or they are under the regular care of CAMHS (attended at least one appointment, if not yet diagnosed); (3) they have an IQ &#x02265;70 as ascertained by previous standardised assessment or diagnosed by clinician, or no indication of intellectual impairment; and (4) they provide valid written informed consent, or assent, if below the legal age of consent (in England this age is 16, in all other participating countries 18).

Young people and their parents/carers are assessed at the clinic, or at an alternative location suitable for the young person, with both semistructured interview (sociodemographic and personal information, and HoNOSCA) and online assessment. The sociodemographic and personal information questionnaire for young people and parent/carers collects general information about the young person and family, and the care the young person receives. The questionnaire covers also medical history and additional variables previously shown to contribute to continuity of mental health problems (eg, history of mental health problems and alcohol or drug abuse by parents). The last online assessment of T1 is the structured sections of the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA),<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60 61</xref> which obtains information on mental health. Information from the assessment with the young person and parent/carer will be combined with a computer algorithm that provides an estimate of the probability of a certain individual diagnosis. Information on clinical diagnosis is obtained from the clinician.</p><p>The length of the baseline assessment (young&#x000a0;people) is approximately 1.5&#x02013;2&#x02009;hours. The participant can take a short break in between the online measures, and if required, complete them over multiple sessions.

All clinicians are approached and those willing to engage are interviewed over the telephone or face to face.</p><p>A subsample of young people taking part in the study will be invited to take part in focus groups at T4 from three participating countries: Ireland, UK and Croatia. The purpose of the focus groups will be to explore their experiences of leaving CAMHS, transition to AMHS if applicable and views of mental health services, the aim being to establish whether young people have better health, educational and social outcomes, better quality of life, and satisfaction with services if they (1) have experienced a managed transition from child to adult services at the transitional boundary or (2) have experienced usual care (ie, their transition to adult services, or their discharge from services, is via the usual procedure of their CAMHS clinic). It is hoped that, as part of MILESTONE&#x02019;s PPI&#x000a0;activity, some of the young advisors, or other young people trained in facilitation skills by some of the research sites, may cofacilitate these focus groups.</p><p>Three audio-recorded focus groups will be held in each country with 9&#x02013;12 young people in each group. Recruitment will be from the study participants with purposive sampling to include some young people who (1) did not transition to adult services, (2) who transitioned to adult services via usual care and (3) who experienced managed transition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Sample size</title><p>Assuming an average cluster size of 15 participants, an allocation ratio of 2:1 (control:intervention), a coefficient of variation of cluster size of 0.4 (cluster sizes ranging from approximately 5&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;30), and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, with 600 participants (195 intervention arm (13 clusters), 405 control arm (27 clusters)), the cRCT has 89% power to detect a difference of 0.30 SD in the primary outcome measure (HoNOSCA). To allow for 30% dropout, the required average cluster size is 21 participants. Thus, for the cRCT the target sample size is 840 participants in total (273 intervention&#x02014;13 clusters of size 21; 567 control&#x02014;27 clusters of size 21). The randomisation was stratified by country, with the number and size of clusters dictated by local capacity. Excess clusters (those not required for the cRCT) were allocated to the control arm and will be used in the analysis of the cohort study only to enhance numbers for sufficient power to study predictors for the longitudinal course and outcome of mental health during transition. There are 10 such excess clusters (average size 21 before dropouts). The recruitment target for the cohort study is therefore 777 participants (567 from the control arm of the cRCT plus 210), and the total recruitment target is 1050 (840 plus 210).</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Retention of study participants</title><p>To ensure that contact is not lost with any members of the study population during the follow-up period and that data are as complete as possible, MILESTONE has paid considerable attention to its engagement and retention strategies, drawing extensively on the advice and experiences of its young advisors to create a special &#x02018;Bonding Plan&#x02019;. Participants may be contacted using several methods of communication (post/phone/email); contact details of all participants, including GP and CAMHS clinician details, are recorded in a &#x02018;keeping in touch&#x02019; form; data are collected in several different ways (face to face, online, phone); and each contact, or contact attempt, made with participants is recorded in a bespoke contact log. There are multiple contact points between study assessments, where the participants can advise of any changes to their contact details. The Bonding Plan activities vary by country, taking local ethical and cultural requirements into consideration. Items include thank you cards, newsletters, gift vouchers and a chance to win a prize in a lottery. The value of gift vouchers provided after assessments range from &#x000a3;10&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;&#x000a3;20 or similar equivalent in euros. In Italy and Croatia, the research ethics committees did not allow providing any gifts after the individual assessment time points.

Questionnaires have been distributed to researchers in each country to ascertain the resources required to set up the intervention, while Excel logbooks capture the time spent by clinicians completing the TRAM.

However, there are real gaps in mental healthcare provision at this crucial stage, and those who experience transition frequently describe it as disruptive. The MILESTONE study is the first ever methodologically robust trial to test whether a decision support and assessment tool, the TRAM, can improve the mental health and social outcomes and functioning of transition age young people receiving CAMHS care. Young people in eight European countries are partaking in the trial&#x000a0;and their longitudinal course of mental health, social and adult functioning outcomes are evaluated as part of a prospective&#x000a0;cohort study. The MILESTONE study has crucial input from young advisors, some with experience of transition in mental health services.&#x000a0;Overall, this is an ambitious and challenging study which will provide a timely and valuable insight into an under-researched population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e674" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016055.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e675" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016055.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful for the CAMHS and AMHS services and research teams who are collaborating in this study in the eight European countries.
