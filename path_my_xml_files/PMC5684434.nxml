Patients with schizophrenia have deficits in cognition, and targeted cognitive training (TCT) of auditory processing and working memory has been shown to improve some of these impairments; but little is known about the baseline patient characteristics predictive of cognitive improvement. Here we use a model selection and regression approach called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to examine predictors of cognitive improvement in response to TCT for patients with recent onset schizophrenia. Forty-three individuals with recent onset schizophrenia randomized to undergo TCT were assessed at baseline on measures of cognition, symptoms, functioning, illness duration, and demographic variables. We carried out 10-fold cross-validation of LASSO for model selection and regression. We followed up on these results using linear models for statistical inference. No individual variable was found to correlate with improvement in global cognition using a Pearson correlation approach, and a linear model including all variables was also found not to be significant. However, the LASSO model identified baseline global cognition, education, and gender in a model predictive of improvement on global cognition following TCT. These findings offer guidelines for personalized approaches to cognitive training for patients with schizophrenia.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Cognitive training</kwd><kwd>Model selection</kwd><kwd>Regularized regression</kwd><kwd>LASSO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Targeted cognitive training (TCT) of auditory processing and verbal working memory for schizophrenia has shown efficacy for improving cognition (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2009</xref>), but little is understood about which patient factors predict positive outcomes. Previous meta-analytic work suggests that symptoms may be predictive of response to cognitive remediation more broadly (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Wykes et al., 2011</xref>), though other findings suggest that baseline cognition and other treatment factors may also predict response (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Kurtz et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fiszdon et al., 2005</xref>; Joanna M <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fiszdon et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Fiszdon et al., 2006b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Vita et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Lindenmayer et al., 2017</xref>). In TCT, baseline reward anticipation was associated with improvements in verbal memory as well as global cognition (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2014</xref>), and improvement in auditory processing speed is also a predictor of subsequent cognitive improvements (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Biagianti et al., 2016</xref>). However, the pre-treatment cognitive and demographic profile of individuals who may benefit from this intervention remains an open question. Efforts to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatric populations including schizophrenia remains a critical goal, especially as psychiatry as a field continues to pursue personalized interventions (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">McGorry, 2013</xref>). However, developing predictive models for psychiatric treatment and outcome poses numerous challenges, and novel analytic tools will likely be required to solve these problems.</p><p id="p0010">Previous work to identify variables predictive of cognitive training outcomes in schizophrenia has been limited by problems with multiple comparisons. Despite numerous clinical trials collecting a wealth of data on measures including cognition, functioning, symptomology, and demographics, there is often insufficient power to test each variable, and few a priori predictions to guide principled analyses. Moreover, building predictive models using linear regression with this type of data raises concerns of &#x0201c;over-fitting,&#x0201d; where inflated <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values may adequately characterize variance in a single dataset, but hamper its predictive ability in the general population. These challenges have therefore given way to more advanced and iterative statistical procedures, that allow for the inclusion of large numbers of predictor variables, without being penalized for their inclusion.</p><p id="p0015">Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is one such regression procedure that allows for testing large numbers of predictor variables (including when the number of predictors is greater than N) while minimizing the model error as well as minimizing the risk of over-fitting (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>). LASSO has been previously used to examine questions regarding genetics (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2009</xref>), neuroimaging (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Shimizu et al., 2015</xref>), and clinical outcomes (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bertocci et al., 2016</xref>). The current study seeks to use LASSO to identify a model of baseline cognitive, functional, symptom, and demographic factors that may be predictive of response to TCT in recent onset schizophrenia (SZ); such information could guide personalized treatments for this population. Here we re-examine data from 42 SZ patients who underwent 40&#x000a0;h of targeted cognitive training (TCT) of auditory processing and working memory. Participants were examined at baseline on the basis of global cognition, symptoms, functioning, estimated intelligence quotient (IQ), duration of illness, and demographic variables including age, gender, and education attainment. Previous findings in these participants suggested that the treatment elicited improvement on measures of verbal memory, problem solving, and global cognition (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesized that LASSO would more adequately identify a model predictive of global cognitive improvement (measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery) in response to TCT, compared to simple correlation or multiple regression models.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="p0020">Participants in the current study included 43 individuals randomized to the active treatment group (TCT) of a study described previously (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2014</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Clinicaltrials.gov" id="ir0005">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NTC00694889). Briefly, patients with recent onset SZ were recruited from the Early Psychosis Clinics at the University of California, San Francisco and the University of California, Davis. Participants were required to meet the following criteria: (1) Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) confirmed diagnosis of SZ or schizoaffective disorder; (2) recent onset of psychotic episode within the last 5&#x000a0;years (M&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18.81; SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15.45); (3) good general physical health; (4) age between 14 and 30&#x000a0;years old; (5) fluent and proficient in English; (6) IQ of 70 or greater; (7) no known neurological disorder; (8) no substance dependence in the past year. All eligible participants had achieved outpatient status for at least 3&#x000a0;months, and were stable on psychiatric medications. Participants 18 and older provided informed consent, while participants under 18 provided assent as well as legal parent/guardian consent. All consenting and baseline assessment procedures were conducted prior to random assignment to the training condition. One participant was subsequently removed due to missing clinical data. All study procedures were approved by the IRBs at the University of California, San Francisco and University of California, Davis.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Training procedure</title><p id="p0025">Participants were loaned a laptop computer to complete the intervention independently at home. Individuals were asked to participate for 40&#x000a0;h over the course of 8&#x000a0;weeks (1&#x000a0;h/day, 5&#x000a0;days/week). Participants were contacted 1&#x02013;2 times per week by telephone to check in on progress, in addition to offering coaching/support if there were difficulties completing the training. Check-in appointments were also conducted after every 10 sessions, where participants were paid $5 for each completed session, an additional $20 for 10 completed sessions, and $30 after completing 40&#x000a0;h of training. Participants also received $20 for each pre- or post-training assessment. TCT consisted of adaptive computerized exercises designed to improve the speed and accuracy of early auditory processing while engaging in auditory and verbal working memory tasks (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2009</xref>), and was provided by Posit Science, Inc. Exercises are individually adaptive, and designed to dynamically shift the difficulty level to maintain an 80&#x02013;85% accuracy rate. During a one-hour session, each participant completed four to six exercises, with their compliance monitored via remote upload of their data. Participants completed on average 32.93&#x000a0;h of training (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10.45), over the course of the 8&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Assessment procedures</title><p id="p0030">Assessments were conducted blind to group assignment immediately before and after TCT.

To do so, we used Pearson correlations to determine whether baseline measures related to change in global cognition (post-pre). Next we entered all measures into a general linear model to examine relationships holding all other variables constant. We then used the &#x02018;GLMNET&#x02019; package in R (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>) to perform a LASSO regression, which is an extension of generalized regression that minimizes residual sum of squares by shrinking some coefficients to zero, thereby eliminating them from the model (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>). This allows for stable model selection and regression without over-fitting.</p><p id="p0040">Here we carry out a 10-fold cross validation of LASSO to produce an optimal tuning parameter (minimum value of lambda) that would minimize the cross-validated error and also protect against tests already run by the model. The final model retained all predictors with coefficients not equal to zero. Though inferential statistics for LASSO have been proposed (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Lockhart et al., 2014</xref>), these estimates are vulnerable to substantial bias, and are therefore subject to further study and not included current statistical packages. Instead we conduct a post-hoc linear regression with the retained predictors to estimate inferential statistics, to compare to the previous full model.</p><p id="p0045">We also sought to determine whether there was a curvilinear relationship between change in global cognition and any of the predictors or their interactions. We constructed the second order terms from the 10 original predictors, resulting in a new set of predictors consisting of 75 variables (10 original variables, 10 variables that were the square of the original variables, and 55 interaction terms between the original variables). We again used the 10-fold cross validation LASSO procedure to identify the non-zero coefficients. We followed up this analysis with another linear regression that also included any polynomial terms. Last, we conducted post-hoc LASSO analyses separating out the individual cognitive domains as predictors (i.e. speed of processing, verbal working memory, visual working memory, and problem solving) as opposed to using the global cognition score. We also tested the LASSO model in subjects randomized to the study's computer game control condition (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43) to determine whether observed changes in cognition may be reflecting regression to the mean. Finally, we also tested the cross-validated LASSO model in a separate sample of chronic schizophrenia patients (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;29) who underwent TCT in a related randomized controlled trial (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p id="p0050">Pearson correlations between all baseline measures and change in global cognition were conducted.

We assessed the correlation between baseline global cognition and change in global cognition in the parent study's computer games control group (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43) (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2014</xref>) and found no significant relationship (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.04; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.78).

SZ patients with lower baseline global cognition scores and more years of education were found to have greater improvements in global cognition following TCT. This relationship was not observed in a post-hoc analysis of the individuals randomized to undergo a computer games control condition. We also found that these relationships were even more robust when accounting for the quadratic relationships between baseline global cognition and change in this measure. A model with baseline education, baseline squared global cognition score, and an interaction between baseline education and gender was found to further improve model fit. We also establish cross validation of LASSO regression as a viable method for predicting treatment outcome in a psychiatric population. Though this method has been established in genetic and neuroimaging research, it is gaining prominence in the examination of psychological data for the purposes of behavioral predictions (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017</xref>). Here we show here that it may be appropriately used to model psychiatric outcomes data, and may be crucial tool in computational approaches to psychiatric research.</p><p id="p0070">Previous work has demonstrated that baseline cognitive status plays a predictive role in response to domain-focused cognitive remediation and strategy coaching interventions for SZ. These studies find that higher baseline cognitive status is predictive of response to treatment (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Kurtz et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Medalia and Richardson, 2005</xref>; J M <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fiszdon et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Fiszdon et al., 2006b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Lindenmayer et al., 2017</xref>), possibly indicating that &#x0201c;the rich get richer&#x0201d; in response to such an intervention. In contrast, interventions that use a compensatory skill learning or decision-making heuristic training approach have demonstrated that lower baseline cognition is predictive of stronger cognitive gains following the intervention (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Rodewald et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Twamley et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="p0075">The current study also suggests that lower baseline cognition is predictive of improvement in recent onset SZ patients in response to intensive training that targets early auditory processing and working memory operations. This indicates that TCT may be an ideal intervention for lower functioning individuals. Differing from both the domain-focused training, as well as compensatory cognitive remediation approaches, TCT emphasizes training of early phases of perceptual processing while simultaneously requiring close engagement of attentional control and prefrontal predictive and response selection operations. This intervention has been demonstrated to evoke neuroplasticity in sensory (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Dale et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Popov et al., 2011</xref>), subcortical (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Ramsay et al., 2017</xref>), and higher-order (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>) cortical regions.</p><p id="p0080">Education also appears to be a critical factor predictive of response to treatment, suggesting that those who have experienced higher levels of education (i.e. some college) may be more responsive to TCT than those with lower educational attainment. This has been shown in studies examining cognitive remediation for schizophrenia (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Lindenmayer et al., 2017</xref>), perhaps indicating that individuals with more practical academic skills (i.e. time management, task planning, goal setting) are likely to benefit more from cognitive training interventions. These findings may also be consistent with the &#x02018;cognitive reserve hypothesis,&#x02019; which proposes that individuals with higher IQ, occupational, or educational attainment show more resilience to neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Barnett et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Koenen et al., 2009</xref>). Individuals with more educational attainment, and subsequent cognitive reserve, may also have more neuroplastic capacity, which has been demonstrated in healthy older adults (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Barulli and Stern, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f6;vd&#x000e9;n et al., 2010</xref>). This could be contributing to mechanisms that support neuroplasticity in response to TCT and similar interventions for schizophrenia (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Ramsay and MacDonald, 2015</xref>). Numerous factors contribute to high school and college dropout in individuals with schizophrenia (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Goulding et al., 2010</xref>), but less is known about factors that may promote resilience in an academic setting. Overall these and other findings suggest that higher education can contribute to training outcomes, and should be considered when making clinical recommendations. However, future studies will be required to examine this effect further.</p><p id="p0085">Finally, though not significant in the linear regression model itself, gender was observed to contribute to overall fit, suggesting that females had slightly better outcomes in response to TCT. This is largely consistent with literature indicating that males with schizophrenia have poorer premorbid adjustment and more severe negative symptoms, possibly contributing to poorer outcomes overall (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abel et al., 2010</xref>). Future studies will be required to more carefully parse gender differences in response to TCT interventions for schizophrenia, and how this may influence cognition.</p><p id="p0090">In the current study the LASSO model proved not to be predictive when breaking down cognition by individual domains. No variables survived the LASSO procedure when including speed of processing, verbal working memory, visual working memory, or problem solving individually. This may suggest that a &#x0201c;general&#x0201d; cognitive factor is better suited to predict global cognitive improvements, which is consistent with the observation that cognitive disruptions in schizophrenia are characterized by a &#x0201c;generalized deficit&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Mohamed et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies will be required to parse out the relative contributions of baseline abilities within different cognitive domains and their mediating effects on cognitive improvement following TCT. Relatedly, we note that while lower baseline cognitive scores might naturally move closer to the average upon retest, we did not observe this relationship in the post-hoc analysis of the control condition. Therefore, we can more confidently conclude that improvements in response to the intervention did not simply reflect a regression to the mean, and are likely a reflection of the TCT more specifically.</p><p id="p0095">Last, we highlight that these results were limited to patients with recent onset schizophrenia, mostly within the first 5&#x000a0;years of the illness. While meta-analytic findings suggest that there are few differences between early and chronic schizophrenia with regard to cognitive training treatment response (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Revell et al., 2015</xref>), some specific interventions have observed more generalized and robust influence on cognition in early schizophrenia patients (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bowie et al., 2014</xref>). In the current study, we applied the identified model to a separate cognitive training dataset that examined chronic schizophrenia patients, and found that the relationship between baseline cognition, education, and gender was not significant. This indicates that the current model's predictive ability is more relevant in people early in the illness course, and may support the hypothesis that younger individuals may be more receptive to intensive neuroplasticity-based interventions (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Wykes et al., 2009</xref>). Future work will be required to extend the current findings and test the model's predictive capacity in other samples and to determine its clinical utility.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p id="p0100">The training software used in this study was supplied free of charge by Posit Science.
