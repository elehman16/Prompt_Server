Some antimuscarinics, such as fesoterodine, are available in two doses, allowing the physician to individually titrate dosage for optimal efficacy and manageable side effects <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.

Patient-reported outcomes measuring bladder-related problems, urgency, symptom bother, and HRQL were significantly improved in these subjects, suggesting that the improvements with fesoterodine 8&#x000a0;mg were clinically meaningful.</p><p>The present results are consistent with two head-to-head prospective studies comparing fesoterodine 8&#x000a0;mg with tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.

However, the incidence of dry mouth for fesoterodine-treated subjects (28%) <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was higher than in the present study (16.6%).These data are also consistent with an open-label, flexible-dose study of fesoterodine in subjects with OAB who reported dissatisfaction with tolterodine treatment (ER or immediate-release) within the previous 2&#x000a0;years <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Significant improvements from baseline to week 12 were observed in UUI episodes, micturitions, urgency episodes, and scores on the PPBC and OAB-q with fesoterodine. Approximately, 80% of subjects who were dissatisfied with previous tolterodine treatment reported being &#x02018;satisfied&#x02019; or &#x02018;very satisfied&#x02019; with flexible-dose fesoterodine treatment.</p><p>Studies with other antimuscarinic agents have also shown that subjects with OAB may be successfully treated with one antimuscarinic after unsuccessful treatment with another <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. These results, together with results from the present study, suggest that switching medication is a valid approach for patients who fail to achieve OAB symptom resolution with antimuscarinic pharmacotherapy.</p><p>As noted above, several studies provide evidence that the highest approved dose of fesoterodine (8&#x000a0;mg) is significantly more effective than the highest approved dose of tolterodine ER (4&#x000a0;mg, which is the only approved dose of tolterodine ER for most OAB populations) <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In addition, the results of a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis demonstrate that fesoterodine 8&#x000a0;mg is significantly more effective in improving UUI episodes and other diary variables than fesoterodine 4&#x000a0;mg <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. This is important, as a dose-response effect for UUI has not been demonstrated for most antimuscarinic agents with multiple approved doses <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>Many patients stop taking their OAB medication because the drug &#x02018;didn't work as expected&#x02019; or because of side effects <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. The availability of flexible dosing with newer antimuscarinic medications affords additional treatment options when current antimuscarinic treatment fails, because clinicians can adjust patients' dosage in an attempt to achieve favourable efficacy and tolerability before considering more invasive treatment options <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Data for three flexible-dose fesoterodine studies, in which subjects were initiated on the 4-mg dose and had the opportunity to escalate to the 8-mg dose based on efficacy and tolerability, have been analysed after stratification by subjects' dose escalation status <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.

These findings underscore the importance of having an alternative antimuscarinic option or dose escalation when there is a suboptimal response to the first antimuscarinic medication.</p><p>Strengths of this study include that it was a prospectively designed, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability of fesoterodine 8&#x000a0;mg in a population with a predefined suboptimal response to tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg. In contrast to previous &#x02018;switching&#x02019; studies, this study was unique in identifying a suboptimal response by analysing UUI data before randomisation. In addition, the evaluation of efficacy at early time points and the incorporation of patient-reported outcomes provided measures of the onset and achievement of OAB symptom relief, which are important to patients and critical factors in their decision on whether to continue treatment. The use of a 2-week run-in period and a threshold of a &#x02264;&#x000a0;50% reduction in UUI episodes to identify suboptimal responders to tolterodine ER are supported by previous evidence <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Tolterodine ER was not included as an active comparator because the greater efficacy of fesoterodine 8&#x000a0;mg vs. tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg has been demonstrated previously <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.</p><p>This study was limited by the measurement of tolterodine treatment response based only on UUI episodes/24&#x000a0;h; other symptoms may also have demonstrated a suboptimal response to treatment with tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg. It is possible that a longer run-in period may have captured additional responders to tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg, although the majority of response is known to occur within the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. In a 12-week, prospective, open-label study of tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg in 1138 adult subjects with OAB who were either OAB treatment na&#x000ef;ve or had previously received OAB treatment other than tolterodine, the median percentage change from baseline in UUI episodes was assessed at weeks 1, 4 and 12 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. After week 1 of tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg treatment, 72% of the maximum reduction in UUI episodes was demonstrated in both treatment-na&#x000ef;ve and previously treated patients. In a subsequent <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the data from this study, the onset of treatment efficacy was assessed based on changes in UUI episodes for treatment days 5, 6 and 7 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. For subjects with &#x02265;&#x000a0;1 UUI episodes at baseline, the median percentage decrease from baseline in UUI episodes was 50% at day 5, 67% at day 6, and 75% at day 7 of tolterodine ER treatment (all p<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.0001 vs. baseline). Using a 50% reduction in UUI episodes to define responders, the responder rate was 58% on day 5, 69% on day 6, and 71% on day 7 of tolterodine ER treatment. These results indicating that subjects with OAB experience significant improvements in UUI episodes and high responder rates, based on a 50% reduction threshold, as early as week 1 of treatment with tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg supported the 2-week duration of the open-label run-in period in the present study. On balance, the 2-week run-in period allowed a pragmatic approach to patient enrolment while maintaining a meaningful period for assessment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Subjects with OAB who responded suboptimally to tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg achieved significant improvements in UUI episodes after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with fesoterodine 8&#x000a0;mg vs. placebo.
