Their progress, however, has been minimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and uneven across countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Unless drastic improvement is attained, most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa will not meet MDGs 4 and 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In this context, global health agencies have advocated continuum of care (CoC) as a new paradigm to overcome MNCH challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The term CoC is well known in nursing for palliative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the public health area, the concept of CoC has been used in HIV and AIDS care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], linking HIV diagnosis, care initiation, therapy retention, and low viral load maintenance. However, for MNCH, the definition of CoC has not yet been clearly established, although several attempts have been made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. So far, CoC has been explained by sequential time and space dimensions of MNCH activities. The time dimension lasts from pre-pregnancy for women through childhood. The space dimension links homes and communities through health facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The CoC in MNCH provided a framework to improve health care for both women and their children by implementing integrated interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Such intervention packages addressed different time stages in the CoC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additionally, single interventions were also efficacious for both women and their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Examples include newborn care preparedness by community-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], use of insecticide-treated nets in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and iron-folic acid supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, financially focused strategies attempted to increase the demand for MNCH health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In the space dimension, the emphasized linkage is between the home and the first-level facility or the hospital. In most African countries, newborns are vulnerable to care delays and many newborn deaths occur at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, interventions provided appropriate care at home, strengthened health system supports, and improved household and community practices and actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For both women and children, positive impacts were identified by training traditional birth attendants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and increasing emergency referral systems in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although these interventions improved MNCH outcomes, long-term sustainability remains a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and it is unclear whether they were effective in &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; settings. To make the best use of the available interventions, we need to know how they work in such settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, it is unclear whether health outcomes will be improved by filling the gaps in the CoC. A study estimated that neonatal mortality would be reduced by between 36 and 67% if all standard MNCH care packages (such as the antenatal care (ANC) package, skilled maternal and immediate newborn care package, and emergency obstetric care package) covered 90% of pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, evidence-based studies are scarce that demonstrate the effectiveness of improved CoC on health outcomes by addressing these gaps.</p><p>In 2010, the Japanese government presented new global health initiatives at the United Nations High-Level Plenary Meeting on MDGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The statement expressed a strategy to accelerate Japan&#x02019;s concerted efforts to help achieve health-related MDGs in developing countries, particularly for maternal and child health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The initiative comprised a model program, the Ghana Ensure Mothers and Babies Regular Access to Care (EMBRACE) program. This program exploits a package of effective interventions to improve the health of mothers and children through the CoC approach. A special feature of the initiative was the Japanese government&#x02019;s clear intention to implement an &#x02018;evidence-based intervention&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. To extend the benefits of the Ghana EMBRACE initiative and evidence-based practices in health policy, the Ghana EMBRACE Implementation Research Project was launched in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The project team comprised researchers from the University of Tokyo and the Ghana Health Service (GHS), including Dodowa, Kintampo, and Navrongo Health Research Centres (HRC). Based on formative research results, the project team developed interventions and will implement them in three Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) sites in Ghana.</p><p>Ghana is one of the countries that face a significant challenge to improving MNCH status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Although it has made progress in different HDSS sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], according to the currently available evidence, Ghana is not on track to meet these MDGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In particular, MNCH status is poor in remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and care-seeking decisions are delayed for ill mothers and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Neonatal death is associated with maternal factors such as multiple gestations and inadequate birth spacing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Additionally, mothers and children do not use all MNCH services continuously. In particular, mothers pay less attention to newborn care. In almost half of home deliveries, postnatal care (PNC) was not completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Approximately 40% of mothers who delivered at home reported that they received PNC for themselves, while only 16% reported receiving it for their newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. However, when mothers appropriately used the antenatal, delivery, and postnatal health services, the risk of neonatal death was reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>MNCH is often influenced by a complex interaction of economic, financial, social, cultural, and clinical factors. Ghana has multiple localities formed by the particular characteristics of each area. Poor infrastructure often limits access to emergency care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In certain areas, a traditional illness, <italic>asram</italic>, could be one cause of care-seeking delay for ill children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The diversity of local characteristics implies the need for flexibility in health service provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This explains why implementation trials should be conducted in Ghana in different actual settings.</p><p>This study proposes specific objectives for the intervention and implementation phases. The intervention objective is to evaluate the impact of increased CoC completion on MNCH status in Ghana. The implementation objective is to evaluate intervention acceptability in different settings in Ghana.</p><p>In light of pragmatic situations in the intervention settings, we included the following as CoC components:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>ANC delivered at least four times by MNCH health service providers at a health facility, in the community, or at home;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Delivery assisted by skilled birth attendants (SBAs); and</p></list-item><list-item><p>PNC delivered three times by MNCH health service providers at a health facility, in the community, or at home, within 48&#x000a0;hours, at seven days, and at six weeks postpartum.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In this study design, we will assess the effects of both an intervention package and its implementation process. An effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial is an innovative design to shorten the time from intervention development through its implementation in a real-world setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. This study design is categorized into three types. The type one design focuses on testing the intervention while observing or gathering information on the implementation. The type two design simultaneously tests the intervention and its implementation strategy. The type three design focuses more on testing implementation strategy while observing or gathering information on intervention outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In our study, we will adopt the type two hybrid design to determine both the impact of the intervention on CoC completion in MNCH and the acceptability of the implementation strategy by GHS.</p><p>This design will assess the effectiveness of intervention and implementation by using cluster randomized allocation to divide participants into intervention and control arms. For trial sustainability and scalability, we will consider site-specific contexts in designing interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. We will conduct the study in three stages: baseline, implementation, and follow-up phases. Acceptability of the trials will also be evaluated through monitoring ongoing trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study site</title><p>We will conduct the study at three different sites in Ghana; Dodowa (Greater Accra region), Kintampo (Brong-Ahafo region), and Navrongo (Upper East region), where the GHS runs HDSS sites (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These three sites were selected because highly reliable HDSS data are available. HDSS involves semi-annual recording of vital demographic events occurring among residents of all households in the HDSS area: pregnancies, births, deaths, and migration. Other data are also collected and updated regularly, such as economic status, morbidity, and vaccination.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

It is located about 40 kilometers away from Accra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Consequently, pregnant women from this site often prefer to deliver at health facilities in Accra. Service deliveries are challenging since the site land size covers about 40.5% of the Greater Accra region. Most of the communities are scattered, containing small populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p>At the Kintampo HDSS site, the surveillance population was approximately 200,000 in 2011. This site is a multi-ethnic area and farming is the most important economic activity. Apart from the central area, most villages are not supplied with electricity and are reached by dirt roads. Access to health facilities is a challenge in Kintampo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], and a home delivery is often the first choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p>At the Navrongo HDSS site, the surveillance population was approximately 153,000 in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Navrongo is the first area where the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) program was launched in Ghana. In that context, Community Health Officers (CHOs) have contributed to improving health status in communities. Among the three HDSS sites, only Navrongo is on track to achieve MDG 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>As the MNCH services are national priority areas in Ghana, various MNCH interventions have been implemented in the three HDSS sites. Representative interventions include Mobile Technology for Community Health (MoTeCH, between 2009 and 2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], Quality of prenatal and maternal care (Qualmat, between 2009 and 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], and Ghana Essential Health Interventions Programme (GEHIP, between 2009 and 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] in Navrongo; early neonatal vitamin A supplementation in improving child survival (Neovita, between 2010 and 2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and Newborn home intervention study project (Newhints, between 2008 and 2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] in Kintampo; and the conditional cash transfer project (GLST, between 2009 and 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] and Neonatal Quality Improvement Programme (NQIP, between 2011 and 2012) in Dodowa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization and allocation</title><p>Each HDSS site contains two districts, and the districts comprise multiple sub-districts, which are the minimum health administration units in Ghana. We defined the sub-district as a cluster unit. Only Jema and Dumso (which used to be a part of Jema) sub-districts in the Kintampo site were combined to form a cluster. In the three HDSS sites, a total of 36 sub-districts were included. Of them, we excluded four sub-districts of Navrongo where another MNCH project is planned. In total, we chose 32 clusters for our study targets (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>): eight clusters in Dodowa, 12 clusters in Kintampo, and 12 clusters in Navrongo. We allocated half of the sub-districts to the intervention arm and the other half to the control arm. At least one hospital was allocated to the intervention arm in each site, since the majority of facility deliveries are done in hospitals (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

To address the actual MNCH conditions in Ghana and site-specific cultural differences in delivery location, geographic conditions, and health system capacity, we developed the following four interventions: the utilization of the CoC card (A-1), CoC orientation (A-2), 24-hour health facility retention of mothers and newborns after delivery (B-1), and PNC by home visits (B-2). We will implement A-1, A-2, and B-2 interventions in all three HDSS sites. However, B-1 will be implemented only in Dodowa and Navrongo because the number of midwives is not enough in Kintampo.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

In most of the primary level health facilities, basic MNCH services will be provided. The delivery and laboratory services are provided mainly in the secondary and tertiary level health facilities. ANC services include general check-ups for mothers, urine tests, hemoglobin tests, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, nutritional support, tetanus toxoid immunization, and health education for birth preparedness and maternal complications. Delivery services include skilled delivery, facility referral, and emergency obstetric care. PNC services include general check-ups for mothers and children, body weights, infant vaccinations, hemoglobin tests, nutritional support, health education for breastfeeding and child care, and family planning counselling. Home visit check-ups are also provided, however, home visit PNC within 48&#x000a0;hours is poorly adopted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>A-1 Utilization of the continuum of care card</title><p>In addition to the maternal health record book, health service providers will provide the MNCH CoC card to all women who receive ANC, delivery, and PNC assisted by SBAs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). When these women receive follow-up services, health service providers place a sticker on the card to show that they complied with the CoC; this includes four ANC visits, delivery assisted by SBAs, and three PNC visits (within 48&#x000a0;hours, at seven days, and at six weeks after delivery). Additionally, health service providers record on the CoC card: provision of essential services and health education; blood tests for assessing hemoglobin, blood group, and Rhesus factor; intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) for malaria; tetanus toxoid immunization; early initiating and exclusive breastfeeding; family planning; preparing items for delivery and baby; arrangement of transportation for delivery, caregiver, and calling health service providers after delivery; and the presence of danger signs during pregnancy and after delivery for mother and newborn.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>

First, we will complete the training of trainers for supervisors of District Health Management Teams (DHMT) and Sub-District Health Management Teams (SDHMT). The trained supervisors will then conduct orientations for health service providers at hospitals, health centers, CHPS, and private clinics. We will focus mainly on introducing MNCH CoC concepts, their importance, the extent to which the MNCH CoC card could be used, and the protocols of other interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>B-1 24-hour health facility retention of mothers and newborns after delivery</title><p>In this intervention, we will encourage mothers to stay with their newborns at health facilities after delivery for at least 24&#x000a0;hours for PNC. This intervention targets only the health facilities where SBAs provide delivery services. In this intervention, mothers and newborns will receive necessary care in a health facility during the 24&#x000a0;hours after delivery. During their stay, we will provide them nutritious drink supplements (for example, Milo (Nestl&#x000e9; S.A., Vevey, Switzerland)). After ensuring all of the necessary health check points, health service providers will discharge them if neither mothers nor babies show any danger signs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>B-2 Postnatal care by home visits</title><p>We will encourage CHOs to visit mothers and newborns for PNC within 48 hours after delivery. This intervention is composed of two steps. The first step is delivery notification; when home delivery occurs, community health volunteers, community key informants, or traditional birth attendants will inform the CHOs that the labor or delivery occurred in the community. The second step is PNC by home visits; CHOs visit mothers and newborns for PNC within 48 hours postpartum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Procurement</title><p>Where necessary, we will provide beds for postpartum rest, rechargeable lamps or solar lanterns, torchlights for all B-1 intervention facilities, and motorbikes for the B-2 intervention facilities. We will also provide care materials for both eligible categories of health facility such as blood pressure apparatus for mothers and children, stethoscopes, thermometers, and pen lights.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Supportive activities</title><p>We will organize three types of supportive activities before the start of the intervention to implement the interventions smoothly into the communities. They include stakeholder meetings, community leader meetings, and community durbars. We will organize the stakeholder meetings in both the intervention and control arms. To avoid contamination of the intervention effect, the community leader meetings and community durbars will be held only in the intervention arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Monitoring</title><p>In each HRC, we will form an intervention monitoring team. This team is responsible for monthly monitoring of all implementation activities of health service providers and for supervision of the DHMT/SDHMT supervisors. The EMBRACE researchers will meet monthly to discuss the issues raised during the monitoring and provide feedback to the monitoring team and the DHMT/SDHMT supervisors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data collection</title><p>We will assess the impact of the intervention by interview survey using a semi-structured questionnaire and HDSS data. We will also assess the acceptability of the implementation process by monthly monitoring and supervision, and by conducting a survey of eligible women at the HDSS sites. Data managers of the HRCs will review all of the collected data for accuracy and completion. Data will be entered into computers twice, using Visual FoxPro software (Microsoft, Washington, United States). Verification checks will be done to correct any discrepancies in records.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Evaluation of intervention efficacy</title><p>We will assess the intervention efficacy using both survey and HDSS data, as described below:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>By survey: to assess the intervention impact, we will conduct the interview survey at baseline and follow-up periods for sampled eligible women. For each survey, we will recruit approximately 500 women from each HDSS site (in total, 1,500 women for each survey). We will select them through the HRC pregnancy registers using the following two steps: (a) creating geographical units (GU) in proportion with the population size of the cluster and selecting 50 GUs from each HDSS site, and (b) selecting 10 eligible women from each GU. We will select the GUs and women using computer-generated random numbers.</p><p>The questionnaire items are: sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics; MNCH services uptake; health complications during pregnancy, at delivery, and during postnatal period; pregnancy outcomes; and care-seeking behaviors. To control for the effects of health care provider and health facility characteristics on the study outcome, we will conduct health care provider assessment and health facility assessment at the baseline survey for both intervention and control arms. The data we will collect includes information on service provision, knowledge of CoC, supervision, community support, job satisfaction at health care provider level, infrastructure, human resources, MNCH service availability, annual statistics of key MNCH indicators, current practice of retaining mother and newborn for the first 24&#x000a0;hours, and provision of PNC by home visit within 48&#x000a0;hours postpartum.</p><p>Prior to the survey, we will complete training for research assistants at each site. The EMBRACE researchers will develop the survey questionnaire through several workshops based on the formative research questionnaire. We will develop the questionnaire in English and the research assistants will interpret it orally when they conduct interviews with participants. As the local languages are not always written, we will not use translated questionnaires. The trained research assistants will pre-test the questionnaire with 20 eligible women and the researchers will revise it accordingly.</p></list-item><list-item><p>By HDSS data: we will also obtain the HDSS data to assess the perinatal mortality rate (PMR) and the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) of HDSS sites.

The secondary outcomes include the PNC rate within 48&#x000a0;hours, the complication rate requiring mothers&#x02019; and newborns' hospitalizations, and the PMR and NMR. The PMR is defined as fetal deaths during any period of pregnancy and newborn deaths within seven completed days after birth.

At first, to measure the CoC completion rate, we used the interview survey and calculated a total of 1,500 women for the sample size. Second, to measure the NMR, we used a HDSS data and calculated a total of 15,000 women for the sample size.</p><p>To calculate the sample size of the CoC completion rate, we used the data of the formative research collected in the previous year in the same sites. According to the data, the CoC completion rate was 8.0%. The coverage of four ANC visits, delivery attended by SBAs, PNC within 48&#x000a0;hours postpartum, and PNC at two weeks were 86.6%, 75.8%, 13.0%, and 60.0%, respectively. The lowest coverage was identified at PNC within 48&#x000a0;hours postpartum, and if this coverage increases to more than that of PNC at two weeks, the CoC completion rate would also increase to 60.0%. For that, we estimated that coverage of four ANC visits would be improved from 86.6 to 95.0%, and calculated the sample size using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.02675 determined in the formative research. The ICC was estimated by considering the differences in the sizes of clusters using multilevel regression with a random intercept at the cluster level. The confidence interval (CI) was 95%, and power was 80%. Adding 10% for potential attrition, the total sample size was calculated at 1,500 for each baseline and follow-up survey period. Therefore, we estimated approximately a 500-person sample size for each HDSS site (1,500 in total).</p><p>In addition to the interview survey, we will also use the HDSS data to evaluate the effect of the interventions on perinatal and neonatal mortality. For the baseline and follow-up survey periods, HDSS data will capture 15,000 pregnancy cases, respectively. The sample size was estimated according to the following assumptions: a 25% reduction of PMR (from 31 to 23 per 1,000 pregnancies), with 95% CI, 80% power, 32 clusters, and an ICC of 0.0007256. The ICC was based on previous MNCH research conducted in the study area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and the sample size was calculated at 13,548. In addition, we added 10% for potential attrition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Continuum of care completion and morbidity</title><p>We will conduct baseline and follow-up interview surveys to assess changes in each outcome in both the intervention and control arms. To minimize overestimation of intervention impact, we will estimate all intervention impact outcomes with an intention-to-treat analysis. In this analysis, individuals&#x02019; outcome data are analyzed according to the allocated arm regardless of the place where they received care. Also, all eligible individuals are included in the analysis regardless of whether they provided outcome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].</p><p>We will conduct a descriptive analysis to assess the distribution of various factors related to the mothers and newborns under study. To evaluate the average effectiveness of interventions on CoC completion, we will apply the generalized estimating equations model with both continuous and binary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. This model uses data on all mothers, including those with incomplete data, over the period from 16&#x000a0;weeks of pregnancy to six weeks postpartum. Adjustment factors include basic demographic characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, and facility characteristics. The data analysis will mostly be conducted using Stata version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, United States).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Mortality rate</title><p>PMR and NMR will be calculated based on the number of live births and perinatal deaths or neonatal deaths as a total of the three HDSS sites, as well as at each HDSS site.

The interventions will be implemented in close consultation with local health administrative offices that have direct responsibility for supervising health facilities. Ongoing feedback will be provided through routine supervision. Additionally, we developed the study materials in close cooperation with policymakers in Ghana.</p><p>The study has limitations. First, the short intervention period may limit the power to fully measure the intervention and implementation impacts. The period is short because we needed repeated discussions to develop intervention packages aimed at a sustainable and scalable intervention design in a real-world setting. The project takes into account the next scale-up phase which will likely last years, during which the impacts could be measured more accurately. To reduce this limitation, we adopted the effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial that is an advantageous study design for time efficiency that enables rapid scaling of the intervention up to the national MNCH service standard. Second, our intervention impacts could be affected by previous or current projects implemented at the HDSS sites. To minimize it, we will control the potential effect for data analysis and carefully discuss the study findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial was registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register on 3 September 2014 (ISRCTN90618993).
