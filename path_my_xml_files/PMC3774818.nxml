Participants were randomly allocated to wear four devices in a different order. Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised (&#x0003c;20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250 to 350 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Devices were each worn for five weeks, with treatment phases being separated by one week wash-out periods. The primary outcome measured was pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Secondary pain measures were the McGill Pain Questionnaire and tender joint count. Inflammation was assessed using C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity blood tests and by swollen joint count. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Disability Index). Disease activity and medication use was also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>65 participants provided complete self-report outcome data for all devices, four participants provided partial data.

Rituals involving magnets featured heavily in the astonishing cures of Anton Mesmer during the 18<sup>th</sup> century, which led directly to the development of the controlled clinical trial <xref rid="pone.0071529-Herr1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In 1830, discovery of copper in the blood fostered new beliefs concerning a causal link between copper deficiency and rheumatism <xref rid="pone.0071529-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This resulted in a new system of treatment, referred to as metallotherapy, involving the application of copper discs and other metal objects to the bodies of the afflicted. Yet, whilst early controlled clinical research revealed the effects of both Mesmerism and metallotherapy to be purely psychogenic <xref rid="pone.0071529-Franklin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0071529-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, similar beliefs and practices still persist today. Magnet therapy, in particular, is arguably far more popular now than at any other time in history, with estimated annual worldwide sales exceeding one billion pounds <xref rid="pone.0071529-Weintraub1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0071529-Colbert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Devices, such as bracelets and insoles, which incorporate either permanent magnets or copper, are widely promoted for relieving pain and combating the progression of chronic musculoskeletal disorders, including most notably rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Despite conducting an extensive literature search (of the following data sources from until 31<sup>st</sup> January 2013: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar), we identified only one previous randomised placebo controlled trial on the use of magnet therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The results of this trial, which compared strong versus weak magnets strapped to the knee, showed that there was no statistical difference in pain outcomes between experimental and control groups <xref rid="pone.0071529-Segal1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The primary objective of the present trial was to investigate whether the practice of wearing magnetic wrists straps offers any specific therapeutic benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis in terms of pain, inflammation, physical function, and overall disease activity. A secondary objective of the trial was to establish whether there are specific therapeutic effects of wearing a copper bracelet for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial is publicly available as a supporting document <xref rid="pone.0071529-Richmond1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

These were: (1) an attenuated (i.e. weak) 303 (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30.3) gauss magnetic wrist strap; (2) a demagnetised (&#x0003c;20 gauss) wrist strap; and (3) a copper bracelet. Each device was worn for five weeks, with each treatment phase being separated by a one week wash-out period.</p><p>The desired magnetic strength of the attenuated wrist strap was determined through experimentation. At 250 gauss or above the device would stick to a refrigerator, which was viewed as a prerequisite for adequate blinding. However, it was acknowledged that even a very weak magnet might have some specific therapeutic action, thereby producing a more conservative estimate of treatment effect for the experimental device. We therefore ensured that none of the attenuated devices exceeded 350 gauss to minimise this possibility.</p><p>Plain copper bracelets were used with the intention of serving as an additional placebo. In the case of osteoarthritis, at least, research evidence indicates that such devices may be considered as inert <xref rid="pone.0071529-Shackel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0071529-Richmond2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Participants completed questionnaires at recruitment and at the end of each treatment period. Pain levels were self-reported using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) as the primary outcome measure, ranging from &#x0201c;<italic>no pain</italic>&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;<italic>worst pain ever</italic>&#x0201d;, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0071529-Melzak1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Participants also reported self assessed tender and swollen joint counts <xref rid="pone.0071529-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Physical function was assessed using the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0071529-Bruce1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Additional self reported measures included the Arthritis Helplessness Index and the EQ-5D <xref rid="pone.0071529-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0071529-EuroQol1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Participants attended their doctors' surgery, providing blood samples which were tested for acute phase reactants, C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma viscosity (PV), thereby providing objective outcome data on inflammation. Disease activity was assessed using a 100 mm visual analogue scale, and a composite measure of objective and self report measures, modelled upon the CRP version of Disease Activity Score <xref rid="pone.0071529-RUNMC1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Medication use was monitored using diaries and manual pill counts before and after each treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample Size</title><p>The sample size calculation for this trial indicated that complete primary outcome data from 62 participants would be required to provide 80% power to detect a clinically important difference of 20% in pain outcomes (100 mm visual analogue scale) between devices using a one way analysis of variance (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05). This assumed a mean outcome score of 65 for the demagnetised device, with a difference of &#x02013;6.5 for both the attenuated device and copper bracelet, and -13 for the standard magnetic device, together with a common standard deviation within subjects of 21.7. To allow for attrition we aimed to recruit 69 participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants were randomly allocated to one of 24 unique treatment sequences, which determined the order in which they wore the four devices. Randomisation was performed remotely by an independent researcher using a computer programme and block sizes of 24 to avoid bias in sequence allocation and minimise the possible influence of any period by treatment interaction on observed outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants were informed that the purpose of the trial was to evaluate the effects of magnetic and copper bracelets, and that one or more of the four devices might be a placebo. Further details about the devices were withheld. Standard, attenuated and demagnetised wrist straps appeared visually identical. Devices were transported in sealed foam padded boxes and participants were instructed to prevent the researcher from seeing devices. Participants, researchers and care providers were all blind to the randomisation sequence.</p><p>It was anticipated that some participants would experiment with their devices and discover that one of the wrist straps was not magnetic, which might exaggerate any apparent therapeutic effect of the standard magnetic wrist strap. The demagnetised wrist strap was included partly for this reason, i.e. to help cancel out any specific therapeutic effect associated with the other control devices, and as a dummy device to divert critical attention away from the attenuated wrist strap and copper bracelet as actual placebos, thereby encouraging participants to believe that these latter devices were intended to have some genuine effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All analyses were conducted using two-sided significance tests, with a P-value of 0.05 selected as indicative of statistical significance. The main method used to compare treatment outcomes for the four devices was analysis of variance (ANOVA); using <italic>proc glm</italic> in SAS&#x000ae;, version 9.1. This involved routine testing for period effects using methods described by Senn (pp.171&#x02013;8) <xref rid="pone.0071529-Senn1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Model assumptions were checked prior to analysis, involving log transformation of data where necessary. As a secondary pre-specified step, the analysis of data for the primary outcome measure was adjusted by including medication use as a covariate, and the possibility of treatment by period interactions was also tested.</p><p>The four devices were compared against each other using multiple comparison adjustment (Tukey-Kramer method) to produce estimates for the least square mean difference between the standard magnetic wrist strap and each of the three control devices, together with associated confidence intervals.</p><p>In the case of missing blood test results, missing values were derived where possible through multiple imputation (using <italic>proc mixed</italic>). This used outcome data reported in post treatment questionnaires, including number of swollen joints and participants' global assessment of disease activity.</p><p>All statistical analyses were guided by the principle of intention to treat, with the exception of a secondary pre-specified per protocol analysis.<sup>10</sup> This took into account the effects of non-compliance in cases where participants failed to wear a particular device for 12 hours or more on average per day (i.e. recommended daily use) by removal of associated outcome data.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Development of composite measure of disease activity</title><p>Pooled or composite measures of disease activity are widely employed and advocated for in trials of rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="pone.0071529-Neogi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To provide a more robust outcome measure of treatment effect, we developed a single composite measure of disease activity, modelled upon the latest CRP version of the Disease Activity Score <xref rid="pone.0071529-RUNMC1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, using principle component analysis to examine the correlation coefficients between self assessed baseline measures of tender joints, swollen joints, and disease activity, together with post treatment CRP scores for the demagnetised wrist strap.

The experimental wrist strap, which was typical of other commonly available devices as regards its magnetic properties and method of application, did not appear to outperform: (a) a very weak (300 gauss) magnetic wrist strap; (b) a non-magnetic wrist strap; or (c) a copper bracelet. Whilst estimated 95% confidence intervals for the individual comparison of experimental and control devices indicate that use of the standard magnetic wrist strap may have resulted in a modest reduction in pain, equivalent to 12 mm on a 100 mm pain VAS, they also indicate the possibility that use of this device may have resulted in a slight increase in pain. Despite such uncertainty, these differences may be viewed as small in terms of potential clinical relevance, and further results obtained for secondary pain measures failed to indicate any analgesic benefit whatsoever resulting from magnet therapy. No overall statistically significant differences were found between experimental and control devices for the primary pain outcome measure (i.e. pain VAS), the McGill Pain Questionnaire, self-assessed measures of tender and swollen joints, disease activity status, physical function, feelings of helplessness, or for two different blood tests used for monitoring levels of acute phase reactants as indicators of bodily inflammation, even when controlling for medication use, local rather than systemic inflammation, and non-compliance. Similarly, we did not observe any evidence, of statistical significance or likely clinical importance, to suggest superiority of the copper bracelet over other control devices.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The main strength of this trial was the use of multiple comparators, consisting of two placebos and one dummy device, which controlled for non-specific effects that may arise in studies of magnet therapy due to inadequate blinding and differences in treatment expectancy. Had the trial relied exclusively on a single demagnetised comparator then this might have cast doubt on findings, due to observed difficulties of blinding. In addition, the use of a randomised crossover design ensured that the sample size was sufficiently large to provide the statistical power to detect a relatively small difference in treatment effects. The recruitment target was exceeded and attrition was lower than anticipated. The high questionnaire completion rate was almost certainly attributable to the use of home visits at follow up. A wide range of possible therapeutic outcomes were assessed, including &#x02018;hard&#x02019; outcome data on inflammation, provided by the collection and testing of blood samples. These were established biological measures used routinely for monitoring changes in disease activity for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which may be less affected by non-specific factors than self-reported outcomes <xref rid="pone.0071529-Hrbjartsson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We also incorporated wash out periods as a safeguard against the possible influence of carry over effects, the absence of which appears to be supported by results obtained.</p><p>In terms of potential limitations, one disadvantage of crossover designs is that they are not well suited to lengthy periods of treatment or follow-up. It is therefore possible that devices were not worn for long enough in order to produce a meaningful treatment effect. However, the fact that the standard magnetic device used in this trial was sold commercially with a 30 day satisfaction or money back guarantee suggests that a 5 week treatment programme should have been adequate. Instructions accompanying the device also recommended a minimum of eight hours daily use. Yet, participants reported that on average they had worn devices for more than twice this duration each day. Moreover, conduct of a secondary per protocol failed to alter the findings.</p><p>Another theory that could explain the apparent absence of any meaningful difference in treatment outcomes between devices would be that magnet therapy has local rather than systemic treatment effects. Inclusion of patients whose wrist joints were not badly affected by rheumatoid arthritis might therefore be questioned. However, the vast majority (i.e. 70%) of trial participants did report pain or swelling of the wrists and adjustment for this variable did not affect the results.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Comparison with previous research findings</title><p>The present trial is unique in being the first randomised control trial to investigate the effects of magnets worn on the wrist for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Indeed, only one previous trial has been reported concerning the use of magnet therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, in which 64 participants wore either 1900 gauss or 720 gauss magnets on the knee for a period of one week <xref rid="pone.0071529-Segal1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although the present trial had greater statistical power, involved a much longer period of treatment, and used more appropriate placebo control methods, results obtained from both trials appear generally consistent in showing that a standard magnetic device had no demonstrable effect on pain, inflammation or physical functioning, beyond that of a placebo.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Meaning of the study</title><p>The results of this study may be understood in a number of ways. The most obvious interpretation is that they demonstrate that magnetic wrist straps, and also copper bracelets, have little if any specific therapeutic effects (i.e. beyond those of a placebo) on pain, inflammation, or disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Both the outcome measures and sample size selected for this trial were determined from guidelines issued by the <italic>American Colleague of Rheumatology</italic> (ACR) <xref rid="pone.0071529-Felson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These specified a minimum benchmark of 20% improvement in five out of seven &#x02018;core&#x02019; measures as indicative of a clinically meaningful response to treatment. The fact that we were unable to demonstrate such a difference for the primary outcome measure on its own, nor indeed any of the other core measures employed, strongly suggests that wearing magnetic wrists straps, or copper bracelets, in order to minimise disease progression and alleviate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis is a practice which lacks clinical efficacy.</p><p>An alternative, although somewhat less convincing interpretation, is that the trial was underpowered and the results are inconclusive. In particular, critics may point towards a seemingly small sample size and the risk of committing a type II error through over reliance on data obtained for a pain visual analogue scale, as a relatively crude and insensitive primary outcome measure.</p><p>Certainly, a sample of just 70 participants may appear too small for an adequately powered randomised controlled trial. Yet, in comparison to parallel group designs, crossover trials provide much greater statistical power, because each participant acts as his/her own control, thereby reducing error variance. However, whilst the number of people recruited and successfully followed up in this study was in fact exceptionally large for a crossover trial <xref rid="pone.0071529-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the authors do acknowledge that the present study cannot be considered as definitive.</p><p>Estimated confidence intervals for the difference between devices measured using a 100 mm pain VAS may be viewed as quite broad and include a possible reduction in pain of up to 12 points in favour of the standard magnetic wrist strap. This almost reaches a level specified as clinically important within original sample size calculation.</p><p>Differences for the pain VAS were not however found to be statistically significant. Moreover, it was precisely because of our own concerns regarding the measurement properties of a simple VAS, and to a lesser extent the self-assessed measure of tender joints, that we included a third measure of pain, i.e. the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which did not feature in the ACR recommendations. It is therefore worthwhile noting that, results for these secondary pain measures do not indicate any therapeutic superiority, statistically significant or otherwise, of the standard magnetic wrist strap over the other devices included in this study.</p><p>Importantly, since this study was first conceived, the American College of Rheumatology and the The European League Against Rheumatism have issued joint guidance on and reporting of trials concerning rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="pone.0071529-Felson2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This favours the use of a simplified index-based measure of disease activity, such as that of the composite measure reported in the present paper. This has the advantage of providing a reliable and valid indicator of remission and its use is therefore preferable to exclusive reliance upon any single &#x02018;primary&#x02019; outcome measure. However, results obtained for this composite measure, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0071529-t004">Table 4</xref>, again show no statistically significant difference between the four devices employed in this trial.</p><p>Although it would be inappropriate to infer equivalence between devices based purely on the apparent absence of any statistically significant difference, as measured using a simple pain VAS, the overall consensus of results obtained for the various outcome measures employed within this trial, together with their varying degrees of precision, does tend to suggest that the therapeutic effects of the standard magnetic wrist strap, and also the copper bracelet, may be considered as broadly similar, if not the same, as those of a placebo.</p><p>Whilst replication is advisable, findings from the present trial offer little encouragement for future research concerning the therapeutic efficacy of either magnetic or copper bracelets for rheumatoid arthritis. Given inherent problems of blinding, future trials should seek to employ equally rigorous control methods to counteract the untoward influence of non-specific factors. In particular, the results of this study demonstrate that research participants can readily distinguish between magnetic and non-magnetic devices. Therefore, sole reliance on demagnetised facsimiles as comparators should be avoided in future placebo controlled trials of magnet therapy.</p><p>The findings of this study do not refute the view that both magnetic and copper bracelets are inexpensive, generally safe, or indeed that wearers may perceive some analgesic benefit, albeit if due to psychological placebo effects or regression fallacy. However, the promotion and use of such devices for arthritis may present a significant opportunity cost. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, early diagnosis and suppression of inflammation is essential to minimise joint damage and disability <xref rid="pone.0071529-National1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Yet, the results of this trial fail to provide any support for belief in the anti-inflammatory effects of magnetic wrists straps and copper bracelets. Similarly, the devices used in this trial did not appear to alter disease activity. Therefore, people with rheumatoid arthritis who chose to wear such devices rather than seeking early diagnosis and effective treatment may be risking their health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The overall findings of this trial indicate that magnetic wrist straps, and also copper bracelets, have no statistically significant, nor clinically meaningful, therapeutic effects upon rheumatoid arthritis. The devices worn in this trial offered little if no specific benefits, i.e. beyond those of a placebo, in reducing pain, inflammation, disability, disease activity, and medication use amongst this patient group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0071529.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
