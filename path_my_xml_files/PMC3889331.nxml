This is related to the overall aging of the population as well as to a continuous increase in the prevalence of T2DM with age, reaching about 20% in adults aged 75&#x000a0;years or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These elderly patients have an increased prevalence of T2DM-related morbidity and mortality, physical disability and frailty, cognitive disorders and, in particular, micro- and macrovascular co-morbidities, such as congestive heart failure and renal impairment (RI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Diabetes is the leading causes of chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with T2DM patients accounting for about 1/3 of all cases of end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, there is also an age-related decline in kidney function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Ultimately, between 25% and 40% of patients with T2DM will develop RI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a large-scale French survey, for example, 28% of the population of patients with T2DM &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years had moderate RI and this increased to 37% for patients aged 75&#x02013;79&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The elderly population with T2DM and moderate or severe RI is a uniquely fragile population and effective treatment in this vulnerable population poses special challenges. These include a high prevalence of polypharmacy, which increases the risk of drug&#x02013;drug interactions, presence of multiple co-morbidities, and the paucity of clinical data in this population. Importantly, treatment options are more limited and/or complex in this population due to contraindications, differential clearance and/or metabolism of anti-hyperglycemic agents, need for dose adjustment and/or regular monitoring. In addition, there is a higher risk for side effects, in particular, a high susceptibility and dangerousness of hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia associated with drug treatment (insulin secretagogues and insulin) increases markedly with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and hypoglycemia in the elderly is associated with more severe consequences and complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The risk of adverse effects is further increased by a marked unawareness of hypoglycemia in the elderly population, leading to more frequent and severe events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, RI is also associated with an increased incidence of hypoglycemia due to decreased renal neoglycogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, in a retrospective cohort analysis, the incidence of hypoglycemia (glucose &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;mg/dL) was 10.72 events per 100 patient-months in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease versus 5.33 in those without chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, RI is associated with differential clearance and/or metabolism of several anti-hyperglycemic agents; in particular, consequent overexposure to insulin secretagogues is often linked to an increased risk of hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similarly, the difficulty with insulin dose selection due to impaired catabolism and clearance of exogenous insulin in patients with RI further increases the risk of hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Vildagliptin is an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) that extends the meal-induced increases in the levels of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), thereby improving the sensitivity and responsiveness of pancreatic &#x003b1;-cells and &#x003b2;-cells to glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This results in glucose-sensitive modulation of insulin and glucagon secretion, improving both fasting and postprandial glycemic control, with a low risk of hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A hypoglycemia risk similar to placebo has consistently been seen with vildagliptin across a wide spectrum of patients/disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], including elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], patients with RI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and/or patients treated with insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This included data from a dedicated 24-week study of vildagliptin 50&#x000a0;mg qd in patients with moderate or severe RI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this large study ~20% of patients were 75&#x000a0;years or older, which provided an opportunity to assess the efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin in this particularly vulnerable and difficult-to-treat elderly T2DM patient population with RI. Accordingly, the authors report here the experience with vildagliptin in patients &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years with T2DM and moderate/severe RI based on a sub-analysis of the afore-mentioned study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and Study Design</title><p>This was a post hoc sub-analysis of data from a previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week study that assessed safety and efficacy of vildagliptin (50&#x000a0;mg qd) versus placebo in 515 patients with T2DM and moderate (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;294) or severe (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;221) RI.

Patients also had to continue their current diet/exercise regimen and background therapy unchanged throughout the duration of the study. The diet or caloric intake was not specifically monitored during the study. Addition or intensification of insulin therapy was defined as initiating rescue medication. After a 2-week single-blind, placebo run-in period, eligible patients were randomized (baseline, BL) to vildagliptin (50&#x000a0;mg qd, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;289) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;226).

Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics in the randomized population.

Nearly 1/3 of patients &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years had severe RI and the remaining about 2/3 of patients had moderate RI. The randomized patients had a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7.8%, mean FPG of 8.5&#x000a0;mmol/L and mean BMI of 30.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and were treated mainly with either insulin (~55%) or oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) monotherapy (~25%), or a combination of insulin and OAD (~13%). As expected, patients had long-standing T2DM (mean duration of 16.2&#x000a0;years, with 2/3 of patients being diagnosed with T2DM for &#x02265;10&#x000a0;years), nearly all patients (96.2%) had hypertension and &#x0003e;2/3 of patients (68.6%) had dyslipidemia. Furthermore, in line with their advanced age and T2DM, more than half of the patients (53.3%) had a high cardiovascular (CV) risk status, defined as previous history of CV and cerebrovascular (CCV) events in the Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQs) of &#x02018;ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure, ischemic cerebrovascular conditions and/or embolic/thrombotic events arterial&#x02019;. These disease characteristics are also reflected in the number and nature of concomitant medications, with 84.8% of patients taking &#x02265;5 other medications (in addition to their anti-diabetic treatment), 95.2% receiving anti-hypertensive medications and 64.8% being treated with lipid-lowering agents.

No patient in the vildagliptin treatment group died, while 3 patients (5.5%) died in the placebo group (1 myocardial infarction, 1 cardiogenic shock, and 1 upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>When system organ classes (SOCs) of interest in this elderly patient population with moderate/severe RI were analyzed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), lower incidences of AEs were reported with vildagliptin vs. placebo in the SOCs of cardiac disorders (4.0% vs. 18.2%; the difference not being driven by a particular type of event) and gastrointestinal disorders (8.0% vs. 20.0%; with the largest difference seen for diarrhea). The AE rates in the SOCs of infections and infestations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were overall similar between vildagliptin and placebo. As further detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the most commonly reported specific AEs were edema (12.0% with vildagliptin vs. 16.4% with placebo), nasopharyngitis (12.0% vs. 7.3%) and dizziness (4.0% vs. 14.5%). Most of the AEs in both treatment groups were mild or moderate, with only 8.0% of patients in the vildagliptin group and 12.7% of patients in the placebo group experiencing severe events.</p><p>There was no deterioration of renal function with vildagliptin after 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment as assessed by the eGFR (change from baseline &#x02212;0.1 vs. &#x02212;2.0&#x000a0;ml/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> with placebo).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present sub-analysis evaluated vildagliptin in the uniquely vulnerable elderly population &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years with T2DM and moderate or severe RI, many of whom (nearly 70%) were treated with insulin. The main finding was that vildagliptin was efficacious, with no increase in the rate of hypoglycemia compared to placebo despite a marked improvement in glycemic control.</p><p>The magnitude of the glucose-lowering seen in this subgroup (HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction of &#x02212;1.0% from a baseline of 7.8%) was similar to that seen previously in patients &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years with mostly normal renal function or mild RI receiving vildagliptin monotherapy or add-on therapy to metformin (&#x02212;0.9% to &#x02212;1.1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or in a population with severe RI with a mean age of 64&#x000a0;years receiving background insulin therapy (&#x02212;0.9%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which was also reported to be consistent with that seen for vildagliptin in the general population in monotherapy or combination therapy studies. Relative to placebo, the decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02212;0.8%) was clinically meaningful, with more than half of the vildagliptin-treated patients reaching an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02264;7.5%, regarded an appropriate target for this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, the metabolic derangements clearly manifested in this patient population with advanced age, RI, and long-standing mainly insulin-treated T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] did not adversely affect the efficacy of vildagliptin. The small HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction (&#x02212;0.2%) seen in the control group is likely a study effect and not unusual for patients entering a placebo-controlled trial.</p><p>Hypoglycemia is a major limiting barrier to good glycemic control even in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In light of the markedly increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, in a highly vulnerable patient population of advanced age, with RI and significant insulin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and given the more severe consequences of hypoglycemia in these patients (including events like falls and fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]), as well as the potential CV risk associated with severe hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the finding that there was no increase in the rate of hypoglycemia with vildagliptin despite the meaningful decrease in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> (7.8% to 6.8%) is noteworthy. The rate of confirmed hypoglycemia was 0.49 vs. 0.96 events per patient-year with vildagliptin and placebo, respectively, with a very low incidence of severe hypoglycemia (1 patient on multiple insulin injections in the vildagliptin group, precipitated by alcohol consumption, and 0 patients in the placebo group) and no discontinuations due to hypoglycemia. While an improvement in glycemic control in the range reported in the current analysis would generally be expected to be associated with an increase in hypoglycemia, in particular, in the patient population studied, the protection against hypoglycemia seen with vildagliptin has a mechanistic basis, likely being mediated via a GIP-induced increase in glucagon levels whenever glucose levels fall into the hypoglycemic range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Vildagliptin treatment extends the physiological meal-related increases of the incretin hormones into the inter-meal and overnight periods and vildagliptin was shown to enhance the glucagon counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia during a stepped clamp versus placebo in drug-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with the weight neutrality generally reported for vildagliptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] including in insulin-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], there was only a minimal weight change (0.4&#x000a0;kg) reported for vildagliptin when added to background therapy in the elderly patient group with moderate/severe RI.</p><p>The safety and tolerability of vildagliptin in a wide range of disease stages including pooled analyses from a large clinical database was assessed in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The results from the present investigation are consistent with the safety and tolerability profile reported earlier, with no new safety signals identified in the present sub-analysis. While a numerically lower percentage of vildagliptin-treated patients experienced events in the SOC of Cardiac disorders (4% vs. 18.2%), a trend similar to that seen in an earlier pooled analysis of elderly patients &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], this was not driven by any particular type of events and based on a very small number of events, thus limiting definitive conclusions.</p><p>In light of the broader applicability of the reported results, while inclusion/exclusion criteria in clinical trials can restrict the demographic and disease characteristics compared to a real life setting, the patients studied in the present analysis were overall reflective of an elderly patient population with advanced renal insufficiency, thus further extending the findings of a previously pooled analysis of a patient population &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years with mainly normal renal function or mild RI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and of a study in a population &#x02265;70&#x000a0;years including a small percentage of patients with moderate RI (14.4%) but no patients with severe RI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The latter study showed that nearly twice as many patients reached individualized treatment targets with vildagliptin than placebo added to their background therapy, with comparable safety and tolerability. In the present sub-analysis, nearly 1/3 of patients &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years had severe RI and the remaining about 2/3 of patients had moderate RI, with a mean eGFR of 35&#x000a0;ml/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>. In addition to the renal comorbidity, patients also had a high prevalence of CV risk factors [including obesity (mean BMI 30.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), long-standing T2DM (mean duration of 16.2&#x000a0;years, with 2/3 of patients being diagnosed for &#x02265;10&#x000a0;years), hypertension (&#x0003e;90%), dyslipidemia (&#x0003e;2/3)], and &#x0003e;50% had a high CV risk status based on previous CCV history. These factors, together with the fact that ~70% of patients were treated with insulin and ~85% of patients taking &#x02265;5 other medications (in addition to their anti-diabetic treatment), highlight the uniquely fragile/vulnerable characteristics of the studied population. It is worth noting, however, that while the mean age of the population was 78.1&#x000a0;years, the upper age of the patients was 85&#x000a0;years, thus the data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to a population of &#x0003e;85&#x000a0;years. Another limitation of the present investigation is that the results are based on a sizeable yet limited number of patients. Furthermore, information that would have allowed to characterize the population with respect to dependency (e.g. care home residency) or mental status is lacking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the present sub-study provides valuable information regarding the experience with vildagliptin in the difficult-to-treat elderly population &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years with T2DM and moderate or severe RI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the patients, investigators and staff at participating sites for the study and also thank Monika Kundu for technical help and assistance with the artwork.
