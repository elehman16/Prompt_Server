In addition, SSIs dramatically increase the treatment cost and length of hospital stay. Following visceral surgery by laparotomy, SSI rates are especially high (14&#x02013;25%). Therefore, measures to prevent SSI in this field are urgently needed. Prophylactic intraoperative wound irrigation (IOWI) of the subcutaneous soft tissue before skin closure hypothetically represents an easy and economical option to reduce SSI rates and is already frequently used in clinical practice. However, there are currently no definite recommendations on the use of IOWI since high-level evidence supporting its use is lacking. Consequently, clinical practice varies widely. Antiseptic polyhexanide (PHX)-based solutions are approved for soft-tissue wound irrigation in surgery but have not been specifically evaluated in randomized clinical trials for the prevention of SSI following laparotomy for visceral surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The IOWISI trial is a multicentre, randomized, observer- and patient-blinded clinical trial with three parallel treatment groups, comparing IOWI with a 0.04% PHX solution to no irrigation (test 1) or saline (test 2) before skin closure after laparotomy for visceral surgery (contamination level II&#x02013;IV). The primary endpoint of the trial is the SSI rate within 30 days postoperatively. Statistical analysis of the primary endpoint measure will be based on the intention-to-treat population.

SSI rates are especially high following visceral surgery by laparotomy. Depending on the level of intraoperative contamination, recent high-level randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with standardized SSI definitions report postoperative SSI rates between 14.5% and 25.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Studies have shown an increase of 6&#x02013;24 days in the mean length of hospital stay if SSI occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition to the risk and discomfort for the patient, SSIs dramatically increase the cost of treatment. In Germany, postoperative SSIs account for approximately 1 million extra days of hospitalization and an additional cost of around &#x020ac;&#x02009;3 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Prophylactic intraoperative wound irrigation (IOWI) of the subcutaneous and deep soft tissue before skin closure with saline or antiseptic solutions hypothetically represents an easy and economical option to reduce SSI rates and is already frequently used in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the latest official guidelines for the prevention of SSI by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] conclude that IOWI with saline is not efficient and IOWI with diluted polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PVP-I) solutions may have a potential benefit in preventing SSI. However, due to the low level of underlying evidence these recommendations are conditional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In contrast, the clinical guidelines of the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from 2008 state that the efficacy of IOWI is unproven for any irrigation solution and that its use should be avoided to prevent potential tissue toxicity and systemic side effects of PVP-I and other antiseptics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, all of these recommendations are based on a small number of unstandardized and heterogeneous RCTs evaluating different types of surgery (abdominal, as well as orthopaedic and neurosurgical procedures) and different types and concentrations of irrigation solutions.</p><p id="Par25">Antiseptic polyhexanide (PHX)-based solutions are approved for prophylactic intraoperative soft tissue wound irrigation and have been shown to be tissue tolerable without being resorbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, side effects such as allergic reactions are extremely rare. PHX inhibits microbial attachment to wound surfaces through an interaction with the bacterial membrane. In vitro data show a superiority of PHX over PVP-I against a broad microbial spectrum, including multi-resistant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, there are no recommendations on IOWI with PHX in any of the current guidelines on SSI prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Previous trials</title><p id="Par26">Even though the literature evaluating SSI prevention is substantial, high-level evidence to guide decisions on the use of IOWI with saline or antiseptics remains scarce. Our research group previously performed a large-scale meta-analysis of 41 RCTs on IOWI with saline, PVP-I, or antibiotic irrigation solutions, exclusively in abdominal surgery. The results of this analysis show a risk reduction of 46% in the treatment group (IOWI with any irrigation solution) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The SSI incidence was 9% in the treatment group compared to 16% in the untreated group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). However, the majority of included trials were out of date (1970&#x02013;1990) and most of them revealed a high risk of bias mainly because of insufficient data reporting or methodological flaws. In addition, interventions, follow-up times, and definitions of SSI varied widely between those trials. Furthermore, neither the WHO nor the NICE guidelines recommend the use of topical antibiotic solutions for this indication anymore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The only standardized RCT comparing IOWI with saline irrigation versus no irrigation after open appendectomies was published in 2000 and found a reduction of SSI from 25% to 8.7% in the saline irrigation group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Recently, PHX-based antiseptic solutions have been successfully and widely used in orthopaedic and trauma surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a longitudinal cohort study, irrigation of traumatic contaminated soft tissue wounds with PHX showed a reduction of the SSI rate of almost 75% compared to irrigation with Ringer&#x02019;s solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One pilot study investigated differences in SSI rates for &#x0201c;short&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;long&#x0201d; IOWI with PHX 0.04% solution in abdominal surgery in 97 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the experimental group the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated through the aponeurosis prior to the initial incision and the wound margins were protected with PHX-soaked abdominal cloths during the whole procedure. After closing the abdominal fascia, wounds were again irrigated with PHX (&#x0201c;long&#x0201d;). In the retrospective control group, wounds were irrigated with PHX only before skin closure (&#x0201c;short&#x0201d;). No significant differences in SSI rates were observed between the two groups. The overall SSI rate in this single-centre study was comparable to observations of other recent trials (19.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This might be explained by the fact that wounds were subsequently rinsed with saline solution after PHX irrigation (see <xref rid="Sec34" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objective</title><p id="Par29">The IOWISI trial aims to investigate if IOWI with PHX solution (0.04%) or saline (NaCl 0.9%) can reduce the rate of postoperative SSI within 30 days (according to the CDC definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) after laparotomy for visceral surgery.

After irrigation with PHX the wound will not be irrigated with saline again. Since PHX is a cation-active substance, it is not compatible with anionic organic substances (e.g. lactate). Furthermore, the combination of PHX with PVP-I products has to be avoided.</p><p id="Par39">In the experimental group 2, the same intervention will be performed using 1000 ml of saline solution (NaCl 0.9%).</p><p id="Par40">After irrigation of the wound, the skin closure and sterile dressing will be performed according to local standards, without any further wound-related procedure. PHX and saline solutions are to be purchased, stored, and distributed according to the respective standard operating procedures of the trial centres. If the operating surgeon decides that incomplete closure of the wound and/or any other wound-related procedure after the study intervention (e.g. negative pressure treatment) is necessary for the benefit of the patient, the patient will have to be excluded from the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Control intervention</title><p id="Par41">In the control group, wounds will not be surgically irrigated according to the NICE guideline recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Permitted and not permitted medication(s)/treatment(s)</title><p id="Par42">No additional study-specific treatments will be performed within the trial. Antibiotic treatment 5 days prior to surgery is an exclusion criterion. Preoperative antibiotic treatment due to septic peritonitis is allowed, but has to be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Application and timing of routine intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis will be recorded in the eCRF. If indicated for medical reasons, all kinds of medication are permitted during the trial. Postoperative administration of antibiotics or medication with adverse effects on wound healing (e.g. immunosuppressive agents) will be recorded in the eCRF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Risks</title><p id="Par43">No additional risks for study patients are anticipated, since IOWI with PHX or saline, as well as the control intervention, represent clinically established standard methods. PHX 0.04% irrigation solution is approved for surgical wound irrigation of soft tissue wounds in Germany. The study will be planned, conducted, and analysed according to all relevant national and international rules and regulations (AMG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], ICH-GCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). The safety of PHX solutions has been demonstrated in marketing studies. However, adverse effects may only be expected in the improbable event of accidental contamination of the respective irrigation solutions or in case of unknown hypersensitivity to PHX. The potential benefits of a reduced risk of SSI outweigh the mentioned negligible potential adverse effects of PHX. The safety of the subjects is ensured by regular study visits, enforcing GCP guidelines. Furthermore, each patient will be provided with insurance coverage for any potential harm from trial participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par44">The primary efficacy endpoint measure of the trial is the incidence of SSI according to the CDC definition and classification within 30 days after surgery (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). If the patient&#x02019;s wound cannot be evaluated exactly on postoperative day 30, a clinical evaluation up to postoperative day 36 will be allowed. However, only SSIs that occurred up to day 30 will be counted as postoperative SSI, conforming to the CDC definition. In addition, the following outcome measures have been defined as secondary endpoint measures and will be determined by the unit given in parentheses: a) duration of hospital stay (in days); b) 30-day rate of reoperation in all groups (%); c) 30-day rate of wound complications other than SSI in all groups (%); d) 30-day mortality in all groups (%); and e) 30-day rate of postoperative adverse events/serious adverse events (AE/SAE) in all groups (%).

The WHO Global Guidelines for the prevention of SSI (2016) as well as the updated CDC guidelines (2017) conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend IOWI with saline and that IOWI with diluted PVP-I could be considered but also not routinely recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the level of underlying evidence is low and trials analysed for these guidelines do not solely focus on visceral surgery, but include all types of surgery (e.g. orthopaedic or neurosurgery) which differ substantially in SSI rates and causative microorganisms. Furthermore, PVP-I solutions are seen as controversial for this prophylactic indication due to possible systemic adverse effects and tissue toxicity. However, despite its unproven efficacy, most general and visceral surgeons currently use IOWI to prevent SSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">Solutions containing the antiseptic agent PHX are approved for IOWI, and were shown to be tissue tolerable and effective in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, PHX solutions are not mentioned in the WHO or other recent guidelines. Ultimately, data from high-quality RCTs are needed to resolve the scientific equipoise regarding application of IOWI with saline or antiseptics.</p><p id="Par71">The IOWISI trial has a pragmatic, three-armed study design (PHX <italic>versus</italic> saline irrigation <italic>versus</italic> no irrigation) and shall be conducted in at least 10 centres within the German Surgical Trial Network (CHIR-<italic>Net</italic>). A multicentre approach, including hospitals of different care levels, was chosen to increase external validity. Internal validity and data quality assurance are established by adherence to the SPIRIT statement and GCP regulations regarding recruitment, training of study personnel, methods against bias, outcome reporting, and documentation.</p><p id="Par72">All patients undergoing visceral surgery by laparotomy within 27 months will be screened for this trial. Broad inclusion criteria were applied to ensure rapid and sufficient recruitment of the target sample size.</p><p id="Par73">After closure of the abdominal fascia according to local standards, laparotomy wounds will either be irrigated with PHX or saline. The volume of 1000 ml was chosen to be sure that large laparotomy wounds would be sufficiently irrigated. This was determined by the clinical experience of senior surgeons at our institution since, so far, no recommendations for the optimal volume of surgical wound irrigation exist. The same applies to the duration and technique of irrigation. However, the POLIS pilot trial compared &#x0201c;short&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;long&#x0201d; irrigation with PHX and no differences in SSI rates were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In vitro experiments show that a contact time of 10&#x02013;15 min is required for PHX to act fully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To ensure this, the irrigation technique will be standardized in the IOWISI trial. In addition, wounds will be left moistened with the PHX solution at the end of the irrigation and shall not be rubbed dry with abdominal cloths or rinsed with saline again.</p><p id="Par74">The primary endpoint is the incidence of SSI 30 days postoperatively, according to the widely accepted CDC definition and classification (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

A commercial interest does not apply as PHX 0.04% irrigation solutions are widely available and several companies offer this product in their portfolio. The trial further does not request a certain product in order to avoid compliance conflicts, but encourages collaborators to use the available product in their respective trial sites.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par78">Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets have been generated or analysed yet.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>TCM, DR, UN, RS, VK, and HF participated in the trial design.
