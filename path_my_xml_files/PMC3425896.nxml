Food is responsible for the majority of anaphylaxis cases in the paediatric population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Egg, milk, peanuts and tree nuts are the most common food allergens in the preschool population; peanut and tree nuts are the most common allergen triggers in older children. There is a wide spectrum of allergic reactions to these allergens ranging from minor urticarial reactions to anaphylaxis, with the associated risk of fatality.</p><p>Anaphylaxis is managed via a two-pronged approach: first lifestyle modification to avoid the allergen and second the acute management of the anaphylactic event itself.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2 R3 R4">2&#x02013;4</xref> Those children who have had anaphylaxis, or who are judged to be at high risk of anaphylaxis, are prescribed adrenaline (epinephrine) autoinjectors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> These are to be carried on their person, or by their carers, at all times in the case of accidental exposure to the allergen(s) in question. This is important as, although uncommon with an estimated incidence of one episode per 10&#x02005;000 children per year,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> most accidental exposures and subsequent reactions tend to occur in community settings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> and because of the typically rapid onset and progression of reactions, most young people and their families do not have immediate access to medical support when this is most required.</p><p>Despite being prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector and being shown the correct method of administration, many young people and/or parents still often report being unsure when to administer this treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> They often worry whether the reaction is severe enough to warrant an injection of adrenaline or whether their child may come to harm if given unnecessary treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> There is evidence that there is often a delay in administering the prescribed medication in an emergency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> This delay in administering adrenaline may lead to increased morbidity and also increases the risk of fatality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Allergy services therefore often encourage children and families/carers to use their autoinjectors if there is any doubt regarding the severity of the allergic reaction. Given the risk of further reactions and the above-described concerns about when to administer emergency treatment, it is perhaps unsurprising that studies have found that food allergy can have a detrimental impact both on the children themselves and also on family quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> There is, however, as yet no clear evidence on how to improve clinical and/or psychological outcomes in this population.</p><p>In the light of the above factors, we hypothesise that: first, uncertainty about the likely severity of their child's reaction (ranging from no reaction to mild to life-threatening) on accidental re-exposure to the allergenic food in question and second, what a patient or carer must do if a reaction occurs, both contribute significantly to parental/child anxiety. We further hypothesise that this uncertainty could be ameliorated by real-time expert clinical guidance and support.</p><p>We propose therefore to test the effectiveness of giving parents and carers of children and teenagers with known food allergy, who are medically considered to be at sufficient risk of anaphylaxis that they have been prescribed and trained in the use of adrenaline autoinjectors, 24-h telephone access (intervention arm) or office-hour access (routine care arm) to expert advice from the clinical allergy service. We will advise parents/carers/teen patients randomised to the intervention arm to ring this clinician-staffed advice line if they or their child has an allergic reaction and they are unsure as to how to manage it. We postulate that the availability of this service will improve disease-specific quality of life compared with families randomised to the routine care arm who do not have this 24-h access. We also suspect that the allergic reactions that parents or families contact the allergy team about will be better managed as a result of the advice given. There is currently no service such as this available in Ireland or indeed worldwide. This is, as far as we are aware, the first ever randomised clinical trial of patient care in the field of anaphylaxis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Aims</title><p>We seek to assess the effectiveness of 24-h telephone access to specialist paediatric allergy expert advice in improving the quality of life of children and their families with potentially life-threatening food allergy (ie, anaphylaxis) compared with usual clinical care.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Main objective</title><p>To compare the difference in food allergy related quality of life between the 24-h telephone access and usual care at 1 and 6&#x02005;months postrandomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Secondary objectives</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To compare the number and clinical severity of incidents of suspected/confirmed allergic reaction in both groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare clinical and health service use outcomes in both groups.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Design</title><p>We will undertake a pragmatic two-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p>All families with food allergic children seen in the paediatric allergy outpatient clinic at Cork University Hospital will be informed about the study and invited to participate.

The manning of this emergency 24-h helpline will be shared between experienced members of the paediatric allergy team. In the event of a suspected serious allergic reaction, the patient or his/her parent or carer will be able to ring the on-call trial clinician for advice. Trial staff will have a standard incident report form (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">appendix 1</xref>) to keep record of on-call encounters. It is to be filled out as soon as is practical after the phone-call consultation. Their advice will be tailored according to clinical need, but will include instructions that there is either: (1) no need for emergency treatment; (2) give antihistamines by mouth and observe or (3) use the adrenaline autoinjector and call an ambulance. The responding staff member will keep a record of all such encounters and the advice given. Consistency of advice given is ensured by each staff member giving out previously agreed, standardised instructions (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">appendix 1</xref>) and by a teleconference to be had between all personnel, following all incidents where advice is given on the 24-h helpline, to discuss the incident and ensure that the standardised advice was given.</p><p>Those allocated to the U care (control) arm will receive standard care, with the option of contacting one or more of the following: the Cork University Hospital Paediatric Allergy team during working hours (Monday&#x02013;Friday 8:00&#x02013;17:00), emergency/ambulance services, their own registered general practitioner, out-of-hours primary care providers or their nearest hospital emergency departments.</p><p>The duration of trial period will be 6&#x02005;months from the point of randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="s3g1"><title>Primary</title><p>All study participants will complete the age-appropriate (discussed above) validated FAQL at 1 and 6 months post randomisation; specifically, any change from baseline between intervention and control groups at the 1-month and 6-month assessment points.</p><p>The FAQLQ-PF, FAQLQ-CF and FAQLQ-TF are age appropriate parent-administered, child self-administered and teen self-administered questionnaires that measure the impact of food allergy on health-related quality of life (HRQL) of children of age 0&#x02013;18&#x02005;years. They were developed and validated under the auspices of EuroPrevall, a European Commission-funded project with over 60 partners (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.europrevall.org">www.europrevall.org</ext-link>). We have previously demonstrated good cross-sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity in European and US samples. The questionnaire items are scored on a seven-point likert scale ranging from 0 (no impact on HRQL) to 6 (extreme impact on HRQL). The measures have three subscales assessing general emotional impact; food anxiety; and social and dietary limitations. The total score is calculated as the mean of these three subscales.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15 R16 R17">14&#x02013;17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3g2"><title>Secondary</title><p>Participants in both groups will also be asked to record any possible allergic reactions that may have occurred, which were self-managed and/or required medical advice or attention other than provided through the trial helpline.

The effect of the factors &#x02018;time&#x02019; and &#x02018;group&#x02019; on the total score, and the interaction of these two factors, will be analysed using a two-way within&#x02013;between groups analysis of variance (ANOVA). The interaction will address the question; &#x02018;Are the time profiles in terms of FAQL total scores of the two groups (experimental/control) significantly different?&#x02019; If improvement over time is determined, a paired sample t test will be used to ascertain at which time-point(s) the difference can be detected. Secondary outcomes will be included in univariate and multivariate models as independent and dependent variables and controls.</p><p>Independent t tests will be used to determine if there are differences in magnitude of improvement in FAQL scores for (I) vs (U) groups. The Bonferroni correction method will be used to adjust for multiple comparisons.</p><p>We will calculate the responsiveness index (mean change score/SD of change score), using Cohen's change index benchmarks; 0.2&#x02013;0.4 (small), 0.5&#x02013;0.7 (moderate) and 0.81 (large).</p><p>We will assess the reliability of the change score by computing the intraclass coefficients of change in the FAQLQ.
