These benefits, however, may be offset by increased risk of hypoglycemia and body weight gain. Insulin detemir is a basal insulin analog that has weight-sparing effects compared with other basal insulin formulations in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), but to date the exact mechanisms underlying these effects have not been elucidated.</p><p>In contrast to its anabolic effects in peripheral tissues in the brain, insulin acts as a satiety signal. These central effects have been established mainly in rodent studies, in which insulin was administered intracerebroventricularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Effects of insulin on the human brain have been studied by intranasal insulin administration, which results in direct brain insulin uptake without systemic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A single dose of intranasal insulin intensified postmeal satiety in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and decreased food intake in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), whereas 8-week intranasal insulin administration was associated with weight loss in men only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>It has been hypothesized that, in comparison with other insulin formulations, insulin detemir enters the brain more easily owing to the fatty acid attached to the insulin molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Furthermore, insulin detemir is suggested to have stronger effects on brain functions than other basal insulin therapies: insulin detemir infusion in mice and healthy humans resulted in enhanced cortical activity compared with human insulin (as measured with electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography) and decreased food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These results suggest the existence of tissue-specific kinetics of insulin detemir in the brain.</p><p>In addition to methods such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography, both of which measure neuronal activity in cortical areas only, positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to quantify metabolic effects of insulin within the whole brain. Using [<sup>18</sup>F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG) and PET, it has been shown that the brain is sensitive to insulin with respect to its action on glucose uptake and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Also, based on the observed blunting of the effect of insulin on cerebral glucose metabolism (CMR<sub>glu</sub>) in obese men with peripheral insulin resistance compared with lean insulin sensitive men, the existence of central insulin resistance in humans was postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). CMR<sub>glu</sub> is known to be closely linked to cerebral blood flow (CBF). The gold standard to obtain regional CBF in humans is [<sup>15</sup>O]H<sub>2</sub>O PET. Regional CBF (measured using single-photon emission computed tomography) and CBF velocity (measured by transcranial Doppler) were found to have a negative association with BMI in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In rats, topically applied insulin increased cortical blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), but in a small study acute hyperinsulinemia during a euglycemic clamp was not associated with an effect on CBF in healthy and impaired glucose tolerant subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to assess whether insulin detemir, compared with NPH insulin, alters CBF or CMR<sub>glu</sub> in appetite-related brain regions in type 1 diabetic patients as a potential mechanism contributing to the reported differential effects on body weight.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>From January 2009 until May 2011, patients were included in this randomized controlled crossover trial; the last follow-up visit was on 13 December 2011. Thirty-five patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 18&#x02013;60 years and with a BMI of 18&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, were included; they were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the VU University Medical Center (VUMC) and from neighboring hospitals. After giving written informed consent, all participants had a screening visit consisting of a medical history, physical examination, and fasting blood and urine analyses. Exclusion criteria were diabetes duration &#x0003c;1 year; A1C &#x0003e;8.5%; proliferative retinopathy; a history of recurrent severe hypoglycemia (defined as an episode that requires external assistance for recovery); a medical history of hypoglycemia unawareness; history of cardiovascular, renal, or liver disease or severe head trauma; any neurological or psychiatric disorder; endocrine diseases not well controlled for the last 3 months; inability to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning; substance abuse; and the use of anticoagulants, oral steroids, or any centrally acting agent. Of all patients in analysis, one had microalbuminuria, four stable background retinopathy, and one peripheral neuropathy (Toronto score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] of 9/19 and a vibration perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] threshold of &#x0003e;25 V at 5 of 12 locations). Three patients were treated with antihypertensive medication (one used an angiotensin II receptor antagonist [ARB], one an ACE inhibitor and an ARB, and one an ACE inhibitor and ARB, a diuretic, and a calcium antagonist). Three patients used cholesterol-lowering medication, and one used aspirin as well. Two patients had stable hypothyroidism treated with thyroxin, and one had stable ulcerative colitis treated with mesalazin. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of the VUMC and the Central Committee on Research involving Human Subjects. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The study was conducted in a randomized crossover design and was part of a larger trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, clinical trial reg. no. NTC00626080). Primary outcomes were CBF and CMR<sub>glu</sub> after a 12-week treatment period, and change in body weight after this 12-week treatment was a secondary outcome measurement. After a run-in period of at least 4 weeks, during which the current insulin therapy was optimized, patients were randomly assigned to start with either insulin detemir or NPH insulin in the evening, both in combination with insulin aspart at mealtimes. Randomization (block design) was conducted by the Trial Pharmacy of the VUMC, and the assigned treatments were concealed by envelopes; a research physician (L.W.v.G.) enrolled patients in the study and assigned them to the intervention. After assignment, no blinding was applied, since NPH insulin needs to be mixed and visually inspected before injection. Weekly seven-point self-measured blood glucose curves were made, and all fasting blood glucose levels were reported. Where appropriate, basal insulin dose was adjusted to maintain a fasting glucose level of &#x0003c;7 mmol/L. Regular telephone contact was available for advice on basal and prandial insulin adjustments. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients switched from basal insulin.</p><p>On the day prior to the scan session, patients refrained from food, alcohol, and coffee intake from 2200 h onward. They were carefully instructed not to forget their basal insulin injection and, if possible, not to use any insulin aspart after their dinnertime injection. Telephone calls were made both on the night before and early in the morning of the day of the PET scan, i.e., before traveling to the hospital. In addition, a similar protocol was followed at the day of MRI scanning (a week prior to the PET scan), when patients had to arrive at the hospital at the same time in a fasting state, using the same basal insulin the night before. If necessary, the insulin regimen was adjusted after the MRI scan to improve fasting glucose levels on the day of the PET scan. Patients arrived at the hospital at 0715 h in the fasting state and remained fasted during the entire imaging procedure. Upon arrival, a catheter was placed in an antecubital vein for blood collection and tracer injection. Blood glucose levels were checked and corrected if necessary (when glucose was &#x0003c;4 mmol/L and falling or when glucose was &#x0003e;15 mmol/L). To prevent further rising of glucose during the remaining duration of the test visit, a low dose of the individual's basal insulin was injected subcutaneously. No insulin aspart was used to avoid interference with the PET measurements. After we check for collateral circulation and administration of local anesthesia using intradermal 1% lidocain, a radial artery was cannulated by an experienced anesthesiologist. Both cannulas were kept patent by a 3 IE/mL 0.9% NaCl heparin solution.</p><p>Before and immediately after scanning, patients completed a questionnaire, scoring their hunger (&#x0201c;How hungry are you right now?&#x0201d;), fullness (&#x0201c;How full are you at this moment?&#x0201d;), appetite (&#x0201c;How much do you feel like eating right now?&#x0201d;), prospective consumption (&#x0201c;How much could you eat right now?&#x0201d;), desire to eat (&#x0201c;How strong is your desire to eat right now?&#x0201d;), and thoughts of eating (&#x0201c;How much do you think about food right now?&#x0201d;) on a 10-point Likert scale. Furthermore, patients scored their insulin treatment satisfaction using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, which measures satisfaction with treatment regimen, perceived frequency of hyperglycemia, and perceived frequency of hypoglycemia over the past few weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Three-dimensional structural MRI images were acquired on a 3.0 T GE Signa HDxt scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI), using a T1-weighted fast Spoiled Gradient echo sequence. PET scans were acquired with a High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) (Siemens/CTI, Knoxville, TN) PET scanner. The scanning protocol consisted of a [<sup>15</sup>O]H<sub>2</sub>O scan to measure CBF and an [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG scan to measure CMR<sub>glu</sub>. Details on scan protocol have previously been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). During both scans, arterial concentrations were monitored continuously, and in addition, manual samples were taken for cross-calibration of the measured input function. Samples obtained during the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG scan (15, 35, and 55 min postinjection) were also used to measure arterial plasma glucose levels. All scans were performed between 0930 and 1200 h to minimize diurnal variations.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Data analyses</title><p>List mode emission data were histogrammed into multiframe sinograms, which subsequently were normalized, and corrected for randoms, dead time, decay, scatter, and attenuation. Fully corrected sinograms were reconstructed using the standard 3D Ordinary Poisson Ordered-Subsets Expectation Maximization (OP-OSEM) reconstruction algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), resulting in 207 image planes with 256 &#x000d7; 256 voxels and a voxel size of 1.22 &#x000d7; 1.22 &#x000d7; 1.22 mm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

Regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated on the MRI scan using the template defined in PVElab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Subsequently, all ROIs were projected onto the dynamic PET images, generating time activity curves (TACs) for the following 16 left and right regions: orbitofrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, insula, caudate nucleus, putamen, medial inferior frontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, parietal cortex, medial inferior temporal cortex, superior frontal cortex, occipital cortex, sensorimotor cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, a single white matter region, a total gray matter region, and striatum (putamen and caudate nucleus combined). Of these ROIs, the first seven were of specific interest, as these are involved in appetite regulation and reward.</p><p>With use of standard nonlinear regression (NLR), appropriately weighted [<sup>15</sup>O]H<sub>2</sub>O TACs were fitted to the standard one-tissue compartment model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) to obtain regional CBF values.

Parametric analyses yielded similar results (data not shown).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The main finding of this study was that a relative loss in body weight in type 1 diabetic patients treated with insulin detemir was accompanied by an increase in CBF in insula, thalamus, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, and striatum&#x02014;regions that are involved in appetite regulation and reward. No significant differences in CMR<sub>glu</sub> between groups were found.</p><p>Several studies have investigated the effects of body weight on CBF. Some of these studies suggest that changes in CBF are causal in the development of obesity. CBF responses in appetite-related brain regions to a meal in formerly obese persons were similar to those in obese persons but different from those in lean subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), indicating a predisposition to obesity that may involve areas of the brain that control complex aspects of eating behavior. This is in line with the observed increase in CBF in appetite-regulating brain regions in response to meal consumption in successful dieters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In minipigs, however, diet-induced obesity resulted in a decrease in CBF in several of these brain regions, suggesting that the changes in CBF were the result of weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). From the current study, it is not possible to determine whether increases in CBF in patients treated with insulin detemir are cause or consequence of the observed weight loss. Previous studies in mice and healthy humans, however, showed cortical brain activation upon acute insulin detemir versus human insulin infusion with concomitant decrease in food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In addition, it was shown that insulin-induced glucose lowering in type 1 diabetic patients resulted in an increase in CBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). However, whether this was caused by increasing insulin or by decreasing glucose levels could not be determined in those studies. Still, a direct effect of insulin on the brain is supported by the acute effects of insulin on cerebrovascular responses in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The present CBF findings are in contrast with a study by Hirvonen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) in eight healthy volunteers and six individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, in which no between-group CBF differences were observed and no CBF effect of insulin. In their study, acute clamp-induced hyperinsulinemic (insulin levels 5&#x02013;6 times higher compared with the current study) euglycemia was imposed, which is different from the insulin effect of two chronic 12-week treatment periods. In addition, fasted, elevated (glucose level 11 mmol/L) glucose levels during PET data acquisition were higher in the current study. In addition, Hirvonen et al. investigated two different subject groups, whereas we investigated only one group of individuals with type 1 diabetes and studied the effects of a chronic treatment in a crossover study design. Finally, Hirvonen et al. may not have observed the 10% difference owing to a lack of power (although insulin levels were higher, the number of subjects was much less than in the current study) or the lower signal-to-noise ratio of the PET scanner used.</p><p>In contrast to the differential effects on CBF, the two insulin treatments did not result in significant differences in CMR<sub>glu</sub> in any of the regions investigated. Previous studies have shown an inverse association of CMR<sub>glu</sub> and BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) and increases in CMR<sub>glu</sub> after stimulation with food pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Of note, the increase in CMR<sub>glu</sub> in appetite-related brain regions after insulin infusion was blunted in insulin-resistant men compared with insulin-sensitive men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and it was associated with insulin resistance and overweight.</p><p>Previously, it was shown that in type 1 diabetes changes in <italic>k<sub>3</sub></italic> are observed compared with healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), without significant concomitant changes in CBF. Under the assumption of absence of between-group differences in phosphorylation (which were indeed absent in the present data), the relationship between CMR<sub>glu</sub> and CBF is nonlinear [as CMR<sub>glu</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> are linearly related via CMR<sub>glu</sub> = <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> &#x022c5; glucose/LC, where <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x022c5; <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>/(<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> + <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>), and CMR<sub>glu</sub> is linearly related to <italic>E</italic> &#x022c5; CBF, where <italic>E</italic> = 1 &#x02013; exp(&#x02212;PS/CBF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>)], and, especially at higher flow values, an increase in CBF will induce a smaller increase in CMR<sub>glu</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), which is what was observed in the current study, although the latter was nonsignificant.</p><p>Possible confounders that could have accounted for the differences in CBF include A1C or prevailing glucose and insulin levels. However, these parameters were not significantly different between treatments, and the insulin detemir&#x02013;induced increase in CBF was similar after adjustment for A1C, glucose, and insulin levels.</p><p>Limitations of this study include its nonblinded nature owing to differences in insulin formulations. NPH insulin is a cloudy suspension that needs to be thoroughly stirred before injection, whereas insulin detemir is a clear, colorless solution that does not require stirring. Therefore, it was not possible to perform a double-blind study. Worldwide, however, NPH insulin is the standard (intermediate) long-acting human insulin and, therefore, the best active comparator. Moreover, even if patients were aware of the type of insulin treatment, it is unlikely that this will have had an effect on the present findings. It should be noted that not all patients in the study were insulin detemir na&#x000ef;ve, i.e., five and six patients starting with NPH insulin and insulin detemir, respectively, already used insulin detemir before the start of the study. As insulin detemir&#x02013;na&#x000ef;ve patients and insulin detemir users were equally distributed between treatment groups, it is unlikely that medication prior to the study has affected the results, especially since PET scans were performed after 12 weeks of exposure to the test insulin.</p><p>Differences in CMR<sub>glu</sub> between insulin detemir and NPH insulin were not statistically significant. Data in the current study were obtained during a resting and fasting condition. In future studies, it may be of interest to investigate responses to (visual) food stimuli in appetite regulating brain regions after both treatments. However, due to radiation exposure and practical reasons (small inner diameter of the HRRT scanner, making it difficult to present visual stimuli), this was not possible in the current study. In addition, for detection of changes in brain activation using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET, two separate sessions are required to test stimulated versus nonstimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>Some patients required glucose or (basal) insulin to prevent emerging hypo- or hyperglycemia, respectively. In six patients on insulin detemir versus one on NPH insulin, glucose was necessary to prevent low or falling blood glucose levels, which could have biased results, as hypoglycemia increases CBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). As three patients in the insulin detemir versus only one in the NPH insulin group required additional basal insulin to avoid hyperglycemia, one could argue that if acute injection of basal insulin would have affected CBF, this would have attenuated the difference in CBF between the groups. More importantly, the increase in CBF in the detemir versus NPH group remained unchanged after exclusion of patients who had received insulin or glucose.</p><p>Although weight gain associated with insulin treatment is relevant for type 1 diabetic patients, it is especially important for patients with type 2 diabetes. It is tempting to generalize the present findings to type 2 diabetes, but further studies in these patients are needed, especially since central insulin resistance possibly plays a role in type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The current study focused on insulin detemir action in the brain. It should be noted, however, that other mechanisms have been proposed to explain its weight-reducing effect. These include less defensive eating due to less hypoglycemia, increased energy expenditure, and higher insulin levels in the liver compared with peripheral tissue, although none of these could be firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In the current study, no significant differences in perceived hypoglycemia frequency were found between treatments.</p><p>In conclusion, the present findings support the hypothesis that a differential effect on CBF, measured during a resting, fasting condition, may contribute to the consistently observed weight-sparing effect of insulin detemir treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
