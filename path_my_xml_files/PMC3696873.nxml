This is a major trauma centre that serves a population of two million people. Approximately 650 patients per year with a fracture of the proximal femur are treated in the centre.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Participants with capacity gave written consent; for those who lacked capacity, written consent was given by a consultee in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p><p>Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups: standard-of-care fixation or standard-of-care fixation and platelet-rich therapy injection. Treatment allocation was determined using a computer generated, randomised number sequence administrated by an independent clinical trials unit via a secure online programme. The randomisation code was stratified by displacement of the fracture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and split into unequal block sizes. Stratification ensured that those fractures which were minimally displaced that are associated with a very substantially improved outcome, were distributed evenly between the groups. The code was only broken at the end of the trial once the trial statistician had locked and analysed the dataset.</p><p>Allocation to the treatment group took place intraoperatively, only after the operating surgeon confirmed a successful reduction of the fracture. Those patients in whom a reduction could not be achieved underwent hip arthroplasty, which reflects standard clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>All participants underwent closed reduction of their fracture, where the leg was manipulated until the bones were &#x02018;reduced&#x02019; back into their normal anatomical position. The lower limb was supported on a fracture table. Internal fixation of the fracture was achieved through a standard lateral approach with perioperative antibiotic cover in accordance with hospital protocol. Postoperative care was the same for both groups of patients with early active mobilisation and immediate full weight bearing with a standardised physiotherapy rehabilitation regime. All participants received routine prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.</p><p>Standard-of-care fixation was with two or three parallel cannulated screws. The number and exact configuration was left to the discretion of the operating surgeon to ensure that the results could be easily generalised. For those participants allocated to platelet-rich therapy, each screw was advanced up to but not beyond the fracture such that no compression was achieved before the platelet-rich plasma was injected. The guidewire of one screw was then removed and 3&#x02005;mL of platelet-rich plasma, harvested in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations (GenesisCS Component Concentrating System, EmCyte Corporation, Fort Myers, Florida, USA), was injected without an activator through the cannulated screw directly into the fracture site under image intensifier guidance.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> The minimum clinically important treatment effect of platelet-rich therapy was agreed in discussion with several expert orthopaedic trauma surgeons. Although the figures&#x000a0;varied by surgeon, all agreed that an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of between 15% and 25% in fixation failure would be clinically important. The overall rate of fixation failure of all intracapsular fractures of the femur is reported to be between 25% and 35%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7 R8 R9">7&#x02013;9</xref> Sample sizes were determined using the PS power and sample size software.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Selecting a power of 90%, and the most plausible estimate of fixation failure rate (30%) and an intermediate value for the minimum clinically important ARR of 20% gives a treatment group size of 82. Adding 20% on to the total trial sample size estimate to account for expected patient mortality gives a recruitment target of 200 participants that should provide a good margin for unanticipated recruitment problems and loss to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary outcome measure, the proportion of patients requiring reoperation for failure of fixation (revision) within 1&#x02005;year of sustaining the fracture, was compared between treatment groups (fixation and fixation plus platelet-rich therapy) using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, where data from participants were analysed by treatment allocation. Treatments were considered to differ significantly if p values were less than 0.05. The primary analysis was an available case analysis where deaths without revision were excluded from the analysis. If mortality differed between the treatment groups, this had the potential to bias the effect estimate, so additional post hoc analyses were undertaken with deaths imputed as both revisions and non-revisions to assess the sensitivity of the primary analysis to the decisions regarding handling of the missing data.</p><p>Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to assess the significance of observed differences for the secondary proportional outcome measures. For continuous outcomes, which were approximately normally distributed, mean differences (MDs) were tested using a two-tailed t test; for non-parametric data (length of stay), differences were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test. A planned subsidiary analysis used a multiple linear regression model to investigate the relationship between each participant's EQ-5D score at 1&#x02005;year postoperatively and the treatment group, after appropriate adjustment for age, sex and fracture displacement for each participant. The incidences of adverse events were reported for each treatment group stratified by the type of event. Planned subgroup analyses were undertaken only for prespecified subgroups. Explanatory variables of sex, fracture displacement, dementia and age were entered into a logistic regression model with associated interaction terms with the treatment arm for each.</p><p>In addition to the primary analysis comparing risks of revision between groups, the Data Monitoring Committee recommended that a post hoc time-to-event analysis was also undertaken to assess temporal differences in revision post operation. In this setting, where failure of the fixation was the event of interest, death was regarded as a competing risk. In the presence of competing risks, the standard cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model is not appropriate as it treats the competing risk (death) as a censored observation. Therefore, the approach adopted here was the proportional hazards model proposed by Fine and Gray,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> based on direct regression modelling of covariates on the cumulative incidence function (CIF). CIF, the proportion of trial participants at time t who had event j (death or revision), was used to compare treatments, and the R software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> package cmprsk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> was used to implement the Fine-Gray model using a stepwise fitting algorithm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participants</title><p>A summary of the flow of participants through the study is at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002583F1">figure 1</xref>.

Interaction terms were added to the model to test for prespecified subgroup effects; that is, additional terms were included in the model that tested to see if the treatment effect was changed (moderated) by fracture displacement, dementia or age group. Appropriate interaction terms were added individually to the base model to give three separate analyses; none of the interaction terms significantly improved the model fit, providing no evidence for substantial subgroup effects.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the unadjusted mean EQ-5D score at 1&#x02005;year between the control and treatment groups (mean control group EQ-5D=0.588, MD=0.018 in favour of the control group, t test; p=0.799). After adjusting for age, sex and fracture displacement, this was maintained.

However, we have been unable to definitively exclude a clinically important difference. A sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of decisions regarding the handling of the missing data and the competing risks of death and revision surgery found similar estimates of the effect size.</p><p>The majority of secondary outcomes, including radiographic, mortality and patient-reported health-related quality-of-life measures, demonstrated effects that were concordant with the primary outcome. The length of inpatient stay was significantly shorter in the group treated with platelet-rich therapy. We are unable to provide a biologically plausible explanation for this difference. There was no evidence of any subgroup interaction effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>This was a pragmatic trial. Although it was only conducted at a single centre, a large number of surgeons were involved in the administration of both the interventions. The consequent variety in reduction and fixation strategies probably reflects wider surgical practice in a well-recognised cohort of patients. The corollary of this, that the case number for any one surgeon was comparatively low, might have reduced the assay sensitivity of the trial. However, each surgeon was either trained to perform the intervention or supervised suitably. Additionally, since each individual surgeon performed only a small number of interventions, the impact of the &#x02018;surgeon effect&#x02019;, related to both experience and technical expertise, was likely to have been small.</p><p>The hypothesis of the trial concerned the incidence of fixation failure. Since it is difficult to define a surrogate outcome of revision, surgery was chosen. It is possible that other considerations, such as patient comorbidity, may have influenced any decision to undertake revision surgery. However, it is unlikely that such considerations differed between the treatment groups.</p><p>Only 80% of the available population was screened for eligibility since the trial staff was often not available outside the working week. This might have produced a sampling bias. However, a review of the admission and screening data revealed no substantial differences in the crucial confounders of age, sex, fracture displacement and chronic cognitive impairment between the unscreened and recruited samples.</p><p>Some participants were being treated with antiplatelet drugs at the time of recruitment into the trial. These participants were not excluded since the trial was pragmatic and there is no evidence that the mechanism of release of the platelet-derived growth factors during platelet-rich therapy administration are dependent on the pathways inhibited by aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Few data exist from other similar studies with which to compare these findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Indeed, to our knowledge, this is the first trial of this size to be conducted exploring platelet-rich therapy in bone healing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p><p>Our modelling demonstrated that fracture displacement and a pre-existing diagnosis of osteoporosis were significant predictors of revision risk. This is consistent with clinical experience and previous authors&#x02019; findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> The cohort study reported by Parker <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> recruited more participants than this trial and identified risk factors with smaller effect sizes. Interestingly, our model found that dementia was a protective factor. It is difficult to develop a biologically plausible explanation for this observation. It may rather reflect the reluctance to embark upon major revision arthroplasty surgery in this group of particularly frail patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions and implications</title><p>How does our work contribute to the current debate concerning platelet-rich therapy? Very little evidence exists to support any routine clinical applications of platelet-rich therapy.
