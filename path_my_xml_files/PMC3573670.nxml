To date, interventions designed to increase participants&#x02019; awareness of benefits to society of completing follow-up, and the impact of a telephone call from a senior female clinician and researcher requesting follow-up have not been evaluated robustly.</p><p><bold><italic>Purpose</italic></bold> Trial 1 aimed to evaluate the effect on trial follow-up of written information regarding the benefits of participation to society. Trial 2 aimed to evaluate the effect on trial follow-up of a telephone call from a senior female clinician and researcher.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods</italic></bold> Two single-blind randomized controlled trials were nested within a larger trial, Txt2stop. In Trial 1, participants were allocated using minimization to receive a refrigerator magnet and a text message emphasizing the benefits to society of completing follow-up, or to a control group receiving a simple reminder regarding follow-up. In Trial 2, participants were randomly allocated to receive a telephone call from a senior female clinician and researcher, or to a control group receiving standard Txt2stop follow-up procedures.</p><p><bold><italic>Results</italic></bold> Trial 1: 33.5% (327 of 976) of the intervention group and 33.8% (329 of 974) of the control group returned the questionnaire within 26 weeks of randomization, risk ratio (RR) 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88&#x02013;1.12. In all, 83.3% (813 of 976) of the intervention group and 82.2% (801 of/974) of the control group sent back the questionnaire within 30 weeks of randomization, RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.97, 1.05. Trial 2: 31% (20 of 65) of the intervention group and 32% (20 of 62) of the control group completed trial follow-up, RR 0.93; 95%CI 0.44, 1.98.</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions</italic></bold> In presence of other methods to increase follow-up neither experimental method (refrigerator magnet and text message emphasizing participation's benefits to society nor a telephone call from study's principal investigator) increased participant follow-up in the Txt2stop trial.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1740774511416524"><title>Introduction</title><p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) generally are considered the gold standard in evaluation of health care interventions but losses to follow-up represent an important threat to both their internal and external validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774511416524">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774511416524">3</xref>]. Bias may occur as those lost to follow-up are likely to differ from those for whom follow-up is completed and bias may be more pronounced where there is differential follow-up between the intervention and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774511416524">4</xref>]. Sprague <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774511416524">4</xref>] suggest that under 5% loss to follow-up will result in little bias, while a loss greater than 20% may represent a serious threat to the validity of the study. However, as the amount of bias introduced depends on the differences between those who were and were not followed-up and is trial specific, the level of bias caused by losses to follow-up cannot be accurately determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774511416524">4</xref>]. The potential for bias introduced by losses to follow-up can only be completely eliminated by achieving 100% follow-up, so it is imperative that trials aim to achieve as close to complete follow-up as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774511416524">5</xref>].</p><p>Many trials fail to achieve high follow-up, potentially wasting economic and intellectual resources. A review of participant recruitment and retention in RCTs in six major journals from 2009 showed that 48% of trials reporting a sample size calculation failed to achieve adequate numbers at outcome assessment, once those lost to follow-up were excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774511416524">6</xref>]. Economic and intellectual resources allocated to research studies are not limitless, and study validity compromised by excessive loss to follow-up is a waste of valuable resources.</p><p>A wide range of methods to increase response rates for postal, e-mail, and telephone questionnaires have been evaluated in RCTs, including the length of questionnaire, prenotification, number of requests, the nature and style of questions, incentives, status of sender, and method of delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511416524">7</xref>].</p><p>The effects on follow-up of interventions that emphasize trial participation's benefits to society are uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511416524">7</xref>]. In all, 10 trials (with a total of 12,731 participants) evaluated the effect of an appeal stressing the benefit to society if participants return a questionnaire: pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 1.29) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511416524">7</xref>]. The trials, however, are affected by several design weaknesses: none of the 10 trials gave evidence of the methods of randomization, except one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774511416524">8</xref>], where allocation was not through randomization but systematic; there was no evidence that allocation of study arm was concealed from trial staff; and all the trials showed evidence of selection bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511416524">7</xref>].</p><p>The effect of a telephone reminder from a senior female clinician/researcher on response rates is not clear. Trials sometimes use a senior staff member to contact non-respondents with the aim of reducing loss to follow-up. Completed trials showed no evidence of effect, when a senior or well-known person signed letters accompanying questionnaires: pooled ORs 1.05 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.23) and OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.15), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511416524">7</xref>]. There was also no evidence of effect on response for the gender of the person requesting follow-up questionnaires (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.58) but in one trial the odds of response decreased by over a half, when the electronic questionnaire was signed by a man (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.80) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511416524">7</xref>]. It is plausible that personal contact by telephone may influence response rates, especially in a clinical trial where the call comes from a senior female clinician and researcher, but to date there have been no trials evaluating this approach.</p><p>Txt2stop is a RCT with 5800 participants that has been designed to evaluate the effect of mobile phone-based smoking cessation support on smoking rates at 6 months after enrolment. The eligibility criteria for Txt2stop were: aged 16 years or over; daily smoker; willing to quit in the next month; owned a mobile phone and resident in the United Kingdom. The primary outcome of Txt2stop was biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months. Data regarding self-reported smoking status were collected and, from those reporting continuous abstinence, a salivary sample for cotinine level assessment was requested by post. Previous trials of smoking cessation support, particularly those using new technologies to deliver support, have experienced high and differential losses to follow-up for long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774511416524">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774511416524">10</xref>]. One of our aims in the Txt2stop trial was to minimize loss to follow&#x02013;up. We followed-up participants by any of the means they agreed to at the start of the trial, including post, e-mail, and telephone calls to mobile, home, or work numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774511416524">11</xref>]. We used all the effective evidence-based methods that were feasible to introduce into the procedures of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774511416524">12</xref>], as identified in the systematic reviews by Edwards <italic>et al</italic>. and Hoile <italic>et al</italic>.

These included monetary incentives, posting correspondence by recorded delivery, pre-notification, follow-up contact, unconditional advance cash incentives, short, concise questionnaires, duplicate questionnaires sent at repeat follow-up attempts, mentioning that commitment to the trial implied an obligation to respond, mention of university sponsorship, prepaid return envelopes with stamps, an assurance of confidentiality, and first-class outward mailing.</p><p>In addition to these procedures, we generated two hypotheses to test in two trials conducted among Txt2stop participants.</p><p>The first research hypothesis was that telling study participants that their participation in research could benefit society, would reduce loss to follow-up in the Txt2stop trial.</p><p>The second research hypothesis was that a telephone call from the study principal investigator (female senior clinician and researcher) explaining the importance of follow-up and asking participants to complete their participation would reduce loss to follow-up in the Txt2stop trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-1740774511416524"><title>Methods</title><p>We obtained ethical approval for these trials from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee.</p><p>Study design and characteristics of the two trials are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774511416524">Table 1</xref>.

We aimed to sensitize participants by making them aware of the social benefits of remaining in the study for its full duration, regardless of smoking cessation status.

A single telephone call from a female senior clinician and researcher did not increase return of mailed saliva samples. These interventions had no additional effect on follow-up when evaluated within a trial, where all other interventions known to increase follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774511416524">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774511416524">10</xref>] already had been implemented. These trials were pragmatic and, apart from the interventions tested, participants received all interventions to increase follow-up that were part of the Txt2stop standard operating procedures.</p><p>The impact of the intervention emphasizing the benefits to society of completing follow-up may have been reduced, since follow-up letters in the standard Txt2stop follow-up procedures already emphasized these benefits to some extent. The Txt2stop standard procedures included telephone calls from trial assistants, who could be male or female. The senior female clinician and researcher was not the only female member of staff calling Txt2stop participants.</p><p>For Trial 2, we included the entire sample of participants available at the time. With this sample, Trial 2 had sufficient power to detect an absolute difference of 25% between intervention and control groups. Ideally, trials should be designed todetect &#x02018;meaningful&#x02019; differences in the outcome. Even modest increases in follow-up could reducebias. Depending on the existing level of trial follow-up, the number of trial participants, and the alternate priorities for a senior investigator's time, it could be worthwhile for a senior investigator to put in the time to increase follow-up by less than 25% (for example, a 5&#x02013;10% absolute increase in follow-up could be important). A limitation of Trial 2 was that the trial was underpowered to detect an absolute increase in follow-up of less than 25%.</p><p>The Trial 1 control group received a text message very similar to the text sent to the Trial 1 intervention group but without any comment emphasizing benefits to society. This text message was sent because telephone text messages have been shown to work as effective reminders for appointments and medications reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774511416524">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774511416524">16</xref>].
