Following injection, there is a variation in the rehabilitation therapy type and amount provided. The purpose of this study was to determine if it is feasible to add intensive therapy to botulinum toxin-A injections for adults with spasticity and whether it is likely to be beneficial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Randomized trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and intention to treat analysis. Thirty-seven adults (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 incomplete or lost follow-up) with spasticity in the upper or lower limb were allocated to one of three groups: experimental group received a single dose of botulinum toxin-A plus an intensive therapy for 8&#x000a0;weeks, control group 1 received a single dose of botulinum toxin-A only, and control group 2 received intensive therapy only for 8&#x000a0;weeks. Feasibility was measured by examining recruitment, intervention (adherence, acceptability, safety), and measurement. Benefit was measured as goal achievement (Goal Attainment Scale), upper limb activity (Box and Block Test), walking (6-min walk test) and spasticity (Tardieu scale), at baseline (week 0), immediately after (week 8), and at three months (week 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Overall recruitment fraction for the trial was 37% (eligibility fraction 39%, enrolment fraction 95%).

Unsurprisingly, higher costs are thus incurred by patients with spasticity during the first year of survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Health professionals identify that addressing spasticity is a high priority during rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and there is international consensus that localized spasticity (i.e., in the upper or lower limbs) is best managed with a combination of botulinum toxin and physical therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While these consensus papers appear to agree, clinical management remains diverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and provides an ongoing challenge for both therapists and health services alike.</p><p id="Par17">In Australia, stroke rehabilitation is guided by the Stroke Foundation clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These guidelines recommend that management of moderate to severe spasticity include the use of botulinum toxin type A <italic>in addition</italic> to physical therapy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Unfortunately, clinical survey data suggests that occupational therapists and physiotherapists report providing therapy post-botulinum toxin type A injections less than a quarter of the time (an estimated 16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This low rate of therapy provision suggests ongoing uncertainty among clinicians as to how to treat patients with spasticity. Such uncertainty is likely to stem from the lack of research studies that describe the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of therapy that is effective for people who have received botulinum toxin injections. While there are previous studies which have tested the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A for spasticity management after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], what remains unknown is whether or not therapy should be provided to this group of patients.</p><p id="Par18">To inform best practice in the treatment and rehabilitation of spasticity in people with neurological conditions, understanding whether the suggested combined effects of using both therapy and botulinum toxin type A together is more beneficial than botulinum toxin-A alone or physiotherapy interventions alone is key. Given the lack of research in this area, a large, powered randomized controlled trial is required. In preparation for this trial, it is key to understand both the feasibility and likely effects of the interventions; therefore, the research questions posed in this pilot study were:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par19">In neurological patients with spasticity, is it feasible to add intensive therapy to botulinum toxin-A injections if the therapy includes both clinic-based and home-based therapy sessions?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">Is adding intensive therapy likely to be of any benefit to goal attainment, upper limb activity, walking, and spasticity over botulinum toxin-A alone or intensive therapy alone?</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par21">A three-group randomized feasibility trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis was conducted at a metropolitan rehabilitation service in Adelaide, Australia. A computer-generated randomization schedule was developed by an independent person who was remote from the area where the study occurred. Allocation was concealed from the recruiter through the use of sealed consecutively numbered opaque envelopes.

If indicated, participants received injections into both upper and lower limb muscles during the same injection session; a maximum dose of 500&#x000a0;U was given in one session. Muscle localization was undertaken via the use of Teflon-coated injection needles allowing electrical stimulation for muscle localization. Participants in the experimental group then undertook an intensive 8-week rehabilitation program delivered by physiotherapists and occupational therapists. The intensive rehabilitation program consisted of serial casting for contracture reduction, strengthening, and task-specific training according to the principles outlined by Carr and Shepherd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Upper/lower limb casts were applied using procedures previously described by Moseley et al.

The Box and Block Test measured unilateral gross manual dexterity and involved the participant moving as many blocks as possible in 60&#x000a0;s. The number of blocks moved was recorded, and a score of 0 was given when the participant was unable to move any of the cubes. Walking was measured using the 6-min walk test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and walking speed reported in meters per second. The test was administered as described by Guyatt et al.

id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par44">The addition of 8&#x000a0;weeks of intensive therapy based on best-available evidence and delivered as structured clinic and home-based outpatient therapy appears feasible for adults with neurological spasticity. Participants attended the majority of sessions, complied with the home-practice program and reported no adverse effects from the intensive therapy program or botulinum toxin injections. Only one participant withdrew from the intensive physiotherapy program for non-study-related reasons. This study found that it is feasible to provide intensive therapy, and while there were promising improvements noted within groups suggesting potential for the intervention to enable change, there were no benefits of one intervention relative to another in terms of goal achievement, upper limb activity, or walking.</p><p id="Par45">In current clinical practice, adults with spasticity who attend an Australian spasticity clinic are more likely to receive botulinum toxin-A alone rather than botulinum toxin-A followed by intensive rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Within-group changes suggest potential benefits to activity and goal attainment in favor of intensive rehabilitation; however, between-group differences were small and not statistically significant. This was a feasibility study with only 37 participants; therefore, effects should be tested in a study with a sufficient sample size. Our adherence rate was also moderate at best, and future studies that test exercise programs carried out largely at home should include aspects in their design that focus on promoting adherence (e.g., learner contracts, motivational interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], structure and support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], or use of a standardized home program such as the Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]). This study found no difference either within or between groups on the measure of spasticity (Tardieu scores) at 12&#x000a0;weeks. Consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], our findings suggest that the effects of botulinum toxin-A had worn off by this time point. We recommend that future trials determining the additive effects of therapies continue to re-measure variables (i.e., follow-up) at 12&#x000a0;weeks post-injection when the effects of botulinum toxin-A have dissipated.</p><p id="Par46">In adults with spasticity, there are large variations in spasticity severity, limbs affected, and how much the spasticity interferes with the person&#x02019;s ability to move. It is, therefore, important to define the population to which this study&#x02019;s findings apply. This study included all people with spasticity that interfered with meaningful movement (upper or lower limb), although in reality, the majority of referred participants had upper limb spasticity (70%). Between-group differences on the secondary outcomes of upper limb activity and walking demonstrated wide confidence intervals and do not provide sufficient support for implementing this rehabilitation program in such a mixed group without further research. With fewer numbers of patients presenting with lower limb spasticity, outcomes on the 6-min walk test should be interpreted with caution, and future trials may need to focus on either the upper or the lower limb in order to ensure sufficient representation in each group.</p><p id="Par47">There are some limitations of this study. The study sample was heterogeneous in nature, and while the primary outcome of goal attainment was able to demonstrate benefit of prescribing therapy to patients after botulinum toxin-A, it was not necessarily able to demonstrate a benefit of prescribing botulinum toxin-A to patients who are receiving intensive therapy interventions. The planned sample size of the current feasibility study was small, and the population varied across the sample with respect to motor ability as is typical of a pilot trial. To reduce heterogeneity, future studies should use baseline ability (walking or upper limb activity) to stratify groups prior to randomization. Selecting only participants with either upper or lower limb spasticity would also reduce the notable heterogeneity. We additionally acknowledge the moderate adherence to the home practice component of our therapy program. Strategies to increase adherence to practice should be embedded in future trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">This study has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a trial that involves prescribing an intensive dose of therapy intervention to outpatients with a neurological injury or illness. While this study was underpowered, power analysis for a future study using Goal Attainment Scale data of the current study (SD 13.75) suggests that a sample size of 136 participants (68 in each group) would be necessary to detect a between-group difference of 7 points on Goal Attainment Scale <italic>t</italic>-score with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80. Given the number of goals set, a 7-point difference represents approximately 10% improvement; clinically, this would equate to achieving at least one goal or partially achieving at least two goals.</p><p id="Par49">In summary, providing an intensive home and clinic-based therapy program to patients after they have received botulinum toxin-A injections for spasticity management appears feasible. In addition, the experimental group demonstrated greater achievement of goals than either control group, particularly at the end of 3&#x000a0;months when the effect of botulinum toxin-A had begun to wane. A larger trial to understand the benefits of delivering the intensive therapy after botulinum toxin-A with respect to upper limb activity or walking is therefore warranted.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>6-min walk test</term><def><p id="Par6">6&#x000a0;min walk test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Con</term><def><p id="Par7">Control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p id="Par8">European quality of life-5 dimension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Exp</term><def><p id="Par9">Experimental</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GRASP</term><def><p id="Par10">Graded repetitive arm supplementary program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MD</term><def><p id="Par11">Mean difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mod Tardieu scale</term><def><p id="Par12">Modified tardieu scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>n</term><def><p id="Par13">Number</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par14">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par15">Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge both Adrian Cowling and Rhiannon Hart who provided the intensive therapy program.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par50">The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>NL and MC initiated the collaborative project and designed the trial.
