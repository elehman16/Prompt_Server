A combination of these disorders increases the risk of developing cardiovascular events. This study investigated the effects of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg; ip)-induced diabetes on blood pressure, oxidative stress and effects of honey on these parameters in the kidneys of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Diabetic WKY and SHR were randomized into four groups and received distilled water (0.5 mL) and honey (1.0 g/kg) orally once daily for three weeks. Control SHR had reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased systolic blood pressure (SBP), catalase (CAT) activity, and total antioxidant status (TAS). SBP, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) were elevated while TAS was reduced in diabetic WKY. In contrast, SBP, TAS, activities of GPx and GR were reduced in diabetic SHR. Antioxidant (honey) treatment further reduced SBP in diabetic SHR but not in diabetic WKY. It also increased TAS, GSH, reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, activities of GPx and GR in diabetic SHR. These data suggest that differences in types, severity, and complications of diseases as well as strains may influence responses to blood pressure and oxidative stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>streptozotocin</kwd><kwd>spontaneously hypertensive rats</kwd><kwd>antioxidant enzymes</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>kidney</kwd><kwd>tualang honey</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidemiological studies suggest that hypertension or diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-12-01888">1</xref>]. It is also known that persons with both hypertension and diabetes mellitus are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular events than are individuals with either risk factor alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-12-01888">2</xref>]. Similarly, in animal models, chemically induced diabetes produces more profound effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) than it does in normotensive strains such as Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-12-01888">3</xref>]. In diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension, the kidney is either a target or it plays a prominent role in these disorders.</p><p>The actual mechanisms by which diabetes exacerbates hypertension still remain unclear. However, a number of hypotheses have been postulated to explain some of these mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-12-01888">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-12-01888">5</xref>]. One of such mechanisms is the role of oxygen-derived free radicals. During atherogenesis, enhanced monocyte adherence to the endothelium, believed to be mediated by induced expression of adhesion molecules and chemotactic proteins, is linked to imbalances or changes in the redox or oxidative state of the endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-12-01888">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-12-01888">6</xref>]. In diabetes, hyperglycemia and/or hyperlipidemia is implicated in the increased generation of reactive oxygen species from vascular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-12-01888">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-12-01888">8</xref>]. This oxidative stress may trigger a number of oxidant-responsive genes that play a prominent role in monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion resulting in endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-12-01888">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-12-01888">11</xref>]. Friedman <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-12-01888">12</xref>] showed that the combination of hypertension and diabetes mellitus is accompanied by higher oxidative stress than that observed in the individual disorder alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-12-01888">12</xref>]. These results would suggest that combined effects of diabetes and hypertension might elicit more pronounced effects not only on redox or antioxidant status but also on their complications compared to the influence of either disease alone.</p><p>A number of <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies have documented the antibacterial, antiproliferative, and antioxidant properties of Malaysian tualang honey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-12-01888">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-12-01888">15</xref>]. This honey has been shown by us to produce glucose lowering as well as protective effects against oxidative stress in kidney and pancreas in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-12-01888">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-12-01888">18</xref>]. Since oxidative stress is recognized as a putative factor in the development and complications of both diabetes mellitus and hypertension, it would be interesting to explore the effects of honey in experimental animals with combined diabetic and hypertensive pathologies. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on blood pressure, antioxidant enzymes, markers of oxidative stress and the effects of tualang honey on some of these parameters in the kidneys of streptozotocin-induced diabetic WKY and SHR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion"><label>2.</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><label>2.1.</label><title>Systolic Blood Pressure</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-12-01888">Figure 1</xref> shows the systolic blood pressure (BP) in control and STZ-induced diabetic WKY and SHR.

Streptozotocin (STZ), an antibiotic derived from <italic>Streptomyces achromogenes</italic>, is a common chemical of choice for inducing animal models of diabetes. Its diabetogenic effect is attributed to its irreversible damage to pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-12-01888">20</xref>]. The induction of diabetes in normotensive and hypertensive rats serves as an experimental model to investigate the effects of diabetes alone as well as the combined effects of diabetes and hypertension in rats. In this study, STZ-treated Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) had significantly increased blood glucose levels compared to control WKY and SHR, respectively as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-12-01888">21</xref>]. In our preliminary results, we had observed that resistance to STZ was higher in WKY than in SHR while mortality was much higher in diabetic SHR than in diabetic WKY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijms-12-01888">22</xref>]. From our data, STZ-induced diabetes had a more profound effect on glycemia in SHR than in WKY. The reason for this is not quite clear. However, some studies have shown that the &#x003b2;-cells are selectively susceptible to STZ, an analog of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), because they contain higher activity of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (OGT, the enzyme responsible for attaching O-GlcNAc to proteins) more than other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-12-01888">23</xref>]. So, it is likely that OGT may be intrinsically over-expressed in SHR &#x003b2;-cells more than in WKY &#x003b2;-cells. There is also a possibility of increased uptake of STZ into SHR &#x003b2;-cells. Moreover, increased oxidative stress is reportedly generated in SHR compared to WKY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijms-12-01888">24</xref>]. Since cytotoxic effect of STZ is believed to be mediated partly through the release of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-12-01888">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-12-01888">26</xref>], administration of STZ might further expose the SHR &#x003b2;-cells to increased levels of free radicals, thus resulting in increased cytotoxicity. These and other mechanisms which require further investigation may play a role in the increased sensitivity of SHR &#x003b2;-cells to STZ. Honey supplementation reduced hyperglycemia significantly in diabetic WKY, similar to what we found in diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-12-01888">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-12-01888">18</xref>]. However, honey did not reduce hyperglycemia significantly in diabetic SHR. This might be due to the severity of hyperglycemia or diabetes in these rats. Insulin treatment, in spite of increased serum insulin, also did not reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic SHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-12-01888">21</xref>]. The significantly reduced body weight observed in control SHR is similar to what was reported by other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-12-01888">21</xref>]. Our results also showed that in STZ-induced diabetes, the magnitudes of weight loss were more in diabetic SHR than in diabetic WKY. In STZ-induced diabetes, proteolysis, enhanced utilization, and mobilization of lipid in the skeletal muscles are reported to cause weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijms-12-01888">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijms-12-01888">28</xref>]. Contrary to our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-12-01888">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-12-01888">17</xref>], it is quite unclear why honey treatment did not improve body weight in both diabetic WKY and SHR.</p><p>Systolic blood pressure (BP) was significantly higher in control SHR than in control WKY similar to what was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijms-12-01888">29</xref>]. Increased production of superoxide anions is implicated in the pathogenesis of elevated blood pressure in SHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-12-01888">30</xref>]. We also found that STZ-induced diabetic WKY had significantly elevated BP compared to control WKY. Our results are consistent with those of Bunag <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-12-01888">31</xref>]. They found that BP, beginning by the second week, was significantly elevated in STZ-treated rats and the elevated blood pressure persisted through the seventh week. Other researchers also reported similar findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijms-12-01888">32</xref>]. On the other hand, there are reports of decreased blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijms-12-01888">33</xref>], or no change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijms-12-01888">34</xref>], with STZ-induced diabetes. The mechanisms by which diabetic normotensive rats become hypertensive or hypotensive still remain poorly understood. At present, it is uncertain whether hypertension is secondary to diabetes or STZ causes hypertension. However, Kawashima <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijms-12-01888">35</xref>] showed that STZ at different doses, even the lowest dose (20 mg/kg) which did not have an effect on the blood glucose levels, significantly increased blood pressure. Based on their findings, they reported that hyperglycemia is not a prerequisite for induction of hypertension by STZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijms-12-01888">35</xref>]. In this study, honey treatment in diabetic WKY did not reduce elevated BP. This seems to suggest that the mechanisms of hypertension in STZ-treated WKY might be unrelated to oxidative stress but due to other mechanisms which need further investigation.</p><p>With STZ-induced diabetes, BP was significantly reduced in diabetic SHR compared to control SHR. Also, there are conflicting reports on blood pressure in diabetic SHR. Our results are similar to those of Davidoff <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-12-01888">21</xref>], Rodgers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijms-12-01888">34</xref>] and Susic <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijms-12-01888">36</xref>] who all reported lower blood pressure in diabetic SHR. However, other researchers did report elevated blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijms-12-01888">32</xref>], or no change in blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijms-12-01888">37</xref>], in STZ-induced SHR. The hypotensive effect of diabetes in SHR is a consequence of reduced peripheral resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijms-12-01888">36</xref>]. The implications of reduced BP in diabetic SHR remain unclear. However, Davidoff and Rodgers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijms-12-01888">38</xref>] reported that decreased blood pressure of diabetic SHR was also accompanied by a progressive decline in heart rate. They further showed that insulin treatment prevented both the depressor and bradycardic effects of diabetes in SHR. Their findings seem to indicate that reduced blood pressure and bradycardia as a result of diabetes in SHR might be detrimental.</p><p>Unlike in Davidoff and Rodgers&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijms-12-01888">38</xref>], honey supplementation in diabetic SHR resulted in further reduction of BP. Our results corroborate those of Medeiros <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijms-12-01888">39</xref>] who reported that olive oil or fish oil produced further diminution of blood pressure in diabetic SHR. Olive oil and fish oil, like tualang honey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-12-01888">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-12-01888">18</xref>], are reported to ameliorate oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijms-12-01888">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ijms-12-01888">41</xref>]. In view of the fact that oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis and/or maintenance of hypertension in SHR, the further reduction of BP elicited by these oils or honey might be due to their antioxidant effects. On the other hand, insulin, unknown to exhibit antioxidant effect, might improve diabetes and other metabolic derangements including hyperglycemia. These effects of insulin might diminish or counteract the effects of diabetes on blood pressure resulting in restoration of the BP towards that of the control SHR. Moreover, considering that these researchers reported hyperinsulinemia after a prolonged treatment period, it is possible that elevated insulin levels generated ROS contributing to the steady increments in blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ijms-12-01888">42</xref>].</p><p>Our data showed that the activities of GPx and GR were up-regulated in diabetic WKY whereas they were down-regulated in diabetic SHR. Further studies are required to clarify the reasons and also perhaps the implications of these disparities. However, since diabetic WKY compared to diabetic SHR had moderate levels of hyperglycemia, free radicals generated in diabetic WKY might be less compared to those formed in diabetic SHR. As a result, the up-regulated activities of GPx and GR might be a compensatory mechanism to protect the kidneys from the detrimental effects of free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ijms-12-01888">43</xref>]. On the other hand, considering the severity of hyperglycemia in diabetic SHR, the kidneys of these rats might be exposed to higher levels of oxidative stress resulting in glycation or inhibition of GPx and GR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ijms-12-01888">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ijms-12-01888">45</xref>]. Besides, elevated blood pressure in SHR might also contribute to increased generation of free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-12-01888">30</xref>]. Furthermore, there are reports that differences in sex, tissue, and duration of diseases influence the responses of antioxidant enzymes to changes in redox status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ijms-12-01888">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ijms-12-01888">47</xref>]. Therefore, in diabetic WKY and diabetic SHR, the differential responses of GPx and GR activities (induction or inhibition) to oxidative stress might be attributed to differences in types, severity, and combinations/complications of diseases as well as strains of animals. We found a significantly reduced TAS and a slightly, non-significantly depressed activity of catalase in kidneys of diabetic WKY and diabetic SHR. Other markers of oxidative stress such as MDA, GSH, and GSH/GSSG ratio remained unchanged in kidneys of diabetic WKY and diabetic SHR. The beneficial effects of honey supplementation on some of these markers were noticed in kidneys of diabetic WKY and diabetic SHR.</p><p>Our results showed that TAS was significantly higher in control SHR compared to control WKY. Higher TAS is suggestive of lower oxidative stress. In some studies, TAS is reported to be lower in SHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ijms-12-01888">48</xref>]. However, another study found no significant difference in TAS between SHR and WKY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ijms-12-01888">49</xref>]. In our study, the reason for the increased TAS in control SHR still remains unclear. Although TAS is supposed to reflect or indicate total antioxidant capacity, this is not always the case. TAS assays generally measure mainly the chain breaking antioxidants such as urate, ascorbate, bilirubin, &#x003b1;-tocopherol, carotenoids, and flavonoids, without taking into consideration the contribution of antioxidant enzymes and other metal binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ijms-12-01888">50</xref>]. Urate, a weak antioxidant <italic>in vivo</italic>, is known to contribute more than 50% of total antioxidant activity in most TAS assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ijms-12-01888">50</xref>]. A study reported that patients suffering from renal failure had increased TAS as a result of elevated urate in spite of the fact that these patients had reduced ascorbate and other chain breaking antioxidants as well as increased free radical damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ijms-12-01888">51</xref>]. Consequently, it is recommended that TAS as an indicator of reduced oxidative stress should be interpreted cautiously because it may mislead and give a false impression of enhanced antioxidant status or defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ijms-12-01888">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ijms-12-01888">51</xref>]. Accordingly, we do not believe that higher TAS in control SHR is indicative of reduced oxidative stress. The elevated BP in control SHR also lends credence to this view. The TAS results may corroborate previous findings as well as views expressed by other researchers that TAS, as a marker of oxidative stress, is not sufficient and thus should be coupled with the measurements of antioxidant enzymes, individual antioxidants, and other markers of oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ijms-12-01888">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ijms-12-01888">51</xref>].</p><p>Whether oxidative stress precedes hypertension or <italic>vice versa</italic> remains controversial. This is because there is evidence in support of either view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-12-01888">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ijms-12-01888">52</xref>]. Our results showed that the control SHR compared to control WKY had significantly increased CAT activity. Considering that SHR, compared to WKY, are known to exhibit increased oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-12-01888">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-12-01888">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijms-12-01888">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-12-01888">30</xref>], it is possible that the over-expressed activity of CAT might be a compensatory mechanism to protect the kidney against the deleterious effects of free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ijms-12-01888">43</xref>]. We are also of the view that the enhanced CAT activity might contribute considerably to the significantly reduced levels of MDA in control SHR. Surprisingly, the same rats (control SHR) also had significantly elevated BP. Normally, with the reduced levels of MDA, one would have inferred that the levels of oxidative stress were much lower in control SHR than in control WKY. However, it may not be scientifically sound to make such an inference in view of the elevated BP in control SHR coupled with the numerous evidences that support the role of oxidative stress in the development of hypertension or <italic>vice versa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-12-01888">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ijms-12-01888">52</xref>]. In fact, it is plausible to hypothesize that the reduced levels of MDA and increased TAS in control SHR might be consequences of enhanced CAT activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><label>3.</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><label>3.1.</label><title>Animals</title><p>This study complied with the institutional guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, Universiti Sains Malaysia [USM/Animal Ethics Approval/2009/(46) (145)].

Furthermore, our data seem to suggest that oxidative stress, unlike in SHR, may not contribute considerably to elevated blood pressure in STZ-treated diabetic rats. Though additional studies with other potent antioxidants such as tempol are required, the inability of tualang honey to decrease elevated BP of diabetic WKY further substantiates this view. The effectiveness of antioxidants including tualang honey not only in ameliorating oxidative stress but also in reducing elevated BP in diabetic SHR corroborate the prominent role of ROS in elevated BP of SHR. Our results indicate that differences in types, severity, and combinations/complications of diseases (hypertension and/or diabetes), as well as strains, may influence antioxidant enzymes in response to changes in redox status. Our study underscores the need for additional studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which STZ-induced diabetes causes hypertension in diabetic normotensive rats. Further studies that investigate the protein and gene expressions of GPx and GR may reveal a differential role in regulating post-translational modification of these antioxidant enzymes in diabetic WKY and diabetic SHR.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a grant (RU:1001/PPSP/81202020) from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).
