Tranexamic acid (TXA) in last decade has emerged as an effective and safe way to decrease postoperative bleeding and transfusion rates. Although there is little doubt on the efficacy of the drug, the debate on ideal mode is more recent. We undertook this study to find out the most effective and yet safest way of TXA administration.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A single institution - two hospital-based, double-blinded, prospective, randomized control trial was conducted from January 2015 to December 2015. One hundred and fifty patients were randomly divided in one of the three groups using computer-generated tables - intravenous (IV), intraarticular and combined. Evident loss through drain, total loss based on gross method and hemoglobin balance method, hidden blood losses, hemoglobin, and hematocrit drop, all possible complications related to TXA were evaluated and compared among groups.

All patients from 50 to 85 years with the diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis of knee awaiting surgery from January 2015 to December 2015 were eligible for the trial. Exclusion criterion included patients with secondary osteoarthritis (rheumatoid and other inflammatory arthritis, posttraumatic arthritis), known allergies to TXA, major comorbidities (the American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade 4 and above), coagulopathies (international normalized ratio &#x0003e;1.4), history of previous deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or patients on antithrombotic treatment, previous history of stroke, or severe ischemic cardiomyopathy patients undergoing bilateral TKA. Patients with hemoglobin levels of &#x0003c;11 were deferred for surgery till hemoglobin levels increased over 11. As hospital strategy, these patients were managed on oral hematinic and/or subcutaneous injection of 40,000 IU of erythropoietin. A total of 200 patients were recruited in the trial during the study. These were divided into four groups: (i) IV group, (ii) topical group, (iii) combined group, and (iv) control group. Finally, a control group was excluded. Because, we believed that debarring patients from well-known benefits of TXA only for study purpose was unethical.</p><p>The study proposed 1:1 randomization for each group. Each patient recruited in the study was assigned a unique identification number and was randomized using computer-generated tables by an independent orthopedic fellow in one of the three groups. The assigned group was kept in sealed envelope opened during surgery by nonscrubbing nurse. Drug [TXA 500 mg/5 ml amples&#x02013;Trneas<sup>R</sup>, Shin Poong, Korea] and placebo [normal saline] were prepared according to the envelope by Grade 1 resident not directly involved in surgery and administered by independent anesthetic. The volume and appearance of drug and placebo were identical, and both surgeons and patients were blinded to the assigned group throughout the study. Independent research fellow performed all data acquisition and analysis.</p><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and was conducted under the ethical norms laid down by the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964. Informed consent was sought from all participating patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Administration of tranexamic acid</title><p>Group 1 was planned for IV TXA transfusion. The drug was administered in dose 10 mg/kg 20 min before tourniquet application as a preoperative dose, 10 mg/kg 15 min before deflation of the tourniquet as an intraoperative dose, and 10 mg/kg 3 h after the second dose as a postoperative dose. As placebo, the group received 50 ml of saline retrograde through drain after surgery.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Group 2 was administered 1.5 g of TXA in 50 ml of saline retrograde through the drain after wound closure, and as placebo, it was given 5 cc of IV normal saline in doses similar to IV group.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Group 3 was planned for combined administration. These patients received the preoperative and postoperative TXA injections of 10 mg/kg similar to IV group. The intraoperative dose was omitted. Instead, patients were given 1.5 g of TXA in 50 ml of saline retrograde through the drain after wound closure. As placebo, these patients received 5 ml of normal saline at the time of intraoperative dose.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Operative procedure and intraoperative management</title><p>All patients underwent a preanesthetic checkup as per institution policy. A routine prophylactic dose of 1 g cephazoline was administered preoperatively. Similar multimodal analgesia regime starting preoperatively was used in all patients. Two senior authors performed all the surgeries. Surgeries were performed under tourniquet, with pressure of 280 mm of mercury for every patients. Standard midline incision with parapatellar approach was used in all cases. The femur was prepared using intramedullary alignment, and femoral canal was blocked with bone plug after femoral preparation. Tibia was prepared using extramedullary alignment. All patients received posterior stabilized type implant. Patellar resurfacing was not done for any patient. All patients received intraarticular drain. It was clamped only for 10 min in all patients. Previous experience had shown that clamping of drain for 30&#x02013;60 min, as advised in various studies of intraarticular TXA, caused drains to be blocked by clotted blood and made them ineffective in postoperative period.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Contact period of 10 min is shown effective for TXA, and further, clamping was found unnecessary.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Tourniquets were released after closure before application of dressing. All patients received continuous femoral catheter for pain control, which was kept for 24 h.</p><p>A standard postoperative protocol was followed in all patients. All patients had postoperative hematocrit and hemoglobin measurements on day 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As hospital policy, the transfusion was given only at hemoglobin levels of &#x0003c;8 gm%. The thigh (10 cm over suprapatellar border), suprapatellar, and calf girths (maximum calf circumference) were measured daily up to 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative days. The drains were emptied every day, and the amount of drained blood was measured. The drains were removed only when this amount was &#x0003c;100 ml for 24 h. On an average, drains were kept for 3 days (range 2&#x02013;5 days). This has been our institution policy, as we have observed that the removal of drains at one preselected time may not work in all cases. Some cases have collection for longer periods, and early removal in such cases may not only cause erroneous lower recordings of drained blood but also has a risk of hematoma formation Foleys catheter and compression bandage were removed on day 1, and patients were encouraged for muscle strengthening exercises and walker assisted walking. Aggressive rehabilitation policy and inpatient physiotherapy were provided to all patients.</p><p>Owing to low incidence of DVT in Asian population, routine chemoprophylaxis was not warranted.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Pneumatic calf pumps were used in all patients until they started ambulation. Chemical prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin was given only in high-risk patients screened preoperatively. Routine deep vein thrombosis was not done for asymptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients were screened for DVT using Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) angiography of deep veins of leg and for chest. As our institution policy, all patients were discharged after suture removal at 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>The primary outcome variables were transfusion incidence, drain output, postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit drop, calculated perioperative blood loss through gross formula<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and hemoglobin balance method,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and postoperative increment in lower limb girth measurement.

In addition, combined administration causes least hidden losses than any other group, and probably, therefore, is the cause of least postoperative thigh swelling following arthroplasty. Further, all modes of administration were found safe with no complications occurred in any group due to drug administration.</p><p>Surgical trauma after arthroplasty results in a hyperfibrinolytic state.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This is further augmented by increased fibrinolysis following tourniquet release.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Since early postoperative bleeding is the result of shift in hemostatic mechanism toward fibrinolysis, the antifibrinolytic drugs such as TXA are very effective to control this bleeding. Literature confirms this point, and there is little controversy regarding the effectiveness of drug.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The recent debate is regarding the mode of administration of the drug.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> IV, topical, or combined administration are most commonly used modes in orthopedic practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, no randomized control trial has yet compared the three modes in a single study.</p><p>The regimen proposed in the study was based on review of literature and our experience. The combination of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative doses for IV group has been shown to be most effective by study of Maniar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The strength of 10 mg/kg has been shown to be effective to produce antifibrinolytic effect in various studies.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This formed the basis of IV regime as we tried to keep total dose to be minimal. Intraarticular dosages have varied from 1.5 g to 3 g in various studies; however, none of them has measured serum tranexamic levels.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Animal studies have shown low systemic absorption of the drug, yet limited clinical results are available on the topic.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Further Wong <italic>et al</italic>. have shown 1.5 g to be equally effective as 3-g dose.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In view of equal efficacy and limited results on systemic absorption of drugs in humans, we chose the least effective dose of 1.5 g for topical group.</p><p>The preoperative dose has been described as most important dosage in any IV regime.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This deactivates fibrinolysis as soon as it starts.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition, fibrinolysis is best inhibited at early stages, and this can be achieved by preoperative dose.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Hence, this dose was chosen to be the part of combined regime. The intraarticular dose was same as topical group as it was most effective. This also replaced the intraoperative dose which served to decrease overall systemic load of drug without compromising results. Most of the intraarticular drug has shown to maintain biological half-life of 3 h.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, fibrinolytic response after surgical trauma is known to be biphasic with an increased activity during the first 3 h, followed by a shutdown that peaks at about 24 h.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Hence, a postoperative dose was considered important for the second peak. TXA is known to enter extravascular space and accumulates in tissues for 17 h.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This formed the basis of our combined regime.</p><p>Similar to most authors, our results also showed combined administration to be most effective regime.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> IV and intraarticular regimes were found to be equally effective.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, drain losses and calculated losses were higher in our study than few papers in literature. This is because drains in most series have been removed at fixed point of time &#x02013; 24&#x02013;48 h.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> On the other hand, we continued drains till output was &#x0003c;100 ml/24 h and on average kept drains for 3 days (range 2&#x02013;5 days). Similarly, most calculated losses were based on fixed day hemoglobin value in most series (2<sup>nd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> day).<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> However, since fixed day value may not be lowest for all patients, we chose lowest value over first 7 days for this calculation. We believe fixed day drain output or hemoglobin value are underestimation of actual losses and our method is a better approximation of true blood loss.</p><p>Hidden losses are shown to be around 40%&#x02013;50% of true losses.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This was true in our series for IV group (43.2% of total loss) and control group. The hidden losses for topical group were 39.4% and 38.2% for combined group. This showed that the intraarticular administration was effective in reducing hidden losses. These hidden losses are thought to be due to bleeding from tissues and hemolysis. It seems that direct high concentration of drug in tissues may have decreased this part of bleeding resulting in lower hidden losses. This tissue swelling and bleeding are the cause of postoperative swelling. A decrease in hidden losses also resulted in decrease postoperative swelling in above groups. Although the hidden losses and swelling have not been directly compared in all groups, there have been few isolated reports supporting our finding. Good <italic>et al</italic>. showed that IV TXA in two doses of 10 mg/kg reduces external blood loss but not hidden loss.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In another study by Ishida <italic>et al</italic>. showed intraarticular administration reduces postoperative swelling probably by reducing hidden loss. This study has for the first time compared hidden losses and swelling in all three modes.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>As concluded by most authors, we also found that the use of TXA is safe over described drug dosages.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> No report of DVT was found in any group despite no use of routine prophylaxis. The intraarticular administration was not sought with any wound-related complications.</p><p>The strength of our study is a large number of patients and description of all modes in a single study. Different authors use different dosages and calculation methods for total losses. This makes comparison among various reports difficult. This study not only describes all modes of administration of drug but also uses various methods of blood loss calculation to be able to compare with available data. In addition, method of calculations used in this study appears more accurate as hemoglobin and hematocrit trends were followed for 2 weeks, and lowest 7-day values were taken for calculation instead of a fixed day value for all patients. Similarly, drains were maintained for longer periods to give more accurate idea of evident losses. The number of patients is large and to the best of our knowledge has not been superseded in any previous study. The study of hidden loss and postoperative swelling has also not been done in the past.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study. First, two different surgeons performed surgeries; the surgical technique by itself might be a confounding factor in assessing the blood loss. Second, we also did not include patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral TKA in the present study, and therefore, our conclusions may not apply to these patients. Third, no blood studies have been carried out to estimate serum TXA levels following TKA, and thus, no information regarding the toxicity related to TXA can be retrieved. Last, the present study has not addressed the subjective knee function score of the patients after TKA, as the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the ideal mode of administration of drug.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Combined administration of the drug is most effective way to decrease postoperative bleeding and requirement of transfusion in unilateral TKA without increasing any risk of complications.
