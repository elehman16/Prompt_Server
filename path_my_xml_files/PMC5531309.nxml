Mortality is greatest among children with high-risk conditions including HIV infection or exposure, severe malnutrition and/or severe hypoxaemia. WHO treatment recommendations include low-flow oxygen for children with severe pneumonia. Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) is a non-invasive support modality that provides positive end-expiratory pressure and oxygen. bCPAP is effective in the treatment of neonates in low-resource settings; its efficacy is unknown for high-risk children with severe pneumonia in low-resource settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>CPAP IMPACT is a randomised clinical trial comparing bCPAP to low-flow oxygen in the treatment of severe pneumonia among high-risk children 1&#x02013;59 months of age. High-risk children are stratified into two subgroups: (1) HIV infection or exposure and/or severe malnutrition; (2) severe hypoxaemia. The trial is being conducted in a Malawi district hospital and will enrol 900 participants. The primary outcome is in-hospital mortality rate of children treated with standard care as compared with bCPAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>CPAP IMPACT has approval from the Institutional Review Boards of all investigators.

</p><p>Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) is a relatively inexpensive mode of non-invasive ventilation. bCPAP treats hypoxaemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure by expanding lungs towards optimal functional residual capacity, which can improve gas exchange and work of breathing by optimising ventilation/perfusion matching, improving lung compliance and reducing airway resistance. It has been successfully used in resource-rich settings for decades in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in neonates. Several trials have demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of bCPAP in treating neonates with respiratory distress in low-resource settings.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><p>bCPAP has been proposed as a treatment modality for children with severe pneumonia in low-resource settings, including children with high-risk conditions such as HIV&#x000a0;infection, HIV&#x000a0;exposure without infection (HUE), severe malnutrition and severe hypoxaemia.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref> However, evidence of bCPAP&#x02019;s effectiveness in children with severe pneumonia in low-resource settings is lacking.</p><p>Our group has documented favourable severe pneumonia outcomes in Malawian children using bCPAP in case series and reports.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> A recent randomised controlled trial conducted in Bangladesh demonstrated that children with severe hypoxaemic pneumonia had decreased mortality among those treated with bCPAP compared with standard care of low-flow oxygen.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> While this study&#x02019;s results provide critical proof of concept, its generalisability to low-resource settings with higher pneumonia case fatality rates remains unclear. For example, the study was conducted in an intensive care unit although the majority of children aged 1&#x02013;59 months with severe pneumonia are treated in district hospitals that lack intensive care.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Additionally, the Bangladesh study was terminated at interim analysis due to perceived efficacy which has led some to argue that the results are difficult to interpret.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p><p>No studies evaluating bCPAP among African children with severe pneumonia and high-risk conditions exist to date. Children with HIV&#x000a0;infection, HUE, severe malnutrition and/or hypoxaemia are at greater risk of pneumonia mortality than other children and are also represented disproportionally among child pneumonia deaths globally.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 12 19&#x02013;21</xref> Identifying bCPAP&#x02019;s impact on children with these high-risk conditions is important because of their high prevalence in low-resource African settings.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 21&#x02013;23</xref> Further reductions in global child pneumonia mortality will require interventions that successfully target these groups.</p><p>In addition to determining bCPAP&#x02019;s effectiveness in pneumonia treatment, specific implementation challenges must also be addressed. While bCPAP may be effective in certain settings like tertiary referral hospitals, wider implementation of bCPAP to the district hospital level where most children receive hospital care may have substantial challenges. For example, bCPAP devices, while not as costly as invasive methods of ventilation, are generally more expensive than traditional low-flow oxygen nasal cannula delivery. bCPAP also requires greater patient-provider ratios of clinicians with specialised training to ensure accurate, continuous pressure delivery. Identifying the subset of patients most likely to benefit from bCPAP will assist with resource allocation, particularly where bCPAP access is limited.</p><p>Prior to wider investment and implementation of bCPAP for non-neonatal pneumonia in low-resource settings, it is necessary to understand whether bCPAP use confers a mortality benefit among high-risk children. Therefore, we are conducting a prospective randomised trial comparing bCPAP to low-flow oxygen among an African paediatric population with endemic HIV and a high prevalence of severe malnutrition to answer this question. The paper describes our research methods and rationale and outlines our efforts to manage two goals: (1) a pragmatic study design that allows for generalisable results; (2) a study that maintains the rigours of a randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study is an unblinded, randomised, superiority trial with parallel assignment and a 1:1 allocation ratio.

District hospitals are where the majority of children in low-resource settings are treated for severe pneumonia.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The study is designed to be representative of everyday care in order to optimise the generalisability of our results, while maintaining the scientific rigour of a trial.</p><p>Salima District Hospital (SDH) in Malawi is the project site.

</title><p>We chose to initiate all enrolled children with a comorbidity (HIV infection or HUE, and/or severe malnutrition), regardless of SpO<sub>2</sub>, on oxygen by either low&#x000a0;flow or bCPAP for four main reasons. First, children without severe hypoxaemia but with severe pneumonia and a comorbidity still have elevated mortality, suggesting that severe hypoxaemia should not be the only indication for bCPAP in this group of children. In most resource-rich settings, the observation of an acute illness with increased work of breathing in selected higher risk children can itself be an indication for bCPAP, since the continuous positive pressure delivered can ease respiratory distress by improving lung compliance and reducing airway resistance. Second, pulse oximetry is not widely available in Malawi; severe pneumonia, in the absence of oximetry, is a clinical indication for oxygen treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Third, there is evidence from Malawi that children with pneumonia and moderate hypoxaemia (SpO<sub>2&#x000a0;</sub>90%&#x02013;92%) have a greater risk of hospital mortality, calling into question the currently recommended Sp0<sub>2</sub> threshold of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;90% for oxygen initiation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Lastly, bCPAP requires 6&#x02013;8 LPM flow to maintain pressure, and this flow is delivered using an oxygen concentrator. We do not expect that district hospitals will have the technology to titrate the fractional oxygen content of the delivered flow required to maintain bCPAP pressure. In addition to an oxygen concentrator and pulse oximetry, titrating fractional oxygen content of bCPAP flow would require delivery of room-air flow and a separate oxygen analyser.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Children enrolled in our trial are diagnosed with severe pneumonia based on clinical criteria</title><p>Given our goal is to make the trial results as generalisable as possible, we choose to use clinical diagnosis of WHO severe pneumonia alone as inclusion criteria. While chest radiographs may add improved specificity to the clinical diagnosis of severe pneumonia, the majority of low-resource settings do not have access to radiographs and are diagnosed with severe pneumonia based on WHO criteria alone.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>In addition, chest radiographs alone are an imperfect reference standard to diagnose pneumonia and are not routinely recommended for pneumonia diagnosis by the WHO.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 28</xref> Instead, chest radiographs are recommended mainly for children who fail first-line pneumonia treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the recently completed multicountry Pneumonia Etiology for Child Health study, approximately 45% of children with chest indrawing or danger signs had a normal chest radiograph (Fancourt N, personal communication).</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>We limit bCPAP pressures to 8 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 (children aged&#x000a0;2&#x02013;59 months) and 7 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 (children aged&#x000a0;1&#x02013;2 months)</title><p>An important risk of higher bCPAP pressures is a pneumothorax. Higher bCPAP pressures are commonly used in resource-rich settings with advanced, continuous monitoring that allows for immediate detection of a pneumothorax. In a low-resource setting, with limited monitoring, we determined <italic>a priori</italic> that we would limit bCPAP pressures to pressures safely used in previously reported observational studies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Notably, two blinded paediatric intensivists independently reviewed this protocol and agreed with this approach prior to study implementation. Future work could examine whether higher bCPAP pressures are feasible, effective and safe in routine care settings with limited supervision and safety measures.</p></sec><sec id="s4a4"><title>We are enrolling children with severe pneumonia but without comorbidity (HIV infection or exposure, and/or severe malnutrition) and severe hypoxaemia into a parallel observational substudy</title><p>As already detailed in this work, we used existing mortality evidence to define our higher risk severe pneumonia cases as children with HIV infection, HUE, severe malnutrition or severe hypoxaemia. However, there may be other at-risk groups of children not enrolled into the trial. Therefore, to better understand whether CPAP IMPACT&#x02019;s enrolment criteria have captured those at greatest mortality risk, and to better understand whether there are additional key mortality risk factors in those children not included in CPAP IMPACT, we are following until hospital outcome those children with severe pneumonia but without a comorbidity or severe hypoxaemia. Children enrolled into the observational substudy are initially evaluated by our study staff and determined to be without comorbidity. Haemoglobin levels and malaria status are collected, standard WHO severe pneumonia treatment is prescribed and then the child is transferred into the care of SDH government staff. Hospital outcomes are recorded. This comprehensive study design should provide a deeper understanding of severe pneumonia cases at a Malawian district hospital while also validating whether CPAP IMPACT has appropriately targeted children at the greatest mortality risk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Efforts towards rigorous protocol</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>We are using the <italic>Fisher &#x00026; Paykel&#x000a0;Bubble CPAP</italic> system for this study&#x02019;s bCPAP device</title><p>While such a system is standard of care in most resource-rich settings, a hybrid, locally designed bCPAP system is more commonly used in low-resource settings.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Previously we have used locally designed systems, but for this study we instead chose to use the commercially available Fisher &#x00026; Paykel system.</p><p>Our previous work identified that if flow is not warmed and humidified, secretions can harden and cause nasal obstruction.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The Fisher &#x00026; Paykel system delivers warmed, humidified flow. In addition, we determined that, for this initial trial, using a validated commercial device would increase the precision of bCPAP pressure to the patient.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>We are using dedicated study staff to care for children enrolled in the trial</title><p>We determined that a dedicated study staff is necessary to assure that bCPAP is reliably implemented, protocols are followed and data are accurately collected.

Our study installed a back-up electrical generator to assure uninterrupted power to the bCPAP devices and oxygen concentrators. While using a generator may decrease generalisability to district hospitals without back-up power supply, assuring uninterrupted power decreases the likelihood that electricity interruptions will become a confounding variable in evaluating bCPAP&#x02019;s efficacy.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the impact of bCPAP on mortality among children with severe pneumonia and high-risk conditions in a district hospital setting representative of where the majority of children in low-resource settings receive treatment for severe pneumonia. Our study&#x02019;s results should inform policymakers and clinicians as they make decisions of whether to implement bCPAP as a pneumonia treatment for their populations, especially in African settings with endemic HIV, severe malnutrition and hypoxaemia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> @tinylungsglobal</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> EDM conceived the study and participated in the design of the study, implementation of the study, revising of the manuscript and approved the final manuscript.
