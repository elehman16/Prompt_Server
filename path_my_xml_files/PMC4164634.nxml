Meat intake impairs insulin sensitivity and leads to increased oxidative stress. However, its effect on postprandial gastrointestinal hormone (GIH) secretion is unclear. We aimed to investigate the acute effects of two standardized isocaloric meals: a processed hamburger meat meal rich in protein and saturated fat (M-meal) and a vegan meal rich in carbohydrates (V-meal). We hypothesized that the meat meal would lead to abnormal postprandial increases in plasma lipids and oxidative stress markers and impaired GIH responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized crossover study, 50 patients suffering from type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 50 healthy subjects underwent two 3-h meal tolerance tests. For statistical analyses, repeated-measures ANOVA was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The M-meal resulted in a higher postprandial increase in lipids in both groups (p&#x0003c;0.001) and persistent postprandial hyperinsulinemia in patients with diabetes (p&#x0003c;0.001). The plasma glucose levels were significantly higher after the V-meal only at the peak level. The plasma concentrations of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were higher (p&#x0003c;0.05, p&#x0003c;0.001, p&#x0003c;0.001, respectively) and the ghrelin concentration was lower (p&#x0003c;0.001) after the M-meal in healthy subjects. In contrast, the concentrations of GIP, PYY and PP were significantly lower after the M-meal in T2D patients (p&#x0003c;0.001). Compared with the V-meal, the M-meal was associated with a larger increase in lipoperoxidation in T2D patients (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Interpretation</title><p>Our results suggest that the diet composition and the energy content, rather than the carbohydrate count, should be important considerations for dietary management and demonstrate that processed meat consumption is accompanied by impaired GIH responses and increased oxidative stress marker levels in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01572402">NCT01572402</ext-link>

However, the postprandial metabolic response is likely also modified by the contents of other macronutrients in meals and by gastrointestinal hormone (GIH) release.</p><p>Dietary saturated fat is known to impair insulin sensitivity and to enhance hepatic glucose production <xref rid="pone.0107561-Savage1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Studies of patients suffering from diabetes have revealed that dietary fat delays gastric emptying, leading to a lag in glucose absorption <xref rid="pone.0107561-Lodefalk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107561-Gentilcore1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. On the other hand, studies suggest that in patients suffering from diabetes, higher fat meals acutely increase the glucose concentration and the requirement for insulin compared with meals containing similar carbohydrate but lower fat contents <xref rid="pone.0107561-Wolpert1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Additionally, addition of protein energy to a meal likely increases the postprandial glucose level <xref rid="pone.0107561-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Epidemiological studies suggest a positive association between high consumption of total and red meat and incident T2D <xref rid="pone.0107561-Aune1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107561-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Subjects who consumed any processed meats (salted fish and frankfurters) were 38% more likely to develop diabetes <xref rid="pone.0107561-Pan2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Previous studies support the concept that increased oxidative stress may play an important role in T2D manifestation <xref rid="pone.0107561-Ceriello1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Dietary fat quality has been proposed to be a critical factor. Several studies have suggested that a high intake of saturated fatty acids naturally present in meat contributes to the risk of glucose intolerance <xref rid="pone.0107561-Feskens1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107561-Maron1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

The aim of our study was to determine the acute effects of meat and plant-based meals on postprandial GIH secretion. Thus, we designed this randomized crossover study to evaluate the acute (a time span of hours) postprandial response to two standardized meals containing the same caloric content but a different nutritional content: a processed meat (hamburger) meal rich in protein and saturated fat and a plant-based meal rich in carbohydrates. The objective of our study was to examine whether the acute intake of different types of isocaloric meals consumed in amounts typical of normal eating (food intake representative of real life) would be associated with different postprandial changes in glucose, lipid, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), GIH and oxidative stress marker levels in patients with T2D compared with healthy subjects. We investigated the hypothesis that a processed meat meal would lead to an abnormal postprandial increase in the levels of plasma lipids and oxidative stress markers and impaired GIH responses in T2D patients. Our results should contribute knowledge relevant to the dietary management of diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1.

Postprandial changes in the plasma concentrations of oxidative stress markers</title><p>The postprandial state, characterized by hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, is associated with increased oxidative stress in patients suffering from diabetes <xref rid="pone.0107561-Ceriello2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In our group of T2D patients, we detected significantly higher fasting concentrations of all oxidative stress markers and significantly lower concentrations of blood antioxidants. Previous studies support the concept that increased oxidative stress may play an important role in T2D manifestation <xref rid="pone.0107561-Ceriello1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Dietary fat quality has been proposed to be a critical factor. Several studies have suggested that a high intake of saturated fatty acids naturally present in meat contributes to the risk of glucose intolerance <xref rid="pone.0107561-Feskens1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107561-Maron1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Based on an intervention study, humans suffering from metabolic syndrome who were consuming a high saturated fatty acid diet displayed higher levels of oxidative stress markers postprandially <xref rid="pone.0107561-PerezMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107561-Cardona1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We found that in diabetic patients during the postprandial phase, the processed meat meal was associated with a significantly greater increase in the products of oxidative damage, namely TBARS, compared with the plant based meal. This finding could also be due to the method of cooking at a high temperature. It has been reported that most of the lipid-peroxidation products ingested from popular foods are derived from meat products and high-fat processed foods such as red meats cooked at high temperatures <xref rid="pone.0107561-Goldberg1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Another study has shown that adding antioxidants to hamburger meat could significantly reduce the formation of lipid-peroxidation products during cooking <xref rid="pone.0107561-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>4. Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>The strength of our study was that we took a physiological approach to measure the postprandial state. We selected two simple isocaloric meals at amounts corresponding to those ingested during a typical meal. The M-meal was rich in both saturated fat and protein; thus, we cannot separate the effect of each macronutrient.</p><p>This study also had several limitations. First, the T2D patients exhibited a significantly higher body weight and BMI compared with the control subjects, and these differences may have affected some of the responses reported. The object of our study was to compare the effect of the two different meals within each group (patients with T2D and healthy subjects). In healthy subjects, no effect of adiposity on the postprandial GIP and GLP-1 levels has been reported <xref rid="pone.0107561-Runchey1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The effect of obesity on other GIHs is unclear. In this study, we primarily aimed to compare the two meals rather than the two groups of subjects.</p><p>Finally, the 3-h study duration might be insufficient for complete absorption of the nutrients, and this limitation may have led to an underestimation of the measured parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, according to our hypothesis, our results suggest that a processed meat meal is accompanied by an impaired GIH response and increased oxidative stress marker levels in diabetic patients. Our results revealed comparable glycemic responses to isocaloric meals containing different carbohydrate contents, despite the distinct peak glucose concentrations. This finding illustrates that the diet composition and the energy content, rather than the carbohydrate count or the glycemic load, should be important considerations for the dietary management of diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0107561.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
