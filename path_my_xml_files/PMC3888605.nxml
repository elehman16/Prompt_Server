In part 2 (beginning after part 1 enrolment ended), newly enrolled patients received TCZ 4 or 8&#x02005;mg/kg or placebo for 24&#x02005;weeks. The same treatment arms were used in BUILDER-2, a phase III study in aTNF-inadequate responders. The primary endpoint for both studies was the proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement in the Assessments in Axial SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included ASAS40 response rates, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index improvement, changes in joint counts, enthesitis score and C reactive protein (CRP).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>102 patients were randomised in BUILDER-1 part 1; 99 (48 TCZ, 51 placebo) completed 12&#x02005;weeks.

CRP levels declined with TCZ treatment, suggesting adequate IL-6 receptor blockade. As a result, BUILDER-1 part 2 and BUILDER-2 were terminated. TCZ safety results were consistent with previous observations in rheumatoid arthritis, except for a cluster of anaphylactic and hypersensitivity events at Bulgarian study sites.

Patients who withdrew from the study before the week 12 ASAS20 assessment or for whom week 12 ASAS20 responses could not be determined for any reason were considered ASAS20 non-responders in the primary analysis. Analyses of endpoints and treatment comparisons were performed in a fixed sequential order to control the type 1 error rate for multiple comparisons. The order used was as follows: ASAS20, ASAS40, BASDAI50, ASAS5/6, ASDAS-CRP, ASDAS-ESR, ASAS partial remission, CRP and BASFI.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>After a protocol-specified review of the 12-week efficacy and safety data for BUILDER-1 part 1, the study sponsor chose to terminate the BUILDER-1 and BUILDER-2 studies. As a consequence, no meaningful statistical analysis of the efficacy data could be conducted for BUILDER-1 part 1 beyond 12&#x02005;weeks, BUILDER-1 part 2 or BUILDER-2. Thus, the efficacy results presented here focus on the placebo-controlled, 12-week phase of BUILDER-1 part 1; the statistical analysis is limited to the primary endpoint of ASAS20 response.

The results of BUILDER-1 part 1 (12&#x02005;weeks) indicated that TCZ was not effective (compared with placebo) in treating the signs and symptoms of AS in NSAID-inadequate responders who were aTNF-naive. This was true in spite of an observed suppression of CRP levels suggesting adequate IL-6R blockade. Although a numerically superior ASAS20 response was observed in the subgroup of patients with a CRP &#x02265;3&#x000d7; ULN (0.9&#x02005;mg/dl) at baseline who received TCZ, this is difficult to interpret in light of the lack of a parallel response in ASAS40 response rates. In view of the efficacy of TCZ in RA, an effect on peripheral arthritis might have been anticipated, but this was not observed.</p><p>The lack of efficacy in the current study was not attributable to any apparent issues with study design, statistical power or study conduct. As such, this negative result highlights that preclinical data may not accurately predict the efficacy of a targeted agent.

Based on the data observed in our studies and in another placebo-controlled trial, we conclude that despite a pharmacological effect (eg, a relevant decrease in CRP), IL-6 inhibition does not result in a clinically meaningful symptomatic effect on the axial symptoms of spondyloarthritis. Other studies would be required in order to evaluate the symptomatic effect of IL-6 inhibition on other clinical features of spondyloarthritis (eg, peripheral articular involvement, psoriasis, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web tables</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203559-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e702" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Our thanks go to all the patients who took part in the BUILDER studies and to all investigators and nursing staff at the participating centres.
