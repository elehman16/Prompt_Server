partial articular fractures of the radial head that have at least 2
millimeters of articular step-off on at least one radiograph (defined as
displaced), but less than 2 millimeter of gap between the fragments (defined
as stable) and that are not associated with an elbow dislocation,
interosseous ligament injury, or other fractures. These kinds of fractures
are often classified as Mason type-2 fractures. Retrospective comparative
studies suggest that operative treatment might be better than nonoperative
treatment, but the long-term results of nonoperative treatment are very
good. Most experts agree that problems like reduced range of motion, painful
crepitation, nonunion or bony ankylosis are infrequent with both
nonoperative and operative treatment of an isolated displaced partial
articular fracture of the radial head, but determining which patients will
have problems is difficult. A prospective, randomized comparison would help
minimize bias and determine the balance between operative and nonoperative
risks and benefits.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The RAMBO trial (Radial Head &#x02013; Amsterdam &#x02013; Amphia &#x02013; Boston
- Others) is an international prospective, randomized, multicenter trial.
The primary objective of this study is to compare patient related outcome
defined by the &#x02018;Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)
score&#x02019; twelve months after injury between operative and nonoperative
treated patients. Adult patients with partial articular fractures of the
radial head that comprise at least 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the articular
surface, have&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 millimeters of articular step-off but
less than 2 millimeter of gap between the fragments will be enrolled.
Secondary outcome measures will be the Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI),
the Oxford Elbow Score (OES), pain intensity through the &#x02018;Numeric
Rating Scale&#x02019;, range of motion (flexion arc and rotational arc),
radiographic appearance of the fracture (heterotopic ossification,
radiocapitellar and ulnohumeral arthrosis, fracture healing, and signs of
implant loosening or breakage) and adverse events (infection, nerve injury,
secondary interventions) after one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The successful completion of this trial will provide evidence on the best
treatment for stable, displaced, partial articular fractures of the radial
head.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial is registered at the Dutch Trial Register: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3413">NTR3413</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Radial head</kwd><kwd>Mason type 2</kwd><kwd>Operative</kwd><kwd>Nonoperative</kwd><kwd>Open reduction</kwd><kwd>Internal fixation</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In 1953, Mark Mason wrote his landmark paper on the classification of radial head
fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite several modifications, the classification is still limited with
regards to the description of stability of the fractured fragments. Fracture
stability is potentially important because unstable fractures are typically
associated with other injuries to the elbow or forearm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We therefore prefer describing the characteristics of the fracture we
are addressing; stable, displaced, partially articular fractures of the radial
head.</p><p>Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of fractures of the radial head became
popular after the advent of implants and techniques for the fixation of small
articular fracture fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Subsequently, enthusiasm grew with reports of good results on operative
treatment of isolated, displaced, partial articular fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Members of our study group described satisfactory long-term elbow function following
ORIF of these fractures, but with a high complication rate of 44% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A limitation of this study is the fact that many of the screws used were
of a larger diameter than those that would be used today.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis by Kaas et al. compared the results of operative and
nonoperative treatment of isolated, displaced, stable, partial articular fractures
of the radial head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nine retrospective case series describing 224 patients met their
inclusion criteria. Successful treatment was defined as an excellent or good result
according to various performance scores. Nonoperative treatment was successful in
114 of 142 patients (80%) pooled from the studies. Subsequent operative treatment
after failed nonoperative treatment was reported in three patients (2%). Open
reduction and internal fixation was successful in 76 of 82 patients (93%), with
subsequent surgery in four patients (5%). These differences were statistically
significant; however, the authors noted that the level of evidence of the included
studies was too low to support any firm conclusions.</p><p>There is currently no consensus as to the optimal treatment of patients with
isolated, displaced, stable, partial articular fractures of the radial head. This
multicenter prospective randomized trial compares DASH scores twelve months after
screw fixation vs. nonoperative treatment and will help to find the balance between
operative and nonoperative risks and benefits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The RAMBO trial is a prospective, international multicenter, randomized
controlled trial. Two academic and six teaching hospitals in the Netherlands as
well as a teaching hospital in the United States and a teaching hospital in
Canada will participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p>All adult patients with partial articular fractures of the radial head that
comprise&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1/3<sup>rd</sup> of articular surface,
have&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 millimeters of articular step-off but less than 2
millimeters of gap between the fragments presenting to either the emergency
department or the outpatient departments of the participating hospitals will be
invited to participate in the trial. The fractures are evaluated on standard
anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs with optional Greenspan view. An
additional Computed Tomography (CT)-scan with axial, coronal and sagittal
reconstructions will be made for post-hoc analysis.</p><p>The treating surgeon or a member of the study staff will introduce and explain
the trial to the patient and address any questions the patient might have. The
patient will receive a written information form and a consent form. After
receiving informed consent, eligible patients will be randomized. We will use a
block randomization strategy with random blocksize and stratify for
participating country and age of the patients. Age groups will be 18-49 and
&#x02265;50 years old. Applicants will be allocated to either operative or
nonoperative treatment using a web-based randomization program. This web-based
program is secure and only members of the study staff have login credentials. It
is not possible to blind surgeons and patients for the allocated treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Patients with the following inclusion criteria are eligible for enrollment:</p><p>&#x02013; &#x02265;18 years of age</p><p>&#x02013; Partial articular fractures of the radial head that comprise
at least 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the articular surface, have at least 2 millimeter
of articular step-off but less than 2 millimeter of gap between the
fragments</p><p>&#x02013; Diagnosis based on an anteroposterior and lateral radiograph
(with additional Greenspan view if necessary)</p><p>A CT-scan will be obtained after enrollment/randomization</p><p>&#x02013; Fracture amenable to screw fixation according to pre-operative
judgment of operating surgeon</p><p>&#x02013; Definitive treatment initiation &#x0003c;10 days after date of
injury.</p><p>If any of the following criteria apply, patients will be excluded:</p><p>&#x02013; Polytraumatized patients (ISS &#x0003e;15)</p><p>&#x02013; Other fractures or dislocations of the ipsilateral or the
contralateral upper extremity</p><p>&#x02013; Radial head fracture as part of an elbow dislocation or
associated fractures of the ipsilateral elbow or forearm</p><p>&#x02013; A nondisplaced or comminuted fracture (also know as Mason type
1 or 3)</p><p>&#x02013; Open fracture</p><p>&#x02013; Pathologic fracture</p><p>&#x02013; Previous ipsilateral olecranon/distal humerus/radial head
fracture</p><p>&#x02013; Pre-existent neurological disorders affecting the upper
extremity</p><p>Patient unable to follow treatment protocol</p><p>&#x02013; Unfit for general anaesthesia and/or operative management.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients that are assigned to nonoperative management will receive a sling for
comfort and are instructed to start active and active-assisted range of motion
exercises after a resting period of 48 hours. Patients that are assigned to ORIF
will be treated by screw fixation of the radial head. The approach as well as
the number and type of screws used is subject to the preference of the treating
surgeon and will be recorded in our study log.</p><p>Patients in both cohorts will be given a leaflet containing instructions for
exercises to regain motion. Patients that prefer to do their exercises with
coaching and supervision can work with an occupational or physical therapist or
see their surgeon more frequently.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure is the DASH outcome measure; a validated,
self-reported questionnaire designed to help describe the disability experienced
by people with upper-limb disorders and also to monitor changes in symptoms and
function over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].The DASH outcome measure is scored in two components: the
disability/symptom section (30 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high
performance Sport/Music or Work section (4 items, scored 1-5). The DASH gives a
score out of 100, in which a higher score indicates greater disability. The DASH
outcome score is validated in both the English and Dutch language.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures consist of;</p><p>&#x02013; The Oxford Elbow Score (OES), which reflects both function and
pain following elbow surgery. The OES consists of three domains; pain, function
and social-psychological. Each domain comprises of 4 questions with 5 response
options per question. Each response is scored 0 to 4, with 0 representing
greater severity. Scores for each domain are calculated as the sum of each
individual item score within that domain. These scores are then converted to a
metric score between 0 and 100 (a lower score represents greater severity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>&#x02013; The Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI), which is based on 4
domains (pain, range of motion, stability and elbow function). A total score
between 95 and the maximum 100 points is considered excellent; 80&#x02013;95 is
good; 60&#x02013;80 is fair and less than 60 points is poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>&#x02013; Elbow pain; Pain level will be determined using the Numeric
Rating Scale, an 11&#x02013;point scale for patient self-reporting of pain</p><p>&#x02013; Active and passive ROM (flexion, extension, pronation,
supination) of both elbow joints will be measured on both sides using a
universal goniometer.</p><p>&#x02013; Crepitance or block to motion will be assessed with elbow and
forearm motion at admission and every follow up visit</p><p>&#x02013; Number of complications (infection, neurovascular compromise,
subsequent or secondary intervention, arthrosis)</p><p>&#x02013; Determining the need for and number of secondary
interventions</p><p>&#x02013; Radiographic appearance of the elbow joint will be evaluated
on the anteroposterior and lateral radiographs at one year. Heterotopic
ossification will be classified as a bone exostosis or as soft tissue
ossification of a ligament, capsule or muscle (&#x0201c;myositis
ossificans&#x0201d;) according the classification scheme of Broberg and Morrey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; degenerative changes of the radiocapitellar and ulnohumeral joints
will be classified as grade zero (no change), grade 1 (slight narrowing of the
joint space with small osteophytes), grade 2 (moderate narrowing of the joint
space, osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis), or grade 3 (severe narrowing of
the joint space, large osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and cystic
deformation). The final radiographs will also be evaluated for fracture healing
and signs of hardware failure or other complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>Clinical assessment will be performed at admission (baseline), three, six months
and one year after treatment initiation. At each follow-up visit the surgeon
will perform a physical examination of both elbows and complete the MEPI and NRS
scores. Simultaneously, the patient will be sent a link to the online,
patient-specific DASH and OES questionnaires: this will be monitored by the
study coordinator. At the two weeks and twelve months follow-up visit an
anteroposterior and lateral radiograph of the elbow will be made. At the last
follow-up visit, an independent and blinded researcher will record any
interventions, complications and physical therapist visits.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The primary outcome variable will be the DASH, which has a minimal clinically
important difference of 17 for the elbow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Consequently, a 2-sided unpaired T-test with an alpha-level of 0.05,
a beta-level of 0.1, and an allocation ratio of 1, requires 31 patients in each
group to detect an effect size of 0.85. Anticipating a dropout rate of 25%, a
sample size of 39 patients in each arm is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Normality of continuous data will be tested with the Shapiro-Wilk and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as well as by inspecting the frequency distributions
(histograms). Homogeneity of variances will be tested using the Levene&#x02019;s
test. The analysis will be performed on an intention to treat basis. Patients
with protocol violations will remain in follow-up, and data will be recorded.
Data will be analyzed with and without inclusion of patients with a protocol
violation. Descriptive analysis will be performed to report baseline
characteristics in both treatment groups. For continuous data (e.g. age), means
and standard deviations (parametric data) or medians and percentiles
(nonparametric data) will be calculated. For categorical data (e.g. gender)
frequencies will be calculated.</p><p>Patients will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat protocol. The
primary outcome, DASH at one year will be corrected for age and assessed using
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Trends in DASH scores among the different
time points will be assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA if the data is
normally distributed. The secondary outcomes; MEPI, OES, pain as indicated on a
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Range of Motion (ROM) will be analyzed in a
similar manner. The radiological outcome, number of conversions and complication
rate will be determined using either a Fisher Exact or a Chi square test,
depending on the order of magnitude of the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Considering current evidence, no clear preference exists for either one of the
treatment allocations in this study. Both treatment modalities are regularly
applied for these fractures in each of the participating institutions. All
surgeons participating in this study are familiar with nonoperative and
operative management of patients with radial head fractures. Except for the
assignment of treatment, management will not differ from patients with similar
conditions that are not enrolled in the study. Patients will be exposed to
radiation from radiographs. However, this exposure is part of routine clinical
care and represents no increased risk. No additional radiographs will be made as
part of this study. The risks and discomfort of participating in this study do
not exceed those of expected of standard treatment for this condition. Patients
may be inconvenienced by the questionnaires, but we consider this a minor
inconvenience, as they will take approximately 10 minutes to complete and can be
filled in online.</p><p>There is no incentive for patients to participate in this trial. The motivation
for the study is a potential benefit to all patients with radial head fractures,
as we increase our knowledge on optimal treatment of these fractures.</p></sec><sec><title>Monitoring and quality assurance</title><p>This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the principal
investigators hospital under the number: NL38903.008.11. Approval of local
Medical Ethical Committees will be obtained in all participating hospitals
separately. At the time of press, local approval was already obtained for 5 out
of 9 participating hospitals. All signed informed consent forms will be filed in
locked cabinets in research offices. Any personal information collected during
this study will be placed in a research folder, and not added to the
patient&#x02019;s medical record unless expressly requested by the patient.
Functional results (range of motion, complications) and questionnaires will be
collected digitally and stored on a password-protected, secured server to which
only study staff will have access. Apart from date of birth of included
patients, no personal data will be stored digitally.</p><p>A member of the study staff will be responsible for monitoring outcomes. No
independent monitoring will occur. All investigators and study staff will be
responsible for reporting adverse effects to the coordinating investigator. Our
coordinating investigator will report adverse events to the ethical committee in

treatment and ORIF for stable, displaced, partial articular fractures of the radial
head. The RAMBO trial will compare management of these fractures of the radial head
by nonoperative treatment and ORIF. ORIF may lead to a better ROM, but may also
carry a higher risk of complications. Patient enrollment has started in November
2012 and we expect to enroll 4 patients per month. Considering the one-year
follow-up, publication of data will be expected in 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AO: Arbeitsgemeinschaft f&#x000fc;r Osteosynthesefragen (German for &#x0201c;Association
