<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> sporting clubs and sport venues have failed to implement evidence-based alcohol management practices comprehensively and consistently.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition, limited rigorous scientific evidence exists to support the effectiveness of such initiatives. For example, recently published systematic reviews of sport and alcohol-focused controlled trials failed to identify any interventions that sought to modify the alcohol management practices of sport clubs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> Nonetheless, a small number of non-controlled trials in this setting have reported promising results. A single group prepost evaluation of an intervention to introduce light-and mid-strength beer and targeted alcohol bans in an amateur football competition reported reductions in alcohol sales and alcohol-related antisocial behaviour,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> while a cross-sectional study, involving a range of Australian sporting clubs, reported a significant inverse association between the prevalence of risky alcohol consumption and the implementation of a multistrategic alcohol management programme.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> There is also evidence to suggest such alcohol management strategies are acceptable to the sporting club's management.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Prohibiting free or cheap alcohol promotions,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

In addition, reviews of interventions in other premises licensed to sell alcohol, such as clubs, pubs, bars and nightclubs, suggest that alcohol management strategies are effective in reducing risky alcohol consumption and subsequent alcohol-related harm.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

The intervention resulted in an absolute reduction of 8% in risky alcohol consumption among members of sporting clubs in the intervention group, and a 37% differential reduction in the odds of risky drinking relative to the control group. A 16% absolute reduction in alcohol-related harm was also observed among members of intervention group clubs; a 42% differential reduction in the odds of such harm relative to the control group. Greater effect sizes were found for clubs in regional/rural areas compared to metropolitan areas, for soccer/association football clubs compared to other football codes, and for clubs that completed the full intervention according to protocol. Significant reductions in risk of alcohol dependence were also found. Given high participation rates in non-elite sports in high-income, low-income and middle-income countries<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> and the prevalence of alcohol misuse by sports people,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> the intervention has the potential to contribute to reducing the risk of alcohol-related harm among the large numbers of sports&#x02019; players, fans and officials. Such a finding offers substantial advance evidence regarding the management of alcohol in public drinking venues and provides a non-enforcement policy option for governments seeking to reduce levels of alcohol-related harm in the community.</p><p>The positive study findings are consistent with those of previous non-controlled and cross-sectional studies of similar interventions in sports settings.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> As the intervention in this study did not involve an enforcement element, to our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled trial to demonstrate the effectiveness an alcohol management intervention without enforcement. It is possible that the accreditation-based nature of the intervention acted to motivate a change in such practices, substituting the need for formal enforcement.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> While accreditation-based programmes for licensed premises have been operating for some time, such as Best Bar None in the UK,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> no controlled trials of such initiatives have been reported.</p><p>The observed reductions in overall risk of alcohol-related harm among club members (AUDIT measure) may indicate that a large proportion of risky alcohol consumption undertaken by members occurs within the club setting. If this is the case, then a reduction in drinking at the club, even without a reduction in drinking in other locations outside of the club, may reduce consumption and overall risk from drinking. Alternatively, the intervention may have independently influenced a change in members&#x02019; alcohol use norms and behaviours outside of the sporting club setting. A further possible explanation is that the intervention may have persuaded members who were at-risk drinkers to leave the club or may have discouraged at-risk drinkers from joining the club. However, such displacement is considered less likely in sporting clubs than other licensed premises given that the primary and initial purpose of sports club attendance is to play or watch sport.</p><p>The results of the study should be considered in the context of its methodology. The internal validity of the study was strengthened by random assignment of clubs, blinding of data collection staff and analysis personnel and use of validated alcohol consumption outcome measures. The consent rate of 36% has the potential to limit the external validity of the findings; however, the likelihood of this is mitigated by the absence of differences between consenting and non-consenting clubs in terms of football code or location, and the consistently positive intervention effects across subgroups according to club type and location. A previous non-controlled study of the intervention with sports, including cricket, was also suggestive of a positive effect.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, over 6500 sport clubs across Australia have adopted the <italic>Good Sports</italic> programme,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> suggesting that a significant number of clubs are willing to adopt alcohol management practice interventions. While the results of the sensitivity analysis, which adopted a conservative imputation approach, also trended toward a positive intervention effect for risky drinking, this finding was not statistically significant (p=0.1) and further studies are required to confirm these findings.</p><p>It would be of benefit for further research to assess the impact of the intervention on club revenue and membership given these are priority outcomes for community sporting clubs; so would be the collection of data on additional measures of alcohol-related harm such as drink driving and violence. Investigation into the mediators of intervention effectiveness may also help identify the elements of the intervention that had the most influence on changing drinking behaviours and this will assist in streamlining the intervention for future adoption by sports clubs.
