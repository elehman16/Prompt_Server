Behavioural economic theory suggests that the lack of adherence results from the disconnect between the timing of when costs and benefits accrue. One strategy to address this discontinuity is to offer patients a near-term benefit, such as a financial reward. Whereas there is evidence that rewards can improve treatment adherence and sometimes health outcomes, further research is needed to determine whether rewards are more effective when targeting processes or intermediary health outcomes. In the Trial to Incentivise Adherence for Diabetes (TRIAD) we test whether adding financial incentives to usual care can improve HbA1c levels among people with diabetes and whether the financial incentives work better when targeting processes (adherence to blood glucose testing, medication, and daily physical activity) or the primary intermediary health outcome of self-monitored blood glucose within an acceptable range.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">TRIAD is a randomised, controlled, open-label, single-centre superiority trial with three parallel arms. A total of 240 patients with suboptimally controlled diabetes (HbA1c&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;8%) from a polyclinic in Singapore are block-randomised (blocking factor: current vs. new glucometer users) into three arms, namely (1) usual care (UC) only, (2) UC with process incentive and (3) UC with outcome incentive, in a 2:3:3 ratio. Masking the arm allocation will be precluded by the behavioural nature of the intervention but blocking size will not be disclosed to protect concealment. The primary outcome (change in HbA1c level at month 6) will be measured by a laboratory that is independent from the study team. Secondary outcomes (at month 6) include the number of blood glucose testing days, glucose readings within the normal range (between 4 to 7&#x000a0;mmol/L), medication-adherent days, physically active days, and average incentives earned and time spent administrating the incentives.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study will provide evidence on whether financial incentives can cost-effectively improve glycaemic control. It will also provide evidence on the benefit incidence of interventions involving financial incentives.

Diabetes is associated with a host of adverse complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and severe neuropathy that may result in amputations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The global direct healthcare cost of diabetes and its complications was estimated to exceed USD827 billion in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Singapore, diabetes is the cause of 10.4% of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost, which represents the fourth most important disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Diabetes management primarily consists of promoting glycaemic control via diet, physical activity; and, if necessary, medication. Medication generally includes oral hypoglycaemic agents, which may be followed by injectable insulin when blood glucose remains suboptimally controlled. In 2012, higher-than-optimal blood glucose was responsible for 2.2 million of the 3.7 million deaths caused by diabetes worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2010 in Singapore, about a third (32%) of known people with diabetes had suboptimal glycaemic control as defined by a concentration of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 8.0% or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">While treatment effectiveness crucially depends on the quality of care provided by health professionals (e.g. efficacious medications, clear and appropriate advice, relevant health education and support), patient engagement is especially important to chronic disease management as most of the treatment takes place outside the healthcare system. In 2003, the World Health Organisation reported that, worldwide, only 50% of patients suffering from chronic diseases were adherent to their treatment. Regarding diabetes, all aspects of treatment (glucose monitoring, administration of medication, diet and physical activity) were affected by non-adherence. As a result, much research was conducted in efforts to improve diabetes management. Meta-evidence on the average reduction in HbA1c levels achieved by various types of interventions shows that education on diabetes self-management reduces HbA1c levels by 0.57 percentage points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], self-monitoring of glucose levels reduces these levels by 0.25 percentage points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], behavioural interventions targeting physical activity reduces HbA1c levels by 0.32 percentage points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and computer-based interventions to improve diabetes self-management reduces HbA1c levels by 0.20 percentage points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In their review of quality improvement strategies on the management of diabetes, Tricco and colleagues found an average reduction in HbA1c levels of 0.37 percentage points and note that strategies targeting patients were on average more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. While all were statistically significant, the above meta-estimates reveal modest-to-moderate effect sizes. Improvement in glycaemic control in the population remains extremely slow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and more generally, the rise in number of people with multiple comorbidities makes treatment adherence even more difficult to achieve overall.</p><p id="Par20">Behavioural economic theory may provide an explanation for the lack of adherence to treatment recommendations: the benefits of greater efforts of adherence only arise well into the future whereas the costs are immediate. When costs and benefits are so far apart, individuals have been shown to be biased towards the present, which results in decisions that are time-inconsistent and that generate significant regret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One strategy that addresses such present bias is to provide patients with near-term benefits. This can be achieved by providing patients with financial incentives that are contingent on treatment adherence. Recent research on financial incentives uses behavioural economics in efforts to generate the largest behavioural change. For instance, studies are leveraging patients&#x02019; loss aversion with deposit contract incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and adherence contingent rebates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and patients&#x02019; probabilistic assessment bias with lottery incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Evidence on the effectiveness of financial incentives for diabetes management is scarce. Long and colleagues found a reduction in HbA1c level of 0.45 percentage points among African American Veterans with diabetes by tying rewards to HbA1c reductions but this effect was not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Sen and colleagues found that a lottery incentive tied to glucose monitoring improved monitoring rates by 19 to 23 percentage points among uncontrolled people with diabetes in a US primary-care medical home practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The first primary objective of this trial is to determine whether adding financial incentives to usual care (UC) can improve HbA1c levels among people with suboptimally controlled type-2 diabetes in the primary-care setting. The second primary objective is to determine whether financial incentives should be directed at processes (adherence to blood glucose testing, medication, and daily physical activity) or at achieving intermediary health outcomes (self-monitored blood glucose within acceptable range). This trial will provide novel head-to-head evidence on which strategy works best. In addition, the trial will assess the effect of financial incentives on treatment adherence and whether such incentives constitute cost-effective intervention strategies for diabetes management. Finally, explanatory analysis will aim at determining whether patient perception about diabetes management is altered by the interventions, uncovering factors that might moderate the effect of financial incentives, and identifying socioeconomic groups that may benefit more from the interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary objective 1</title><p id="Par23">To determine whether complementing UC with financial incentives for good treatment adherence is superior to UC alone in reducing HbA1c at 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary objective 2</title><p id="Par24">To determine whether incentivising intermediate health outcomes (self-monitored blood glucose levels within acceptable range) is superior to incentivising intermediate processes (blood glucose testing, physical activity, and medication adherence) in reducing HbA1c at 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary objective 1</title><p id="Par25">To assess whether complementing UC with financial incentives for good treatment adherence is superior to UC alone in improving treatment adherence as measured by the proportion of glucose tests and medications taken as prescribed and average number of daily steps taken between baseline and 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary objective 2</title><p id="Par26">To assess whether incentivising health outcomes is superior to incentivising intermediate processes in improving treatment adherence as measured by the proportion of glucose tests and medications taken as prescribed and average number of daily steps between taken baseline and 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Secondary objective 3</title><p id="Par27">To assess which intervention (i.e. incentivising health outcomes or processes) has the most favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for HbA1c reductions between baseline and 6&#x000a0;months compared to UC alone.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par28">The Trial to Incentivise Adherence for Diabetes (TRIAD) is designed as a randomised, controlled, single-centre superiority trial with three parallel arms.

To assess this, we have used data from a pilot intervention aimed at improving diabetes outcomes through a comprehensive educational and management programme (that did not include financial incentives). Among 54 participants with suboptimally controlled diabetes, we found that the standard deviation in participant HbA1c levels was 1.29 at baseline and 1.99 after a 3-month intervention.

After applying a Bonferroni correction by dividing the test&#x02019;s significance level by 2 (which is the number of primary hypotheses to test in this trial), we found that 76 participants per intervention arm are necessary to detect mean differences in HbA1c levels of 1% between these study arms (with significance level of 5/2&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.5% and 80% power). Given the resulting cumulated sample size for the intervention arms of 76&#x02009;+&#x02009;76&#x02009;=&#x02009;152, we then computed the size required for the UC arm to test the overall effect of financial incentives (primary objective 1) with the same effect size, significance level, and power. This computation yielded a sample size of 51 for the UC arm. After accounting for approximately 20% attrition in each study arm, we set the final sample size at 60 for the UC arm and 90 for each intervention arm, for a grand total of 240 participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par82">Prior to the start of recruitment, randomisation numbers will be generated by the principal investigator of the study and the project coordinator using Stata 13.2 to create an assignment schedule for block-randomisation to allocate eligible participants into one of the three study arms in a ratio of 2:3:3.

The procedure for blood tests will follow the usual polyclinic process. One of the physicians at the polyclinic will order the blood test and give a printed form to the patient. The patient will arrange and attend an appointment at the polyclinic laboratory. The laboratory technician will obtain a capillary specimen from the patient and will perform the HbA1c test on-site via the Siemens DCA Vantage&#x000ae; Analyzer using immunoassay. The costs of these tests will be covered by the study.</p><p id="Par87">The data from the glucometers will be collected at months 3 and 6 during the clinic visits. As glucose testing is part of UC, all patients receive support for adequate usage of their glucometer. For most glucometers in use at the polyclinic (this includes the Accu-Chek Performa&#x02122;, the Accu-Chek Active&#x02122; and the Nipro TRUEresult&#x02122;) the device will be scanned using the appropriate docking station and the data will be downloaded to the relevant glucometer software. From the software, the data will be exported to an Excel file where the CRC will check the validity of the data. The Excel file will then be imported to the trial application where treatment adherence and the corresponding incentives will be calculated. For the less common glucometers, the data stored on the device will be manually entered by the CRC onto an Excel file which will then be imported into the trial application.</p><p id="Par88">The data from the medication trackers will also be collected at months 3 and 6. The CRC will scan each medication tracker using the CertiScan&#x02122; desktop reader and the data will be downloaded to the Med-ic&#x02122; software. From the software the data will be exported to an excel file where the CRC will check the validity of the data. The Excel file will then be uploaded to the trial application where medication adherence and the corresponding financial incentives will be calculated.</p><p id="Par89">Each pedometer will be linked to an anonymous online Fitbit&#x02122; account that will be created for the study. The trial application will automatically synchronise with the Fitbit&#x02122; accounts and automatically update physical activity data for adherence and incentives calculations. This data will be checked regularly by the project coordinator to verify that the participants are synchronising their pedometer with their Fitbit&#x02122; account and that this data gets transmitted to the trial application. This is important because the pedometers can store up to 30&#x000a0;days of data. Participants who do not synchronise for 21&#x000a0;days will receive an automatic text message to remind them to synchronise. Participants who do not have access to a smartphone or personal computer will need to come to the polyclinic once a month where the CRC will synchronise their pedometers for them.</p><p id="Par90">Paper-based survey questionnaires will be administered at baseline and month 6 by the CRC. Both questionnaires include the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels,(EQ-5D-5L), BIPQ and BMQ survey instruments. The baseline survey also includes patient socioeconomic characteristics while the month-6 questionnaire contains questions on compliance with the medication tracker and medication-purchasing habits during the intervention period.</p><p id="Par91">In addition, the CRC will complete participant checklists at baseline, months 3, 6 and 18. The Baseline checklist will include the participant&#x02019;s current HbA1c reading and the date of the blood test. This information will be obtained from the SingHealth computerised patient database at Geylang Polyclinic. The randomisation code and study arm, the participants&#x02019; diabetes medication regimen, and whether the participants are new or current glucometer users will also be recorded on the checklist. The CRC will also confirm the participants have understood which study arm they have been randomised to, record the response on the checklist and explain again if necessary.</p><p id="Par92">At months 3 and 6, the CRC will again check that the participant understands the goals and rewards of the study arm they have been randomised to, record the response on the corresponding checklist and re-explain if necessary. Details on fasting which could affect medication dosages and times; overseas trips which involve time zone changes that will possibly impact the study devices; and hospitalisations will also be recorded at months 3 and 6. Further, the participants&#x02019; adherence and payments made will be recorded along with the time spent by the CRC on adherence calculation and corresponding incentive payments. Last, the CRC will record any changes to the participants&#x02019; diabetes medication regimen based on their medical records.</p><p id="Par93">At month 18, the CRC will complete a checklist solely from the patient&#x02019;s medical records.

Such transfers will be acknowledged and documented in a log file maintained by the study team. To ensure confidentiality, only de-identified research data will be passed to Duke-NUS. Study team members at Duke-NUS will digitise the responses from the paper-based questionnaires and checklists into a data entry Excel file. Data will be double-entered for accuracy by two separate members of the Duke-NUS team. To further minimise errors, the data entry sheets have been designed to only accept values that are within the correct range.</p><p id="Par95">Once the first 80 participants have successfully completed the month-6 assessments, the following outcomes will be assessed by a trained statistician: HbA1c levels and adherence across physical activity, medication and blood glucose testing rates and levels. These will be repeated when 160 participants complete the month-6 assessment. Further, attrition and missing data patterns will be analysed. The purpose of these interim analyses is to detect potential issues that might have arisen during the data collection process before the end of the trial and to report preliminary results to SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB) on an annual basis. No stopping rules have been defined for this trial.</p><p id="Par96">The CRC will ask participants about potential adverse events. If a patient has been hospitalised during the intervention, the CRC will record the details. Reporting of adverse events involves notifying the SingHealth CIRB and submitting the Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Reporting Form within the stipulated timeframe.

The perspective of the cost-effectiveness analysis will be that of the health system. Effectiveness will be measured by the primary outcome and costs will include the average financial incentives paid, labour costs associated to the administration of the incentives, and the cost of devices.

Those investigators and collaborators who do not meet all four criteria will be acknowledged for their contribution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par105">The primary objectives of this randomised controlled trial are to determine whether adding financial incentives to UC can improve HbA1c levels among people with suboptimally controlled diabetes in a primary-care setting; and to determine whether financial incentives should be directed at processes or at achieving intermediary health outcomes. In order to meet these objectives it will be crucial that participants fully understand the goals and rewards of their study arm. First, participants must not confuse the non-contingent incentives received to compensate for their time taking part in the trial with the process and outcome incentives that participants in the intervention arms can receive if they meet their goals. Second, it is important to make sure that participants understand the calculation of the incentive amount that they can expect to receive based on their diabetes self-management efforts. Great care will be taken by the CRC to explain the incentive scheme during the baseline visit. In addition, the CRC will check whether the participants remember the incentive calculation at the month-3 and month-6 visits, will re-explain the calculations if necessary, and will record whether the calculations were understood in order to assess the quality of the study. The Participant Leaflets also contain a detailed section on incentive goals and calculation for the study arm the participants have been randomly assigned to.</p><p id="Par106">The possibility of gaming has also been considered. In order to earn incentives without improving their diabetes management, some participants might, for instance, ask a third person to use their device, shake their pedometer to gain extra steps, and open and close their tracking device without taking their medication. In efforts to contain gaming, participants will be asked to sign a participation oath which has been shown to decrease the likelihood of cheating in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and has been applied to financial incentives studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, several quality checks will be performed. Participants will be asked to keep all their medication bills and bring them to the clinic visits. In order to assess the validity of pedometer data, the distribution of steps within days will be examined to detect implausible patterns. Glucometer readings data will be compared to HbA1c levels in efforts to detect implausible discrepancies. It is worth noting that, if present, gaming would not affect the primary analysis as it is based on HbA1c tests.</p><p id="Par107">We will first compare our primary results to the only other incentive study that reports HbA1c levels as a primary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We will then compare our results to those found in other types of diabetes management interventions such as education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], blood glucose self-monitoring alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], free-living physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], computer-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and quality improvement strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This study will provide evidence on whether financial incentives can cost-effectively improve diabetes management. It will also be important to determine who benefits the most from the intervention. By interacting socioeconomic characteristics with the intervention effect, this study will provide evidence on the benefit incidence of interventions involving financial incentives. Last, by comparing process to outcome incentives, this study will inform the design of future incentive strategies in chronic disease management and beyond.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par108">Recruitment to the TRIAD study began in February 2015 and is ongoing.
