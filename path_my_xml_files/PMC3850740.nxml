Myocardial fibrosis is one of the key mechanisms and aldosterone is a key mediator of myocardial fibrosis. We propose that aldosterone antagonism will improve cardiac function. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of selective aldosterone receptor antagonism with eplerenone added to optimal medical treatment in improving cardiac structure and function in diabetic cardiomyopathy. We will randomize 130 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, stable metabolic control and impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic or diastolic function, to either eplerenone (target dose 50mg) or matching placebo, in addition to optimal medical therapy for 12 months. The primary endpoints are changes in LV systolic and diastolic function, measured by echocardiographic 2-dimensional speckle tracking strain and strain rate and tissue Doppler imaging. The secondary endpoints include changes in echocardiographic markers and plasma biomarkers of collagen turnover; left atrial dimensions and function, incidence of atrial fibrillation and changes in exercise capacity and dyspnea score. The present study will assess whether specific aldosterone antagonism with eplerenone in addition to standard therapy will prevent progression or reverse cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy using sensitive, robust and quantifiable echocardiographic measures that allow early detection of change. The study may offer a new direction in the management of this condition.</p><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12610001063000">ACTRN12610001063000</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Diabetes</kwd><kwd>Heart failure</kwd><kwd>Left ventricular function</kwd><kwd>Echocardiography</kwd><kwd>Collagen</kwd><kwd>Aldosterone antagonism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing towards epidemic levels in both developing and industrialized countries. Patients with T2DM are at increased risk of heart failure from diabetic cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], with the spectrum of disease ranging, in early stages, from diastolic dysfunction to overt systolic dysfunction during later stages. The pathogenesis of ventricular dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy is multifactorial, and independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease (CAD) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, which occurs in the early stages of diabetic cardiomyopathy, experience prognosis and functional decline similar to patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Evidence based management guidelines are limited for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Treatment is mainly directed towards symptomatic relief with loop diuretics and treatment of associated conditions such as hypertension. Definitive treatment to halt disease progression, improve prognosis and reverse the underlying pathophysiology is still lacking.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed scheme of development and progression of cardiac dysfunction as a result of the metabolic abnormalities seen in diabetes.</bold> Legend: RAAS&#x02009;=&#x02009;renin&#x02013;angiotensin II&#x02013;aldosterone system, PPARs&#x02009;=&#x02009;peroxisome proliferator activator receptors, ER&#x02009;=&#x02009;endoplasmic reticulum, ATP&#x02009;=&#x02009;adenosine triphosphate.

Cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an active role in modulating cardiac function and undergoes extensive and continuous turnover, an important step in an injury-reparative process. Myocardial fibrosis involving predominantly types I and III collagen, the most abundant type in the heart, has been documented in biopsy studies of diabetic patients without hypertension or CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the synthesis of type III collagen has been found to proportionally increase with hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Overactivation of the renin angiotensin-II aldosterone system (RAAS) occurs in diabetic cardiomyopathy resulting in cardiac insulin resistance and a cascade of abnormalities mediated by angiotensin II and aldosterone (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Aldosterone plays an important role in promoting fibrosis by stimulating fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, triggering proinflammatory factors leading to activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and increasing transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Aldosterone antagonism has been shown to improve symptoms and outcomes in advanced systolic heart failure and after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Attenuation of the excessive ECM turnover by aldosterone antagonism was suggested as one of the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects in systolic heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The beneficial effects of aldosterone antagonism on myocardial fibrosis may help to explain the impressive improvement in patient outcomes in systolic heart failure and after AMI despite only modest improvement in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone administered to patients with mildly symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy improved LV diastolic function and led to regression in myocardial fibrosis on biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similar improvements in LV function and measures of fibrosis have been documented in patients with hypertensive cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the efficacy and safety of aldosterone antagonism has not been previously evaluated in early stage diabetic cardiomyopathy (ranging from isolated diastolic dysfunction to systolic dysfunction with NYHA functional class I-II symptoms) where aldosterone antagonists are currently not indicated.</p><p>There is paucity of data on the specific use of aldosterone antagonists in T2DM and this is a particular group who are prone to hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As a consequence, there are concerns regarding hyperkalemia with the use of aldosterone antagonists, particularly in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Evaluation of this particular problem in clinical trials has been limited to subgroup analyses. The present study will provide safety information on the use of such drugs in patients with T2DM.</p><p>Circulating biomarkers of collagen synthesis and degradation provide a means of monitoring ECM turnover and the balance between collagen synthesis and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Levels of the, procollagen type III N-terminal propeptide (PIIINP) and procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide (PICP) have been shown to have prognostic value in systolic heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], with aldosterone antagonism decreasing levels of these biomarkers. Moreover, clinical benefits were most predominant in those who had elevated biomarker levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Cardiac imaging modalities such as echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be used to quantify myocardial interstitial fibrosis. Histologically quantified collagen accumulation has been shown to be linearly related to the magnitude of ultrasound backscatter, a marker of myocardial reflectivity, in experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] as well as in clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The magnitude of integrated backscatter has been shown to correlate with serum concentrations of PICP and PIIINP in patients with hypertensive heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Diabetic patients without hypertension, CAD, or overt heart failure demonstrate evidence of systolic dysfunction and abnormal calibrated integrated backscatter (IB). These changes are not only similar to those caused by LV hypertrophy, but are also independent and incremental to the effects of ventricular hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The potential for assessing retardation or regression of this fibrosis using ultrasound or biomarker surrogates in patients with subclinical diabetic cardiomyopathy has not been investigated. Furthermore, in contrast to the use of ejection fraction for assessing serial change in cardiac function, echocardiographic strain and strain rate imaging provides a robust, sensitive, reproducible and quantifiable measure of changes in cardiac function that precede changes in ejection fraction. Documentation of strain and strain rate measures have the potential to allow earlier detection of abnormalities as well as changes in cardiac function to effect earlier intervention strategies before the development of advanced heart disease.</p><p>The aim of the current study is to investigate whether treatment with eplerenone, a specific aldosterone antagonist, for 12 months, in addition to ACEI or ARB, would improve myocardial structural and functional abnormalities in patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy without advanced heart failure or severe LV systolic dysfunction.</p><sec><title>Research design and methods</title><p>This study was designed as a prospective, investigator-initiated, multi-centre, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the impact of treatment with eplerenone for 12 months on myocardial structure and function in patients with T2DM and LV diastolic or systolic dysfunction, in the absence of class III-IV symptoms with severe LV systolic dysfunction.

A power of at least 80% was also obtained for peak longitudinal systolic strain and strain rate, and early diastolic strain rate using similar calculations.</p><p>Since commencement of this study, Kosmala and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] examined the effects of spironolactone versus placebo on cardiac function in patients with metabolic syndrome and found improvements in longitudinal strain and strain rate over a 6-month period, but no significant difference in &#x00394;IB. Sample size recalculation has shown that the intended sample size of 130 patients in the present study provides adequate power to detect a difference over the 12 month time period in LV strain and strain rate.</p><p>These sample size calculations are based on a two-sample t-test and are therefore conservative. As analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for the baseline measurement will be the method of analysis, the power will be higher or the minimal detectable effect smaller for the same power target. The gain in efficiency is linked to the correlation (r) between the baseline and on-treatment measurements which is currently unknown for the endpoints involved, but expected to be high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Trial oversight</title><p>A data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) comprising of personnel with sufficient cardiological, endocrinological and statistical experience will be formed to review the interim results and oversee the conduct of the trial. The DSMB and ethics committee will review all unblinded data on clinical endpoint events and determine whether events meet pre-specified criteria. The DSMB will monitor safety and efficacy of the trial and periodically assess whether the trial should continue.</p></sec><sec><title>Interim analysis</title><p>Interim analyses for safety and efficacy are incorporated into this trial. The Haybittle-Peto rule with two interim efficacy analyses detailed in a statistical analysis plan are planned after approximately 30% and 60% of the patients have been followed up at 12 months. Early termination for the study will be recommended for evidence of overwhelming benefit (2-sided p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.003 favouring eplerenone) or substantive harm (2-sided p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 against eplerenone).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The intention-to-treat principle will be applied to the analysis. Baseline and demographic characteristics will also be summarized by treatment group. All changes from baseline, including the primary and secondary end-points will be analysed by means of ANCOVA, adjusted for the baseline measurement.</p><p>Descriptive statistics will be provided for safety data. The number of patients reporting any SAE, the occurrence of specific SAEs and discontinuation due to SAEs will be tabulated. The effect of treatment on the number of patients experiencing at least one SAE will be tested using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test if the number of events is small. All hypotheses are two-sided. A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 is considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are features of this trial design that deserve particular emphasis:</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;Patients of all symptomatology and degrees of myocardial abnormalities ranging from grade 1&#x02013;3 diastolic dysfunction to mild to moderate systolic dysfunction are enrolled. Including patients with more severe grades of baseline diastolic or systolic dysfunction may allow greater improvement on eplerenone. Furthermore, patients with milder degrees of systolic/diastolic dysfunction randomized to placebo may experience disease progression during the course of the study.</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;Blood pressure independent effects of eplerenone will be examined by recruiting those with stable blood pressure control at baseline, and blood pressure will be continually monitored to ensure stability throughout the study. Furthermore, the dose of eplerenone will not exceed 50mg daily, minimizing the antihypertensive effects.</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;The impact of aldosterone antagonism on myocardial fibrosis will be measured both by cardiac imaging and serum levels of biomarkers. Furthermore, attempts will be made to correlate the changes in myocardial function with changes in the degree of myocardial fibrosis both on imaging as well as changes in biomarker levels.</p><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;In comparison to previous studies examining biomarkers of fibrosis, it is assumed that the beneficial effects of aldosterone antagonism come from more effective suppression of aldosterone, yet few have definitively shown that this beneficial effect is present despite a persistently elevated renin and aldosterone level after treatment. We will measure both renin and aldosterone level before and after treatment in our study.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>Diabetic cardiomyopathy is an increasingly prevalent disorder for which there is currently no specific therapeutic intervention. This trial, when successfully completed, will advance our understanding of diabetic cardiomyopathy and the underlying mechanisms. This may provide a new direction in the management of diabetes; the early treatment by eplerenone may prevent and reverse the progression of atrial and ventricular dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis to irreversible structural and symptomatic cardiac disease. Thus, the proposed research will have a favourable impact in turning the focus of treatment of this disease from secondary prevention and heart failure symptom management into an interventional approach at the preclinical stage. This may result in a reduction in morbidity and mortality for patients with T2DM, with improved outcomes and consequent substantial health cost savings for the community.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>2D: 2-dimensional; ACEI: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; AMI: Acute myocardial infarction; ARB: Angiotensin receptor blockers; CAD: Coronary artery disease; IB: Integrated backscatter; DSMB: Data safety and monitoring board; e&#x02019;: Peak early diastolic velocity; E/e&#x02019;: Ratio of mitral inflow early diastolic velocity to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity; HbA1c: Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c; LA: Left atrial; LV: Left ventricular; MMPs: Matrix metalloproteinases; MMP-1: Matrix metalloproteinase 1; MMP-9: Matrix metalloproteinase 9; NYHA: New York Heart Association functional class; PICP: Procollagen type I carboxy-terminal propeptide; PIIINP: Procollagen type III amino-terminal propeptide; PINP: Procollagen type I aminoterminal peptide; RAAS: Renin angiotension-II aldosterone system; TGF-&#x003b2;: Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;; TIMP-1: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Pfizer Inc. provided eplerenone and placebo tablets for this trial.
