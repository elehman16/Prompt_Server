Mode and parameters of mechanical ventilation were adjusted according to patients&#x02019; condition. Patients were ventilated using SIMV and PSV and PEEP, and switched to PSV and PEEP after the PIC window appeared. The level of PSV was decreased gradually to 5-8cmH<sub>2</sub>O with the improvement of patients&#x02019; condition; at least 12 hours later, exudation was conducted and followed by non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The non-invasive mechanical ventilation that we used were bi-level positive airway pressure-spontaneous and timing mode (BiPAP-S/T); the level of inspiration positive airway pressure (IPAP) was 4-7cmH<sub>2</sub>O (1cmH<sub>2</sub>O = 0.0198KPa), and then weaning from mechanical ventilation after spontaneous breathe smoothly, instead of nasal breathing.

In addition, balance of normal flora was inevitably destroyed as a result of using antibiotics long term, and influenced the body&#x02019;s digestion and absorption. Patients will in high emergency condition when exacerbations, and then muscular atrophy will happen, even if it is timely to add exogenous proteins, it can&#x02019;t change organization protein consumption of their own, so mal-nutrition is common in most of COPD patients. For those patients who have weaning difficulties, they will get pulmonary infection aggravated even though infection is controlled, because of respiratory muscles fatigue and weakness, sputum drained difficultly, obstructed airways repeatedly.</p><p>It is well known that during long-term mechanical ventilation, due to implementation of an invasive artificial airway, ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) requiring repeated treatment often occurs. The results show that occurring rate of VAP in the study group is obviously lower than those of the control group (P&#x0003c;0.01). The decrease of the incidence rate of VAP can improve the effect of treatment and decrease the medical expenditure. In a way, increasing BMI can reduce dangerous factors of VAP, strengthen the body&#x02019;s immunity and decrease mortality risk. The results show that 23 people in the control group (BMI&#x0003c;21, but their BMI&#x0003e;21 by enteral nutrition combined with parenteral nutrition in treatment) were survived by using endotracheal intubation again. In this way, we know BMI is important.</p><p>Pulmonary infection control window (PIC window) will appear early if the antibiotic is administrated reasonably, although the treatment of COPD is a comprehensive process. There is no significant difference between these two groups on analysis of invasive mechanical ventilation time, and infection could be controlled rapidly during the short period of invasive mechanical ventilation. These COPD cases require invasive mechanical ventilation again as a result of respiratory muscle fatigue and sputum drained difficulty followed by non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Compared with the control group, the study group had shorter duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation time, total mechanical ventilation time, in re-intubation rate (P&#x0003c;0.01). Body mass index (BMI) is recommended as an important marker to reflect total nutrition of body. Capability of respiratory muscle and sputum drained of the COPD patients can be improved by strengthening nutrition, and the time of mechanical ventilation can be shorten. Therefore, BMI as an important reference index can be used to estimate the weaning from sequential mechanical ventilation for severity COPD patients.</p><p>The results show that weaning successfully from mechanical ventilation is very impossible when the BMI&#x0003c;21. In one of the studies by A Anzueto et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], there were no differences in the patients&#x02019; outcomes (duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of weaning, length of stay in the intensive care unit, length of stay in the hospital and mortality in the intensive care unit and in the hospital) based on body mass index categories, but they found a similar trend although they did not find statistically significant differences that body mass index was associated with risk-adjusted hospital mortality among mechanically ventilated adults with acute lung injury. Lower body mass index was associated with higher odds of death, whereas overweight and obese were associated with lower odds[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is superficial to use BMI as an important reference index which estimates the weaning from sequential mechanical ventilation for severity COPD patients, but as one effective reference index. If using pulmonary infection control window (PIC window) as the switch point for transferring from invasive to noninvasive mechanical ventilation, BMI as a time point of weaning from sequential invasive-noninvasive mechanical ventilation need further clinical research.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Declarations</title><p>This article has been published as part of <italic>BMC Emergency Medicine</italic> Volume 13 Supplement 1, 2013: Proceedings of the 2012 Emergency Medicine Annual Congress.
