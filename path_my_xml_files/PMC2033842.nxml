We compared standard CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) with alternating CMF/EV (epirubicin, vincristine) in the adjuvant therapy of early breast cancer. Stage II premenopausal node-positive or post-menopausal node-positive oestrogen receptor-negative and stage III breast cancer patients were eligible for the study. From January 1985 to December 1990, 220 patients were randomised (115 to CMF and 105 to CMF/EV). Toxicity was mild; neurotoxicity, vomiting and hair loss were more frequent in the CMF/EV group, while permanent amenorrhoea, diarrhoea, stomach ache and minor infections occurred more often in the CMF arm. At a follow-up of 48 months, 113 patients (51.4%) had had recurrence (62 on CMF and 51 on CMF/EV) and 54 (24.5%) had died (30 on CMF and 24 on CMF/EV). There was no significant difference in disease-free and overall survival between the two arms. After adjusting for menopausal status and stage, the relative risk (RR) of recurrence for CMF/EV patients was 0.93 (95% CL 0.64-1.35), while the RR of death was 0.85 (95% CL 0.49-1.47). In conclusion, the Goldie-Coldman model of alternating therapy is not confirmed in this trial of adjuvant therapy of early breast cancer, although in view of its design a difference of less than 20% in 3 year disease-free survival could not be excluded.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1283" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1284" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1285" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1286" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1287" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
