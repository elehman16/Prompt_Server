<italic>Reach</italic>: Patient participation rates were 71.5&#x000a0;%. Compared to no change in the control sites, there were significant pre- to post-intervention increases in self-reported receipt of print materials in the intervention hospitals (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1370, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). <italic>Adoption</italic>: In the intervention hospitals, all targeted units and several non-targeted units participated; 76.0&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1028) of targeted nurses and 317 additional staff participated in the training, and 92.4&#x000a0;% were extremely or somewhat satisfied with the training. <italic>Implementation</italic>: Nurses in the intervention hospitals reported increases in providing advice to quit, counseling, medications, handouts, and DVD (all <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and reported decreased barriers to implementing smoking cessation services (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

Hospitalization provides an excellent opportunity for patients to quit smoking because they are a captive audience, are often motivated to quit due to illness, and often quit temporarily due to hospital smoking bans. Moreover, meta-analyses suggest that nurse-administered interventions are efficacious, particularly among hospitalized patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the strong evidence for the efficacy of inpatient smoking interventions, a large gap exists between the availability of effective smoking cessation interventions and their widespread dissemination in hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The challenge rests with disseminating smoking cessation interventions into standard practice.</p><p>The <italic>Reach</italic>, <italic>Effectiveness</italic>, <italic>Adoption</italic>, <italic>Implementation</italic>, <italic>and Maintenance</italic> (RE-AIM) framework has been used in other dissemination and implementation health behavior and smoking studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Utilization of the RE-AIM framework is intended to enhance the applicability of research-based interventions in clinical practice and ease the process of planning, conducting, reporting, and selecting interventions to be implemented on a large scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The constructs of the RE-AIM framework are the following: (1) <italic>reach</italic> (percent and representativeness of individuals receiving an intervention); (2) <italic>effectiveness</italic> (impact of an intervention on outcomes); (3) <italic>adoption</italic> (proportion and representativeness of settings and providers willing to deliver the intervention); (4) <italic>implementation</italic> (extent to which the intervention is implemented as intended); and (5) <italic>maintenance</italic> (sustainability of an intervention at individual and setting levels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The RE-AIM framework has been used to guide several studies testing the Tobacco Tactics intervention.</p><p>A randomized controlled trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;184) tested the <italic>efficacy</italic> of the Tobacco Tactics intervention among head and neck cancer patients and found that 6-month smoking cessation rates were 47&#x000a0;% quitting in the Tobacco Tactics group compared to 31&#x000a0;% in the usual care group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Ninety percent of participants said they would recommend the intervention and the manual to someone else dealing with similar issues. As with many efficacy studies, the intervention was not <italic>maintained</italic> and ended when the trial ended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The Tobacco Tactics intervention was then packaged into a toolkit for inpatient nurses and smokers in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. <italic>Reach</italic>: Compared to the usual care site, patients in the intervention sites reported an increase in receiving and satisfaction with selected cessation services, particularly medications (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. <italic>Effectiveness</italic>: Six-month quit rates improved from the pre- to the post-intervention time periods in Ann Arbor (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004) and Detroit (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) (which services a large number of African Americans), compared to the Indianapolis control site (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1070). <italic>Adoption</italic>: Three hundred sixty-nine or 74&#x000a0;% of targeted nurses and 282 non-targeted personnel were trained in the Tobacco Tactics intervention. <italic>Implementation</italic>: Nurses&#x02019; self-reported administration of cessation services increased from 57&#x000a0;% pre- to 86&#x000a0;% post-training (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0002). The intervention was incorporated into new nurse training, and <italic>maintenance</italic> was high as the programs remain in place in Ann Arbor and Detroit 3&#x000a0;years after the study ended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The intervention was exported to another VA via satellite broadcast where it has continued to be implemented 2&#x000a0;years after the study ended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>A recently completed NIH-supported R21 randomized controlled trial compared a nurse-supported, web-based version of the Tobacco Tactics intervention versus referral to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW telephone quitline (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;145) among blue collar workers. <italic>Efficacy</italic>: The Tobacco Tactics website group showed significantly higher quit rates (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18/67, 26.9 %) than the 1-800-QUIT-NOW group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6/78, 7.7 %) at 1-month follow-up (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003). <italic>Reach</italic>: Compared to participants in the 1-800-QUIT-NOW group, significantly more of those in the Tobacco Tactics website group participated in the intervention, received phone calls and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and found the intervention helpful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>These prior studies show that the Tobacco Tactics intervention had high <italic>reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation,</italic> and <italic>maintenance</italic> in VA, non-VA, and community settings. As one of these six studies funded by the National Institutes of Health, which together comprised the Consortium of Hospitals to Advance Research on Tobacco (CHART), this pragmatic trial used the RE-AIM framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to test the nurse-administered Tobacco Tactics intervention on inpatient units in six community hospitals. This study differed from the other CHART trials in that (1) this was a non-randomized, implementation trial while the others were all randomized controlled studies and (2) all but one of the other trials tested variations on referral to quit telephone lines, the other tested referral to website, while this study used real-world staff nurses to deliver the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>A recently published paper in the <italic>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</italic> describes the <italic>effectiveness</italic> of the Tobacco Tactics CHART study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There were significant improvements in propensity-adjusted, pre- to post-intervention self-reported quit rates and cotinine-verified quit rates in the intervention sites compared to no change in the control sites.

Using data collected from the larger study, this paper provides information on the process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework, excluding effectiveness (outcome) evaluation, which was recently published separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Using mixed methods, this quasi-experimental study initially designed to be conducted among a convenience sample of six Michigan Trinity Health community hospitals (matched on size and number of minority patients), of which three were to receive the nurse-administered Tobacco Tactics intervention and three were to receive usual care, although data from one of the control hospitals was not useable due to a protocol deviation. Not to randomize, but only to reduce investigator bias, a random number generator was used to assign the hospitals to experimental and control conditions. While medical surgical units were the primary units targeted, the leaders at the hospitals were allowed to include additional units, which increased the generalizability of study findings. However, nurses and patients on non-targeted units were not followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Human study approval was received from the University of Michigan (Health Sciences and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board #HUM00043349) and Trinity Health hospitals (Mercy Health Institutional Review Board #2011013, Saint Joseph Mercy Institutional Review Board #HSR-11-1272, and Saint Mary&#x02019;s Health Care Institutional Review board #SM11-830-01).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting and sample</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>Trinity Health is one of the largest multi-institutional Catholic health care delivery systems in the nation.

Using a modified Dillman approach, patients were mailed surveys 30&#x000a0;days and 6&#x000a0;months after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Participants were given $10 for each survey returned. At 6 months post-discharge, participants that returned 6-month surveys were provided a urinary NicAlert cotinine test strip to be mailed back, for which they received an additional $20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Medical information, receipt of cessation services, and quit rates for those lost to follow-up were also downloaded or abstracted from the EMR. Midway through the study, nurses in the intervention hospitals were trained in the Tobacco Tactics intervention, which became the standard of care for treating tobacco dependence for all inpatient smokers in the institution, whether or not they enrolled in the study. In this way, receipt of services and quit rates for all patients were determined pre-intervention, during training (transition period), and post-intervention in both intervention and control groups. Data from patients in the transition period, while nurses were being trained, were not included in the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Adoption, implementation, and maintenance</title><p>Nurses in both intervention and control hospitals were anonymously surveyed pre-intervention to assess attitudes about, provision of, and barriers to providing smoking cessation services to inpatient smokers. In the intervention hospitals only, working with the research nurse, master trainers then provided 1-h training sessions on all shifts to targeted nurses who were then immediately surveyed about their opinions about the training. Approximately 3&#x000a0;months after training, nurses in intervention and control hospitals were again surveyed to assess attitudes about, provision of, and barriers to providing smoking cessation services to inpatient smokers. In addition, 10&#x000a0;% of targeted nurses in the intervention sites were interviewed.

Pre- and post-intervention nurse surveys provided information on the characteristics of the nurses and nurses&#x02019; opinions about the training (overall satisfaction, satisfaction with pharmaceutical management, satisfaction with behavioral management, understanding of training, and helpfulness of training, all of which were rated on a five-point Likert scale).</p><p>
<italic>Implementation</italic> was measured from nurse surveys by calculating pre- to post-training changes in&#x000a0;self-reported attitudes toward providing cessation services, delivery of the components of the intervention, and barriers to implementation. In the intervention sites only, <italic>implementation</italic> was measured via descriptive statistics of documentation of services downloaded from the EMR. In the intervention sites only, interviews were conducted with nurses about their provision of Joint Commission measures for inpatient tobacco cessation (yes/no) and delivery of components of the intervention (yes/no), and nurses were asked to give qualitative comments about their experience implementing the intervention. Volunteer logs revealed the number of phone follow-up attempts, percent reached, average number of calls per patient, number of patients reached, and total number of contacts. <italic>Maintenance</italic> of the intervention was measured by determining whether the implementation continued after the researchers withdrew support from the hospitals as noted in post-intervention patient and nurse surveys (short-term maintenance) and anecdotal communication with nurses after the study ended (long-term maintenance).

The qualitative results were triangulated with quantitative results, which involve cross verifying the same information from different sources, in this case comparing patient data, nurse survey and interview data, and EMR data. It was expected that the rich qualitative data obtained from a smaller number of nurse interviews could further explain the more closed-ended, but more generalizable, patient and nurse surveys and EMR data that could be obtained from larger numbers of participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Reach</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Patient participation and follow-up rates from recruitment logs, EMR downloads, and patient surveys</title><p>Recruitment logs showed that across the three intervention and two control hospitals, 4013 smokers were approached from October 2011 through May 2013.

An average of 2.2 follow-up phone calls per patient were completed to 144 patients, for a total of 313 patient contacts. The remaining attempts/phone calls resulted in voicemail messages, no answers, speaking with someone other than the patient, and unreachable phone numbers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Maintenance/sustainability</title><p>To enhance sustainability, training was incorporated into new hire nurse training at all sites. The information in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, which was collected during the post-intervention period, suggests that there was short-term sustainability. While data were not systematically collected on long-term sustainability of the program, there is anecdotal evidence that the program is being maintained, as members of the study team are periodically contacted by Trinity Health nurses with questions, primarily regarding where to order more materials. One of the intervention hospitals reported that they changed the nurse training from face-to-face to online training. Two other Trinity Health hospitals heard about the program, contacted us, and are implementing components of the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec36"><title>Reach</title><p>The intervention had high reach as demonstrated by post-intervention patients in the intervention sites reporting receiving significantly more handout materials. Unlike telephone quit lines, which have been shown to be highly effective, but reach only 6 to 10&#x000a0;% of smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], numerous studies have shown that inpatient cessation programs, including those delivered by nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], have the potential to reach a large number of captive smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Participants in the sample had many characteristics that placed them at high risk for smoking and relapse back to smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] including probable problem drinking, depression, and less than a high school education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Diseases of the respiratory and circulatory systems were among the most common and are often smoking-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], which may increase motivation to quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Adoption</title><p>One of our best measures of success is that over three quarters of targeted nurses participated in the Tobacco Tactics training on targeted units with additional participation from non-targeted units. The high satisfaction with the training was likely discussed among nurses and their managers resulting in many nurses attending from non-targeted units. The extension of the intervention to various types of intensive care units, outpatient, emergency room, psychiatric, substance abuse, and obstetric units (including expectant fathers) speaks not only to the to the quality of the program but also for the need for training providers to conduct tobacco cessation interventions in hospital settings.</p><p>Nurses increased perceived importance of and self-confidence in delivering tobacco cessation services likely contributed to the increased adoption of the intervention and subsequent increased quit rates in the intervention sites. Our prior work has shown that nurses who were more satisfied with and had a better understanding of the Tobacco Tactics intervention had significantly higher perceived confidence scores and importance scores related to providing the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Providers who feel more confident in their ability to do what is expected, recognize the need and importance for the intervention, and have the requisite skills are more likely to implement a program at higher levels of fidelity and result in increased quit rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Implementation</title><p>With as little as a 1-h training session, the proportion of nurses self-reporting the provision of cessation services significantly increased from pre- to post-intervention. This finding is congruent with a Cochrane Collaborative Review that demonstrated that health professional training increases the delivery of smoking cessation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Implementing standard protocols, which have been shown to be effective in increasing smoking cessation counseling interventions provided by nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], likely enhanced service delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Nurses are ideally positioned to deliver cessation interventions because (1) physician time is at a premium, (2) nurses are educated in psychosocial and physiological interventions, (3) nurses have access to and immediate rapport with patients as well as respect from physicians, (4) nurses understand the patient&#x02019;s medical condition and can tailor the intervention accordingly, and (5) nurses can read charts, initiate medication orders, and write nursing notes.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in the control group, nurses pre- to post-intervention self-reported a decrease in feeling that providing smoking cessation is important, a decrease in feeling confident in providing smoking cessation services, and less provision of smoking cessation services, and selected barriers increased at marginally significant levels. Moreover, patients in the control group reported receiving less smoking cessation handouts post-intervention compared to pre-intervention. This may be related to the lower educational levels of the nurses in the post-intervention period compared to the pre-intervention period. This is similar to another smoking cessation implementation study that also trained nurses and found that low performing units had nurses that were less educationally prepared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>Lack of time and competing demands have been cited as barriers to providing cessation services by nurses in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Yet, our work and the work of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] have shown that the major barrier to nurses providing cessation services is not lack of time but lack of expertise, as the nurses in our current study reported that the intervention &#x0201c;saves time.&#x0201d; Although in our prior VA study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], splicing the DVD into the overhead television system was easy and nurses reported that showing the patient the DVD saved them time at the bedside, the DVD was not easily integrated into the overhead television system used by Trinity Health.</p><p>While several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and this study report the use of the EMR to identify smokers, there are few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] that use the EMR to actually document the treatment of smoking in accordance with JC standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. While qualitative comments supported the need for improvement in the documentation template, there is motivation for hospital leadership to conduct this programming as meaningful use (the set of standards defined by the Centers for Medicare &#x00026; Medicaid Services Incentive Programs that governs the use of EMRs) will allow eligible providers and hospitals to earn incentive payments for implementing tobacco cessation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Currently, the JC is starting to work with Mathematica Policy Research and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to assemble the Tobacco Treatment Task Force, which will reengineer these measures as electronic clinical quality measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Maintenance</title><p>The nurse-delivered Tobacco Tactics program remained sustainable 1&#x000a0;year after the researchers withdrew from the settings and longer term sustainability has been anecdotally verified. Integrating the program into new nurse training has enhanced sustainability as nurses turn over. While volunteers made phone calls during the study, unfortunately, there was no one from any of the intervention hospitals invested in coordinating the follow-up phone calls when the study ended. This is similar to our prior VA study that implemented and evaluated volunteer follow-up phone calls for smoking cessation and found it to be effective and cost-effective yet was not sustainable for similar reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Application of the RE-AIM framework to assess intervention implementation</title><p>This study has shown how the RE-AIM framework can be used to guide research-based interventions in clinical practice. Utilization of the RE-AIM framework can serve as a guide to plan, conduct, and report on interventions that are implemented on a large scale in real-world settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Not only can the RE-AIM framework identify individual impact, but it can also identify population impact, as was done in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The framework can be used to maximize external validity; report elements of both internal and external validity; review a body of evidence; and compare interventions to make policy decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>While pragmatic designs are more feasible and allow for implementation in natural environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], the lack of randomization may pose challenges in terms of internal validity, making it harder to rule out confounding variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Although data from one of the control hospitals did not materialize, the nurse and patient sample sizes in the other two control hospitals were large enough to allow clinically and statistically meaningful comparisons with the intervention hospitals. Nurses&#x02019; implementation of the Tobacco Tactics intervention was based on self-report and therefore may have been inflated, although there was no inflation in the nurse self-report in the control group. Moreover, self-reported implementation of the Tobacco Tactics intervention was somewhat substantiated by EMR-downloaded documentation of services and qualitative comments by nurses reflected a large amount of detail about and enthusiasm for implementing the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Tobacco Tactics intervention had high <italic>reach</italic> among inpatient smokers. <italic>Adoption</italic> and <italic>implementation</italic> were also high probably due to the packaging of the intervention into a user-friendly toolkit. Short-term maintenance was substantiated by patient and nurse surveys, and anecdotal evidence suggests that the program remains sustainable. Imagine the enormous reach and public health impact of an inpatient smoking cessation intervention if the largest group of front-line providers, namely nurses, were trained to effectively provide the tobacco cessation interventions. As we move toward more population-based interventions, the RE-AIM framework is&#x000a0;a valuable guide for implementation.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec43"><title>Additional files</title><p>
