The leading hypothesis for winter depression (seasonal affective disorder, or SAD) is the phase shift hypothesis (PSH). The PSH was recently established in a study in which SAD patients were given low-dose melatonin in the afternoon/evening to cause phase advances, or in the morning to cause phase delays, or placebo. The prototypical phase-delayed patient as well as the smaller subgroup of phase-advanced patients, optimally responded to melatonin given at the correct time. Symptom severity improved as circadian misalignment was corrected. Orcadian misalignment is best measured as the time interval between the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and mid-sleep. Using the operational definition of the plasma DLMO as the interpolated time when melatonin levels continuously rise above the threshold of 10 pglmL, the average interval between DLMO and mid-sleep in healthy controls is 6 hours, which is associated with optimal mood in SAD patients.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="es"><p>El hallazgo que la luz brillante puede suprimir la producci&#x000f3;n de melatonina condujo al estudio de dos situaciones, o mejor dicho modelos, de privaci&#x000f3;n de luz: las personas totalmente ciegas y los depresivos invernales.

According to the melatonin PRC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> melatonin administered in the morning (AM) causes a phase delay, and melatonin administered in the afternoon/evening (PM) causes a phase advance. That is, the melatonin PRC is about 12 hours out of phase with the light PRC. Therefore, according to the PSH, most SAD patients should preferentially respond to PM melatonin. After a baseline week in which subjects were permitted to sleep only between consistent bedtimes and wake times of their choosing and a baseline DLMO assessment, subjects were assigned to one of three regimens (AM melatonin, PM melatonin, or placebo capsules only). The melatonin dose varied slightly according to the year and was divided into 3 to 4 capsules, 2 hours apart; the total dose was 0.225 to 0.3 mg per day, depending on the year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Patients took 7 to 8 capsules per day, depending on the year. At the end of the third treatment week, capsules were stopped and the next day a post-treatment DLMO assessment was undertaken. The 29item SIGH-SAD (21-item Ham-D plus eight items characteristic of SAD) was administered weekly for 3 weeks. When this study was initially formulated, it was thought that the phase-advanced subgroup was too small to significantly influence, testing the hypothesis that PM melatonin would be more antidepressant than AM melatonin. This may explain why there was no statistically significant difference between these two treatments. However, more informative findings were revealed after phase typing, based on an operational definition of normal phase alignment as a 6-hour interval between the DLMO and midsleep, that is, a phase angle difference (PAD) of 6 h <italic>(<xref rid="DialoguesClinNeurosci-9-291-g003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</italic> Although the clock time of a phase marker is important, PAD is more useful because: (i) it removes confounding effects from sleep/wake cycles that occur at the different times; (ii) it is almost impossible for subjects or their raters to infer PAD from knowledge of sleep times; and (iii) psychiatric symptoms are more likely to be related to internal circadian misalignment.

Terman group claims the key to understanding the circadian mechanism of light lies in its ability to cause a phase advance; the greater the phase advance, the greater the antidepressant effect. This does not take into account the possibility that some patients may do better with evening light so as to provide a corrective phase delay. Furthermore, the Terman group recommends that patients awaken earlier than usual in order to schedule light at an earlier circadian time. However, an earlier wake time would shorten PAD, and, according to our findings, would compromise light's antidepressant effect in the prototypical phase-delayed patient. Moreover, we would predict that these prototypical patients would do less well if overly phase advanced by light scheduled too early; it had been known for some time that as long as the light was not scheduled too many hours before dawn, the earlier light exposure was scheduled relative to the DLMO, the greater was its phase-advancing effect.</p><fig orientation="portrait" id="DialoguesClinNeurosci-9-291-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Post-treatment SIGH-SAD score as a function of PAD.

Accordingly, circadian misalignment may constitute a surrogate marker for the symptoms of SAD. The above analyses also indicate that circadian misalignment seems to be the causal term in the correlation with symptom severity. This remarkable finding is further confirmed by retrospectively comparing the behavioral response to the correct treatment vs the incorrect treatment or placebo. Patients who were phase delayed at baseline and were assigned to PM melatonin received the correct treatment, while those who were assigned to AM melatonin received the incorrect treatment; patients who were phase advanced at baseline and were assigned to AM melatonin received the correct treatment, while those who were assigned to PM melatonin received the incorrect treatment. The pre- to posttreatment decrease in depression ratings was 20% more in the correctly treated groups as compared with the other two groups, which is remarkably impressive for a fixed-dose trial of an antidepressant <italic>(<xref rid="DialoguesClinNeurosci-9-291-g008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</italic> The most conservative effect size was 0.61, which also is quite robust for an antidepressant. Given that most studies of antidepressants cannot disguise side effects and that melatonin was administered in such a way that sleepiness, its only side effect, was not present, melatonin appears to be of enormous therapeutic value, particularly once the dosing regimen is optimized. We used melatonin only as a means to test the PSH for light and the inclusion of AM melatonin was primarily as a control for PM melatonin. Future studies should continue to use the Instructions we provided to the patients which minimized their expectations and helped to lessen the placebo response (about 13%, compared with the usual 30% In antidepressant studies).</p><fig orientation="portrait" id="DialoguesClinNeurosci-9-291-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Percent change in (SIGH-SAD) depression score after correct treatment incorrect treatment and placebo, as well as incorrect treatment and placebo combined (correct treatment such as giving PM melatonin to phase-delay SAD patients, etc; see text for details of the composition of these treatment groups).

The PSH may also be applied to sleep and other psychiatric disorders. The PSH for these other disorders suggests that they are caused at least in part by a phase shift in circadian rhythms as marked by the DLMO with respect to the sleep/wake cycle. While we regard the PSH confirmed in SAD, the PSH remains to be tested in other sleep and psychiatric disorders.</p><p>In our recent study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> we reported that the weekly SIGHSAD ratings continuously declined over the 4 weeks of the study only in the correctly treated group.

This suggests that nonseasonal major depressive disorder, as measured by the 21-item HAM-D, might have a substantial circadian component related to the PSH. Furthermore, we have found that all of the main analyses using just three items substituted for the entire scale (that has a tenfold greater range) results in almost identical findings. These three items on 1-5 scales were: (1) self -reported symptoms of depression; (ii) self -reported symptoms of anxiety; and (iii) objective assessment of agitation of the subject by the rater at the time of the interview. Thus, anxiety disorders and mixed depressive/anxiety disorders should be evaluated for the PSH. Since depression and anxiety are frequently a part of sleep disorders, sleep disorders should also be tested for the PSH, as well as substance abuse disorders. As these iterative analyses proceed, we might be able to define a circadian endophenotype. However, we hesitate to use this term, as the range in PAD in healthy controls is the same as in our SAD patients, and the means are not much different. Therefore, the circadian component is a necessary but not sufficient cause of SAD. Why some people become symptomatic when their DLMO becomes delayed or advanced with respect to mid-sleep while others do not Is an Important research question. However, the answer to this may not affect treatment, and would not diminish the clinical importance of the circadian component in SAD: no matter how many necessary-but-not-sufficient causes there may be, correction of just one of these could produce a successful clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for analyses of extant and new data sets</title><p>It is hoped that the work presented here will alert researchers to another way of conceptualizing a biological marker, in addition to the current concept of using a biological marker to distinguish between patients and healthy controls, which can often be made by merely taking a good history, that is, identifying patients who are anxious, depressed, obsessivecompulsive, paranoid, psychotic, substance abusers or poor sleepers, etc. Indeed, a symptom severity biological marker may be more useful than a chemical test for a DSM diagnosis, particularly if the former informs the type of treatment and provides a way of monitoring treatment in addition to assessing subjective and objective signs and symptoms. Given how relatively inexpensive and noninvasive the salivary DLMO is compared with other markers, neuroimaging for one example, and given how safe and inexpensive low-dose melatonin and light are compared with most other allopathic treatment modalities, there is ample justification for future investment in circadian research.</p><p>Our recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> establishes the PSH and the circadian component as a necessary but not sufficient cause of a substantial component of SAD, as well as a biological marker. It is hoped that the three criteria met by the circadian component for the latter designation will clarify what is important for other biological markers to demonstrate, something like Koch's postulates. We<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> have recently described these; in the same patients:

We restricted our analyses to the baseline data due to the known profound placebo component associated with light. Using the DLMOs as provided in the data set as well as diary-recorded sleep onset and offset times averaged across the 7 days of the baseline week, we tested the following hypotheses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> plotting 29-item SIGH-SAD scores against PAD:

Interestingly, we noticed that <italic>Figure 2</italic> of the Terman paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> contained data from which the proportion of phase delayed vs phase advanced patients at baseline could be estimated. In this figure, DLMO is plotted against sleep midpoint. The linear regression equation (r=0.66) is y=1.01x-5.93. Rounding to the nearest integer this equation becomes y=x-6 (or y-x=6). Since y is DLMO and x is midsleep, the line estimates PAD 6. Therefore, all data points to the left of this line are probably PAD &#x0003c;6 (phase delayed according to our criteria) and all data points to the right of this line are PAD &#x0003e;6 (phase advanced according to our criteria). Despite the limitations of this type of analysis, it is clear that the predominant group of patients are phase delayed and that there is a smaller, but substantial, subgroup of patients who we would categorize as phase advanced at baseline, which is consistent with the findings in our <italic>PNAS</italic> paper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> although their presumably phase-advanced subgroup appears to comprise more than one third of the patients. Before closing, we should note that the work of others in the field of circadian rhythms and depression was recently reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> We should also note that agomelatine, a melatonin agonist with serotonergic actions, appears to be effective in major depressive disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, at least animal studies suggest anxiolytic effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> These findings are consistent with what we have reported above.</p><p>For the clinicians, particularly those practicing in the US, it is important to note that melatonin is easily available to consumers without a prescription. Our impression is that some SAD patients prefer light, some prefer melatonin, and some prefer the combination, at least for the very shortest days of the year. Until more clinical labs are capable of measuring melatonin in saliva, clinicians must proceed without this test and the recommendations of <italic>Table I</italic> remain state-of-the-art. Since most patients with SAD are of the phasedelayed type, morning light should usually be tried first. Failure to respond is apparent within the first week of treatment, after which bright light should be switched to the evening. If morning bright light causes too much of a phase advance, patients will start to complain of early-morning awakening.</p></sec></body><back><notes><p>We thank the research subjects, the nursing staff of the Oregon Health &#x00026; Science University (OHSU) Clinical and Translational Research Center, Diana Arntz and Kathryn Woods.
