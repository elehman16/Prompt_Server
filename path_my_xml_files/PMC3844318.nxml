increasing evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to both susceptibility to, and severity of, multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients with the clinically isolated syndrome represent the initial presentation of a demyelinating disorder, and those with asymptomatic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are at risk of progression to clinically definite MS. The aims of this study are to examine the immunologic effects of vitamin D in both healthy individuals and in patients with clinically isolated syndrome, and in the latter group the effects on disease progression assessed by MRI and clinical measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a single-center double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. The primary endpoint is the immunologic effects of two doses of vitamin D compared with placebo over 24 weeks in both healthy control participants and patients presenting with the clinically isolated syndrome. Healthy control participants (n = 39) and patients with clinically isolated syndrome (n = 45) will be randomized to one of three arms, namely 1) vitamin D 5,000 IU daily, 2) vitamin D 10,000 IU daily, or 3) placebo, and followed up for 24 weeks. In both patients and healthy control participants, the primary outcome will be immunologic measures of the frequency of CD4 T-cell subsets and cytokine responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, assessed at baseline, and after 16 and 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints, in the patients with clinically isolated syndrome, will be relapse activity, and the number of new T2 lesions and gadolinium-enhancing lesions assessed by MRI in the two vitamin D-treated groups compared with the placebo-treated group over the 24 weeks of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>EU Clinical Trials Register: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=eudract_number:2012-000635-68">EudraCT: 2012-000635-68</ext-link>.

The causes of MS remain unknown, but it is widely believed that there is interplay between genetic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Evidence for the role of the environment in the development of MS is supported by a strong correlation between MS incidence/prevalence and increased latitude and lower levels of sun exposure, suggesting an association with vitamin D production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Individuals who emigrate before the age of 15 years from an area of high MS prevalence to one of low prevalence, acquire the lower risk of MS in their new country of residence. Migration studies provide perhaps the strongest support for the role of environmental factor(s) in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>People living at high latitudes are generally deficient in vitamin D, as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In one study, mean winter 25(OH)D levels in healthy control subjects in Ireland were 36.4 nmol/l, and more patients with MS had vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D levels less than 25 nmol/l) compared with control subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Patients have lower serum vitamin D levels during MS relapses, and also have blunted parathyroid hormone responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In 267 Dutch patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), higher vitamin D levels were associated with an increased chance of remaining relapse-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In 134 North American patients with RRMS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) of pediatric onset, the strongest predictor of further relapse was the baseline serum vitamin D level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In a prospective Australian study of 145 patients with RRMS, each increase of 10 nmol/l in baseline serum vitamin D level was associated with a 12% reduction in the risk of a further relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Vitamin D deficiency may increase susceptibility to MS even <italic>in utero</italic>; higher maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy was associated with a 38% lower risk of MS in offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and maternal vitamin D levels greater than 75 nmol/l were associated with a 61% reduced risk of MS in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Month of birth studies showing an increased MS incidence in those with spring versus autumn births also provide evidence of the role of maternal vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The potential therapeutic effect of vitamin D supplementation was first suggested by Goldberg in 1986 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Dosing studies in healthy volunteers have shown that supplementation with vitamin D 10,000 IU daily results in an increase in serum 25(OH)D levels of 150 nmol/l over a 12 week period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A Canadian phase I/II open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of 49 patients with RRMS who were randomized to placebo or escalating doses of vitamin D over a 52 week period showed a trend toward relapse reduction in the actively treated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This study was primarily aimed at establishing the safety and tolerability of high-dose vitamin D supplementation; the mean vitamin D dose was 14,000 IU per day, and there were no adverse events or hypercalcamia despite maximum mean vitamin D levels of 413 nmol/l being achieved. The results from this phase II trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and from dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggest that pharmacologic doses of vitamin D of up to 10,000 IU/day are safe, and may reduce the risk of relapse by a factor superior to the 30% reduction reported from the pivotal trials of interferons in RRMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin D modulates both the innate and adaptive immune systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The active metabolite, 1,25 (OH) vitamin D, primarily mediates its effects through the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], which is present in monocytes, dendritic cells, B-cells, and CD4+ T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Activation of VDR alters transcription, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and modulates immune response both indirectly, by reducing the activation of pro-inflammatory T-cells by antigen-presenting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and directly, by inhibiting T-cell and B-cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This results in a T-helper (Th) 2-cell driven anti-inflammatory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>There is thus accumulating evidence that vitamin D deficiency increases susceptibility to MS, and that vitamin D supplementation reduces disease activity by immunomodulatory mechanisms. It seems probable that serum vitamin D levels of greater than 100 nmol/l are required to produce the immunologic effects of vitamin D and thus, in patients with MS with vitamin D deficiency, doses of 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day are needed to achieve this. Most patients with RRMS, once diagnosed, commence treatment with first-line disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Several RCTs are underway to examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation in patients with RRMS already receiving first-line DMTs, using clinical and MRI outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the UK and Ireland, patients with CIS are not usually commenced on DMTs until there is clinical or MRI evidence of dissemination in time. These CIS patients, at risk of developing RRMS, may be recruited into trials of potentially therapeutic agents in order to examine the efficacy of specific therapies in preventing the development of clinically definite MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We have therefore designed this RCT to examine, over a 24 week treatment period the effects on immunologic measures as a primary outcome, both in patients with CIS and in healthy control participants, randomized to either of two doses of vitamin D (5,000 or 10,000 IU) or to placebo. In addition, in the patients with CIS, clinical and MRI efficacy measures will be assessed as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a single-center investigator-led, phase II, exploratory, double-blind, dose-ranging, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the immune responses to two doses of vitamin D in patients with CIS and in healthy control participants. Recruitment commenced in November 2012. In total, 45 patients with CIS and 39 healthy control participants will be enrolled and randomized to one of three arms, placebo oil or vitamin D oil (Vigantol&#x000ae;; Merck Serono, Darmstadt, Germany) at a dose of 5,000 IU or 10,000 IU, all of which will be taken orally for a period of 24 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval has been granted by St Vincent&#x02019;s Hospital Ethics and Medical Research Committee, and the study has been approved by the Irish Medicines Board.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated within 12 hours of drawing blood, and cryopreserved until samples from all three time points have been collected. Cytokine production will be measured by ELISA, and will include 1) cytokine production by T cells and by other cells such as monocytes, and 2) flow cytometry, gating specifically on CD4 and CD8 T cells. 1) For analysis of PBMC cytokine production, PBMCs from each timepoint will be thawed out and stimulated with antigen (purified protein derivative (PPD) and tetanus toxoid) or polyclonal stimuli (anti-CD3 and phytohaemaglutinin). After 3 to 5 days (for polyclonal or antigen-specific stimulation respectively), the cell culture supernatants will be assayed by ELISA for cytokines including interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-17, and interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;. 1) For flow cytometry analysis of T-cell subsets, stimulated PBMCs from experiment 1, will be re-stimulated on day 5 with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of brefeldin A for 5 hours, followed by cell surface staining for T-cell markers (CD3, CD8) and intracellular staining for cytokines including IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-&#x003b3;.

Participants will be dispensed two identical bottles at 4-weekly intervals, which will be either two bottles of the study drug (Vigantol&#x000ae;), two bottles of placebo oil, or a bottle of each, equating to the two doses of vitamin D and placebo being investigated in this study. Participants will be advised to take a set dose from each bottle per day. Mechanisms are in place so that the code can be broken in the case of an emergency where it is essential for the clinical management of the subject.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The power calculations for this study were based on a pilot study, which examined immunologic outcomes in four healthy control participants treated with vitamin D 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day at our institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. All calculations for numbers needed in the study were based on &#x003b1; = 5% and &#x003b2; = 80%. Based on flow cytometry analysis of T-cell subsets, the change in IL-17-producing CD4 T-cells (Th17 cells) had an effect size (mean &#x000b1; SD) of 1.9 &#x000b1; 1.8 indicating a need for five study subjects per group for 80% power. For IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4 T-cells (Th1 cells), the effect size was 4.3 &#x000b1; 6.3) indicating a need for 19 subjects per group for 80% power. The changes noted in cytokines in response to anti-CD3 stimulation of PBMC were 1) for IL-17, &#x00394; = 44.5 &#x000b1; 44.3, thus 10 participants needed in each group; 2) for IFN-&#x003b3;, &#x00394; = 32.8 &#x000b1; 1.2, thus 6 needed in each group; and 3) for IL-10, &#x00394; = &#x02212;455 &#x000b1; 27, thus number needed is &#x0003c; 5. The changes noted in cytokines in response to PPD stimulation were 1) for IFN-&#x003b3;, &#x00394; = 1860 &#x000b1; 1835, thus 10 needed, in each group and 2) for IL-10, &#x00394; = &#x02212;576 &#x000b1; 86, thus number needed is &#x0003c;5. On the basis of these results, at least 10 subjects should be included in each group (the only immunologic endpoint not powered would be the flow cytometry analysis of the IFN-&#x003b3;-producing cells). Recruiting 39 healthy controls and 45 patients with CIS will allow for a drop-out rate of 20% and 30% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All analyses assume a two-sided test of hypothesis with an overall &#x003b1; level of 0.05. Immunologic endpoints and <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses, which will include the 16 and 24 week endpoints, are considered exploratory, and will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons. Descriptive statistics will be presented as mean &#x000b1; SD. Non-parametric tests will be used to compare characteristics between treatment groups. For outcomes, the sign/sign rank test will be used to evaluate continuous outcomes. McNemar testing will be used to categorize categorical and binary outcomes. For non-parametric testing on unpaired continuous data, the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used. All outcomes will be adjusted for baseline serum 25(OH)D levels, and for mean serum levels achieved at weeks 16 and 24.</p><p>Missing data will be imputed as the mean of the preceding and following measurements. Only patients completing at least 4 months of full participation in the study or experiencing a relapse at any time in the study will be included in the final analysis. Non-adherent participants, defined as those with an increase in serum level of 25(OH)D of less than 50 nmol/l from baseline, will be excluded from the final analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The costs of conducting the clinical trial are funded by the Department of Neurology, St Vincent&#x02019;s University Hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Study sponsor</title><p>The trial sponsor is Dr Peter Doran, Senior Lecturer in Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Supplemental vitamin D appears to have potential as a therapeutic agent for MS; what is less clear is the optimal dose of vitamin D needed to effect change within the immune system. Our study is designed to address this question, and to add to the growing evidence of the safety and tolerability of high-dose vitamin D supplementation. As this is a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two distinct study groups and is adequately powered to meet the primary endpoint, it should be considered a high-quality trial aiming to provide class II evidence of the primary endpoint.</p><p>Existing guidelines on vitamin D supplementation are conservative, and refer mainly to bone health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], with 4,000 IU considered the upper limit of tolerability, despite the fact that sun exposure can provide an adult with up to 20,000 IU per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Older adults are now advised to sustain 25(OH) D concentrations of greater than 75 nmol/l for optimal bone health and, in order to achieve that, they need to consume approximately 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Levels greater than 100 nmol/l are needed to ensure that patients are receiving adequate immunomodulating doses of vitamin D. Based on previous dosing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the maximum serum 25(OH)D level expected with a daily dose of 10,000 IU is approximately 250 nmol/l, making both treatment doses safe and tolerable.</p><p>The availability of DMT and the earlier recognition and diagnosis of MS have a significant effect on trial design for the evaluation of new drugs, and this also raises ethical concerns. Most would feel that placebo-controlled studies of the RRMS population are unethical. This results in the need for large multicenter trials to achieve adequate numbers to power the study over longer time periods to assess for clinical endpoints. Thus, costs are generally prohibitive and really limits these studies to large pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>In Ireland, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, patients with CIS are treated conservatively until there is evidence, on clinical or MRI grounds, of dissemination in time. Patients with CIS form a distinct population with a well-established natural history, who are not exposed to immunomodulatory therapy. Given the standard practice in Ireland, there is no ethical concern with regard to watchful withholding of treatment. Should patients convert to RRMS during the trial, they will be offered standard DMT. This study should add to the growing evidence of the immunomodulatory effects of high-dose supplemental vitamin D in demyelinating disease. We hope to show that vitamin D is a safe and effective therapy for patients with CIS.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is active and has been recruiting from November 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ARR: Annualized relapse rate; CIS: Clinically isolated syndrome; DMT: Disease-modifying therapy; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging; MS: Multiple sclerosis; PBMC: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells; RCT: Randomized control trial; RRMS: Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis; VDR: Vitamin D receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>KO&#x02019;C has received an educational grant from Biogen Idec and travel bursaries from Abbot, Teva, and Biogen Idec.
