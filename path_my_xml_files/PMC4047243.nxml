quadriceps exercise on muscle strength, pain, and function in knee osteoarthritis.
[Subjects and Methods] Outpatients (N=42, 21 per group; age range 40&#x02013;65
years; 13 men and 29 women) with osteoarthritis of the knee participated in the study. The
experimental group performed isometric exercises including isometric quadriceps, straight
leg raising, and isometric hip adduction exercise 5 days a week for 5 weeks, whereas the
control group did not performed any exercise program. The outcome measures or dependent
variables selected for this study were pain intensity, isometric quadriceps strength, and
knee function. These variables were measured using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS),
strength gauge device, and reduced WOMAC index, respectively. All the measurements were
taken at baseline (week 0) and at the end of the trial at week 5. [Results] In
between-group comparisons, the maximum isometric quadriceps strength, reduction in pain
intensity, and improvement in function in the isometric exercise group at the end of the
5th week were significantly greater than those of the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05).
[Conclusion] The 5-week isometric quadriceps exercise program showed beneficial effects on
quadriceps muscle strength, pain, and functional disability in patients with
osteoarthritis of the knee.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Isometric exercise</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal condition affecting the quality of
life of older adults<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent survey in India reported that the prevalence of OA in
older adults more than 65&#x02005;years of age was 32.6% in the rural population and 60.3% in the
urban population<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Knee OA is likely to
become the eighth most important cause of disability in men and the fourth most important
cause of disability in women according to the World Health Organization report on global
burden of disease<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three major physical
impairments, such as knee pain, stiffness, and decreased quadriceps strength, are highly
associated with knee OA and are believed to contribute to physical disability and
progression of the disease<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Strength of the quadriceps musculature is one of the intrinsic factors that has been shown
to affect the knee joint functions. It is evident that lower extremity strength has a major
role in knee joint shock attenuation during weight bearing activities; however, research is
still ongoing regarding investigation of the role of strengthening in the treatment of OA of
the knee<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is increased risk of
development or progression of disease due to greater or uncontrolled loading on the joint;
therefore, quadriceps strength needs to be considered in the study of knee OA. A reduced
quadriceps strength has been shown to be associated with the presence of OA in the knee<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Reduction of pain and disability is the main aim of any treatment approach in the
management of knee OA. Combinations of treatment approaches including both pharmacological
and non-pharmacological methods are often preferred<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI)
recommended non-pharmacological methods including patient education programs, weight
reduction, coping strategies, and exercise programs for treatment of knee OA<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are three types of basic therapeutic exercise: isotonic, isokinetic, and isometric
exercise. Of these three, isometric exercise might be the most appropriate and easy to
understand by the patients and can be easily and safely performed at home because it
requires no or minimal apparatus. Further, isometric exercise causes the least
intra-articular inflammation, pressure, and bone destruction<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Norden, Leventhal, and Schumacher reported that &#x0201c;isometric
exercises&#x0201d; are simple and inexpensive to perform and that they rapidly improve strength<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, the purpose of this study was to
investigate whether isometric quadriceps exercise has a beneficial effect in patients with
knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The criteria for inclusion were as follows: prediagnosed case of knee OA as per the
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and radiological evidence of primary osteoarthritis
of grade 3 or less on the Kellgren Lawrence scale; age between 40&#x02013;65 years, unilateral or
bilateral involvement (in the case of bilateral involvement, the more symptomatic knee was
included), and pain in and around the knee. Subjects were excluded if they had any
deformity of the knee, hip or back, had any central or peripheral nervous system
involvement, had received steroids or intra-articular injection within the previous three
months, were uncooperative patients, or received physiotherapy treatment in the past 6
months. The study was approved by our Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC), and written
consent was obtained from all the participants. All experiments were conducted according
to the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly
assigned to one of two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> CONSORT diagram showing the flow of the study participants through each stage of

measurements of dependent variables were obtained by another therapist who was blinded to
group assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>All the subjects in the experimental group performed isometric exercises including
isometric quadriceps, straight leg raising, and isometric hip adduction exercise. All the
subjects also received ultrasound therapy as per the patient&#x02019;s requirement with 1.5
watts/cm<sup>2</sup> for 7 minutes in continuous mode at the tender point around the
knee joint prior to exercise.</p><p>The subjects in the experimental group performed the following sets of exercise for 5
weeks (5 days/week). All exercises were performed in sets of 10 repetitions; 1 set of all
exercises was performed twice a day for the 1st week, and this progressed to 2 sets twice
a day until the 3rd week and then 3 sets twice a day until the 5th week.</p><p>Isometric quadriceps exercise: Patients lay in a supine position. A rolled up towel was
put beneath the knee. They were instructed to maximally activate their thigh muscles in
order to straighten their knee and hold the contraction for 5 seconds.</p><p>Straight leg raising (SLR) exercise: Patients lay in a supine position. They were
instructed to perform a maximum isometric quadriceps contraction prior to the lifting
phase of the exercise. Then they were instructed to lift the leg up to 10&#x02005;cm above the
plinth and hold the contraction during the lifting phase for 10 seconds.</p><p>Isometric hip adduction exercise: Patients lay in a supine position. A small pillow was
put between the knees. They were instructed to perform isometric hip adduction exercise
while pressing the pillow between the knees and to maintain the adduction with contraction
for 5 seconds.</p><p>The control group received ultrasound therapy as per the patient&#x02019;s requirement with an
intensity of 1.5 watts/cm<sup>2</sup> for 7 minutes in continuous mode at the tender point
around the knee joint. They were told to continue their normal daily activities, and no
extra exercises were applied.</p><p>The outcome measures or dependent variables selected for this study were pain intensity,
knee function, and isometric quadriceps strength. These variables were measured using the
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, a reduced WOMAC index<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a strength gauge device<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, respectively. All the
measurements were taken at baseline (week 0) and at the end of the trial at week 5.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 15.0 Software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess whether the dependent variable conformed to a
normal distribution and so that parametric testing could be undertaken. The results of the
Shapiro-Wilk tests suggested that the dependent variable was not normally distributed
(p&#x0003c;0.05). Thus, a non-parametric test was used to analyze the data. The Mann-Whitney U
test was used to compare the pain intensity, functional disability, and isometric
quadriceps strength between the two groups at baseline and at the end of the 5th week. The
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to study the changes in these dependent variables in
each group over time. The level of statistical significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 50 subjects were assessed for eligibility. Six subjects did not satisfy the

beneficial effect in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The results of this study
demonstrated that isometric quadriceps exercise brought significant improvements in all the
parameters after the 5-week training program.</p><p>The results of the study demonstrated that isometric quadriceps exercises brought
significant gains in strength of the quadriceps muscle in the experimental group after the
5-week training program. In the between-group analysis, the improvement in strength in the
experimental group was 33% greater than that of the control group at the end of the training
period.</p><p>Our findings concur with those obtained in previous studies that have demonstrated the
benefits of isometric exercise in strength training. Uganet Hern&#x000e1;ndez Rosa et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the effect of isokinetic versus
isometric exercise in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. They reported that both
groups showed significant improvement in muscle strength at the end of the trial. However,
the isokinetic exercise group showed slightly greater improvement compared with the
isometric exercise group. Similarly, Masatsugu Miyaguchi et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a significant increase in muscle strength after 8
weeks of isometric quadriceps exercise in patients with knee OA.</p><p>The results of the present study showed that the 5 week period of intervention brought
about a significant reduction in knee pain and improvement in function in the experimental
group at the 5th week. The significant reduction in pain and improvement in function in the
experimental group may be attributed to improved quadriceps strength and therefore increase
stability of the knee joint.</p><p>The findings are consistent with the findings of previous investigators who have reported
that exercise can reduce pain and increase the functional abilities of OA patients. The
Fitness Arthritis and Seniors Trial<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported a modest 8% to 10% improvement in pain and functioning scores as a result of 18
months of aerobic or resistance exercise among their sample of knee OA patients. Further
Deyle et al<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, Falconer et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and Fisher et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> found the same positive effects of exercise programs on
pain and function. It is well documented in the literature that impaired quadriceps strength
has been found to be the greatest single predictor of lower limb functional limitation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Further study done by Boon Whatt LIM et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that quadriceps strengthening has beneficial effect on
pain and function in patients with OA knee. The study done by Shreyasee Amin et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that subjects having stronger
quadriceps strength had less knee pain and better physical function as compared with those
with the least strength. Strong muscles stabilize the joints in a proper alignment,
attenuate shocks that are transmitted to the joints and minimize the effect of impact by
spreading the forces out over a greater area so it may be hypothesized that improvement in
muscle strength is one of the main causes of reduced pain and disability. In the present
study, the reduction in pain and disability in the experimental group may be attributed to
increased quadriceps muscle strength and thereby improved stability, which leads to
reduction of pain and disability.</p><p>Moreover, the subjects of both groups received ultrasound therapy (UST) with an intensity
of 1.5 watts/cm<sup>2</sup> for 7 minutes in continuous mode at the tender point around the
knee joint prior to exercise. The reduction in soft tissue pain by UST could result from
increased blood flow to muscles in spasm or the rise in temperature causing relaxation of
muscle guarding. In a review of the effectiveness of UST in treating musculoskeletal
conditions, Falconer et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> found that
most reports indicate that therapeutic ultrasound appears to relieve OA pain. Further,
Centin N et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded in their
study that exercise and physical agents can reduce pain and improve function and health
status in patients with knee OA. Since pain and disability are interdependent, a reduction
in one will cause a reduction in the other. All three exercises, isometric quadriceps
exercise, straight leg raising, and isometric hip adduction, were necessary for the results
of this study to happen. It is recommended to see which one has more influence on the
increase in muscle strength in a future study. In conclusion, the 5-week of isometric
quadriceps exercise program for patients with knee OA showed beneficial effects on
quadriceps muscle strength, pain, and functional disability, but future parametric studies
are needed with larger subject numbers to confirm this finding.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud
