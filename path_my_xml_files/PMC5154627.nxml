Whether minimally invasive catheter evacuation followed by thrombolysis is safe and can achieve a good functional outcome by removing clot is unknown. We investigated safety and efficacy of alteplase with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P4">MISTIE was an international, randomized, open-label study and was done in 26 hospitals in the USA, Canada, the UK, and Germany. Patients (aged 18&#x02013;80 years), with non-traumatic (spontaneous) ICH &#x02265;20 mL were randomly allocated, centrally, to medical care or image-guided MIS plus rt-PA (0.3 mg or 1.0 mg every 8 hours for up to 9 doses) to remove clot using surgical aspiration followed with alteplase clot irrigation. The primary efficacy outcome was the adjusted dichotomized modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0&#x02013;3 vs 4&#x02013;6 assessed at day 180 after symptom onset. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Primary safety outcomes: mortality, symptomatic bleeding, brain infections, as well as withdrawal of care, did not differ between groups. Asymptomatic hemorrhages were more common in the surgical group (3 (7%) vs. 12 (22%) p= 0.05) producing a difference of 15.1% (95% CI: 1.5% to 28.6%). The estimated absolute benefit, i.e., the unadjusted difference in observed proportions of all subjects with mRS 0&#x02013;3 (33% vs 21%) at 180 days comparing MISPA vs. medical control, is 0.109 [95%CI: &#x02212;0.088, 0.294; p=0.26], and is 0.162 [95%CI: 0.003, 0.323; p=0.05] after adjustment for potential imbalances in baseline severity between study arms (primary efficacy outcome).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Interpretation</title><p id="P6">MIS+rt-PA appears safe with an apparent advantage of better functional outcome at 180 days.

The trial statistician employed a randomly generated number sequence to allocate patients to the surgical and medical groups. Patient allocation was stratified according to clot size with two schedules employed: one for ICH &#x02265;20 mL and &#x02264;40 mL; and one for ICH &#x0003e;40 mL as measured on the diagnostic CT. The trial had two pre-planned stages, which were managed by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB): a dose finding stage and a safety assessment stage. Stage one (dose finding) consisted of two doses (0.3mg and 1.0mg). A third dose, 3mg, was not investigated after a planned DSMB review. This decision decreased the sample size from 110 to 96 subjects. Subjects in stage 1 were randomized 3:1 to treatment (MIS plus the dose of rt-PA in that part) or medical management. In stage one only, blocks of 4 patients were employed within each randomization schedule to ensure a 3:1 assignment to treatment (MIS+rt-PA) versus control (medical management). After stage one enrollment and DSMB review were completed, a planned protocol amendment, occurred. This specified the use of alteplase at the selected 1 mg dose (based on safety profile and clot removal efficiency), use of a surgical oversight center (based on initial surgical performance) and addition of 365 day outcome assessments. This amendment was reviewed and approved by the DSMB and executive committee. Stage two remained stratified by size, used 1:1 randomization and evaluated the safety of treatment vs. medical management.</p><p id="P12">The first subject at every site was assigned to surgical management and served as a &#x0201c;credentialing subject&#x0201d; to document the surgeon&#x02019;s ability to perform the surgical protocol. Once a surgeon was credentialed, subsequent eligible patients were randomized to MIS+rt-PA or medical management (stage one: 3:1; stage two: 1:1). The assignments were not masked because of surgical assignment in the protocol. The number randomized in stage one was 29 to MIS+rt-PA and 17 to medical management; the corresponding numbers in stage two are 25 to MIS+rt-PA and 25 to medical management. Unlike stage one participants (followed up to 180 days), stage two participants were followed up for 365 days.

Six or more hours after the diagnostic CT, a stability CT was performed to ensure that the ICH clot had not expanded by &#x0003e;5 mL, providing image demonstration of a safe starting point for clot reduction therapy, defined as the absence of active bleeding before performing MIS+rt-PA. The CT could be repeated every six hours until the clot stabilized or just before the 48-hour eligibility window closed, whichever came first. In addition, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) or CT angiography (CTA) was required to rule out underlying pathology as the bleeding source; an angiogram was encouraged with equivocal findings on vascular pathology screening.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> An INR &#x02264;1.3, a normal aPTT, and BP stability were required prior to randomization.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> After a protocol amendment, planned catheter insertion trajectories describing the skull entry site and the planned linear path to the hematoma target were shared by the site with the trial&#x02019;s Surgical Center for joint review (stage two only).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>MIS Protocol</title><p id="P14">Individuals randomized to MIS+rt-PA were taken to the operating room and general anesthesia was induced. Image-guidance was used to place an introducer cannula within the middle two-thirds of the overall haematoma diameter, via a burr hole or twist drill opening. The introducer portion was then removed. Clot aspiration was performed using a 10 mL hand-held syringe until there was no longer any fluid component of the clot noted in the aspirate and/or until first resistance. A soft catheter was passed through a rigid, peel-away cannula into the residual haematoma, tunneled subcutaneously, and connected to a three-way stopcock and a closed drainage system. A postoperative CT was performed to confirm positioning of the soft catheter within, and stability of, the residual haematoma and catheter tract.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Thrombolysis Protocol</title><p id="P15">Three or more hours after catheter placement, intraclot rt-PA administrations of 0.3 mg in 1 mL or 1.0 mg in 1 mL were given every 8 hours, for up to 9 doses, or until a trial-defined surgical performance requirement was reached. All doses were followed by a 3 mL flush of preservative-free normal saline. After each assigned dose, the system was closed for 1 hour to allow drug-clot interaction, and then reopened to allow for gravitational drainage. Trial-defined surgical performance requirements were reduction of clot to either 20% of the volume measured on the stability CT prior to randomization, or to &#x02264; 15 mL, or occurrence of a clinically significant re-bleeding event, defined as a sustained drop of more than two points on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor score with CT-demonstrated ICH enlargement. CT scans were subsequently obtained every 24 hours until dosing was complete to evaluate safety and drainage.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Medical Treatment Protocol</title><p id="P16">All subjects were managed using the American Heart Association recommendations for the treatment of non-traumatic (spontaneous) ICH.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This allowed for a standard approach to monitoring patients&#x02019; airway, ventilation, intracranial pressure (ICP), sedation, and pharmacological treatment of intracranial mass effect.

Study enrollment for stage one took place from February 2, 2006 to August 2, 2009. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>). Stage two enrollments took place from December 21, 2009 through April 3, 2012, with the final follow-up visit occurring on April 8, 2013 after approval of the planned protocol amendment. The demographic characteristics of the randomized subjects are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Fifty-four subjects (stages one and two combined) were randomized to the intervention: eight (15%) achieved the surgical goal at the end of the surgical procedure (i.e., after aspiration and catheter placement, and 46 (85%) received rt-PA via the catheter to further reduce the haematoma size (MIS+rt-PA). Forty-two subjects (stages one and two combined plus 6 subjects from stage one endoscopy arm) were randomized to medical care. Delayed deterioration led to craniotomy in four medical and in two MIS+rt-PA subjects (post MIS procedure). Overall, event rates were below pre-specified safety thresholds and the primary safety profile of symptomatic events was similar for both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The entire surgical group had non-significantly more asymptomatic and significantly more total bleeding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival over 365 days demonstrated no adverse effect of MIS+rt-PA on survival (hazard ratio 1.32 (95% CI: 0.618, 2.82) log rank p=0.473); see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1 on page 13 in the Supplementary Appendix</xref>).

When we considered univariable (unadjusted) models, we found that pre-randomized ICH volume, age, enrollment NIHSS, the presence of any pre-randomization IVH, and the absolute clot volume remaining at the EOT were statistically significant; assignment to MIS+rt-PA resulted in a nonsignificant benefit (similar to the estimates in the ITT efficacy analysis above). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> shows the results of the multivariable logistic regression of good 180-day outcome on the aforementioned variables. After controlling for age, enrollment NIHSS, pre-randomized ICH volume and presence of IVH, and assignment to MIS+rt-PA, the absolute volume of clot remaining at the EOT is statistically significant. Specifically, the model predicts that with all other variables held constant, each 10 mL of additional clot remaining at the end of treatment is associated with a relative reduction in the odds of a good 180-day outcome by almost 50% (Adjusted Odds Ratio 0.496; [95%CI] 0.259, 0.949, p= 0.034).

However, increased asymptomatic bleeding is a major cautionary finding. MISTIE II is an important test of a very gentle approach to ICH evacuation, minimizing potential tissue injury inherent in craniotomy. It employs image guidance and a novel combination of surgery and drug treatment. The MISTIE II approach was reliably reproduced by surgeons new to the treatment concept but trained in the general principles. The surgical technique is a simple and logical extension of routine image guidance and intracerebral catheter placement. Where both pragmatic (craniotomy) and simple translational (factor VIIa) approaches have failed in trials, our results are promising and contrary to the belief that surgical manipulations to remove blood may damage brain tissue and impair long-term function.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Because supportive medical care is the only universally-accepted ICH treatment, these results are promising<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and consistent with trends from studies of convenience samples or at single sites.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We have demonstrated that MIS can be performed safely at multiple sites, that rt-PA can be combined with MIS safely, and that the MISTIE treatment, though different from current practice, can be adopted without difficulty at interested sites. Thus, MISTIE could be a promising approach to a worldwide health problem. If the apparent benefits of the MISTIE approach are replicable, the findings could lead to a change in treatment of ICH.</p><p id="P36">Several limitations are considered. This trial size is small and screening yield low (123 enrolled of 4103 screened). It was powered to observe relatively high safety thresholds (15% bleeding), not efficacy; thus, the range of estimated benefit in the ITT analysis is wide and the true benefit could be different. However, all known baseline severity factors (ICH size, IVH size, age, NIHSS, GCS and stability) were nearly balanced between arms. The point estimates in both adjusted ITT analyses are suggestive of a treatment benefit. Safety conclusions are similarly limited by sample size; the substantial difference in asymptomatic bleeding demonstrates that combining MIS and alteplase still has important risks.</p><p id="P37">We hypothesize that the effect of the MISTIE treatment on mRS outcome is mediated through clot volume reduction, although such a relationship cannot be assessed without a second trial. We considered potential confounders of the relation between clot-reduction and mRS outcomes, such as length of ICU care and use of ICP monitoring; these were similar in both treatment groups. Surgical bias could unknowingly account for good outcomes; however, the usual source of this problem&#x02014;selection of less severe subjects for surgery&#x02014;did not occur, as the randomized surgical subjects were slightly, but non-significantly, more impaired at baseline, and all subjects were consented without knowledge of surgical allocation, further limiting the possibility of surgical selection bias. A bias could also be that the population was not fully representative of the general population of ICH subjects and that the routine care that medical management subjects received may account for the surgical benefit by having selected a sicker subgroup. This is not likely, as the distribution of good and poor outcomes for the medical subjects is similar to that found in observations of other ICH populations. A bias in the amount of rehabilitation care a particular group received is also possible. Finally it remains possible that specialized skills, such as surgical skill or superior stroke center organizational resources produced the benefits rather than the MISTIE treatment, rendering the results not reproducible by a wider set of surgeons or centers. This seems unlikely, as the majority of the surgeons, although trained in image guidance and catheter placement, previously had not combined these skills to treat ICH. Similarly, attention to BP control in MISTIE is already a well-developed and standard approach in established stroke center protocols.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p id="P38">Our outcome data suggest that MIS+rt-PA has the potential to be efficacious where routine craniotomy has failed. Comparisons to existing trial data<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and meta-analysis data<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> are reassuring for the possible generalizability of these findings. Mortality was low and not different for medical or surgical subjects and was similar to STICH I &#x00026; II mortalities,<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> suggesting that the surgical procedure itself is low risk. This is in agreement with other MIS observations.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The low mortality may relate to the infrequent discontinuation of care. Interestingly, the deep ICHs that responded so poorly to invasive craniotomy in STICH I appear to have benefitted from MIS plus rt-PA.</p><p id="P39">Administration of rt-PA following MIS also appears safe in this small sample utilizing mortality and symptomatic bleeding as the main safety measures, but only if performed under MISTIE protocol conditions. Some rebleeding must be expected in ICH patients and with exposure to surgery and thrombolytic drug. The significantly increased occurrence of asymptomatic bleeding provides biologic plausibility for further safety evaluations. The combined use of imaging to define clot stability and BP control appears to have limited the frequency of symptomatic bleeding events in both arms of MISTIE and the absence of a symptomatic rebleeding difference between MIS+rt-PA and controls is a reassuring safety profile for a thrombolytic treatment approach; external monitoring and core imaging lab assessments for enlargement reinforce our confidence in this safety profile. However, the presence of higher frequencies for all bleeding categories in the treatment arm demonstrates that the possible benefits of MIS+rt-PA come with a clear potential bleeding risk that must be managed with clinical vigilance. A larger sample is needed to confirm that the current clinical vigilance (ICH stability, dose and BP control) is reproducible in the widest possible population. A phase 3 study would provide a better estimate of safety and particularly bleeding events.</p><p id="P40">The MISTIE approach targets two major sources of ICH morbidity: mass effect and inflammation. The functional outcomes in the treatment group are consistent with better tissue preservation<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and, when compared to the medical management group equally treated with ICH stabilization and BP control, reassuring for the potential to reproduce the result in other populations. The trial design was not able to differentiate whether better tissue preservation was attributable to mass-effect reduction or to removal of inflammation-provoking blood products; most likely both are important effects of clot reduction. Because removal took place over three to four days, it is likely that some degree of secondary injury from mass effect and inflammation occurs over days, not hours. If the MISTIE approach of minimal mechanical manipulation is to be employed the majority of subjects (85%) will require rt-PA irrigation to achieve large reductions of clot volume. Analysis of subgroups suggests the potential for benefit in a window of at least 48 hours. If the time window is this large, then MISTIE treatment could possibly be scheduled urgently rather than in an emergent manner. The model and subgroup findings represent hypothesis generating information such as time dependence of treatment and require independent confirmation. For example if much damage occurs by chemical means in the initial hours there could be additional benefit to very early removal or biochemical blockade of such events.</p><p id="P41">Testing the reproducibility of our results will require at least 500 subjects in a randomized trial; possibly more, if the estimate of therapeutic effect is falsely large or if the symptomatic bleeding risk is underestimated. A rigorous test should include stringent reproduction of the standard elements of the surgical and drug-administration tasks used in MISTIE II in a cohort of subjects recruited from the widest possible set of stroke hospitals utilizing image guidance, CT imaging, and BP control to treat ICH. Decreases (s) in treatment related bleeding events might benefit outcome. Testing generalisability will provide a better estimate of the number of treatment candidates. Safety and preliminary outcome data indicate that MIS+rt-PA is a realistic approach to ICH, possibly improving long-term function and the ability to live at home, and perhaps, decreasing cost, even for patients with large ICH volumes.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Panel: Research in Context</title><sec id="S31"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="P42">Minimally invasive surgery was reviewed in a recent meta-analysis by Zhou et al. This review of international databases, websites, and conference summaries such as Pubmed and the International Clinical Trials Registry were searched through December 2011 using the following key words: intracerebral, intracranial, cerebral, brain, putaminal, intraparenchymal, basal ganglia hemorrhage, thalamic, hemorrhagic stroke, hemorrhage, hematoma, minimally invasive, minimal surgical procedures, endoscopy, stereotaxy(ic), aspiration, keyhole, or craniopuncture. Inclusion criteria were nontraumatic (spontaneous) ICH diagnosed on a CT and randomized controlled trials with minimally invasive surgery compared to a control group. Exclusion criteria were traumatic brain injuries, infratentorial ICH, and studies with quality assessments less than 2 on the Cochrane criteria scale. An Egger test was conducted to check for publication bias for primary and secondary outcomes (P=0.377 and P=0.805 respectively).</p><p id="P43">We have thirty years of evidence that clinical injury from ICH is directly related to the size of the clot. Benefit from the obvious solution of reducing the clot size by mechanical means has been difficult to demonstrate. Now with the completion of STICH 1 &#x00026; 2, we have a strong indication that pragmatic use of open craniotomy does not produce the presumed benefits. Today, when caring for the millions of spontaneous ICHs that occur yearly, clinicians are faced with substantial class 1 evidence demonstrating no effect of routine craniotomy on the functional performance of subjects experiencing brain hemorrhage. STICH 1 also demonstrated that subjects with deep basal ganglia hematomas were particularly likely to experience a poor outcome, if they underwent craniotomy. These findings were consistent with samples from the general population and suggest, in a congruent manner, that an alternate approach to ICH be considered. Small studies have tested the idea that catheter-based, minimally invasive clot volume reduction can be performed without loss of life and that individual subjects experience improved outcome in increased proportion. Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with ICH, hyper acute craniotomy and deep location of ICH in particular, we chose to organize a two-stage test of the possibility that minimally invasive surgery, performed on stabilized subjects provides benefit from clot reduction without exposing patients to as much injury as was possibly occurring from open craniotomy. Further testing of this idea could include studies of the recovery process as well as larger trials.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="P44">To the best of our knowledge MISTIE II is the first rigorous study of brain MIS because it was a multisite study with a standardized surgical task designed to eliminate cortical incision, electrocautery, toxic exposure to thrombin and the attendant additional loss of deep brain tissue. The results provide evidence of safety of the MIS approach and identify the best dose of thrombolytic to be employed for clot volume reduction. It identifies that you cannot combine MIS and alteplase without increased incidence of asymptomatic bleeding. The need for meticulous management of bleeding risk is inherent in this finding. In addition, results produced an estimate of treatment effect that is substantial (&#x0003e;10% absolute benefit) and longstanding (one year). As such, these data provide novel safety, surgical performance and overall proof of concept for the hypothesis that MIS has robust potential as a unique intervention for intracerebral hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="P45">Although this manuscript focuses on the results of MISTIE II and the possible role of clot volume reduction as a mechanism of treatment, it is consistent, in a clearly defined prospective manner, with the external data from single site and meta-analysis of convenience samples. The data provide a sound basis to estimate a treatment effect and inform clinical goals for the surgical task of clot size reduction, if performed in the standard manner described (i.e., single tissue trajectory, small tissue cannula, minimal mechanical manipulation). The manuscript highlights the possibility that MIS is a technique with promise to mechanically reduce lesion size in all or many subjects and has the potential to directly alter the course of events set in motion by the presence of blood clot within brain tissue and treat a disease for which we have no therapy. Trials utilizing this approach will require well-defined management of bleeding risk and identification of relevance or not to amyloid vasculopathy. The time window for ICH trials remains broad as sub group analysis in MISTIE did not find benefit or detriment in the times observed. The precise role of clinical stability in patient selection is another subject for future trials. The findings have stimulated multiple smaller tests of parts of our MIS thought process with many variations of equipment and surgical technique. Sharing the full results of MISTIE II is likely to stimulate further investigations of a worldwide problem that is serious and growing. An investigator-initiated, publically sponsored NIH trial MISTIE 3 is underway to prospectively test the generalizability of the MISTIE 2 surgical task and medical stabilization protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label/><media xlink:href="NIHMS823825-supplement.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e773" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN3"><p id="P46" content-type="publisher-disclaimer">This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
