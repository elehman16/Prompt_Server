of the right and left erector spinae muscles in asymptomatic subjects and the effect of
lumbar stabilization exercises on these differences. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-six
participants (12 in the exercise group and 14 in the control group) with a difference in
the FRP in the right and left erector spinae muscles were recruited from among healthy
students attending Silla University. The exercise group performed two lumbar stabilization
exercises (back bridge exercise and hand-knee exercise) for 4 weeks. The control group did
not exercise. [Results] No significant group-by-exercise interaction was found. The right
and left erector spinae muscles did show a difference in FRP between the control and
exercise groups (119.2 &#x000b1; 69.2 and 131.1 &#x000b1; 85.2&#x02005;ms, respectively). In addition, the
exercise group showed a significant decrease in post-exercise (50.0 &#x000b1; 27.0&#x02005;ms) compared to
pre-exercise (112.3 &#x000b1; 41.5&#x02005;ms) differences in the right and left FRP. [Conclusion] These
results suggest that lumbar stabilization exercises may counter asymmetry of the FRP in
the erector spinae muscles, possibly preventing low back pain in the general
population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Flexion-relaxation phenomenon</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stabilization exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP) is the myoelectric silencing of a muscle during a
full-flexion maneuver<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FRP of the
erector spinae (ES) muscles shows silencing during upright to full-flexion lumbar movement
in asymptomatic subjects. The phenomenon involves the transfer of the role of the extension
moment producer to the deep back muscles to achieve spinal stability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with low back pain (LBP) exhibit laxity of passive
structures and an altered neuromuscular activation pattern in the back muscles, in which the
FRP of the ES muscles is not present. Thus, the FRP of ES muscles has been used to evaluate
LBP and to monitor intervention-related factors after treatment<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that FRP occurs with full lumbar flexion in the sagittal plane.
However, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects can produce asymmetric lumbar flexion by
lumbar flexion combined with lateral bending and axial rotation. Although most healthy
people do not have LBP, they have the potential for asymmetry in the FRP in the right and
left ES muscles due to repetitive movement and poor posture in their work environments or
daily activities. Ning et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that asymmetric lumbar flexion elicits a loss of the FRP in the ipsilateral muscle in
asymptomatic subjects. Although 90% of non-LBP subjects show FRP<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, many of them were at risk of LBP, because of asymmetry in
the FRP of the ES muscles.</p><p>Currently, LBP patients perform various deep muscle strengthening exercises for lumbar
tissue, with Pilates, sling exercises, and lumbar stabilization exercises being the most
common<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar stabilization exercises,
especially the back bridge and hand-knee position, are the most effective at strengthening
the multifidus muscle<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Marshall and
Murphy et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a 12-week
exercise program (side bridge, supine bridge, partial curl-up, bird-dog exercise, Swiss ball
push-up, single leg hold, and rollouts) decreased self-reported pain and ES muscle activity
during the relaxation phase of FRP tests in patients with chronic non-specific LBP. Lumbar
stabilization exercises elicit a reappearance of the FRP through strengthening of the
multifidus muscle, and eventually this could result in symmetry of the FRP in non-LBP
subjects with an asymmetric FRP of the ES muscles.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in the FRP in the right and left ES
muscles in asymptomatic subjects. In addition, the effects of lumbar stabilization exercises
on differences in the FRP of the right and left ES muscles were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Participants (<italic>n</italic>=30; average age, 19.8 &#x000b1; 1.1&#x02005;years; height, 164.5 &#x000b1; 7.4&#x02005;cm;
body mass, 57.54 &#x000b1; 7.20&#x02005;kg) were recruited from among the healthy student population of
Silla University. Participants were excluded from the study if they had a history of back
pain, vertebra surgery, or neuromuscular disorders. All participants provided their written
informed consent prior to participation. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the
ethics committee of Silla University.</p><p>To analyze the FRP of the ES muscles, surface electromyography (EMG) (MyoTrace 400; Noraxon
Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) was used with two bipolar surface EMG electrodes placed
bilaterally 2&#x02005;cm apart over the right and left L3 area. The collected surface EMG data were
analyzed using MyoResearch software (ver. 1.08 XP). The data were collected at 1,000&#x02005;Hz and
processed using a 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz band-pass filter and a 60-Hz notch filter. The root mean square
moving average of 300&#x02005;ms duration of the processed EMG data was calculated. The relaxation
time was defined as when ES activation decreased by two standard deviations (SD) of silence
activation in the fully flexed lumbar phase. The absolute value of the difference in
relaxation time measured in the right and left ES was calculated. The experiment was done in
triplicate and the calculations were based on the averages of the three trials. The subjects
were examined from upright to full-forward lumbar flexion. The position of the feet was
marked for consistency between trials. In all trials, the move from upright to full-forward
flexion (forward flexion phase) was performed over 3s, followed by 3s maintenance of full
flexion posture (fully flexed phase), and another 3&#x02005;s to move from full-forward flexion to
the upright posture (re-extension phase)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Participants were assigned randomly to the control or exercise group using a table of
random numbers. The control group did not exercise. The exercise group performed two
exercises that are commonly used in clinical practice and have been used in previous studies
(back bridge and hand-knee exercise). These exercises were performed 3 days per week with a
trainer and 2 days per week at home for 4 weeks. The exercises were done in three sets with
three repetitions per set and a set break of 3&#x02005;min. All exercises were performed on a mat.
Instructors provided feedback to ensure that a consistent supine and lower limb posture was
maintained during the exercise. For the back bridge exercise, the subjects lay supine on the
floor with their feet flat on the ground, their knees bent at 90&#x000b0;, their toes facing
forward, and their hands on the floor by their sides. With their palms facing down, the
subject raised the pelvis to achieve and maintain a neutral hip flexion angle. The subjects
were requested to raise the back bridge from the floor (stable condition) and hold the
posture for 1&#x02005;min. After the 1-min hold, the subject was given a 30-s break. For the
hand-knee exercise, the subjects started on their hands and knees with a neutral pelvis
position and breathing normally. They lifted and held straight the right arm and the left
leg before doing the same with the opposite set of limbs. The subjects held each position
for 40&#x02005;s with a 30-s break between positions.</p><p>SPSS software (ver. 18.0) was used to test the significance of differences between the
exercise and control groups and between pre- and post-exercise. A subject factor analysis
was used to assess the statistical significance of the FRP in the ES muscles with a repeated
two-way analysis of variance. The paired t-test was used to test the significance of
differences between the two groups&#x02019; characteristics. The results are expressed as means &#x000b1;
SD, and &#x003b1;=0.05 used set as the level of statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A difference was seen in the FRP between the right and left ES muscles in asymptomatic
subjects (control group 119.2 &#x000b1; 69.2&#x02005;ms and exercise group 131.1 &#x000b1; 85.2&#x02005;ms; p&#x0003e;0.05). No
significant group-by-exercise interaction was found (p&#x0003e;0.05). The exercise group showed a
significant decrease post-exercise (50.0 &#x000b1; 27.0&#x02005;ms) versus pre-exercise (112.3 &#x000b1; 41.5&#x02005;ms) in
the right and left FRP of the ES muscles (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, the healthy participants showed a difference in the right and left FRP in
the ES muscles. This lack of balance in the FRP is thought to result from repetitive
asymmetric posture and activity. Previous research has indicated there is an increased risk
of back pain when working in asymmetric positions<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Asymmetric postures produce passive spinal postural deconditioning
in the lumbar stabilizing muscles. Motor control deficits and motor dysfunction result in
increased passive system loading from repeated stress<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The students who participated in this experiment spent a great
deal of time at school in a sitting position. This does not produce LBP, but they exhibited
an asymmetric FRP in the right and left ES muscles. Callaghan<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a difference in activation between the right and left ES
in healthy subjects (right 15 and left 17 of 20 participants). Furthermore, the FRP was not
detected in 20% of healthy subjects. This indicates that asymptomatic people can have
impairment and imbalance in the FRP. When the students exhibited poor posture (e.g., sitting
cross-legged or one-leg weighted standing) they experienced no pain, but they demonstrated
potential factors for LBP.</p><p>The bridge exercise is a popular lumbar stabilization exercise that activates weak
abdominal muscles and prevents unstable lumbar spine movement via co-activation of the
pelvic floor muscles, diaphragm, and deep abdominal muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the Swiss ball exercise activates deep and
superficial abdominal muscles by using the characteristics of an unstable environment<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Marshall and Murphy<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that Swiss ball exercises increased the FRP (from
3.26 &#x000b1; 3.43 to 6.53 &#x000b1; 3.34) in LBP patients. In the present study, lumbar stabilization
exercises improved muscular balance by reducing asymmetry in FRP onset. Howarth et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that back muscle instability
caused by slumped sitting delayed the onset of the FRP. Likewise, the intervention used in
the present study was meaningful for trunk asymmetry and instability. At the onset of the
FRP, the external moment generated around the lower back by the upper body&#x02019;s mass is
counteracted by the net internal moment produced from the tensile forces developed in
elongated passive tissue, instead of the forces generated by the active component of the
lower back musculature<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, lumbar
stabilization exercises can improve the motor control of lumbar spinal movement and lumbar
stabilization control.</p><p>Among the various exercises used for lumbar stabilization, the sling and Swiss ball
exercises show the highest EMG activation values<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, this study used the back bridge and hand-knee exercises.
These two exercises do not need any special equipment or space, so they are more suited for
home-based exercise than sling or ball exercises. Additional studies are needed to measure
changes in the FRP in the ES muscles elicited by other lumbar stabilization exercises.</p><p>While further study is needed, the results of this study suggest that lumbar stabilization
exercises can help to correct asymmetry of the FRP in the right and left ES muscles and this
would help prevent LBP in the general population.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Floyd</surname><given-names>WF</given-names></name><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>PH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The function of the erectores spinae muscles in certain
