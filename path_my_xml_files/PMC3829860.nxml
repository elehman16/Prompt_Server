Every year, close to two million people in the US suffer TBI, which is the leading cause of death and disability among the general population. Stroke affects almost a million people and is the leading cause of inability to maintain independent life among adults <xref rid="pone.0079995-Coronado1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-FaulM1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. There is no effective treatment/metabolic intervention in the daily clinical practice for post TBI and stroke patients with chronic neurological dysfunction. Intensive therapy and rehabilitation programs are considered essential for maximizing quality of life but are often just partially successful. Clearly, new methods for brain repair should be examined in order to provide sustained relief to brain damage patients. Recent studies reported that hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) can induce neuroplasticity leading to significant neurological improvement in post-stroke patients at the convalescent stage and at late chronic stages, months to years after the acute event <xref rid="pone.0079995-Efrati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Definitions and classifications</title><p>Traumatic brain injury is defined as damage to the brain resulting from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, blast waves, or penetration by a projectile. Consequently to the injury, brain function is temporarily or permanently impaired and structural damage may or may not be detectable with current imaging technology. TBI is usually classified based on severity, anatomical features of the injury, and the cause of the injury. The severity is assessed according to the loss of consciousness (LOC) duration, the post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) grading of the level of consciousness. Approximately (70&#x02013;90%) of the TBI in the US are classified as mild TBI (mTBI) or concussion &#x02013; LOC duration of 0&#x02013;30 minutes, PTA duration of less than a day and GCS grade of 13&#x02013;15. Post concussion syndrome (PCS) is a set of symptoms succeeding mTBI in most patients. The PCS symptoms include headache, dizziness, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairments <xref rid="pone.0079995-Bazarian1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-McCauley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In most patients, PCS may continue for weeks or months, and up to 25% of the patients may experience prolonged PCS (PPCS) in which the symptoms last for over six months <xref rid="pone.0079995-Kashluba1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Iverson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Bohnen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Binder1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Bazarian2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Kushner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Such individuals are at high risk for emotional and cognitive dysfunction, culminating in inability to carry out ordinary daily activities, work responsibilities and standard social relationships <xref rid="pone.0079995-Bohnen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Binder1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Bazarian2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Kushner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Associated brain pathology and function impairments</title><p>Diffuse axonal injury - diffuse shearing of axonal pathways and small blood vessels - is one of the most common pathological feature associated with mTBI <xref rid="pone.0079995-Medana1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Another primary pathological feature, usually caused by a direct hit to the skull, is brain contusions, which commonly involve the frontal and anterior temporal lobes <xref rid="pone.0079995-Kushner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Secondary pathologies of mTBI include ischemia, mild edema, and other bio-chemical and inflammatory processes culminating in impaired regenerative/healing processes resulted from increasing tissue hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0079995-Kochanek1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Due to the diffuse nature of injury, cognitive impairments are usually the predominant symptoms, involving deficiencies in several cognitive functions, primarily memory, attention, processing speed, and executive functions, all localized in multiple brain areas. Their potent functions rely on potent network structure and connectivity between different brain areas <xref rid="pone.0079995-Kushner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Levin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Sohlberg1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We note that the diffuse nature of the mTBI injury renders the pathological damage hard to be detected by common neuroimaging methods such as CT and MRI so that diagnosis largely relies on subjective reports of the patients, as well as cognitive and quality of life tests. While diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has the potential to detect diffuse axonal injuries, this method is still not commonly used for diagnosis of mTBI pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Rationale for hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT)</title><p>The brain receives 15% of the cardiac output, consumes 20% of the total body oxygen, and utilizes 25% of the total body glucose. Still, this energy supply is only sufficient to keep about five to ten percent of the neurons active at any given time. Thus, at standard healthy condition, at any given time, the brain is utilizing almost all oxygen/energy delivered to it. The regeneration process after brain injury requires much additional energy. This is where hyperbaric oxygen treatment can help &#x02013; the increased oxygen level in the blood and body tissues during treatment <xref rid="pone.0079995-Niklas1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Reinert1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Calvert1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> can supply the energy needed for brain repair. Indeed, several previous studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of dissolved oxygen by HBOT can have several reparative effects on damaged brain tissues <xref rid="pone.0079995-Efrati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Calvert1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Neubauer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Golden1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Rockswold1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Other studies revealed the beneficial effect of HBOT on the injured brain and cognitive function in animal models <xref rid="pone.0079995-Palzur1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Harch1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Vlodavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Palzur2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Daugherty1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The elevated oxygen levels can have a significant effect on the brain metabolism, largely regulated by the glial cells (see discussion). Improved energy management leads to multifaceted repair, including activation of angiogenesis and triggering of neuroplasticity (reactivation of quiescent neurons; creation of new synapses and new axonal connections), and might even induce differentiation of neuronal stem cells <xref rid="pone.0079995-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The idea that HBOT can promote brain repair is reasonable and has gained experimental support, yet is still largely dismissed by the medical community as is discussed next.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>The medical community reservations</title><p>A study of the effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment of severe brain injured patients has been published already two decades ago. Several prospective clinical trials on treatment of mTBI have been published in the last decade <xref rid="pone.0079995-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Golden2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Rockswold2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and three studies published in the last two years addressed the effect of HBOT on chronic mild TBI patients <xref rid="pone.0079995-Harch2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Cifu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, the reported beneficial effects of the hyperbaric treatment were severely questioned by the medical community and triggered high skepticisms to the extent that TBI and stroke patients in the US are rarely treated by hyperbaric oxygen. The HBOT option has been dismissed by the medical community on the grounds of: 1. Lack of knowledge about the connection between metabolism and neuroplasticity. 2. Lack of randomized clinical trial with standard placebo control. 3. Sham control with room air at 1.3Atm yielded significant improvements. These issues are clarified and elaborated on in the discussion section.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>The placebo dilemma</title><p>People can sense a pressure increase beyond 1.3Atm, hence standard placebo, with normal air pressure, for HBOT could perhaps be attained by exposing the patients to normal pressure combined with falsifying stimulation (e.g., by increasing and decreasing the pressure), which generates a fictitious pressure sensation. Since breathing normal air under hyperbaric conditions leads to elevated tissue oxygen (e.g., about 50% for 1.3Atm), standard placebo could also be attained by giving the patients compressed air with sub-normal oxygen concentration. In the discussion section we explain that the first approach can be effective only for some patients and poses logistic difficulties and the second approach involves ethical issues. In an attempt to evade the placebo dilemma, a recent study of HBOT for mTBI compared the effect of 100% oxygen at 2.4Atm with the effect of room air at 1.3Atm as sham control <xref rid="pone.0079995-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The study found significant improvements in both groups and with slightly higher efficacy at 1.3Atm. Based on these results, the authors resented a sweeping conclusion that their study shows that HBOT has no effect on post mTBI brain damage and the observed improvements resulted from placebo associated with spending time in the hyperbaric chamber. As is discussed in great details in the discussion section, we reason that the authors reached wrong conclusions for two main reasons. First, room air at 1.3Atm cannot serve as a proper sham-control since it is not an &#x0201c;ineffectual treatment&#x0201d; (as is required from placebo) since it leads to a significant increase in the level of tissue oxygenation which has been shown to be effective <xref rid="pone.0079995-Collet1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-James1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Second, 100% oxygen at 2.4Atm leads to too high oxygen levels which can cause inhibitory effect or even focal toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s1f"><title>The crossover approach</title><p>To overcome the placebo issue, a randomized crossover approach was successfully used to test the effect of HBOT in post-stroke patients at late chronic stage <xref rid="pone.0079995-Efrati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The advantage of the crossover approach is the triple comparison &#x02013; between treatments of two groups, between treatment and no treatment of the same group, and between treatment and no treatment in different groups. Up till now, a similar prospective, randomized, crossover trial to evaluate the brain repair effect of HBOT in mTBI patients at late chronic stage has not been done.</p><p>

In the first phase, patients choose a colored square matching the color of a general word (for example, the word &#x0201c;Cat&#x0201d; appears in red letters, the patient must choose the red square out of two colored squares in the following screen). In the next phase (termed the Choice Reaction Time test), the task is to choose the colored square matching the name of the color presented in white letter&#x02013;color. In the final (Stroop interference) phase, patients are asked to choose the colored square matching the color and not the meaning of a former color-naming word, presented in an incongruent color (for example, the word &#x0201c;RED&#x0201d; appears in green letters, the patient is asked to choose the color green and not red, a task requiring the ability to inhibit an automatic response to the meaning of the word).</p><p>

Timed test requiring a reaction based on solving simple arithmetic problems (pressing right/left mouse button if the answer higher/lower than 4, respectively) with three levels of information processing load (single digit, two digits addition/subtraction and three digits addition/subtraction problems), each containing three speed levels (3, 2, and 1 second for the presentation of the stimuli).</p><p>

<bold><italic>Catch game</italic></bold>. A test of motor planning that requires participants to catch a falling object on a computer screen by moving a paddle horizontally so that it can &#x0201c;catch&#x0201d; the falling object.</p><p>To assign scores, Mindstreams data was uploaded to the NeuroTrax central server. Outcome parameters were calculated using custom software blind to diagnosis or testing site. To minimize differences related to age and education, each outcome parameter was normalized and fit to an IQ-like scale (mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;100, STD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) according to patient's age and education. We note that the score evaluation was based on normative data from cognitively healthy individuals collected in controlled research studies that were part of more than 10 clinical sites <xref rid="pone.0079995-Doniger2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>The cognitive indices&#x02019; scores</title><p>The computation of the cognitive indices based on the scores of the cognitive tests was done as follows: 1. Information Processing Speed index was computed as the combined score for the low and medium-load stages of the staged information processing test. 2. Attention index was calculated as the mean score of reaction time for Go&#x02013;No-Go test and choice reaction time of the Stroop test (at second phase), mean STD of reaction time for Go&#x02013;No-Go test, mean reaction time for a low-load stage of staged information processing test and mean accuracy for a medium-load stage of information processing test. 3. Memory index was computed as the mean score for total learning score (after four repetitions) and delayed recognition phase of verbal and non-verbal memory tests. 4. Executive Functions index was computed based on the scores of the Stroop test and the Go&#x02013;No-Go test and the mean weighted accuracy for catch game.

In addition, we defined the individual's General Cognitive Score as the average of the scores of the four cognitive indices for each individual.</p><p>It is important to note that the above cognitive index scores were specifically designed to represent known impaired cognitive domains in mild TBI. In addition, the fact that each index is referred to more than one test-score ensures the index to be associated more with a cognitive domain score and less with a test-dependent score. We also utilized a computerized testing battery which supports the inclusion of more accurate measures such as reaction time and elimination of the bias effect of tests' administration and hand scoring. An important aspect of the tests is the inclusion of the cognitive domain of information processing speed, known to be impaired in mild TBI patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Quality of life evaluation</title><p>Quality of life (QOL) was evaluated by the EQ-5D questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0079995-Rabin1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

In addition volume rendered brain perfusion images normalized to cerebellum maximal activity were reconstructed. All SPECT analysis was done while blinded to the laboratory and clinical data.

For example, &#x0003c;SF<sub>j</sub>&#x0003e; means the average of SF<sub>j</sub> over all patients (j) that belong to the group.

For that we calculated, for each patient (i), the normalized relative change NRC(i). Next, we calculated for each group (control and HBOT in the crossover group and HBOT in the treated group) the locations of the mean departures from baseline. Finally, we marked the location of each patient (i) at a distance NRC(i) from the location of his/her group's mean difference (see methods section for details). Typical results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079995-g005">Figure 5</xref>. More specifically, we show the scatter plots for Information Processing Speed vs. Executive Functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079995-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), for Attention vs. Memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079995-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), for Attention vs. General cognitive score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079995-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), and for IPS vs. General cognitive score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079995-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The results illustrate the differences between the three cases (control and HBOT for the crossover group, and HBOT for the treated group) which form three distinct clusters. Also clear in all the figures is the linear dependence between the changes in the different cognitive indices (similar results are also obtained for the other combinations, e.g. Memory-IPS, Attention-IPS, Memory-EF and Attention-EF). Interestingly, the scattering of the individual patients also follows the linear line for the scatter plots of the specific cognitive indices as function of the general cognitive score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079995-g005">Figures 5C and 5D</xref>). These linear dependences demonstrate high consistency between the changes of the different cognitive indices for each patient.

A drawback to the above-mentioned findings is that the different effects have been tested at different experimental setups and while utilizing different protocols of HBOT. However, it is well noticed that there is at least one common denominator to all repair/regeneration mechanisms: they are all energy/oxygen dependent. It might be possible that HBOT enables the metabolic change simply by supplying the missing energy/oxygen needed for those regeneration processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Rationale for testing the HBOT effect on patients at late chronic stage</title><p>As stated in the introduction, the crossover approach is adopted in order to avoid the inherent difficulties associated with randomized HBOT trial while practicing standard placebo (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079995.s005">Text S1</xref>). The placebo dilemma and the rationale for a crossover approach are further discussed below following the rationale to selecting patients at late chronic stage. First, as explained in <xref rid="pone.0079995-Efrati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, applying hyperbaric oxygen in the acute or early phase after brain injury makes it almost impossible to signify and assess the HBOT effects vs. the effects of the spontaneous natural repair mechanism that are effective at this stage. Moreover, in some patients the elevated oxygen can inhibit natural regeneration or even cause toxicity. In <xref rid="pone.0079995-Efrati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> it was proposed that this might explain the contradictive results in studies using HBOT at early stage after stroke <xref rid="pone.0079995-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Nighoghossian1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Rusyniak1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. One can assume that any added energy during the degenerative stage, immediately after brain injury, could further increase the unwanted, post-injury damage. On the other hand, elevated oxygen supply during the regenerative stage would supply the energy needs for the innate brain repair processes. Second, as also explained in <xref rid="pone.0079995-Efrati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, patients at the chronic late stage demonstrate neurological stability with low probability of spontaneous changes unrelated to treatment. Third, typically, patients at this stage, years after injury, have already gone through rehabilitation programs. These programs, which attempt to attend mainly to the cognitive dysfunction following the injury, are commonly based on behavioral compensation methods (such as attention training drills, teaching memory, planning strategies and usage of external aids <xref rid="pone.0079995-Sohlberg1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Glisky1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, and have limited patient-specific success in repair of mTBI impaired brain function <xref rid="pone.0079995-deFrias1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Therefore, studies at the late chronic stage allow assessment of the power of the HBOT approach to achieve brain function improvements in addition to, rather than instead of, the standard rehabilitation programs.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>The placebo dilemma and debate</title><p>There are inherent ethical and logistic difficulties in handling the sham control in HBOT trial according to the standard placebo definition: &#x0201c;<italic>Medically ineffectual treatment for medical conditions intended to deceive the recipient from knowing which treatment is given</italic>&#x0201d;. First, the minimal pressure for the patients to sense pressure increase is 1.3Atm. Second, breathing regular air under hyperbaric conditions of 1.3Atm leads to more than 50% elevation in tissue oxygenation. There are many case reports illustrating significant effects due to small increases in air pressure, including effects on the brain <xref rid="pone.0079995-James1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Golding1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Austin1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Mychaskiw1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Moreover, even a slight increase in partial pressure, such as to 1.05 ATM at altitude 402 m below sea level (the Dead Sea), can lead to noticeable physiological effects <xref rid="pone.0079995-Goldbart1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Kramer1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Falk1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Abinader1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079995-Gabizon1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Since 50% elevation in tissue oxygen can have significant physiological effects, treatment with room air at 1.3Atm is not an &#x0201c;ineffectual treatment&#x0201d; as is required from a proper sham control. Yet, a recent randomized, controlled trial on mTBI patients by Wolf et al <xref rid="pone.0079995-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, used room air at 1.3Atm as sham control for treatment with 100% oxygen at 2.4Atm. Both groups revealed significant improvements in cognitive symptoms and in the measure of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We find these results very important: they actually demonstrate that the significantly less expensive and logistically simpler treatment of mTBI patients with mild HBNO2 (mild hyperbaric pressure of 1.3Atm and regular air) can lead to meaningful improvements. Our interpretation is based on previous studies demonstrating that mild HBNO2 conditions can be effectual treatment. The authors of that study presented a very different interpretation. Overlooking the fact that mild HBNO2 can be an effectual treatment, they regarded it as sham control and concluded that the observed improvements must be due to placebo, and that HBOT has no therapeutic effect on mTBI patients. In other words, they implicitly assumed that bringing the patients many times to spend long duration in the hyperbaric chamber can trigger such a powerful placebo effect that it can lead to a significant repair of chronic brain damage due to mTBI. Remembering that for mTBI patients (with intact macro vascular bed), breathing 100% oxygen at 2.4ATA generate very high oxygen levels in tissues, which can cause an inhibitory effect or even focal toxicity, it is conceivable that HBOT using 2.4 ATA can be less effective than 1.3 ATA or other lower levels of pressure <xref rid="pone.0079995-MychaskiwIi1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Future studies are needed to test this issue by evaluating the specific dose response in post mTBI patients.</p><p>A potential way to comply with standard placebo could be to expose the patients to normal pressure combined with falsifying stimulations (e.g., by increasing and decreasing the pressure), which generates a fictitious pressure sensation. This approach poses non trivial logistic difficulties. Some patients, especially in long-term repeated treatments, can detect pressure fluctuations. Another potential way to avoid the increase in tissue oxygen at 1.3Atm in order to attain a standard placebo is to let the patients breath air with lower than normal oxygen level. Obviously, this is an unsuitable approach, as it involves ethical issues and leaves an open question with regards to the pressure effect. Nevertheless, Cifu et al <xref rid="pone.0079995-Cifu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> conducted a randomized blinded clinical study in which 2.0 ATA with 10.5% oxygen was used as the sham control. More specifically, the patients were at 2.0 ATA but were randomly assigned to one of three groups breathing either 10.5%, 75% or 100% oxygen to mimic normal air at 1.0 ATA, 100% air at 1.5 ATA and 100% air at 2.0 ATA, respectively. The authors concluded that: &#x0201c;This study demonstrated that HBO2 at either 1.5 or 2.0 ATA equivalent had no effect on post-concussion symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury when compared with sham compression&#x0201d;. Unfortunately, the HBOT effect in this study was assessed merely based on the self-administered Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) which is known to display several flaws in implementation and in its ability to accurately reflect test-taker experience. Moreover, interpretation and accuracy of the RPQ can vary widely due to self-administration and the various confounding variables involved <xref rid="pone.0079995-Potter1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Put aside this weakness, the study suffers from a logical flaw: The authors mention that their study was motivated by the results of Wolf et al. <xref rid="pone.0079995-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and they accepted the interpretation that any observed improvements should be a reflection of placebo effect and have nothing to do with the HBOT. If indeed, placebo can be so powerful in mTBI patients, one would expect that stress related to the idea of breathing half the normal level of air may trigger powerful negative placebo effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Rationale for the crossover approach</title><p>In the current study we tested the effect of 1.5 ATA using the crossover approach. As stated in the introduction, the approach is adopted in order to avoid the inherent difficulties associated with conducting HBOT trial while practicing standard placebo. The crossover approach involves two groups &#x02013; a treated group in which the patients went through two months of 40 HBOT sessions, and a crossover group in which the patients first went through two month of no treatment followed by two months of HBOT sessions. The advantage of the crossover approach is the triple comparison &#x02013; between treatments of two groups, between treatment and no treatment of the same group and between treatment and no treatment in different groups (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079995.s005">Text S1</xref>). For both groups, the HBOT sessions induced statistically significant improvement in cognitive functions (according to four cognitive indices: Information Processing Speed, Attention, Memory and Executive functions), in brain activity (according to SPECT imaging) and in quality of life (according to the EQ-5D and the EQ-VAS scores), compared to the control period of the crossover group. To gain better validity of the results, we used the scatter plot analysis of the changes of the cognitive indices in terms of the corresponding scaled relative changes. The scatter plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079995-g005">figure 5</xref>) show correlations in the improvements of the different indices both for the group means and the individual patients. The good correspondence between the improvements in the cognitive indices, the quality of life scores and the elevated brain activity as revealed by the SPECT imaging, which was done in a completely blinded fashion, further substantiates the clinical findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Implications</title><p>Combined with previous studies of the HBOT effects on TBI and CVA patients, the results presented here show that treatment with hyperbaric oxygen can significantly repair the chronically impaired brain functions and dramatically improve the quality of life of these patients. Yet, HBOT did not become a common acceptable treatment for TBI and CVA, largely because of the debate regarding the placebo issue and the optimal time for administration. Additional larger scale clinical studies are required to asses if and to what extent placebo effects might be operative. However, since the improvements are significant with no significant side effects, it seems reasonable to let patients benefit from HBOT now rather than wait until future studies are completed.</p><p>We foresee that the future oxygen-pressure dose-response studies, described in the discussion section, will have significant therapeutic implications. In particular, we expect that HBOT treatment with room air at 1.3ATA will have significant brain repair effects, and its effect should be compared with the 1.5ATA protocol used in this study.</p><p>In the current study, the HBOT effects were assessed shortly after treatment ended. Future follow-up studies are needed in order to investigate the durability of the effect. It might be that some patients will need more than 40 HBOT sessions. The issue of how to optimize patient-specific protocol is important subject for future research.</p><p>
<bold>In conclusion</bold>, this study provides, for the first time, convincing results based on a crossover study, demonstrating that HBOT can induce neuroplasticity and significant brain function improvements in mild TBI patients with prolonged Post-Concussion-Syndrome at late chronic stage, years after injury. The results call for better understanding of how to set the optimal HBOT protocol for the specific patients and how to determine which patients benefit the most from this treatment. The findings reported here bear the promises that HBOT can be effective in treating other brain impairments, like easing PTSD symptoms or repairing radiation damage. It is also reasonable to expect that HBOT can help slow down or even reverse metabolic disorders associated neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0079995.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
