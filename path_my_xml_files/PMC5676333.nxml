It has shown to have many beneficial effects on our oral health. Different types of teas are manufactured, and each has shown to have a positive effect on the teeth. White tea goes well with healthy white teeth and gums.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>White tea, green tea, and black tea originate from the plant <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] White tea has a light taste and color. The origin of white tea is mostly from Fujian Province of China and is the least processed form of tea with least amount of caffeine as compared to black and green tea.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>White tea retains its nutrients since the processing temperature is low compared to processing temperature of other two teas. The ingredients of white tea are alanine, histidine, aspartic acid, threonine, glutamic acid, and amino acids.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The most important ingredients in white tea are rich in polyphenols, which is a natural antioxidant.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>There have been studies in the past which have shown that white tea has a major health benefit, it can kill bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the body with more success than other teas.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] White tea contains a number of polyphenolic compounds which have a wide spectrum of antioxidant, antiviral, anticancer, antitoxoplasmal, antihelmintic properties (Almajano, Carbo and Gordon 2008).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>It lowers cholesterol, reduces blood pressure, and fights fatigue.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] White tea also contains fluoride, tannins, and flavonoids.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Fluorides help to reduce caries.</p><p>Not much research has been done on the efficacy of white tea as an antiplaque agent. Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of white tea as mouthwash in comparison with the gold standard, i.e., chlorhexidine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> study design</title><p>The current clinical trial was a double-blinded, randomized, parallel, longitudinal study. Forty-five periodontally healthy subjects (11 males and 34 females) between the age group of 21 to 23 years (mean age 22 years) were enrolled in the 4-day rinsing study. Mouthwashes were labeled as A, B, and C by one examiner and another examiner (blinded) conducted the study.</p><p>Mouthwash A (test) was a white tea extract mouthwash; mouthwash B (placebo control) was a placebo that constituted distilled water, and mouthwash C (positive control) was a commercially available 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash (ICPA Health Care Products, Ankleshwar, Gujarat).</p><p>For mouthwash A, white tea extract powder (Changsha Nutra-Y Biotechnology, Hunan, China) was used. The solubility of the mouthwash was 1 mg/100 ml of water. It was dissolved in distilled water for an effective concentration of 1%.</p><p>Subjects with good systemic health with at least 24 scorable teeth (not including third molars or crowned teeth) were included in the study. Subjects who consumed a high polyphenolic diet (including green tea or soya diet), wore appliances, or prostheses (fixed or removable) were prescribed antibiotics or other medications in the previous 3 months or had undergone treatment for periodontal problems were excluded from the study. Subjects having diseases that would increase oxidative stress such as diabetics and subjects not cooperating with the study protocol were excluded from the study.</p><p>Forty-five students, studying in Terna Dental College, Nerul, Navi Mumbai, India, who complied inclusion criteria, were selected. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the same institution and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and principles of good clinical practice.</p><p>The subjects were randomly assigned into three equal groups Group A, B, and C (15 subjects per group).</p><p>At baseline, thorough oral prophylaxis was done for all the subjects by the investigator. Plaque was disclosed using Two Tone Plaque Disclosing Agent (Dento Plac, India) to ensure that all deposits had been removed. Subjects were told not to use toothbrushes, toothpaste, or any other interdental cleaning aid or chewing gum for the next 4 days. Instead, subjects were asked to use one of the assigned mouthwash two times a day.</p><p>At a particular specified time during the day, all subjects were instructed to rinse two times a day for 1 min with 10 mL of the randomly allocated rinse. At each rinsing, 10 mL of the solution was swished around the mouth for about 60 s and then expectorated. On day 5, the subjects were recalled; plaque index (PI; Turesky <italic>et al</italic>. modification of Quigley PI) was recorded, and subjects were allowed to resume their routine oral hygiene regimens.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Data collection</title><p>The amount of plaque was checked on days 0 and day 5.

White tea mouthwash was compared with distilled water and 0.2% chlorhexidine solution. The study design (4-day plaque regrowth study) has been used in many studies and is a standard method for testing the plaque-reducing effect.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The advantage of a 4-day plaque regrowth study design is that it eliminates the effect of the adjunctive mechanical oral hygiene techniques because they are not permitted during the trial period.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In all the groups, PI showed statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) increase from baseline to day 5. The present study showed significant and comparable reduction in PI in the white tea and chlorhexidine group as compared to the distilled water (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). White tea mouthrinse was found to be a potent antiplaque agent, though less efficacious than chlorhexidine mouthrinse. Postoperative mouthrinse of white tea and chlorhexidine are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, respectively.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Postoperative white tea mouthrinse patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-514-g003"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Postoperative chlorhexidine mouthrinse patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-514-g004"/></fig><p>Probably, it can serve as a long-term herbal antiplaque agent in maintenance phase or as an alternative for the patients looking for herbal products mouthrinse, or for the patients who complaint of side-effects due to chlorhexidine mouthrinse.</p><p>One of the shortcomings of this study is the smaller sample size. At the end of the study, no adverse effects of the white tea mouthwash were seen in any of the subjects. The duration of the study was short (4 days) as the plaque regrowth model was used. Therefore, the antigingivitis efficacy of the white tea extract mouthwash was not tested. More studies using a longer duration, larger sample size and a cross-over model can be performed for further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>White tea mouthrinse was found to be a potent antiplaque agent although less efficacious than chlorhexidine mouthrinse. It can serve as a good alternative for the patients who prefer herbal products, which have practically no side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and
