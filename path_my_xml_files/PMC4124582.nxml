A randomized, single-blind, crossover study with three treatment sequences was used. Thirty patients with persistent AR received the three treatments using a nasal spray twice daily for 30 days and were evaluated by an NPT with histamine before and after each period of treatment. The treatment comparison, assessed by the nasal responsiveness to histamine, was monitored based on subjective (symptom score) and objective parameters (acoustic rhinometry). The minimal cross-area 2 (MCA2) was measured by acoustic rhinometry at 1, 4, 8, and 12 minutes after NPT for each histamine concentration administered (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mg/mL) up to at least a 20% reduction in the MCA2 from baseline (NPT<sub>20</sub>). The subjects were scored regarding nasal response encompassing histamine dose and time after histamine administration that caused nasal obstruction (NPT<sub>20</sub> score) to assess the treatments' effects. Combination therapy produced a significant increase in baseline MCA2, <italic>viz.</italic>, the improvement of nasal patency (p = 0.005). The symptoms score was significantly decreased after treatment with AZE (p = 0.03), BUD (p &#x0003c; 0.0001), and AZE/BUD (p &#x0003c; 0.0001), compared with pretreatment. The NPT<sub>20</sub> score was significantly higher (p = 0.0009) after AZE/BUD, compared with AZE and BUD on their own. Thus, AZE therapy combined with BUD might provide more therapeutic benefits than the isolated drugs for improving nasal patency.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acoustic rhinometry</kwd><kwd>allergic rhinitis</kwd><kwd>azelastine</kwd><kwd>budesonide</kwd><kwd>histamine</kwd><kwd>intranasal drug</kwd><kwd>nasal obstruction</kwd><kwd>nasal patency</kwd><kwd>nasal provocation test</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Pharmacologic treatment for allergic rhinitis (AR) includes intranasal and oral antihistamines, intranasal and oral glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, cromones, ipratropium bromide, decongestants, subcutaneous-specific immunotherapy, and intranasal allergen-specific immunotherapy. Therapy guidelines for AR recommend new-generation oral H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids as the main treatment.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Antihistamines control the symptoms of AR with a rapid onset of effects.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The effects of H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines include decreased eosinophilic and neutrophilic cell infiltration, decreased eosinophil cationic protein levels, and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in nasal lavages after allergen challenge and inhibition of the allergen-induced release of mast cell mediators, histamine, and tryptase from the nasal mucosa.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In addition to its antihistamine and antiallergic effects, azelastine (AZE) has anti-inflammatory properties. It reduces the inflammatory mediator levels, including nasal eosinophil cationic protein, tryptase, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Intranasal AZE therapy decreases sneezing and nasal secretions and improves the baseline symptom scores after histamine nasal challenge.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Intranasal corticosteroids are the most effective medication class for controlling the symptoms of AR.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Corticosteroids reduce the transcription factors that regulate gene expression, preventing several events associated with inflammatory cell recruitment and activation.

These studies<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> used a symptom score and quality-of-life questionnaire to evaluate the drug efficiency and verified that combined therapy had a better effect than drug monotherapy.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Drug effectiveness can be assessed by using the nasal challenge protocol, which provides convenient access to the application of appropriate agents in the nasal chamber.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The nasal provocation test (NPT) is a standardized method<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> used to diagnose suspected allergies and a useful tool for studying the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in allergic inflammation. In this test, reactions are observed in response to potential allergens or to histamine placed in the nasal cavity. Among other symptoms, sneezing, nasal secretion, itchiness, lacrimation, and swelling of the nasal mucosa are considered indications of an inflammatory reaction.</p><p>Ordinarily, objective methods that monitor nasal patency include rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry. These techniques have been validated and are standardized for clinical use in Europe and scientific research in the United States.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Acoustic rhinometry measures cross-sectional areas and the volume of the nasal cavity to objectively define the structure of the nasal passage. Several topographical measurements of acoustic rhinometry have been described, such as minimal cross-sectional area (MCA), nasal volume, and distance between the nostril and nasopharynx in rhinograms. The second notch in the rhinogram, MCA 2 (MCA2), represents the anterior portions of the inferior turbinate or middle turbinate.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of intranasal therapy with AZE and budesonide (BUD; isolated and combined) using NPT and acoustic rhinometry in patients with AR.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Subjects</title><p>Fifty patients were recruited from the University Hospital, University of Campinas, Brazil, with a history of at least 2 years of persistent rhinitis presenting significant current clinical rhinitis symptomatology.

Histamine is a good marker of the nasal vasomotor response and neuroreflex as it acts both directly at the mucosal level and through nervous reflexes on vessels and glands, producing sneezing, itching of the nose, mucosal edema and, consequently, nasal congestion.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> We used a model of NPT with histamine to mimic the alterations found in atopic hypersensitivity, modifying the nasal compartment in a transitory manner to investigate the effects of treatments.</p><p>The method to objectively evaluate nasal patency used in this study is reproducible, noninvasive, fast, easy, and low cost. In addition, the procedure provides the identification of changes in the anatomic structures of the nasal cavity immediately after stimulus. Acoustic rhinometry can determine changes in the nasal chamber by measuring cross-sectional areas in the nasal cavity.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The MCA2 analysis before the nasal challenge, considering pre- and posttreatment, shows that AZE was unable to improve nasal obstruction. In contrast to AZE, the analysis of the effects of BUD and AZE/BUD treatment showed a significant improvement in MCA2. However, AZE/BUD provided better results, improving nasal patency with a higher MCA2 than BUD. This result suggests that drug association decreases the time latency for nasal protection in a more efficient manner than AZE or BUD on their own.</p><p>On the other hand, after nasal challenge, the patients treated with BUD (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) showed a lower reduction in nasal patency than patients treated with AZE. The MCA2 data from patients treated with AZE/BUD confirm the favorable effect of this drug association. The nasal response to NPT was much lower (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) than that observed for BUD treatment. These results corroborate the hypothesis that the combination of these drugs is better than monotherapy for the control of nasal obstruction.</p><p>NPTs may induce immediate and/or late responses. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology recommend monitoring the nasal response at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes poststimulus.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Our data were analyzed considering the nasal patency from the 1st minute after histamine nasal administration until 64 minutes poststimulus, with regard to the nasal response. This method allowed the characterization of the onset of action and also the maintenance of the effect of drugs on nasal patency under nasal provocation. The NPT<sub>20</sub> score was used to compare two variables before and after treatments&#x02014;time and histamine dose necessary to achieve NPT<sub>20</sub>. These variables are nasal patency markers and are relevant in studies where drugs with different onsets of action are associated. As previously mentioned, AZE has a fast onset of action, whereas BUD requires extended use to reach peak efficacy. The effects of the drugs combined significantly increased the time and histamine dose necessary to achieve NPT<sub>20</sub>, requiring a higher histamine dose and prolonged time to obtain nasal obstruction after treatment.</p><p>This study shows the benefits of combined therapy for reducing nasal obstruction, where there is an objective evaluation of the changes of nasal patency after treatment. The advantage of the combined treatment derives from the addition of complementary effects of two known distinct mechanisms of action. In addition to H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonism, pharmacodynamic studies of AZE have shown a variety of anti-inflammatory properties, such as histamine release from mast cells and inhibition of leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 synthesis and release.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The combination of antihistamines and the anti-inflammatory effect of AZE with the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroid provides greater efficacy in the treatment of AR. Moreover, our results contribute to an alternative model for pharmacodynamic studies, rather than the use of large clinical trials, using a reduced number of patients and lower costs. Furthermore, we are proposing a new approach to evaluate the effects of nasal provocation considering the time and histamine dose administered.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Funded by the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare pertaining to this article</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Natalia C Fabbri, PhD was a fellow from National Council of Scientific and Technological Development.
