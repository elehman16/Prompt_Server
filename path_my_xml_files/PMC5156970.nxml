ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and alteration in bowel habits.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although there are some hypotheses about the pathophysiology of IBS, the exact cause has remained unclear[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and there is no organic or structural cause which can explain IBS symptoms.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The most accepted diagnostic criteria for IBS is the Rome criteria.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>As well as other parts of the world, IBS is one of the most common conditions which causes patients to refer to gastrointestinal clinics in Iran.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] According to a systematic review in Iran, IBS prevalence is in the range of 1.1&#x02013;25%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The prevalence of IBS with diarrhea is approximately 3% among the general population in the UK[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and ranged from 3% to 20% in North America.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] IBS is more common in women than men.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] SEPAHAN systematic review also showed the greater prevalence in women than men.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>IBS can generally be diagnosed beyond a careful history taking, a general physical examination, and common laboratory studies (without colonoscopy) in patients who have symptoms that meet the Rome criteria and who do not have warning signs.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] According to bowel habits and stool characteristics, patients can be subclassified as having diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation-predominant IBS, or mixed bowel habits.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies suggest the importance of bacteria and gut flora in the pathophysiology of IBS.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These studies linked IBS to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] SIBO is more common in diarrheal IBS than other subtypes.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The conventional therapies are loperamide for IBS-D, however, because of the heterogeneous nature of the symptoms, patients are often treated with medications from more than one drug class to achieve relief.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Since an abnormal composition of gut microbiota exists among IBS patients, using antibiotics seems to be appropriate to treat IBS.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] According to previous studies, antibiotics such as rifaximin have demonstrated a substantial benefit to reduce gut flora.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Some studies showed the role of different treatments such as loperamide, alosetron, and ondansetron on IBS syndrome.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Some scientists such as Pimentel <italic>et al</italic>., Saadi and McCallum and Menees <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of Rifaximin on patients with nonconstipation predominant IBS.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Pimentel <italic>et al</italic>. showed that a short course of rifaximin can ameliorate IBS symptoms.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Saadi and McCallum explained the benefits of rifaximin to treat IBS.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Despite the large number of studies on different treatments, especially different antibiotics such as rifaximin, few researches investigated the effect of azithromycin on IBS symptoms and the literature in this area is not substantial.</p><p>Having few side effects, and applying one-dose per day, we studied the effect of azithromycin to treat IBS, in
