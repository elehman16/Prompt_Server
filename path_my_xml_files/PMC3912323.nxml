The first conditioning concept is prolonged high-volume low-intensity exercise (HVT). The second is training at or near the lactate threshold (THR); third is low-volume high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and the fourth concept is a combination of the aforementioned concepts known as &#x0201c;polarized&#x0201d; training (POL). There is a debate as to which of these training concepts may be superior in maximizing adaptations and performance.</p><p>HVT executed with low (LOW) intensity [approximately 65&#x02013;75% of peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) &#x0003c;80% of peak heart rate (HR<sub>peak</sub>) or &#x0003c;2 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> blood lactate (Laursen and Jenkins, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Seiler and Kjerland, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>)] and prolonged duration is thought to be a fundamental training concept in preparing for endurance events. This type of exercise improves VO<sub>2peak</sub> by increasing stroke and plasma volume and induces molecular adaptations for capillary and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby improving the efficiency of metabolic key components for energy fueling (Romijn et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Midgley et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>HIIT has revealed great improvements in athletic performance and related key variables of endurance (e.g., time to exhaustion, time trial performance, VO<sub>2peak</sub>, maximal and submaximal running speed, running economy) in both trained and untrained individuals (Laursen and Jenkins, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). These improvements were largely due to increases in O<sub>2</sub> availability, extraction and utilization and the increases in VO<sub>2peak</sub> (Daussin et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Helgerud et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). A condensed 2 week block of 10&#x02013;13 sessions of HIIT led to a 7% increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub> (St&#x000f8;len et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Training at or close to the lactate threshold (LT) (Faude et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), referred to as &#x0201c;threshold training,&#x0201d; improves endurance performance, particularly in untrained participants (Denis et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Londeree, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). However, Norwegian world-class sprint cross-country skiers demonstrated greater training volume close to the LT when compared to national-level skiers (Sandbakk et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Furthermore, in elite cross-country skiers greater improvements in running speed at lactate threshold and performance in a 20-min run when exercising at an intensity eliciting 3&#x02013;4 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> lactate compared with low intensity training (&#x0003c;3&#x02013;4 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were found (Evertsen et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In contrast, experimental and correlational data from well-trained athletes suggest that training time close to LT may be ineffective, or even counterproductive (Esteve-Lanao et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Guellich and Seiler, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Retrospective analysis of the intensity, duration and frequency of the training load of international-level cross-country skiers (Seiler and Kjerland, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), rowers (Steinacker et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), cyclists (Schumacher and Mueller, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and runners (Billat et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Esteve-Lanao et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) revealed that elite endurance athletes completed most of their yearly training sessions at either intensities below (~75% of total training volume) or well above (~15&#x02013;20% of total training volume) their LT. Six weeks of cycling using POL resulted in greater systemic adaptation in already well-trained athletes when compared to THR (Neal et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, no study has investigated the POL concept in well-trained endurance athletes to determine whether this concept may be superior to the aforementioned training strategies.</p><p>In many endurance sports, five key variables have been used as a benchmark to compare athletic performance in and between endurance athletes: (i) VO<sub>2peak</sub> (Bassett and Howley, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>); (ii) velocity/power output at the lactate threshold (V/P<sub>LT</sub>) (Bassett and Howley, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Midgley et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Faude et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>); (iii) work economy (Di Prampero et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Helgerud et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>); (iv) peak running velocity or power output (V/P<sub>peak</sub>) (Midgley et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>); and (v) time to exhaustion (TTE) (Laursen and Jenkins, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The aim of this study was to compare the effects of four training concepts (HVT vs. THR vs. HIIT vs. POL) on the aforementioned key variables of endurance performance in well-trained athletes. We hypothesized that the POL and HIIT group would lead to superior improvements compared with HVT and THR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Forty eight healthy competitive endurance athletes who participated in either cross-country skiing, cycling, triathlon, middle&#x02014;or long-distance running volunteered to take part in this study (mean &#x000b1; SD: age: 31 &#x000b1; 6 years, body mass: 73.8 &#x000b1; 9 kg, height: 180 &#x000b1; 8 cm).

Retrospective analysis of training protocols over 6 months prior to the study revealed that none of the participants had regularly executed HIIT. All had followed a HVT training protocol with a maximum of two THR training sessions per week.</p><p>Based on the participants' baseline VO<sub>2peak</sub> and training mode (running or cycling), all athletes were randomized into HIIT, HVT, THR or POL. At baseline, the four groups were not statistically different with regard to age, height, body mass or VO<sub>2peak</sub>. During an initial visit, study details and participation requirements were explained, and written informed consent was obtained. The study received approval from the University of Salzburg Austria Ethics Committee and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The intervention lasted 9 weeks plus 2 days of pre- and post-testing. All athletes (<italic>n</italic> = 15 cyclists; <italic>n</italic> = 3 triathletes) engaging in cycling training trained with their own bike and completed all tests on a bicycle ergometer (Ergoline, Ergoselect 100P; Bitz, Germany) using their own cycling shoes and pedal system. Other athletes (<italic>n</italic> = 16 runners, <italic>n</italic> = 6 triathletes, <italic>n</italic> = 8 cross-country skiers) ran during the study and completed their pre- and post-testing on a motorized treadmill (HP Cosmos, Saturn, Traunstein, Germany). All participants were instructed not to change their diet throughout the training period and to maintain strength training, if it was part of their training program. Participants' nutritional intake was not standardized or controlled during the study, but for the 3 h prior to all testing in which food intake was not permitted. The training intensity was controlled by HR based on the baseline incremental test: (i) LOW (HR at blood lactate value &#x0003c;2 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>); (ii) LT (HR corresponding to a blood lactate of 3&#x02013;5 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>); (iii) HIGH (&#x0003e;90% HR<sub>peak</sub>)]. The HR was measured during each training session and athletes documented training mode, exercise duration, and intensity in a diary.

The adaptation week included two 60 min HIIT sessions, three 90 min LOW sessions, one 120 min LOW session and 1 day of recovery. The condensed 16 day interval block included 12 HIIT sessions within 15 days, integrating four blocks of three HIIT sessions for three consecutive days followed by 1 day of recovery.

The pre- and post-tests included the determination of body mass, an incremental test protocol, a work economy and VO<sub>2peak</sub> ramp protocol.</p><p>On the first day participants performed an incremental test on a treadmill (7.2 km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; increment: 1.8 km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>every 5 min, with 30 s recovery between stages, inclination 1%) or cycle ergometer (80 W; increment: 40 W every 5 min, cadence &#x0003e;80 rpm) until volitional exhaustion was achieved to assess the peak velocity/power output (V/P<sub>peak</sub>), HR, blood lactate, as well as the velocity, power output and HR at 2 and 4 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> blood lactate (V/P<sub>2</sub>, V/P<sub>4</sub> and HR<sub>2</sub>, HR<sub>4</sub>). The participants' HR was recorded by telemetry (Suunto t6, Helsinki, Finland) at 2-s intervals. The mean HR over the last 30 s of each increment was used for statistical analysis. A 20 &#x003bc;l blood sample from the right earlobe was collected immediately after each increment, as well as 3 and 5 min after the completion of the test into a capillary tube (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). All samples were analyzed amperometric-enzymatically (Biosen 5140, EKF-diagnostic GmbH, Magdeburg, Germany) in duplicate, and the mean of the two measures was used for statistical analysis. The lactate sensor was calibrated before each test using a lactate standard sample of 12 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Results within a range of &#x000b1; 0.1 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were accepted.</p><p>One day after the incremental tests, all athletes completed a combined work economy and VO<sub>2peak</sub> ramp protocol to determine their submaximal and peak VO<sub>2</sub> (VO<sub>2submax</sub> and VO<sub>2peak</sub>) and HR (HR<sub>submax</sub> and HR<sub>peak</sub>), as well as time to exhaustion (TTE). First, the intensity for running was set at 8 km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (inclination: 5%) on the treadmill, and for cycling at 200 W with a cadence of &#x0003e;80 rpm for 10 min to determine VO<sub>2submax</sub> and HR<sub>submax</sub> for this intensity. The mean VO<sub>2</sub> and HR during the last 5 min of these tests were used for statistical purposes. The intensity was then increased every 30 s by 0.5 km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (inclination: 10%) on the treadmill or 15 W on the cycle ergometer until exhaustion. The overall time for the ramp test was defined as time to exhaustion (TTE). VO<sub>2</sub> was measured with an open circuit breath-by-breath spirograph (nSpire, Zan 600 USB, Oberthulba, Germany), which was calibrated prior to each test using high precision gas (15.8% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub> in N; Praxair, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany) and a 1L syringe (nSpire, Oberthulba, Germany). All respiratory data were averaged every 30 s. VO<sub>2peak</sub> was achieved if three of the four following criteria were met: (1) plateau in VO<sub>2</sub>, i.e., an increase &#x0003c; 1.0 mL&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> despite an increase in velocity or power output; (2) respiratory exchange ratio &#x0003e;1.1; (3) HR &#x000b1; 5% of age predicted HR<sub>peak</sub>; and (4) peak blood lactate (LA<sub>peak</sub>) &#x0003e; 6 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after exercise. Reliability analysis of The VO<sub>2peak</sub> test (<italic>n</italic> = 18) revealed ICC values of 0.96 for VO<sub>2peak</sub> and 0.98 for TTE.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data exhibited a Gaussian distribution verified by the Shapiro-Wilk's test and, accordingly, the values are presented as means &#x000b1; <italic>SD</italic>.

When a significant main effect over time was observed, paired <italic>t</italic>-tests within each group were conducted. Based on the different units of peak power/velocity and power/velocity at 2 and 4 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> blood lactate in the incremental and VO<sub>2peak</sub> test, percent changes between pre- to post-values were calculated, and a One-Way ANOVA between groups was performed using Tukey's <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis. Furthermore, within group changes for these variables were calculated using Wilcoxon tests. An alpha value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.

The main findings were that (1) POL led to the greatest improvement in VO<sub>2peak</sub>, TTE and V/P<sub>peak</sub>; (2) V/P<sub>4</sub> increased after POL and HIIT; (3) no significant differences in work economy were observed pre to post between any of the groups; and finally (4) body mass decreased by 3.7% in response to HIIT.</p><p>There are several challenges associated with conducting an exercise training intervention such as the one presented here. Firstly, the compliance of all athletes is paramount to the successful completion of the study and for the subsequent examination of the intervention. The athletes attended more than 95% of all training sessions and all completed their predetermined training load (intensity based on HR zones, duration, and frequency), which was confirmed by logging the daily training dose in a diary and retrospective analysis of HR data. Secondly, an experimental study is difficult to conduct in elite athletes because typically neither the athletes nor their coaches like to have the athletes' training intensity, duration or frequency altered. However, we successfully managed to conduct the current study in well-trained male and female athletes (VO<sub>2peak</sub>: 52&#x02013;75 mL&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) over a 9 week period.</p><p>Of the four training concepts, POL resulted in the greatest increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub>, TTE,V/P<sub>peak</sub> and, together with HIIT, in V/P<sub>4</sub>. As mentioned, POL was confirmed by retro-perspective analysis of the intensity, duration and frequency distribution of the training load in highly trained athletes (Steinacker et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Billat et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Schumacher and Mueller, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Seiler and Kjerland, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Esteve-Lanao et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In these studies, it was demonstrated that endurance athletes perform approximately 75% of their yearly training program either below or well above (~15&#x02013;20%) the LT, but little at the LT. In the current study, POL mimicked this distribution (LOW = 68%, LTP = 6%, HIGH = 26%). Only the study of Neal et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) demonstrated that 6 weeks of POL resulted in greater systemic adaptation in trained cyclists when compared to THR, hence supporting our findings.</p><p>In moderately trained persons, HVT improves metabolic and hemodynamic adaptations over 3 days (Green et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Coyle, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). However, a greater volume of training (~3&#x02013;5 weeks with 3&#x02013;5 sessions&#x000b7;wk<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is needed to improve VO<sub>2peak</sub> (Laursen and Jenkins, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). One reason due to why athletes may choose a high amount of HVT may be due to that HVT leads to improved fat and glucose utilization (Romijn et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), which is beneficial for long lasting endurance events. Therefore, it might be reasonable to implement HVT in the training programs of elite endurance athletes for improving oxidative flux, which is important for converting energy aerobically and recovery after and during HIIT sessions with large anaerobic portions. When HVT becomes the major component of a training program and HIIT sessions are neglected, no further improvement in VO<sub>2peak</sub> and performance in already well-trained athletes occur (Costill et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Laursen and Jenkins, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>); in line with the findings of the present study. Further improvements of well-trained athletes require adding high intensity training sessions to HVT, as demonstrated in POL. However, due to that the participants of this study mainly used HVT prior to this experiment, the HVT model might not have provided an adequate stimulus for further adaptations.</p><p>The advantage of HIIT compared to HVT lies in a shorter period of training time for similar muscular adaptations (Gibala et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Burgomaster et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In response to HIIT, several central and peripheral adaptations including increased stroke (Helgerud et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and blood volume (Shepley et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), O<sub>2</sub> extraction (Daussin et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and improvements in aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (Macdougall et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), such as increased mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity, have been reported (Gibala et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Daussin et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Burgomaster et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The aforementioned adaptations in response to HIIT explain the often documented increases in TTE, time trial performance (Lindsay et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), lactate and ventilatory threshold (Acevedo and Goldfarb, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Edge et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and VO<sub>2peak</sub> (Laursen and Jenkins, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Gibala et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Midgley et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Daussin et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Burgomaster et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>The present study, as well as that of Helgerud et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), demonstrated that training at or near VO<sub>2peak</sub> may be more effective in enhancing VO<sub>2peak</sub> when compared to HVT or THR. However, POL, a combination of HVT and HIIT, may be superior for enhancing VO<sub>2peak</sub> and performance. Numerous studies using &#x0201c;blocked&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;condensed&#x0201d; HIIT (i.e., several HIIT session in 1 or 2 weeks) aim to increase VO<sub>2peak</sub> (St&#x000f8;len et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Furthermore, in HIIT intervention studies (2&#x02013;3 HIIT sessions per week), VO<sub>2peak</sub> increased approximately 9% over a 10 week training intervention (McMillan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and 11% over a 6 week training intervention (Helgerud et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) in youth and junior soccer players, suggesting a 0.5% increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub> per HIIT training session. In the current study, the increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub> following 9 weeks of HIIT (27 HIIT sessions) was 4.8% (0.18% increase per training session), while POL resulted in an 11.7% increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub> with fewer HIIT sessions (14 HIIT) (0.84% increase per training session). This result may be explained by: (1) peak adaptation might have been reached following the first HIIT block, and therefore, repeated HIIT bouts did not produce any further improvements in VO<sub>2peak</sub> or performance, or (2) the combination of HVT and HIIT, much like in POL, leads to greater long-term adaptations in endurance performance than with exclusively HIIT or HVT.</p><p>THR improves VO<sub>2peak</sub>, lactate or ventilatory thresholds and endurance performance in untrained persons (Denis et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Londeree, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Gaskill et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). These findings contrast those of the current study, as we did not observe improvements in VO<sub>2peak</sub>, V/P<sub>4</sub>, TTE or V/P<sub>peak</sub> in our elite athletes in response to THR. Additionally, it is possible that in well-trained endurance athletes, repeated training bouts at LT might generate unwarranted sympathetic stress (Chwalbinska-Moneta et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), while offering no further stimulus for performance enhancement (Londeree, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In this context, especially within the THR group, significant variability in the individual changes in VO<sub>2peak</sub> from pre- to post-intervention were observed (range: &#x02212;20 to +4%). However, some THR training might be beneficial to well-trained athletes since world-class sprint cross-country skiers demonstrated greater training volume in the low and moderate intensity zones compared with national-level skiers (Sandbakk et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>The body mass of the well-trained athletes decreased by 3.7% (approximately 3 kg) after HIIT, but not in response to the other training concepts. HIIT favors lipid oxidation and promotes adipose tissue loss (Perry et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Boutcher, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Depending on the athlete's baseline value, reduction in body mass may negatively impact immune function and overall health, as well as induce a catabolic state. Training blocks with increased volume and/or exercise intensity might induce symptoms of &#x0201c;overreaching,&#x0201d; reduced physical capacity, burnout symptoms including tiredness, and lack of energy (Angeli et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, despite the large differences in the individual responses in some of the training groups, none of the athletes demonstrated reduced TTE or V/P<sub>peak</sub> after the study, nor did they report any of the aforementioned symptoms during and after the 9 week intervention. Based on the observed changes in body mass and smaller increases in VO<sub>2peak</sub> in the HIIT group compared with previously published data (McMillan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; St&#x000f8;len et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Helgerud et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), longer blocks of training periods with high intensities could provoke these symptoms.</p><p>Except for significant decreases in %VO<sub>2</sub><sub>peak</sub> in the POL group and HR<sub>submax</sub>/%HR<sub>peak</sub> in the HIIT and THR groups (with no group differences), no improvements in work economy were found in the current study. Helgerud et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) reported a ~5% improvement in running economy after THR, HIIT, and HVT with no differences between groups. These improvements were mainly attributed to an increased amount of running training. Therefore, the applied training regimes were largely responsible for the changes in V/P<sub>peak</sub>and VO<sub>2peak</sub>, while work economy remained fairly constant. V/P<sub>4</sub> was only improved in POL (8.1%) and HIIT (5.6%). This is consistent with findings demonstrating that running velocity at lactate threshold follows the improvements in VO<sub>2peak</sub> (Helgerud et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; McMillan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and perspectives</title><p>Standardized methodology of performance diagnostics (incremental test and VO<sub>2peak</sub> ramp protocol) was utilized to evaluate the effects of the four endurance training interventions on key variables of endurance performance. However, a direct transfer to specific competition situation (e.g., time trial) need to be established in future research. Furthermore, the increase of about 11% in VO<sub>2peak</sub> with POL within 9 weeks is large for well-trained endurance and has to be put in perspective within the annual training periodization. Long-term training studies are warranted to evaluate these aspects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study of elite athletes performing HIIT, HVT, THR or POL training, POL results in the greatest improvements in key variables of endurance performance (VO<sub>2peak</sub>, TTE, V/P<sub>peak</sub>, and V/P<sub>4</sub>). HIIT led to a decrease in body mass and less pronounced increases in VO<sub>2peak</sub> compared with previous findings using short term (1&#x02013;2 weeks) HIIT, suggesting that a 9 week HIIT should be applied with care. Exclusive training with THR or HVT did not lead to further improvements in endurance performance related variables in well-trained athletes.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosure of funding</title><p>No funding was received for this work from the National Institutes of Health, the Welcome Trust, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, or other funding agencies to PubMed Central.
