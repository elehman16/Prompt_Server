For example, regulatory authorities use causality assessment to assess spontaneous ADR reports to help with signal detection and inform risk&#x02013;benefit decisions regarding medicines. Anecdotally, clinicians' assessment of ADR causality is generally done informally and sometimes subconsciously, which leads to variability in decision making, specifically in terms of when to alter drug therapy and reporting of ADRs.</p><p>There are many causality assessment tools available. The Naranjo tool is probably the most widely used worldwide.<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">[1]</xref> In two recent large paediatric ADR studies, the Naranjo tool was found to be inadequate for ADR causality assessment and have poor reproducibility.[<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>] For instance, in the assessment of ADRs detected in children acutely admitted to hospital over a 12 month period,<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">[2]</xref> inter&#x02010;rater reliability using the Naranjo tool was poor. The investigators concluded that some of the questions in the tool were not appropriate, leading to a lack of sensitivity, with the overall score obtained being artificially lowered. This led to underestimation of the likelihood of an ADR. In addition, the weighting for each question within the Naranjo tool was not justified in the original publication. Subsequently, a new causality assessment tool, the Liverpool Causality Assessment Tool (LCAT, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijpp.12197/suppinfo">Appendix S1</ext-link>), was developed, formally tested and internally validated.<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">[4]</xref> This tool aimed to overcome the issues identified with the Naranjo tool, while (1) making it as easy, or easier, to use than the Naranjo tool and (2) maintaining the basic principles of causality assessment. Given that there is variability in clinical decision making around ADRs, we aimed to develop a means to disseminate this new approach of ADR causality assessment to practitioners. We developed an interactive, web&#x02010;based e&#x02010;learning package designed to improve assessment by individual practitioners: The Liverpool ADR Causality Assessment e&#x02010;learning Package (LACAeP) (see Box&#x02009;<xref rid="ijpp12197-fea-0001" ref-type="boxed-text">1</xref> for the attributes of this package). The use of e&#x02010;learning packages for medical training has been shown to have good uptake and to be effective.<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">[5]</xref>

Feedback obtained for the latter will be used to identify areas for improvement and development. This trial also aimed to generate data on effect size enabling a larger hypothesis testing study to be conducted.</p></sec><sec id="ijpp12197-sec-0006"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a pilot, single&#x02010;blind, parallel group study conducted by the University of Liverpool. This pilot aimed to inform a larger scale study that would formally compare the effect that the LACAeP has on improving the consistency of assigning causality using the LCAT. This trial was supported by the Mersey Deanery and approved by their ethics committee. The study obtained organisational approval from NHS North of England, and permission was obtained from the Head of Schools at the North West and Mersey Deaneries to include trainees from that region.</p><p>Eligibility criteria were defined to ensure that improvements in classifications were attributed to the intervention and so that prior knowledge or experience of the participants could be managed as appropriate. In the UK, trainees in paediatrics progress through specialty training (ST) levels, ST 1 being the first year of training. Eligible participants were specialist trainees in paediatrics (ST level 1 and above) within the Mersey (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;165) and North West Deaneries (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;214). Trainees who had previously received formal training in causality assessment or had obtained a professional qualification in clinical pharmacology or pharmacy were excluded. Recruitment commenced on 15 January 2013 and continued until 18 February 2013. Eligible trainees were recruited through email and by advertising the trial on the Alder Hey Children's Hospital intranet and in workplaces. Invitations to participate were also included in induction packs for new doctors. All participants completed a consent form when they registered to participate and returned an electric or hard copy. Random allocation sequence was generated by computer by an independent statistician and was stratified by speciality training level.</p><p>Both the control and intervention arm received access to the LCAT to assist causality assessment. Participants in the intervention arm accessed an interactive training module with self&#x02010;directed e&#x02010;learning components that guided users when making causality assessments using the LCAT (LACAeP). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijpp.12197/suppinfo">Appendix S2 and S3</ext-link> show illustrative screenshots of the introduction page and a worked example, respectively. Training was provided using five preloaded ADR case studies. Although trainees were aware of the allocated arm, data analysts were kept blinded to the allocation until after the analyses were finalised.</p><p>Each trainee was issued a username, password and web link which would allow access to the trial platform according to the randomisation schedule. Following any training, trainees in both arms were required to assess the same 20 ADR cases using the LCAT tool. These cases were randomly ordered to minimise contamination of results. The e&#x02010;learning package was tested rigorously by the study team for functionality and content before the trial was opened. Several iterations of testing were undertaken until all aspects of the trial and package were suitable for a full pilot study to commence.</p><p>Participants were able to access the trial platform from 29<sup>th</sup> February to 15<sup>th</sup> March 2013. Email reminders were sent to those who had not completed the assessments during this period to improve completion rates. Trainees who completed the trial were given a training certificate for their training records and entered into a cash prize draw.</p><p>ADR case studies used both for post intervention assessment and within the training phase of the e&#x02010;learning tool were taken from two previous ADR studies.[<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>] Within these studies, causality classification (unlikely, possible, probable or definite) was reached by consensus by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. For the purpose of this trial, these classifications were deemed to be the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019;. Case studies were selected using quota sampling methods from this cohort of cases to mirror the distribution of possible, probable, definite and unlikely ADRs observed in these studies. The number of correct classifications when compared against the gold standard was defined as the primary efficacy outcome. The maximum possible score for each trainee was 20. As a second efficacy outcome, the route taken on the LCAT flowchart was recorded to ensure that classifications were obtained following a route defined by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. Upon completing the intervention, trainees were encouraged to provide feedback on both LCAT and LACAeP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijpp.12197/suppinfo">Appendix S4</ext-link>) by completing an optional survey, built in to the package, made up of a series of open and closed questions.</p><sec id="ijpp12197-sec-0007"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>As this was a pilot study, intended to generate data on effect size to enable a larger hypothesis study to be conducted, no formal power analysis was completed prior to the trial. A pragmatic sample of 80 participants of the total 379 trainees at that time was considered a minimum requirement.</p><p>Closed items on the feedback questionnaire were analysed quantitatively and reported as count data and percentages. No formal qualitative analysis was conducted on open items which are presented verbatim. To ensure participants remained anonymous, each was given a unique participant number made up of a letter to indicate the intervention arm (A for the intervention arm and B for the control arm) and a sequential number within arm.</p><p>Overall series agreement postintervention was summarised for each treatment group, both overall and split by Speciality Training level (groups: 3 and below, 4 and above), using descriptive statistics, means with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or medians with an interquartile range if the scores was non&#x02010;normally distributed.

However it is difficult to see the day to day ward use, as we are encouraged to report any ADR's on the yellow forms which is a quicker process. The tool could help in reflective practice but is quite unwieldy to use in a busy ward round. The way it was presented was very retrospective. Some parts were difficult to understand or qualify such as is there a mechanism for the ADR, and is there previous reported cases seemed to overlap a good deal. Reading BNF and clinical education and high index of suspicion remain best tools. There also remains little quantification for acceptable levels of ADR.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">I did not feel that the pre test information explained enough the process of assessing if the ADR was definite, probable or possible well enough.

Occasionally the tool forced me into a conclusion which I did not agree with e.g. the oral candida had not yet got better in the case where this occurred following antibiotics (nystatin had only just been started so I would not expect it to have improved yet) however stating that it has not improved after stopping the abx leads to the conclusion being that the chance of ADR is only possible, when I feel in that case it is at least probable.

Before embarking on a larger trial, it is also important to assess the feedback received from the participants on the tools used. Feedback on the LCAT was mostly positive, with trainees indicating they had learnt something about ADR assessment from the tool and would use it in their clinical practice. The user feedback on both the LCAT and LACAeP has highlighted a number of areas that need to be addressed in the educational package such as giving more explanation of some of the terms used and the routes taken to determine causality.</p><p>Our data indicate that the LACAeP did not improve causality assessment in trainees, but participants who were given training by the LACAeP in causality assessment obtained a higher score by approximately 1.5 (out of 20) on average for correct classification (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.34, 95% CI, &#x02212;0.3 to 3.0).</p><p>This was a pilot study to inform a main trial, and data were not available to inform a sample size calculation prior to recruitment. We selected a pragmatic sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;80) based on the eligible population, but we did not reach this recruitment target. However, the inclusion of 35 participants was adequate to fulfil the aims of this pilot study. We consider that a difference of 2 correctly classified ADRs out of 20 between the groups would be the minimum worthwhile clinical difference. Based on the results obtained and this consideration, a trial with 90 participants (45 per group) is required to have adequate power to detect a true clinically relevant difference of 2.0 at the 5% significance level and 80% power.</p><p>There are three main strengths to this study. First, it shows that a novel trial design where participants can take part remotely is feasible and results in a reasonable proportion of participants completing the trial; overall, 61.4% of participants who were randomised completed the trial. Second, this pilot offers a template for easy expansion to a larger trial that will represent the package utility in a larger cohort, not only in size but also in geographical expansion to represent a wider proportion of trainees across the UK. A similar e&#x02010;learning approach has been used by Gordon <italic>et&#x02009;al</italic>. who conducted an RCT to investigate the effectiveness of an e&#x02010;learning course on paediatric prescribing<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">[5]</xref> in North West England. This research attained a sample size of 206 from a pool of 1150 (17.9%) of which 113 completed the trial (54.9%). This is comparable with our sample size of 57 from a pool of 379 (15.0%) of which 35 completed the assessment phase of the trial (59.5%). Third, the use of trainees as participants means that differences observed are indeed down to the intervention and not prior knowledge or experience.</p><p>This study also had limitations. First, only a postintervention assessment was undertaken stratifying by ST level. The inclusion of a preintervention assessment of all participants would have been the optimum approach to determining the impact of the intervention. However, the study relied on the availability of trainees to participate, so the design was adapted to minimise the time commitment required from participants, with the aim of enhancing participation rates. Second, and for the same reason, the study was held remotely hosted on a server such that trainees could participate in their own time, and so, the possibility of participants discussing their responses cannot be eradicated. However, the study management team did not consider this likely as participants consented to not discussing aspects of the trial with their peers. Third, as this trial relied on the participation of volunteers, the generalisability of the results may be questionable.</p><p>We have recently shown the importance of ADRs in paediatric medicine,[<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>] and previously in adult medicine.[<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>] The burden overall is very large leading to a great deal of morbidity in patients, occasional mortality, unnecessary investigations, increased length of stay in hospital and a huge cost burden. It is incumbent on all healthcare professionals to recognise ADRs and act accordingly (stop the drug and/or reduce the dose, and report the ADR to their own hospitals and regulatory authorities).<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">[9]</xref> However, because ADRs can affect any bodily system, and can present in a multitude of ways, they are sometimes difficult to recognise, and even when recognised, there may be difficulties in assigning causality.<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">[10]</xref> Many causality assessment tools have been developed;<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">[11]</xref> more complicated tools may potentially be more accurate but extremely difficult to use in clinical practice. Our aim with the LCAT was to develop a user&#x02010;friendly and easy&#x02010;to&#x02010;complete tool<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">[4]</xref> which would improve assessment of ADRs and their reporting in daily clinical practice. The feedback from participants that they would use such a tool in their clinical practice is thus encouraging. Although this trial included medical trainees, the LCAT was developed by a multidisciplinary team<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">[4]</xref> and has been used by nurses and pharmacists for the evaluation of causality in a research setting.[<xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="ijpp12197-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>] Therefore, we anticipate it being used by both medical and nonmedical professionals in a clinical setting. Nevertheless, the appropriate use of the tool needs an educational package such as the one developed as part of this study.</p></sec><sec id="ijpp12197-sec-0013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Feedback on the LCAT and LACAeP was mainly positive although we have identified areas of the LACAeP that need improving before conducting a trial to formally assess the effectiveness of the tool. This study was not powered to detect a difference between allocation arms though preliminary findings show a non&#x02010;significant improvement of 1.5 (out of 20) on average in the LACAeP arm. The data collected were sufficient to enable a formal sample size calculation for a main study, and thus, our next step will be to improve the educational tool and then test it again in an appropriately powered trial of 90 participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45 per group).</p></sec><sec id="ijpp12197-sec-0014"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="ijpp12197-sec-0015"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>All authors are members of the research team on the Adverse Drug Reactions in Children project.
