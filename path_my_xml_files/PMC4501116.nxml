Considering only factors evaluable at treatment initiation, maximum diameter of liver metastases (&#x02265;3.9&#x000a0;cm; HR: 3.1), liver volume (&#x02265; 1376&#x000a0;mL; HR: 2.3), and history of prior chemotherapy (&#x02265; 3 lines of treatment; HR: 2.5-2.6) showed an independent survival impact. When follow-up data were included in the analysis, significant factors were maximum diameter of liver metastases (&#x02265; 3.9&#x000a0;cm; HR: 3.1), control of LMBC during follow-up (HR: 0.29), and objective response as best overall response (HR: 0.21). Neither the presence of any extrahepatic metastases nor presence of bone metastases only had a significant survival impact.

As a result, surgical or locally ablative treatment of metastatic lesions is now an accepted, potentially curative modality in a variety of cancers for patients with limited metastatic burden (e.g., colorectal, renal cell, and non small-cell lung cancer) and has been integrated into treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More recently, however, the distinction between &#x0201c;curable&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-curable&#x0201d; cancer has become less clear as some patients may continuously demonstrate controllable disease for many years and eventually die from causes unrelated to their cancer. The propensity of a cancer to develop rapid dissemination has been referred to as the disease&#x02019;s biology; however, it is likely that a complex pattern of interaction between the tumor cells and the host organism rather than specific properties of the tumor alone determine the metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These observations have led to the concept of a distinct &#x0201c;oligometastatic&#x0201d; disease state which incorporates patients who may derive benefit from local treatment (even repeatedly) despite the impossibility to achieve true cure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>It is unknown if an oligometastatic subpopulation exists among patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Generally, MBC is regarded as a systemic disease and these patients, in line with current European and American treatment guidelines which essentially reserve locally ablative or surgical treatment to lesions that are symptomatic or prone to cause local complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], are mostly offered palliative systemic treatment regardless of their metastatic burden. This is particularly true for liver metastases (LMBC) that typically occur late in the course of breast cancer and are uncommon in the absence of extrahepatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite this, there are a number of retrospective, non-randomized reports demonstrating superior survival in patients undergoing liver resection for LMBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] compared to patients receiving systemic treatment alone, with surgically treated patients achieving median survival of up to 5&#x000a0;years and 5&#x000a0;year overall survival of up to 60&#x000a0;%, whereas median survival in MBC patients treated with systemic therapy only is approximately 24&#x000a0;months and only 5-10&#x000a0;% are alive at 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Survival figures reported for patients treated with locally ablative modalities (radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or interstitial CT-guided brachytherapy (BT)) are generally lower, probably in part owing to a selection bias. However, they still compare favorably to systemic treatment alone, demonstrating some benefit from local control of liver metastases in a disease that is assumed to be systemic by nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is further complemented by the observation that, in chemorefractory patients not amenable to surgical or locally ablative treatment, encouraging survival was observed with locoregional intrahepatic therapies (<sup>90</sup>Y radioembolization (RE) or intrahepatic chemotherapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>As currently available data do not allow to determine if improved survival in patients undergoing locoregional therapy represents a true treatment benefit or must be regarded as an expression of favorable disease biology, with patients demonstrating relatively indolent disease preferably being selected for local treatment, it has repeatedly been suggested that these treatments be evaluated within a randomized trial comparing the combination of local and systemic therapy to systemic therapy alone. The exploratory data we present here is intended to help modelling such study concepts by identifying prognostic factors in a cohort of LMBC patients both with and without extrahepatic disease who were not amenable to radical surgery and received locally ablative (RFA or BT) or locoregional intrahepatic (RE) treatment either once or in combination as part of sequential treatment decisions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This retrospective study explores prospectively collected data from patients with LMBC who were referred to our department for local interventional treatment of liver metastases between 2006 and 2010.

Selection of patients for local interventional treatment was based on lack of further chemotherapeutic options (progression of LMBC on all standard chemotherapeutic protocols or patient refusal of further chemotherapy) as well as surgical non-resectability of all visible lesions (either technically or due to impaired patient tolerance for major liver surgery). Patients had to have liver-predominant disease; however, limited extrahepatic disease that was stable under systemic treatment or amenable to local ablation was allowed.</p><p>The median interval from diagnosis of LMBC to presentation for interventional treatment was 22 (1-294) months.</p><p>Tumors were hormone-receptor positive in 49 of 59 patients and Her2-neu positive in 20 of 59 patients.</p><p>Differentiation of liver metastases was graded as G1 (4 patients), G2 (26 patients), or G3 (21 patients). For 8 patients no information on tumor differentiation was available.</p><p>At presentation for interventional treatment of LMBC, the mean intrahepatic tumor load (mean cumulative volume of all liver metastases relative to total liver volume) was 8.2&#x000a0;% (range 0.1&#x02013;51.4). Mean number of liver metastases was 13 (range 1-88). The diameter of the largest liver lesion ranged from 1-14&#x000a0;cm (mean 4.9&#x000a0;cm). The mean cumulative volume of the liver metastases was 129.6&#x000a0;mL (range 0.5-976), and mean total liver volume was 1445&#x000a0;mL (range 801-2202).</p><p>54 of 59 patients had a history of 1-8 (median 2) lines of systemic chemotherapy (without hormones) for their breast cancer prior to presentation for interventional treatment of LMBC. Bisphosphonates had been applied in 24 patients. Surgery and external beam radiation for breast cancer metastases had been performed in 19 and 20 patients, respectively.</p><p>29 of 59 patients had evidence of limited extrahepatic disease at the time of interventional LMBC treatment (bone metastases only, 19/59 patients;

Nonetheless, with the continuing improvement of perioperative outcomes in liver surgery, there is now an increasing role for liver resection as part of a multidisciplinary treatment concept in many cancers, even outside of a curative approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Minimally invasive local treatment modalities have been developed to further reduce periprocedural risks. Recent data referring to a variety of techniques demonstrates encouraging results regarding local tumor clearance, making them particularly attractive in patients in whom a more radical approach associated with higher morbidity may not be acceptable because a survival benefit cannot be reliably predicted. Among these treatments, RFA is the most widely accepted modality and is regularly used to ablate liver tumors of limited number and size (usually &#x0003c;3-5&#x000a0;cm) in a suitable location (i.e., outside the immediate vicinity of large vessels to minimize the heat-sink effect, or at some distance from the hepatic bifurcation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Image-guided, catheter-based, interstitial brachytherapy is employed by an increasing number of centers since it avoids the tumor size limitation applicable for RFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Our patient cohort recruited between 2006 and 2010 did not benefit of advances in systemic treatments that were recently reported for the use of nab-Paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], with approx. 80&#x000a0;% of the patients in that study having visceral metastases whereas the proportion of hepatic metastases (that are considered to confer a particularly poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]) was not specified. Hence, our results must be compared to studies employing anthracycline, taxanes or cyclophosphamide. Data available refers to first line patients (in contrast to our cohort in a salvage situation), and median overall survival ranged from 22.7 to 27.1&#x000a0;months in patients with liver metastases only and from 14-16.8&#x000a0;months in patients with liver-dominant and limited extrahepatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The beneficial effect of a local treatment approach is further complemented by the observation that local control of the liver metastases and objective response to locoregional treatment at follow-up were found to be the strongest factors indicating prolonged survival at multivariable analysis in our study (HR of 0.29 and 0.21, respectively). Thus, in contrast to the view held by some investigators that local control of liver metastases in breast cancer has no survival impact due to the generalized nature of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], our results (in line with other published research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]) are rather suggestive of the existence of an oligometastatic subpopulation in LMBC patients whose prognosis is determined by the visible lesions rather than subclinical tumor dissemination which will cause rapid systemic progression regardless of local disease control. The observation that most patients developing recurrence following resection of LMBC have the liver as their first site of recurrence further underscores this view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>There are currently no methods to reliably identify the oligometastatic subpopulation which may benefit from local surgical or image-guided treatment approaches. In the absence of established molecular biomarkers, the selection of metastatic breast cancer patients who are most likely to derive benefit relies on retrospective identification of prognostic factors in patients receiving these therapies. In published studies, patient characteristics most often reported to be associated with prolonged survival include long disease-free interval between the treatment of the primary cancer and the diagnosis of liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], small size and/or low number of liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], well-differentiated histopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and response to pre-interventional or preoperative chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In some studies, patients demonstrating extrahepatic disease were generally excluded from local or locoregional treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the studies that did include patients with tumor spread beyond the liver, presence of extrahepatic disease was identified as a poor prognostic factor by some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] but not all investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the study by Jakobs et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], presence of extrahepatic disease in patients undergoing RFA of liver metastases was associated with poor prognosis; however, this did not apply to patients who had bone metastases as their only extrahepatic tumor site.</p><p>Since factors predictive for treatment benefit should be available before treatment is started, we first analyzed the survival impact of parameters prior to treatment only. Of these parameters, only large liver volume, tumor diameter of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3.9&#x000a0;cm, and at least 3 lines of chemotherapy prior to local treatment were associated with poor prognosis. Presence of extrahepatic disease showed a tendency towards a negative prognostic impact (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.058) when only factors known prior to the therapeutic decision were included. The negative effect almost vanished if extrahepatic disease was limited to bone metastases only. To evaluate the survival benefit conferred by locally ablative treatment, parameters related to treatment outcome that were available at follow-up only were entered into a subsequent analysis. Sustained local control of the liver lesions and objective treatment response were the strongest predictors of good outcome in this setting, whereas neither the presence of any extrahepatic disease, nor evidence of bone metastases as the only extrahepatic tumor site preserved their tendency towards a negative prognostic impact.. Interestingly, the impact of prior chemotherapy was also no longer significant, indicating that even heavily pre-treated patients may derive benefit from locoregional treatment modalities if local control of the liver lesions is achieved.</p><p>The treatments used in our study appeared to be generally safe, with no grade 4 toxicities observed and only few grade 3 toxicities occurring exclusively among patients treated with RE. Although a tendency towards decreased survival in patients developing grade 3 toxicity was noted, this was not significant. A larger analysis is required to reliably establish the relationship between treatment toxicity and outcome, and to determine how toxicities occurring after locally ablative treatment impact patient&#x02019;s tolerance for further antineoplastic therapy.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that patients most likely to derive benefit from local or locoregional LMBC treatment are those with a largest tumor diameter of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;cm and only limited history of systemic chemotherapy prior to treatment. According to our data, patients with controlled extrahepatic disease, and specifically patients with bone metastases as the only extrahepatic site, may be considered for local ablation. We postulate that this is the patient population that should be selected for future trial concepts designed to compare local tumor treatment plus systemic chemotherapy with standard chemotherapy alone.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, we have no sound explanation for the finding that liver volume &#x02265;1376&#x000a0;ml was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor. Because liver volume included the volume of any intrahepatic tumor lesions, one might suspect that this was simply an expression of high tumor load being responsible for increased liver volume, thereby impairing survival. However, there was no correlation between liver volume and the volume of liver metastases (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). For patients undergoing RE, a possible explanation could be that dose calculation according to the BSA method as in our study may lead to relative underdosing of <sup>90</sup>Y in patients whose liver volume to BSA ratio is elevated compared to the average population. Using our data, we were unable to test this hypothesis and any attempt at providing an explanation for this finding must remain speculative. Second, our selection of patients based on the criterion &#x0201c;no uncontrolled extrahepatic disease&#x0201d; was somewhat subjective. This represents clinical practice at our institution as well as in many other centers. It may be appropriate as long as neither a broadly accepted definition of &#x0201c;controllable disease&#x0201d; nor treatment guidelines exist. However, for a future prospective trial a clear definition of what extent of extrahepatic disease is acceptable must be adopted. According to our data, this should clearly include patients with bone metastases only. For extrasceletal metastases, a possible threshold could be sustained disease stabilization for at least 12&#x000a0;months prior to local treatment as in the study by Hoffmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Third, with patients included in our study who underwent RFA, interstitial brachytherapy, and RE, a very heterogeneous spectrum of treatment modalities and tumor distribution within the liver was analyzed. Thermal (RFA) vs. non-thermal (BT and RE) treatments are based on different working principles, as are high-dose (BT) vs. low-dose (RE) radiation therapy. If high-dose, catheter-based brachytherapy or low-dose, microsphere-based radioembolization is more effective in terms of response as well as recurrence rate and survival will be an area of high interest for larger, future analyses. The aim of our study, however, was to obtain information on the general benefit of liver-directed local treatment in metastatic breast cancer and to identify predictive and prognostic factors to help modelling future research strategies. All of the treatments studied exclusively target intrahepatic disease; hence, we considered it appropriate for our exploratory purposes to perform a joint analysis of the results obtained with all of these treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our results confirm that patients with hepatic metastases from breast cancer, despite being incurable in most cases, may have favorable survival outcomes from locoregional treatment of their liver disease. The exact role of such therapies must be established in a randomized trial. Our study supports the assumption that an &#x0201c;oligometastatic&#x0201d; subgroup exists among patients with breast cancer metastases and that, as long as no reliable biomarkers exist to predict disease behavior, even limited extrahepatic disease should not automatically exclude patients from being treated locally.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional files</title><p>
