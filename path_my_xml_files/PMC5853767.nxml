</p><p>The recognition that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of illness in older adults has driven the development of RSV vaccines for this age group [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. RSV circulates annually, but protective immunity is short-lived despite multiple exposures [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies are important for protection; however, cellular immunity is also thought to play a role, probably in limiting viral spread [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>]. Although adults maintain neutralizing antibodies as they age, older adults may be deficient in cellular immune responses to RSV, compared with younger adults [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Immunosenescence poses a challenge for the development of vaccines for older adults, and inclusion of an adjuvant might improve immune responses in this population [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>RSV vaccine candidates generally include the fusion (F) protein of the virus, a highly conserved surface protein essential for infection containing multiple neutralizing and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes. The F protein exists in pre- and postfusion conformations, with prefusion antibodies significantly contributing to the magnitude of neutralizing antibodies in human sera [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The development of vaccines to the prefusion conformation was hindered by manufacturing difficulties, but prefusion vaccine candidates are now being studied [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The monoclonal antibody palivizumab binds postfusion F protein and prevents RSV disease in infants; thus, vaccines that stimulate antibody to postfusion F have been considered viable vaccine candidates [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The postfusion F used in this vaccine study protected cotton rats and mice from experimental challenge [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that an adjuvanted, RSV postfusion F&#x02013;based vaccine shown to be immunogenic in phase 1 studies would protect older adults from RSV illness [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Based on animal studies demonstrating generation of a T-helper type 1&#x02013;biased immune response, the adjuvant selected was glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA), a Toll-like receptor 4 agonist, in a squalene-based oil-in-water stable emulsion (SE) [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Phase 1 data demonstrated appropriate safety and immunogenicity and, based on both cellular and humoral responses, provided support for inclusion of the adjuvant [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, a phase 2b study was conducted to assess the immunogenicity and efficacy of this investigational RSV vaccine among older adults.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s6"><title>METHODS</title><p>The investigational RSV vaccine (MEDI7510) comprised RSV F protein derived from the A2 virus in the postfusion configuration (120 &#x000b5;g, produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and GLA (5 &#x000b5;g), a synthetic analogue of monophosphoryl lipid A, in a 2% squalene-based oil-in-water SE. GLA-SE was provided by and licensed from Immune Design (Seattle, WA) pursuant to an existing agreement. The vaccine was mixed on site from lyophilized RSV F protein (diluted in sterile water) and liquid GLA-SE. It was administered as a 0.5-mL intramuscular dose. Blinding was maintained by wrapping syringe barrels if all were a visual match or by use of an unmasked administrator and a visual shield.</p><p>The randomized, double-blinded, phase 2b clinical study (clinical trials identifier: NCT02508194) was conducted during the 2015&#x02013;2016 RSV season primarily in the United States but also in Canada, Eastern Europe, Chile, and South Africa. Subjects were aged &#x02265;60 years, medically stable, and capable of visiting their study site. Exclusion criteria included influenza vaccination within the prior 6 months, history of an autoimmune disorder other than hypothyroidism, immunosuppression, or receipt of immunoglobulins or blood products within the prior 4 months.</p><p>Subjects received locally approved unadjuvanted, standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) provided by the sponsor (Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine or Vaxigrip vaccine, a trivalent vaccine) and were randomly assigned a ratio of 1:1 to receive saline placebo or RSV vaccine in the other arm; randomization was stratified by age (&#x02264;75 and &#x0003e;75 years) and geographic region (Europe, North America, and southern hemisphere). If subjects experienced 1 day of any respiratory symptom (runny/stuffy nose, sore throat, earache or pain, new/worsening cough, new/worsening sputum, new/worsening subjective wheezing, dyspnea, or exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease), they recorded symptoms daily for 21 days in a paper workbook modified from Flu-PRO, an existing patient-reported-outcomes instrument [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Subjects self-swabbed both nares, using 2 mid-turbinate swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA), on days 2&#x02013;4 of illness and returned to the site on day 4 for site staff to collect mid-turbinate swabs and a sputum specimen if the subject was able to expectorate. Subjects were contacted once per week during peak RSV season and otherwise every other week to remind them of illness procedures.</p><p>Blood specimens were obtained at baseline (before vaccination on day 1), day 29, at the end of the RSV season (30 April in the northern hemisphere; 31 August in the southern hemisphere), and on days 4 and 22 of illness to test for antibodies to RSV F (anti-F immunoglobulin G [IgG]), glycoprotein G from antigenic groups A and B viruses (Ga and Gb, respectively), and the RSV nucleoprotein (N) [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ga, Gb, and N are not components of the vaccine. Hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibodies (to influenza virus) were determined by Focus Diagnostics (Cypress, CA) in samples obtained on days 1 and 29 in the first 910 subjects enrolled in North America; seroresponse was defined as a &#x02265;4-fold increase in titer. RSV A2&#x02013;neutralizing and palivizumab-competitive antibodies [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] were assessed in subjects who met the primary end point of RSV-associated acute respiratory illness (ARI) or were selected to match them (in a 1:6 ratio) or to match the sample size of a group that received the same formulation in a phase 1b study (clinical trials identifier: NCT02289820) through random sampling stratified by age and sex and controlled over baseline anti-F IgG levels, region, and comorbidity status. Cell-mediated response to RSV was measured by RSV interferon &#x003b3; enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in subjects who met the primary end point or who were randomly selected on the basis of sample availability (samples were obtained only from sites in the United States capable of appropriate processing and freezing).</p><p>RSV was detected using the Quidel Lyra RSV plus human metapneumovirus (hMPV) multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (Quidel, San Diego, CA). RSV genotyping (A or B) was performed by <italic>G</italic> gene sequencing at Eurofins Viracor-IBT Laboratories (Lee&#x02019;s Summit, MO).</p><p>The clinical protocol was approved by relevant institutional review boards or ethics committees. All subjects provided written informed consent. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines.</p><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The primary study objective was to assess efficacy for the prevention of RSV-associated ARI in adults aged &#x02265;60 years. RSV-associated ARI was defined on the basis of symptoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) with detection of RSV. A sample size of 1900 subjects randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive vaccine or placebo provided 88% power (by simulation) to demonstrate a lower bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of vaccine efficacy (VE) of &#x0003e;0%. VE was calculated as [1 &#x02013; relative risk] &#x000d7; 100%, where relative risk is calculated as [(rate of RSV-associated ARI in the vaccine group) &#x000f7; (rate of RSV-associated ARI in the placebo group)]. The sample size calculation was based on these assumptions: a VE of 70%, an incidence of RSV-associated ARI in placebo recipients of 2.5% [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a dropout rate of 10%, a 2-sided &#x003b1; of 0.1, and a superiority margin 0%.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Symptom Locations and Definitions of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)&#x02013;Associated Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) and Lower Respiratory Tract Illness (LRTI)</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symptom or Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Location</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Upper respiratory tract</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nasal congestion/rhinorrhea (runny or stuffy nose), sore throat, and earache or ear pain</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lower respiratory tract</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), sputum (coughing up sputum or phlegm), and wheezing by self-report</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Systemic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myalgias or arthralgias (overall body aches), fatigue (tiredness), headache, decreased appetite, and feverishness</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Definition</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARI (primary end point)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Detection of RSV in at least 1 respiratory sample at the time of illness plus &#x02265;1 symptom from any 2 of 3 locations</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LRTI (secondary end point)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Detection of RSV in at least 1 respiratory sample at the time of illness plus &#x02265;2 lower respiratory tract symptoms</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The primary analysis was conducted in the per-protocol population, defined as all subjects dosed and analyzed by product received who were followed for symptoms until their first RSV-associated ARI or the end of the surveillance period. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population, analyzed by randomized treatment group, included all subjects who were randomly assigned to a study group and dosed. A high-risk subgroup was determined before unmasking by selecting terms preferred by the <italic>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</italic>, version 19, for medical history that placed the subject in a risk category for severe influenza [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The primary end point, the incidence of the first RSV-associated ARI episode occurring &#x02265;14 days after vaccination and within the RSV surveillance period, was evaluated by constructing a 2-sided 90% CI for VE in the vaccine group as compared to the placebo group. A period of 14 days was selected to eliminate the risk of including subjects with incubating disease and to permit an immune response to vaccination. The CI was estimated by an exact conditional method dependent on the total number of cases [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. If the lower bound of the 90% CI was &#x0003e;0%, VE would be demonstrated. A modified Poisson regression with robust error variance was conducted to adjust for duration of follow-up, and a multiple imputation analysis was conducted to address the impact of missing data, both in the ITT population. To evaluate the effect of RSV vaccine on the immune response to IIV, 910 subjects had predose and day 29 postdose HAI antibodies assessed after receipt of Fluzone Quadrivalent, for a 90% power to demonstrate a 1.5-fold noninferiority margin for the postdose HAI antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios (calculated as the GMT of HAI antibody in the placebo group divided by that of the vaccine group) for each of 4 strains. The power calculation was based on a 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test, assuming log-normal distribution, a 1-sided &#x003b1; of 0.025, a standard deviation for the HAI GMT of 1.48 in natural log transformation, an attrition rate of 10%, and no true difference between both groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8"><title>RESULTS</title><p>As planned, 1900 subjects were enrolled.

There was no clinically identifiable patient population that could potentially derive benefit from the vaccine.</p><p>There were no identifiable flaws in study execution that would have led to these results. Our older adult population was highly compliant, despite limitations of age and health for some, and data quality was good. Although the study was underpowered for the observed incidence, the absence of a trend toward efficacy indicates that a much larger study would not be expected to reach a different conclusion. For example, if 3500 subjects had been enrolled, and, hypothetically, the VE was 70% in the additional 1600 subjects, the overall study VE would be 29% (90% CI, &#x02013;20%&#x02013;58%). The study end point, RSV-associated ARI, performed well, and use of a more stringent definition did not result in observed efficacy. The F antigen used in this study was from the same lot used in the phase 1 program. The adjuvant was from a new lot manufactured by the previously used process, and release specifications were met. The study appears to have failed because the vaccine did not generate adequate protective antibodies, either because antibodies to postfusion F were not qualitatively appropriately protective or because sufficiently high titers of anti&#x02013;postfusion F neutralizing antibodies were not generated.</p><p>The vaccine induced a significant immune response, which declined during the RSV season, as has been observed after wild-type RSV infection [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, RSV-associated ARI end points were not clustered in the end of the season, suggesting that the decline in immunogenicity did not lead to low efficacy. Although immunogenicity was lower than that observed in the phase 1b study (data not shown), this finding could have been due to population differences, and responses confirmed correct randomization and excluded significant loss of potency. Neutralizing antibody titers and cellular responses were not collected for all subjects in this study and RSV B neutralizing antibodies were not assessed; however, in a previous study, neutralizing antibodies to a type B strain were demonstrated after immunization with this vaccine. Because similar numbers of types A and B viruses were detected, it is unlikely that failure to prevent type B RSV infection was an important cause of the lack of efficacy. The observation that responses were greater in the F IgG assay than in the microneutralization assay suggests that many antibodies generated were nonneutralizing and therefore ineffective.</p><p>Although neutralizing antibody to the F protein is known to be protective in infants and to correlate with protection in older adults, this adjuvanted F protein&#x02013;based RSV vaccine joins other F-based vaccines in failing to prevent RSV disease in adults [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Most recently, after a successful phase 2 study, the Novavax RSV F&#x02013;based vaccine failed to prevent RSV disease in a phase 3 study, with outcomes very similar to those reported here (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://novavax.com/presentation.show">http://novavax.com/presentation.show</ext-link>). The F protein used in current study, in the postfusion conformation, contains neutralizing epitopes including antigenic sites I, II, and IV on the F1 subunit [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recently, antibodies to the prefusion conformation were shown to have greater neutralizing activity, including in adults, than antibodies to postfusion F; in particular, antibodies to site &#x000d8;, which are not induced by postfusion F, are far more important than those to site II (the palivizumab epitope), which are induced by both prefusion and postfusion F [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that a postfusion F&#x02013;based vaccine may not generate appropriate neutralizing antibodies to prevent RSV disease in older adults; however, the efficacies of palivizumab and motavizumab suggest that, at least in young children, there is a concentration of antibodies to site II that can protect against RSV disease [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The observed incidence of RSV disease in this study did not reflect the epidemiologic incidence of disease in older adults. Dosing in this study occurred during the upslope of the RSV season so that part of the epidemic curve was excluded [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. More RSV disease occurred in the southern hemisphere (2.7% in the placebo group), and the start of dosing was more timely for that inverted seasonality (but the sample size was small). Although most study subjects had underlying diseases, the oldest and most frail elderly subjects (who might have the highest RSV disease rates) were underrepresented. End points were probably underreported. Only about 29% of subjects had an illness visit, which is low frequency as compared to other studies [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; in addition, we know that subjects with respiratory diseases such as pneumonia or exacerbation of respiratory illness often did not consider these to be potential RSV illnesses despite being asked to do so. Also, no patient was tested for RSV during a hospitalization. The RSV incidence assumption for sample size calculation was 2.5%, based primarily on the report from McClure et al [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], with adjustment for lack of requirement of medical attendance in the current study. In healthy adults aged &#x02265;65 years, the incidence of RSV infection (not necessarily medically attended) diagnosed on the basis of culture, RT-PCR, or serologic test results was 3%&#x02013;7% annually [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In our study, diagnosis on the basis of serologic test results was 5.3%&#x02013;5.8%. The 2015&#x02013;2016 season, based on MedImmune internal data from laboratory surveillance (primarily based on pediatric respiratory samples), was typical of recent RSV seasons (data not shown).</p><p>The trend toward efficacy against hMPV is an intriguing finding. Although this study was not designed to evaluate VE against hMPV, the findings may be meaningful and deserve consideration. Monoclonal antibodies with efficacy against both hMPV and RSV have been generated, and cross-neutralization is hypothesized to occur, based on a conserved region of the F protein [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Anti-hMPV efficacy demonstrates biologic activity and suggests that the lack of efficacy was RSV specific.</p><p>The failure of this vaccine has broad implications for the field. Our vaccine contained a potent Toll-like receptor 4 agonist in a SE and a large quantity of antigen (close to the maximum that could feasibly be included in a vaccine), which suggests creating an improved postfusion F protein&#x02013;based vaccine will be difficult. Inclusion of an F protein in the prefusion configuration may improve immunogenicity and efficacy. It is also possible that antibodies to the RSV G protein are protective; however, the need to match the highly variable G protein to circulating strains might entail periodic reformulation and inclusion of &#x0003e;1 genotype, which would be a significant barrier to a preventive strategy [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We plan to continue to investigate the immune responses to this RSV vaccine to better understand protective immunity against RSV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s13"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
