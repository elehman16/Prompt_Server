It has been described that there is a curvilinear relationship between EPOC magnitude (total O<sub>2</sub> consumed during recovery) and exercise intensity (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A larger EPOC [effect size (ES)=0.9] is observed after high-intensity exercise, compared to moderate-intensity ones, even when the total work performed is matched (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The EPOC magnitude is also related to the exercise duration, in particular after a high-intensity, supramaximal exercise (SE) bout (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). For example, Bahr et al. (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) demonstrated that the EPOC magnitude was positively correlated to the exercise duration of an SE performed at 108% peak oxygen uptake (&#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2 peak</sub>), once EPOC increased from 5.6 to 16.3 L (ES=6.3) as the exercise duration increased from 2 to 6 min. It is interesting to note that a single SE bout performed until exhaustion is considered a time-efficient alternative to increase post-exercise energy expenditure. This may have clinical applications because a single SE bout would increase post-exercise fat oxidation and insulin sensibility (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, any manipulation that increases the time length of an SE bout will directly affect EPOC magnitude. This would be of practical relevance because a larger EPOC will increase post-exercise energy expenditure, which in turn could help individuals engaged in weight loss programs to reduce their body mass more rapidly and ameliorate their metabolic profile.</p><p>Regarding the main strategies to prolong SE duration, there are some evidences suggesting that high-carbohydrate (CHO) availability has an important role (ES ranging from 0.7 to 2.4) (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that the time to exhaustion during an SE was increased after 48 h under a high-CHO diet, when compared to an isocaloric, low-CHO diet (ES=2.4) (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This improvement in exercise tolerance with a high-CHO diet might be associated with several mechanisms such as an attenuation of central fatigue, a better maintenance of excitation-contraction coupling, a maintenance of CHO oxidation, and a reduced exercise-induced strain (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In this regard, it could be hypothesized that the longer endurance time during an SE after a high-CHO diet period could lead to a greater EPOC and to a higher total energy expenditure in a given exercise training session, which could potentiate the body weight loss and reestablish metabolic balance in individuals engaged in training programs for health promotion. Thus, the interplay between SE duration and diet on post-exercise metabolism is an important point to consider when making decisions about training prescription and establishing weight-loss approaches.</p><p>Therefore, we performed new analyses using a data set from a large project previously published (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) in order to determine the effects of a high-CHO diet on the EPOC after an SE bout performed until exhaustion. We hypothesized that the high-CHO diet would increase SE tolerance, thereby increasing EPOC compared to an isocaloric, low-CHO diet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on the ES of a high-CHO diet on the SE duration and on the ES of SE duration on the EPOC, reported in Lima-Silva et al. (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and Bahr et al. (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The expected ESs from these studies were 2.4 and 4.0, respectively. Thus, using the lowest ES (2.4), the minimum sample size required in this study for an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.80 was 4 participants. Therefore, after receiving verbal and written explanations, and signing an informed consent, 5 physically active males (age 31.0&#x000b1;7.7 years, height 180.2&#x000b1;4.3 cm, body mass 77.0&#x000b1;7.7 kg, body fat 13.3&#x000b1;2.9%, &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2 peak</sub> 48.6&#x000b1;11.5 mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>) volunteered to participate in this study, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidade de S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil.</p></sec><sec><title>Preliminary test and SE familiarization</title><p>Participants completed an incremental test to exhaustion (starting at 50 W and increasing 20 W every 3 min) on a cycle ergometer (Ergo Fit 167, Ergo-FitGmbH &#x00026; Co., Germany) to determine their first and second lactate thresholds (LT<sub>1</sub> and LT<sub>2</sub>, respectively) and &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2 peak</sub>. Exhaustion was assumed when participants were unable to maintain a pedal cadence above 60 rpm. Blood micro-samples (25 &#x003bc;L) were obtained at each stage from the earlobe and immediately analyzed for blood lactate concentration (La) [YSI 1500 Sport, Yellow Springs Instruments, USA]. The &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2</sub> was continuously measured breath-by-breath (Quark b2, Cosmed, Italy). The blood La was plotted as a function of the workload, and the LT<sub>1</sub> and LT<sub>2</sub> were identified by a 3-segment linear regression (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The 3-segment linear regression fitting was done using an interactive process with two initially unknown intercepts calculated from every possible combination of intersections. The intercepts that best shared the curve in three linear segments were assumed when the highest R<sup>2</sup> value and the lowest residual sum of squares were attained. The LT<sub>1</sub> was therefore defined as the workload corresponding to an initial change in the rate of lactate accumulation in the blood, while LT<sub>2</sub> was defined as the workload corresponding to the second change in the rate of lactate accumulation. The &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2 peak</sub> was defined as the highest 30-s &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2 peak</sub> average at the end of the test.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to familiarize the participants with the experimental procedures, they performed an SE at 115% of &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2 peak</sub> until exhaustion, 48 h after the incremental test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). At this intensity (100 to 120% &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2 peak</sub>), the exercise can be tolerated for a sufficient time to develop a reasonable EPOC, as previously reported (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); time to exhaustion was also expected to be prolonged by the high-CHO diet in this exercise intensity, as reported elsewhere (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design.

Immediately after the test, they sat comfortably on a chair for 60 min.

The exercise tolerance was significantly longer in high- than in low-CHO diet, thereby inducing a higher VO<sub>2</sub> during the exercise as well as after the exercise. These results suggest that high-CHO diet confers benefits considering exercise tolerance and energy expenditure during and after a single SE bout.</p><p>The high-CHO diet increased exercise duration (&#x0223c;32%) and total mechanical work (&#x0223c;34%) during a single SE bout. The increased tolerance further led to an increased exercise energy expenditure (i.e., &#x0223c;30% VO<sub>2</sub> increase). Previous studies had already demonstrated that energy expenditure during a high-intensity exercise is proportional to its duration (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although the anaerobic metabolism is highly demanded during high-intensity exercises, the additional energy expenditure necessary to support longer SE with high-CHO availability is probably covered by aerobic metabolism (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Although the mechanism for an increased SE tolerance with high-CHO availability is not fully understood, the assumption of elevated pre-exercise muscle glycogen stores seems to be improbable. Studies have shown that muscle glycogen is not fully depleted after a single SE bout performed until exhaustion (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), so that the remaining muscle glycogen would be sufficient to supply ATP and sustain a longer exercise. Therefore, fatigue during SE may be related to other factors such as a better metabolite balance, reduced exercise-induced strain and maintenance of excitation-contraction coupling (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Additionally, the higher CHO availability can also play a central role by reducing the perceived effort during exercise, thus increasing the fatigue tolerance (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting result of this study was that the longer SE found with the high-CHO diet was accompanied by a greater EPOC magnitude, which indicates elevated post-exercise energy expenditure. The EPOC magnitude has been attributed to several mechanisms such as beta adrenergic stimulation, triglyceride/fatty acids cycling, body temperature, increased lactate removal and oxidation, replenishment of muscle and blood oxygen stores, and creatine phosphate resynthesis (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Even though the shift from CHO to fat oxidation after the exercise bout with low-CHO availability may lead to an elevated EPOC (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), in the present study the EPOC magnitude was &#x0223c;34% greater with high-CHO diet. This result suggests that the exercise duration during an SE bout is an important factor influencing EPOC magnitude (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Bahr et al. (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) demonstrated that EPOC increased 3 times (ES=6.3 large) with a 3 times longer SE (from 2 to 6 min). A similar proportion has also been demonstrated by Hagberg et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"/>
<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"/>), who reported that EPOC increased 5 times when a high-intensity exercise (80% of &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2 peak</sub>) was 4 times longer (from 5 to 20 min). Interestingly, this &#x0223c;1:1 proportion and moderate to large ES persisted in the present study (i.e., 32% longer exercise, 34% larger EPOC magnitude, and large and moderate ES, respectively). In fact, longer exercise duration is thought to provoke larger metabolic disruption (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,), which might directly affect the return to homeostasis after the exercise. In this sense, prolonging the SE bout by &#x0223c;32% must have increased metabolic disturbance in the present study, and this may have been sufficient to proportionally increase EPOC magnitude (&#x0223c;34%).</p><p>Because exercise and post-exercise VO<sub>2</sub> were increased, the total energy expenditure demanded in the training session (exercise+recovery) was 34% larger in high- than in low-CHO diet. This result suggests that combining high-CHO diet and a SE bout until exhaustion could provide benefits considering energy expenditure. Recently, it has been debated that the lack of free time in modern life is a limiting factor for exercise practice and adherence (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In this context, a short-duration SE bout until exhaustion has also been introduced as an alternative training model to stimulate active life style and to induce body weight reduction (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In a practical perspective, a few minutes of SE per day could increase daily energy expenditure. Interestingly, a single SE bout until exhaustion has been suggested to elicit similar health benefits compared to several intermittent bouts of SE with short intervals for recovery, despite the shorter duration of the former (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that a high-CHO diet seems to confer additional benefits regarding the total energy expended during a SE bout performed until exhaustion. It would be interesting to investigate in further studies the accumulative effect of combining a high-CHO diet and training with a single exhaustive bout of SE on energy expenditure, weight loss and metabolic adaptations.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study is the small sample size. However, in an attempt to minimize possible bias, we calculated the Cohen&#x02019;s ES between conditions for time to exhaustion, total O<sub>2</sub> consumed, EPOC magnitude and total O<sub>2</sub> demanded (exercise+recovery). Despite the small sample size, the statistical power ranged from 0.69 to 0.98 for total O<sub>2</sub> consumed, EPOC magnitude and total O<sub>2</sub> demanded (exercise+recovery). Therefore, the sample size was enough to achieve a satisfactory power effect, which in turn avoids a type II error. In addition, we are not able to extrapolate our results to a longitudinal perspective; further studies investigating the effect of combining a high-CHO diet and SE on energy expenditure and metabolic balance using a longitudinal-intervention design, are required.</p><p>In summary, when compared to a low-CHO diet, a high-CHO diet leads to a higher exercise tolerance, and higher consumed oxygen during and after a single exhaustive SE bout. From a practical standpoint, this might be an appealing strategy for a less time-consuming training and weight loss.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
