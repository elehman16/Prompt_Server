To extent its applicability to medium-sized defects MFx has been combined with a collagen type I/III matrix (Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). This technique is called Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and meanwhile a clinically established treatment option for localized full-thickness small- to medium-sized cartilage defects. Despite its more spreading clinical use, clinical data published so far are limited to mainly case report series.</p><p>In this study, we report the first results of a randomized, controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>versus MFx. Patients enrolled in 2 centers were included in this analysis. 38 patients (aged 21-50 years, mean defect size 3.4 cm<sup>2</sup>) were randomized and treated either with MFx, with sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Clinical outcomes (modified Cincinnati and ICRS score) could be assessed in 30 patients at 1-year and 27 patients at 2-years post-operation. Improvements in both scores were seen at 1-and 2-years post-operation, irrespective of the technique used. MRI assessment revealed a satisfactory and homogenous defect filling in the majority of patients. No treatment-related adverse events were reported.</p><p>This interim analysis confirms the mid-term results for AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> reported in literature. It demonstrates clearly that clinical outcomes at 1-year post-operation are maintained at 2-years. Therefore we consider enhancing MFx with Chondro-Gide<sup><bold>&#x000ae;</bold></sup> is a valid and safe cartilage repair option for small- to medium-sized cartilage defects of the knee.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Articular cartilage</kwd><kwd>Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC&#x000ae;)</kwd><kwd>Chondro-Gide&#x000ae;</kwd><kwd>microfracture</kwd><kwd>knee surgery.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cartilage defects are a frequent complication after traumatic knee injury with affected patients suffering from significant pain, morbidity and impaired mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Due to the low intrinsic healing capacity of human articular cartilage, spontaneous healing of the damaged tissue cannot be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p>Repair of the very complex articular cartilage tissue has been carried out with varying success with the goal to reduce pain, to regain mobility in affected patients by producing repair tissue that can withstand the demands of daily activity and sports, and to postpone or even avoid total knee replacement. A variety of surgical techniques that aim to resurface and repair the damaged articular cartilage have evolved. These include bone marrow stimulation methods, such as Pridie drilling, abrasion and microfracture (MFx) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], implantation techniques, such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), matrix-induced autologouschondrocyte implantation (MACI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], and mosaicplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Currently MFxis recommended as the treatment of choice for smaller cartilage defects (&#x0003c;2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], while ACI or MACI are frequently used for larger defects based on the publication of beneficial mid- and long-term results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"> 10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p>Marrow stimulation methods involve penetration of the subchondral bone plate to access the bone marrow compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The resulting blood clot enriched with bone marrow elements is thought to provide a favorable microenvironment for the development of the cartilage repair tissue. This so-called superclot is capable of further stimulating the migration, proliferation, and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p>Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is an innovative and clinically established treatment for localized full-thickness cartilage defects. It combines MFx treatment with Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (GeistlichPharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) with the goal to extent the applicability of MFx from small to medium-sized cartilage defects. Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a well-documented natural collagen type I/III matrix, is routinely used as a substitute for periost in ACI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"> 15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and ACI cell-seeded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"> 19</xref>] with good clinical outcomes. Its unique bilayer structure allows for optimal attachment and in-growth of cells and cartilage matrix deposition through its scaffold function and provides protection through the compact layer facing the knee cavity.</p><p>In AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, the formed blood clot, which is subsequently transformed into cartilaginous repair tissue by the contained bone marrow components, is immediately stabilized by the Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> matrix covering the microfractured area. This may improve primary and hence secondary defect filling. An investigation of cell-laden and cell-free matrix-induced chondrogenesis techniques in a sheep model found formation of repair tissue of greater thickness when the Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> matrix was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p>The expected clinical results of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>should be comparable to those reported for MFx. Generally in cartilage repair, a number of factors are critical to treatment success, including the defect filling, the integration of the tissue regenerate into the adjacent cartilage and post-operative rehabilitation program. Irrespective of the method used, clinical outcomes after cartilage repair have been reported to be better with smaller defect size and younger age, and better clinical scores are generally achieved at the femoral condyle compared with the patella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"> 11</xref>].</p><p>AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a simple, single-step procedure and may be of particular benefit when expensive two-staged implantation techniques are not an option for financial or logistic reasons.</p><p>First clinical results of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> are already published, which will be discussed later in this paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"> 21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], but no randomized study was performed yet.</p><p>We decided to conduct an interims analysis of an ongoing, prospective, randomized, controlled trial in order to verify reported clinical findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>A prospective, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the AMIC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>technique compared to MFx in the treatment of small-to-medium sized cartilage defects (&#x0003e;2 cm<sup>2</sup>) of the knee.</p><p>Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age with 1 or 2 cartilage defects of grade III or IV according to the Outerbridge classification and a defect size between 2 and 10 cm<sup>2 </sup>were enrolled onto the study. Patients with more than 2 defects, 2 corresponding defects or defects on both knees were excluded from the study, as were those with signs of osteoarthrosis, bone lesion &#x0003e;0.7 cm and uncorrected knee instability. Further exclusion criteria were rheumatoid arthritis, parainfectious or infectious diseases, chronic heart, endocrine, metabolic or autoimmune disease, varus or valgus deformation, previous complete meniscus resection or mosaicplasty, treatment with cartilage specific medication (e.g. hyaluronic acid) and chondropathia patellae or dysplasia of the patella.</p><p>At arthroscopy patients were randomly assigned to 1of 3 study groups receiving the following treatments: microfracture (MFx); sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(fixation of Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> with sutures); or glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (fixation of Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>with fibrin glue) by drawing a sealed envelope. The study endpoints included clinical evaluation comprising modified Cincinnati and ICRS score as well as MRI evaluation with emphasis on defect filling at 1-and 2-year follow-up. All patients agreed to undertake a strict postoperative physiotherapy program and provided informed written consent before arthroscopy was performed.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (03-088 and 03/173-MZ) and was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. It was not registered at a clinical trial register, because at the time of setup in 2003, such a registration was not obligatory.</p><p>The interim analysis presented here includes all patients randomized and treated at the Orthopedic Clinic, Heilig Geist Spital, Ravensburg, and the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Regensburg between January 2004 and March 2010. Not all patients were available at 1- or 2-year follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Procedures</title><p>MFx was performed according to the technique published by Steadman <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"> 4</xref>] as an arthroscopic procedure. For the AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> groups a miniarthrotomy was performed. A collagen type I/III matrix (Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) was additionally added to cover the microfractured defect area. Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was placed with the porous layer facing the bone surface and fixed either using sutures (PDS 5.0, Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany; sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or by gluing the matrix onto the bone surface with fibrin glue (Tissucol, Baxter, Unterschleissheim, Germany; glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The stable position of the Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> matrix was checked by flexing and extending the knee 10 times. An intra-articular drain without suction was inserted, the wound closed, and patients were hospitalized for 2-5 days after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative Rehabilitation Program</title><p>After surgery, patients were submitted to a strict rehabilitation program. To assign all patients to the same scheme was judged appropriate since AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as enhanced MFx is based on bone marrow stimulation and involves the same cartilage healing mechanism as MFx alone.</p><p>The staged program included increasing weight bearing and mobilization exercises, electrotherapy of leg muscles, proprioception, walking, and sports as indicated in Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>.</p><p>Scar tissue management for the patients with mini-arthrotomy is not specifically listed in this table but was part of the clinical routine.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of Clinical Outcome and Safety</title><p>Clinical outcome was assessed by physical examination, and using the Modified Cincinnati [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and Modified International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] Scores. The Modified Cincinnati Score is divided into the three parts: assessment of knee function (6-30 points); clinical pathology (0-20 points); and highest activity level without pain (0-50 points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. A maximal score of 100 points is possible. The Modified ICRS Score consists of ratings carried out by the patient and the surgeon. Patients were asked to rate their pain and the functional status of the affected knee. In this study, pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain). Functional status was rated according to the ICRS Cartilage Injury Standard Evaluation Form-2000 from normal to severely abnormal. The affected knee was evaluated by the surgeon with respect to functional status (i.e. knee-related limitation in the daily activity), classification, and crepitation, utilizing parts 3, 4 and 7 of the ICRS form. Classification of the affected knee was performed using the Lachman test, valgus and varus rotation, and pivot shift. Each test was graded from normal to severely abnormal, and the lowest grade within an assessment determined the final grade for this assessment.</p><p>Safety was evaluated by physical examination and continuous monitoring of adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI Analysis</title><p>Structural regeneration of the cartilage defect was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed by an independent radiologist, with a focus on the extent, signal intensity and surface of the defect filling, integration to adjacent cartilage, and bone marrow lesion (BML).</p><p>This adapted scoring system takes into account a variety of features that are currently believed to be relevant to the integrity of cartilage repair tissue as used in the MOCART-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] after ACI and semiquantitative MRI-scores of osteoarthritis established as WORMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and BLOKS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Inferential data analysis of treatment effects was performed by the Brunner-Langer-approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], suitable for analyzing designs of this type. By its non-parametric construction, it is especially suitable for small samples. Since Brunner-Langer-models are able to deal with incomplete records (under the general assumption of missing completely at random), all available data (not only those from patients with complete records) were used in this analysis.</p><p>Due to the exploratory nature of this interim analysis, no correction for multiple testing is performed; thus the significance level of 5% is used as a threshold for hypotheses testing. For each of the endpoints listed in the next section, two questions were addressed:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Do the values differ systematically over time? (e.g. main effect of time).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do the changes over time differ systematically between treatments?

Seven patients (2 in the MFx, 4 in the sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and 1 in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group) could not be evaluated at either 1-or 2-years post-operation and for 1 patient in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group only 2-year results were available. MRI data were missing for 1 patient at 1-year post-operation in the sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group and for 2 patients at 2-years in the MFx goup. Assessment of clinical outcome and safety at 1-year post-operation was therefore performed in 30 patients (8 in the MFx group, 9 in the sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and 13 in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group). For 27 patients (6 in the MFx group, 8 in the sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group, and 13 in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group) 2-year results were available at the time of the interim analysis (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>).</p><p>Characteristics of the patients included in the interims analysis are shown in Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref></bold>.</p><p>Mean age at surgery was 37 years (range 21&#x02014;50). 21 patients had previously undergone surgery at the affected knee and the mean defect size after debridement was 3.4 cm<sup>2</sup> (range 2.1&#x02014;6.6 cm<sup>2</sup>). Baseline characteristics were largely comparable between groups. The proportion of patients with meniscus revisions was higher and the proportion of patients with defect class III was lower in the MFx group compared with the other 2 groups. The proportion of patients with injuries was higher in the sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group compared with the other 2 groups for patients with available 2-year data, whereas it was lower in the MFx group compared with the other 2 groups for patients with available 1-year data.</p><p>Statistical analysis revealed no significant changes also due to the small patient number in the different treatment groups.

Complete integration was observed in no patient in the MFx group, 2 patients in the sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group and 3 patients in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group. The quality of the regenerate surface and defect cover were similar in all 3 groups; with a trend towards reduced surface quality, but better defect cover in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group. The occurrence of bone marrow lesions was comparable between the groups and no further ossification has been observed.</p><p>Fig. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>) shows an example of an MRI evaluation performed 12 months post-operation in 1 patient treated with glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, demonstrating a complete and almost homogenous filling of the defect.</p><p>At 2-years post-operation, defect filling was largely comparable between the groups without statistical significances. Complete integration or with marginal gap was seen in 3 patients in the MFx group, 8 patients in the sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group and 11 patients in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>No treatment-related adverse events were reported for any of the patients included in this interim analysis. One patient treated with glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> received a joint replacement after 1-year and dropped out of the efficacy analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> combines MFx treatment with the application of Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>and was developed with the aim of offering a simple and effective treatment for small- to medium-sized cartilage defects (&#x0003e;2 cm<sup>2</sup>). To gather information on the medium-term effectiveness of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> a RCT in patients with cartilage defects of the knee was started in 2004.</p><p>It was originally planned to include 120 patients, 40 in each group. Accordingly computer assisted block randomization was carried out in blocks of 30. Since the 2 sites included in this interim analysis could not enroll all their allocated patients yet, the number of patients in each study group varies and is particularly low in the MFx group. This makes comparisons between the groups even more difficult.</p><p>Already at the beginning of the study it proved to be extremely difficult to convince patients to participate, since they did not want to be treated with MFx only. Hence, recruitment was very slow and is still ongoing to enroll the adequate number of patients. It is even more difficult as AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a clinically established cartilage repair option, available without participation in a study.</p><p>Discussion and justification of the study design is necessary for several reasons. When AMIC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>was developed, Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>was thought to be sutured to the defect site, as in ACI. Since fixation with fibrin glue had been established for MACI, a third group - glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, was added. Meanwhile gluing is routinely carried out and proved to be a feasible fixation technique. It has been shown that surgical suturing of articular cartilage can induce osteoarthritis-like changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Therefore, the sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technique has largely been replaced by glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The superiority of gluing is supported by published results demonstrating that biphasic carrier constructs, consisting of fibrin glue and a Chondro-Gide<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> matrix, improve chondrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p>In 2003 when the study was designed different outcome scores for cartilage were used. Here the Cincinnati, not specific for cartilage as for instance the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), was chosen in addition to the ICRS score.</p><p>The postoperative rehabilitation protocol was the same for all treatment groups since AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as enhanced MFx is based on bone marrow stimulation and involves the same cartilage healing mechanism as MFx alone. A possible effect of the different surgical approach, arthroscopic versus mini-arthrotomy, was not addressed in this study. The arthroscopical approach is less invasive compared to mini-arthrotomy, but effects on cartilage healing are unlikely to be still detectable at 1-year. No adverse events, e.g. pain or impaired motion related to scarring were reported.</p><p>Overall, our data are in agreement with the results of Gille <italic>et al</italic>. reporting a significant improvement in clinical outcomes in patients treated with AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, assessed by 5 different scores up to 36 months. 87% of their patients treated with AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were subjectively highly satisfied with the results after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Although patient satisfaction with the treatment chosen was not directly assessed in our analysis, the positive results obtained not only in scores assessed by the surgeon, but also in subjective patient ratings are encouraging.</p><p>The findings presented here demonstrate improved Modified Cincinnati and ICRS scores and an improvement in clinical symptoms at 1- and 2-years post-operation for most of the patients, irrespective of the technique used.</p><p>Mean changes from baseline in the Modified Cincinnati Scores were slightly higher in the MFx and sutured AMIC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>groups compared with the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group at 1-year, but comparable at 2-years post-operation. Interestingly, the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group comprised 1 patient who presented with a worsened Cincinnati Score at 1-year post-operation, but who showed clinical improvement to above baseline scores at 2-years. In agreement with results published by Gille <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], where further improvements in Cincinnati scores were observed up to 24 months post-operation, this may indicate that the beneficial effects of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> may become more prominent after the first post-operative year. While the majority of patients either remained stable or showed further improvement during the second year post-operation, 1 patient in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group presented with decreased Cincinnati Scores at 2-years post-operation, despite having shown initial improvement at the 1-year assessment.</p><p>The ICRS score largely remained stable or further improved at 2-years compared to 1-year post-operation. This result is again in agreement with published results of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>where a significant increase in mean ICRS values was noted at 12 and 24 months post-operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, pain was found reduced in all treatment groups at 1-year post-operation and further decreased at 2-years in the majority of patients. Only 1 patient in the glued AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group reported increased pain over time; however, pain was rated very low at baseline and as light pain at 2-years post-operation.</p><p>When drawing conclusions from the clinical evaluations, especially assessments conducted by the patients themselves, it needs to be taken into account that these are subjective and may, for example, depend on patient expectations. Here differences in patient rated assessments and surgeons rated ones were not analyzed since sample sizes were too small to draw conclusions. However, in the ICRS score patients rated their part of functional status overall lower than the surgeons by clinical assessment. Both reported a positive trend over time.</p><p>MRI assessment revealed good defect filling in the majority of patients, independent of the treatment method. The proportion of patients with homogenous repair tissue was found to be approximately 50% at 1-year post-operation in all 3 groups. It remained 50% in both AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> groups at 2-years but improved in the 4 MFx patients with available 2-year MRI data to 100% homogenous. Radiologic evaluation showed slightly inferior outcome in the AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> groups, especially with regard to the surface of the regenerate and degree of integration. However, in the 2-year analysis of clinical outcomes, which included 4 patients treated with MFx, these observations were not confirmed; outcomes were satisfying and comparable for all groups. Indicators for poor mid- and long-term outcome could be a possible thickening of the subchondral layer, bony overgrowth, or the formation of subchondral cysts after bone marrow stimulation and were not observed yet in the study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><p>Studies have suggested that the repair tissue formed after ACI may be more hyaline-like and therefore of higher quality and durability than the regenerate formed following bone marrow stimulating techniques, such as MFx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"> 37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"> 38</xref>]. However, the association between hyaline-like structural repair and clinical outcome remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"> 39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"> 40</xref>]. In one comparative study, ACI and MFx provided similar clinical and radiographic results 2 and 5 years after surgery, and no correlation between histological findings and clinical outcome could be shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].</p><p>Comparison of these results with medium-term results of other cartilage regeneration techniques is difficult due to the small analysis population in this assessment, and because of the different evaluation and scoring systems used. To date, no randomized controlled studies have been published comparing AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> with other cartilage repair procedures. Several randomized studies have, however, compared outcomes after ACI, MFx or transplantation techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"> 39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"> 41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Whilst ACI was reported to be superior to mosaicplasty in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], other authors found these techniques to be clinically equivalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. In studies comparing ACI and MFx, both techniques provided satisfactory outcomes at 2- and 5-years after surgery, with no significant differences in the clinical and radiographic results between the 2 treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"> 43</xref>]. Evaluation of clinical and histological outcomes after ACI and osteochondral cylinder transplantation revealed a decrease in symptoms with both techniques, but the onset of recovery was slower with ACI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Characterized chondrocyte implantation (CCI) was found to produce superior structural repair to MFx 1-year after treatment. However, clinical outcomes in the KOOS were similar between both treatment groups at 1-year post-operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. After 3 years, the mean improvement in overall KOOS from baseline was greater for the CCI group. A positive treatment effect was however not seen in all subdomains of the score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Conflicting data have also been published regarding the durability of different cartilage repair strategies. Whilst some groups have reported mid- and long-term survival rates of approximately 75% after MFx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"> 41</xref>], others have observed that good short-term results are not maintained in the long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Despite these controversies, failure rates after MFx were found to be about 25-28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], which is comparable to values for alternative biologic treatment options, such as ACI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].</p><p>In this analysis, the small study population with available 1- and/or 2-year data allowed only a limited statistical comparison between the treatment groups, and due to the limited follow-up of 2 years, conclusions with regards to differences in clinical outcomes and the quality of the repair tissue cannot be drawn. However, as stated before, AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is aimed to extent the applicability of MFx from small- to medium-size cartilage defects and results are expected to be equivalent to MFx.</p><p>Unfortunately, 8 patients were lost to follow-up despite that they had been informed and agreed about the mandatory 1- and 2-year visits. However, except for 2 patients, which came back at 2-years and 5-years respectively, all others presented at least at 6-months post-operation. 1 patient had to undergo total knee arthroplasty then. He had been treated before AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 4 times with lavage and debridement for persistent pain and had a relatively high body mass index (BMI) of 29. It is well known that the number of previous surgeries and BMI influences clinical outcome after cartilage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The remaining 5 patients either moved away without leaving their new address or did not conclude their study follow-up without giving a reason. This is a well-known and often experienced issue which is very rarely described or discussed, especially in medical device industry. Non-compliance might be attributed to following reasons: either the patient is satisfied with treatment outcome and feels no need for further participation or he is not satisfied and refuses continuation.</p><p>Due to the reasons outlined above, definite conclusions about the mid- to long-term effectiveness of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> are currently not possible. However, this study confirms the effectiveness and safety of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> glued or sutured and demonstrates that the good results observed at 1-year post-operation are maintained at 2-years. Pain reduction and improvement of symptoms and hence function could be achieved up to 2-years post-operation. Five-year results are expected and may provide important insights into the long-term effectiveness of AMIC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for the treatment of cartilage defects of the knee.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Medical Writing Support was provided by nspm ltd, Meggen, Switzerland.
