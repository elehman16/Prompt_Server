These learning environments assemble small groups as the units in which learning takes place to &#x02018;teach&#x02019; undergraduate medical students. In such small groups, students are supposed to solve meaningful problems, share information and discuss conflicting ideas <xref rid="pone.0093328-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These distinctive steps in the process of learning have shown positive effects on short- and long-term knowledge acquisition <xref rid="pone.0093328-vanBlankenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093328-vanBoxtel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Performing these steps within a small group has been shown more effective than acted by an individual alone <xref rid="pone.0093328-DeGrave1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-vanderLinden1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, in the field of medical education positive effects of these group processes on a variety of medical competencies have been shown repeatedly <xref rid="pone.0093328-Schmidt2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093328-Schmidt3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In accordance with the evidence, many medical schools all over the world have changed their learning context towards powerful learning environments.</p><p>Medical schools have grown towards &#x02018;mega&#x02019; classes with commonly over 300 students in European medical schools. This scale enlargement has shown to make teaching large classes difficult <xref rid="pone.0093328-Jenkins1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093328-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In these traditional learning contexts the solution to involve all students in the mega-class was to include group-based activities in the learning contexts <xref rid="pone.0093328-Murdoch1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, in powerful learning contexts, which are founded upon learning in small groups, it is plausible that the scale enlargement threatens the students' learning processes. Random allocation of students into new groups every few weeks again results in small groups of unfamiliar students. Sharing knowledge in the collaborative process incurs an implicit cost, while the expected returns of relevant new knowledge and/or expertise are uncertain. Some students are therefore less willing to share knowledge than others. Group member familiarity might reduce costs of sharing information among students <xref rid="pone.0093328-Gruenfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Second, groups must invest time and energy in the collaborative process before the group can become effective <xref rid="pone.0093328-Mathieu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Changing the composition of groups too quickly might prevent groups from reaching the beneficial effects of collaboration in groups. Such suboptimal effectiveness of physicians' medical training increases the need for parsimonious solutions to make medical education more effective.</p><p>The battle against scale enlargement cannot be won by reducing the number of students enrolling in medical schools. Dividing a medical parallel programme into two (or more) sections will result in a duplication of necessary staff time <xref rid="pone.0093328-Bridges1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Next, in medical education we strive towards evidenced-based decision making to design the most powerful learning context. Therefore, our study angled this large class debate differently. We conducted a randomised controlled intervention study to test if subdividing a large class into small subsets could facilitate the students' collaborative learning processes positively. This division of a large class in small subsets, which is schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093328-g001">Figure 1</xref>, makes students collaborate with the same students frequently in small groups. Hereby, these subsets increase the time students spend collaborating with the same students they have collaborated with in the past. More time to collaborate with one another aligns with the group development literature <xref rid="pone.0093328-Mathieu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> which has shown to increase the effectiveness of groups.</p><fig id="pone-0093328-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0093328.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the randomised controlled trial allocation procedure and intervention.</title><p>The class of 2010&#x02013;2011 was randomised into two intervention groups (A and B) with 50 students in each subset and the control <italic>group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;102). The control group was mixed with the non-randomised students representing the large subset of the class. The intervention consisted of allocating students within the subsets of the class to new tutorial groups while progressing through the curriculum. This way, students in the small subsets frequently interacted with the same students over time.</italic>
</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0093328.g001"/></fig><p>Our primary aim was to assess group dynamics in small groups in the medical curriculum. As was briefly expounded in the first paragraph, interaction among students when problem solving, sharing knowledge and discussing medical scenarios are the steps in which learning takes place. However, learners in groups do not necessarily interact when present in the same space at the same time <xref rid="pone.0093328-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Roschelle1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Attitudes, motivation and beliefs drive or inhibit interaction within a group. For example, potency beliefs -beliefs that the group will be valuable for one's learning process- is an important predictor for effective learning in a group <xref rid="pone.0093328-Gully1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Stajkovic1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. A strong body of evidence shows that effective learning in groups is dependent on the quality of interaction and a variety of attitudes, motivations and beliefs among the group members <xref rid="pone.0093328-Harrington1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Therefore, we borrowed the parameters of effective group processes as the primary outcome measures: group learning behaviour, potency, social cohesion and psychological safety e.g. <xref rid="pone.0093328-Mathieu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-vandenBossche1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In this study we hypothesized that the students in small subsets perceived better group learning processes, reflected as more positive primary outcome measures compared to the control group.</p><p>The second aim of this study, focuses on the informal side of group learning. Students spend the majority of time studying and interacting with other students outside the formally organised activities. Learning in the &#x02018;informal&#x02019; context with other students has been found an important part of the students' learning process <xref rid="pone.0093328-Hommes1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and could thus confound our findings related to learning in the formally organised groups <xref rid="pone.0093328-Krackhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Large classes allow students to learn with or from a large number of students. However, large learning networks have been shown to be less effective as it demands much energy to maintain the learning network <xref rid="pone.0093328-Cross1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore our second hypothesis tested whether dividing the class into subsets directed informal group learning networks towards learning primarily within their own subset.</p><p>Finally, to be thorough and not miss (unexpected) effects of this intervention study on the students' group learning process in an actual medical school, the third aim was to explore students' perceptions on the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Research in medical education is exempted from the Medical Ethical Committee in The Netherlands on the ground that this type of research does not intend to answer a research question on health or pathology (aetiology, pathogenesis, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention, results of a treatment) <xref rid="pone.0093328-Center1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. As the medical educational domain does not agree with this view, a review board for medical education was designed, but was not yet in function when this research was planned and applied. This did not prevent our research team to apply ethical guidelines for our research. To meet the need for thorough ethical guidelines normally tested in an ethical committee, the students were given the details of the intervention, after which they were asked for informed consent to take part. Students could withdraw at any moment without having to provide a reason. The intervention did not influence the contents of the educational programme at all. For each study (observation), students were again briefed with the goals of the research and asked to participate and provide informed consent to use their data for research purposes. Stop criteria were formulated on the basis of achievement, the pre-requisite for students to progress through the medical programme. To replace an independent institutional review board the management team of the medical faculty responsible for the quality of education in the medical programme, approved our research proposal and annual feedback on the progress was given.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting &#x00026; participants</title><p>This study was conducted in the first two years of the undergraduate-entry pre-clinical curriculum in the Maastricht University medical school. This medical school employs a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach with small-group tutorials as the backbone of the curriculum in conjunction with practical learning sessions, e.g. gross anatomy laboratory sessions, to complement these groups. The formal activities compose approximately ten hours per week, which leaves plenty of time for informal learning. At its inception in 1974, classes consisted of 34 students. Nowadays, this school enrols approximately 320 students yearly.</p><p>Students enrol in a class and participate in a set of modules in chronological order. Recruitment for this study started with enrolment for the new academic year of 2010&#x02013;2011 (July 2010). One inclusion criterion was used: informed consent to participate in this RCT.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation and intervention</title><p>Of the students enrolling in the undergraduate-entry Maastricht University medical school, 202 students were randomised into three groups: Two intervention groups (A &#x00026; B) with 50 students each and the control group (C) consisting of 102 students. For logistical reasons, mainly on the national level, approximately 100 students were not allocated to our medical school before the randomisation of students to tutorial group, which occurs two weeks before the start of the medical programme. Therefore, these students could not participate in the study. The majority of these students still started within the first week of the medical programme. Only eighteen students entered late in the first module. Together with 27 students who did not want to participate in the intervention study, these &#x02018;non-randomised&#x02019; students were mixed with the control group, to generate a large subset of the class.</p><p>Students were stratified on their Grade Point Average (GPA) as a proxy to divide weak and strong students evenly over all subsets <xref rid="pone.0093328-Moruzi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. It was decided to have two intervention groups so that each intervention group could serve as a cross validation for the results of the other group. Randomisation was performed using block randomisation in STATA version 11 <xref rid="pone.0093328-StataCorp1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

Social networks define student learning as interaction between a set of actors or individuals (&#x0201c;nodes&#x0201d;) and their interrelationships (&#x0201c;ties&#x0201d;). Three network types assessed social interaction between students; friendships, giving and receiving information related to the module in which students were involved. Friendship networks explore passive information diffusion, while communication networks have a more instrumental nature (e.g. asking explicitly for help on a certain topic) <xref rid="pone.0093328-Ibarra1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Katz1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

A previous study demonstrated validity of this method <xref rid="pone.0093328-Hommes1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Five times during the two curriculum years (T1&#x02013;T5), students' were asked to indicate with whom they interacted in the informal context (outside all formally organised activities), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093328-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Perceptions of the intervention</title><p>Individual interviews were held with students to explore any (other) positive or negative effects of the randomised controlled trial.

The first outcome measure shows that making a class seem small resulted in more effective group dynamics in formally organised small groups. In other words, changing the composition of small tutorial groups in the medical programme to ensure higher member familiarity among students induced more effective group dynamics as indicated by significantly more positive feelings of psychological safety, social cohesion, group potency and group learning behaviour when a new group was assembled. These findings align with those from the team-based literature describing that group members need to get to know one another before the group can be considered &#x02018;effective&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0093328-Mathieu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Decuyper1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Interestingly when comparing effect sizes among the parameters of group dynamics, social cohesion and psychological safety stand out. The literature refers to these perceptions or beliefs as the basis of collaboration in teams <xref rid="pone.0093328-Edmondson1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Beal1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Chiocchio1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Future studies might be able to determine more specifically how these processes relate to one another to further enhance insights how design features can influence group dynamics. For example, van den Bossche et al <xref rid="pone.0093328-vandenBossche1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> suggest that social cohesion and psychological safety are the first steps towards group learning behaviour. However, group potency towards as might grow concurrently with social cohesion <italic>(I like the group members and I belief that as a group we will be able to gain in-depth knowledge into the subject matter)</italic>, and even more strongly after a group had a deep discussion in one of the group sessions. Thus, group dynamics might be related in a non-sequential and more complex cyclical pattern <xref rid="pone.0093328-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093328-Hommes2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Although more studies might enable us more insights in the complex matter of group learning behaviour over time, this study does show that a change in curriculum design has a substantial effect on formal group processes. In this study the group processes among the students in the large subset were &#x02018;lower&#x02019; as those in the intervention groups for at least 20% of all tutorial group sessions in these two modules. Although this study did not assess group processes during all tutorial groups sessions over all modules, this intervention does indicate that making classes seem small, increases formal group learning for a substantial duration of the formal medical programme.</p><p>This study also discovered that the educational design directed informal group learning to occur mainly within the subset of the class over 22 months which might even enhance the effects of the intervention as students spend more time with the same students. At first glance it might seem a disadvantage to be involved in a small subset as this reduces the chance to meet a large number of students. However, in the organisational sciences research has shown that large networks need quite some energy to be maintained <xref rid="pone.0093328-Cross1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore big networks are not necessarily effective networks. In contrast, safety and judgements of expertise are the strongest indicators of successful informal learning from peers <xref rid="pone.0093328-Cross1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Since the students in the small subsets indicated to know one another better (interview data) and feel safer among others (formal group learning processes), it is likely that informal learning in networks is also more effective in these small classes. Alternatively, positive experiences during informal group learning networks could contribute to group learning processes in the formally organised small groups. Therefore, this study might have created a better context to learn outside formal activities as well. As students arrange and develop their informal group learning networks themselves, it has been regarded as difficult to steer this learning process in a variety of disciplines <xref rid="pone.0093328-Marsick1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. This study is a promising example that it is possible for educators to direct informal learning among students besides formal group learning.</p><p>The results of the interviews exploring students' perception of the effects of the intervention support the positive perceptions of students being involved in small subsets. These interviews showed that students perceived higher member familiarity, which in turn improved collaboration among students within the tutorial groups. Moreover, these interviews might indicate that students feel more related to the university when students have developed towards a tight group of friends among close fellow students. Tinto <xref rid="pone.0093328-Tinto1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> has shown that the curriculum design can make students feel more at home at the university which reduced attrition rates. Future studies might be able to indicate whether subdividing a large class into small subsets indeed causes students to be related closer to the university and results in lower attrition rates as has been shown in the past. Interestingly, students mentioned that it was easier to understand the competency development of fellow students. This intervention might thus be a rather valuable tool for students to receiver better feedback from fellow students, which is in the end a vital method to improving medical competencies of our future medics <xref rid="pone.0093328-Schuwirth1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, especially since students tend to be dissatisfied with the feedback they receive <xref rid="pone.0093328-Molloy1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In the end, these interviews show minor to negligible &#x02018;side effects&#x02019;. What can be learned from these &#x02018;negative&#x02019; side effects that can be taken into account when implementing this study into practice, is the ability for students to manage their own agenda. In PBL curricula, students usually have choices in when they can attend skills or anatomy training sessions. These sessions per subset should be flexible enough to fit students' training. We believe that once students choose to be involved in a training session, students also engage more easily in the training session. The literature continues to show that student engagement enhances student learning <xref rid="pone.0093328-Carini1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p><p>Time plays a key role in developing students' collaborative learning processes. We measured processes representing formal group interaction in five modules over two years. Yet, we cannot define precisely the timeframe needed for students in the intervention arm to start experiencing more positive learning processes than the control group. At the same time, within the modules, it cannot be defined when the control group develops to the same level as the intervention arm. This shows that time is still an unsolved parameter with respect to the students' learning process. Previous studies in team learning recognise groups as dynamic social systems changing over time <xref rid="pone.0093328-Decuyper1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Future research in education should focus on the influence of time on groups within and over modules.</p><p>In the search for evidence-based practice in medical education, randomised controlled trials are valuable tools to show how education can be improved. Especially since very little studies have applied this research method to show effects of the educational context on learning. The setting of an actual learning context is strength of this study and makes the outcomes much more ecologically valid than controlled (lab) experiments, but it also made the study more complex. A pure experimental design, for example, would not have included a control group mixed with a non-randomised group. However, because it was situated in an actual learning context, the study could not avoid mixing the controls with students that do not want to participate or who could not be included. The most important reason was that it would have been unethical to give the non-participants anything but an optimal &#x02018;standard education&#x02019;. Had we separated out the control group and the non-participants then the participants would have been automatically put in their own small subset and thus be similar to the intervention groups. When analysing their results we found that the GPA was lower in the non-randomised group, which indicates that the latter group consisted of &#x02018;weaker&#x02019; students and could affect the students from the control group negatively. No differences were found in group learning processes between the control group and the not randomised student group in the first and second curriculum years. Several interpretations are possible to understand the effects from mixing these two groups on the results and conclusions. First of all, mixing might not have &#x02018;weakened&#x02019; the control group nor the non-randomised group. Second, the initially weaker non-randomised group lifted on the &#x02018;stronger&#x02019; control group. Finally, the control group leaned on the non-randomised student group and became weaker than would have occurred when not mixed. Although theoretically all three possibilities could have occurred we think that the results suggest that the control group was not weakened nor lifted by the non-randomised groups as no differences in group dynamics were measured from the second week of medical programme and further onwards in the curriculum between the control and non-randomised groups.</p><p>Since two intervention groups (A &#x00026; B) were used in one experiment, each replicating the findings of the other, we conclude that the beneficial effect of the intervention is valid and replicable. The validity of our results are strongly founded on the collaborative learning literature aligning to Kane's notion of an argument-based approach to validity <xref rid="pone.0093328-Kane1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Since this research was conducted in an actual learning context, we believe that the results are quite unique and underline the ecologic validity of the results, which is normally a critical downside in pure tightly controlled experimental studies.</p><p>This study was performed in the context of the Maastricht Medical School, a Problem-Based Learning context. We want to argue that the results of this intervention study are also beneficial to other small-group learning contexts similar to this curriculum design, such as team-based learning contexts. Implementation of this intervention can be rather simple since no additional costs are needed to reducing class size by dividing the class into subsets.</p><p>Increasing the strength of the intervention could further accelerate the positive effects. In this study we manipulated only a part of the educational processes (the tutorial groups) and not all other educational activities (practical, lectures). It is plausible to assume that with a stronger intervention even stronger effects would be caused. In a further step-up, for example linking a student group to subgroups of faculty further improvement of the efficacy of formal and informal group learning processes could be achieved, as this study clearly shows that classes need to seem small to reach optimal learning processes. In such study we feel that competency development should be introduced as outcome parameters. Since the foundation of learning in small groups, the quality of learning processes, seems to be positively correlated to &#x02018;smaller classes&#x02019;, it is of extra interest to study performance of students in a variety of competency domains. This has however not been done in this study since the main parameter that was available in the early curriculum years was medical knowledge. We would value incorporating multiple performance indicators such as communication and collaboration skills in a following study, especially if a stronger intervention has been realized as described in the previous paragraph.</p><p>To conclude this study, we advise our medical school and others, which make use of a powerful learning context to change the formal group design and make large classes seem small.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093328.s001"><label>Figures S1</label><caption><p>
