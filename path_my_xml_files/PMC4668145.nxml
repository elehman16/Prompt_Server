application, shown to increase blood flow and metabolic activity and to function as an ion
pump, is able to reduce muscle pain after exercise-induced muscle damage. [Subjects and
Methods] Seven participants (4 males, 3 females) performed two sessions of downhill
running separated by at least 4 weeks. After the running sessions, participants were
either treated for 45&#x02005;min with a pulsating electrostatic field (field intensity, 9000 V;
current, &#x0003c;9 mA; frequency, 50&#x02005;Hz) or a sham treatment. The order of the intervention
was random, and the condition was blinded for the participants. Muscle soreness score,
creatine kinase, and jump ability were assessed before and up to 48 hours after running.
[Results] Twenty-four and 48 hours after the downhill running, the muscle soreness score
tended to be less increased after pulsating electrostatic field administration when
compared with the sham setting (changes in muscle soreness score: 3.7&#x000b1;1.6 vs. 5.7&#x000b1;2.2
after 24&#x02005;h and 3.1&#x000b1;2.0 vs. 5.4&#x000b1;3.2 after 48 h, respectively). No further differences were
detected. [Conclusion] The outcomes show that a pulsating electrostatic field might be a
promising treatment to reduce muscle soreness after exercise-induced muscle damage.
However, further studies are needed to confirm the present outcomes and to establish the
mechanism by which a pulsating electrostatic field may reduce muscle pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Exercise-induced muscle damage</kwd><kwd>Recovery</kwd><kwd>Downhill running</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eccentric exercise was shown to provoke skeletal muscle damage leading to delayed onset of

Even though some positive effects have been reported,
several studies did not find any reductions in the symptoms of muscle injuries.</p><p>Beside these treatments, static or pulsed electromagnetic field therapy have been used for
the treatment of DOMS<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Again, some
authors reported positive effects on DOMS symptoms, whereas others were not able to find
benefits<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Application of a pulsating electrostatic field (PESF), which is a
comparable but not identical technique, might be a further method capable of reducing the
symptoms of muscle soreness. A PESF was shown to increase vasomotion and as a consequence
blood flow<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, to reduce the formation of
rouleaux, and to increase metabolic activity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, a PESF may function as an
ion pump able to move calcium ions, the concentration of which was shown to be increased
after eccentric exercise with detrimental effects<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to these effects, it might be
speculated that a PESF could prevent the development of DOMS and muscle strength loss after
muscle damaging exercise. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the
effect of PESF application on sensation of muscle soreness and muscle strength after
eccentric exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Nine sport students (5 males, 4 females) without any medical problems and not adapted to
eccentric exercise were recruited for the study. All of them were informed about the study
aims and gave written informed consent for participation. Two participants (one male and one
female) had to be excluded from the final analysis, one because of a pre-start muscle
soreness score of already 4 and one because of a pre-start CK value of 333 U/L. Therefore, 7
participants (4 males and 3 females; weight, height, and age: 74.3&#x000b1;5.7&#x02005;kg and 71.0&#x000b1;5.3&#x02005;kg,
183.0&#x000b1;9.9&#x02005;cm and 172.3&#x000b1;6.4&#x02005;cm, and 26.5&#x000b1;2.4&#x02005;years and 24.3&#x000b1;1.2&#x02005;years, respectively) were
included in the final analysis. The study was carried out in conformity with the ethical
standards of the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by Institutional Review Board of
the Department of Sport Science, University of Innsbruck.</p><p>The study was designed as a single-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over intervention
study. All participants performed 2 downhill running sessions on a treadmill separated by at
least 4 weeks. Before and at different time points after the sessions, muscle soreness
score, creatine kinase (CK), and jump ability were assessed as described in detail below.
The first running session was carried out in a slightly modified form according to Kingsley
et al<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Running sessions started with a
3&#x02005;min stage of horizontal running at 5&#x02005;km/h (warm-up). Thereafter, the inclination was set
at &#x02212;17.5%, and the speed was increased every minute by 1&#x02005;km/h until reaching approximately
70% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate (HR) (calculated as 220 &#x02212; age). This speed was
kept constant until the end of the running session. Overall, the running duration was 30
minutes, not including the warm-up time. During the second test, the speed was regulated in
the same way as during test one but independent of HR in order to have identical test speeds
and a comparable muscular stimulus. Immediately after each run, half of the subjects were
treated in a sitting position with a PESF for 45&#x02005;min, and half of the subjects were exposed
to a sham treatment. After at least 4 weeks, in which participants were advised not to
change their physical activity habits, the subjects that were treated with a PESF during the
first session received the sham treatment and those that were treated with the sham
treatment during the first session received the PESF treatment. The allocation to the
treatment or placebo session was random. The (negative) PESF was generated with a New Health
9000 device (Akern srl, Pontassieve, Italy) and was applied through a mat with a field
intensity of 9000 V, a current of &#x0003c; 9 mA, and a pulsatile frequency of 50&#x02005;Hz. The
electrostatic field was confined to the ion mat surface, and it has been proven to be
safe<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The general rating of muscle soreness was assessed as described by Trombold et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> before and immediately after the runs,
immediately after the 45&#x02005;min treatment or sham treatment, and 48 hours after treatment.
Participants subjectively rated the degree of soreness using a visual analog scale of 0 to
10, with 0 describing &#x0201c;no soreness&#x0201d; and 10 describing &#x0201c;unbearable soreness&#x0201d;. Jump ability
(jump and reach test) was assessed before running, after the 45&#x02005;min session, and 48 hours
after the running. CK activity was assessed before running and 48 hours after running from
capillary blood samples with a Reflotron Sprint device (Reflotron Sprint, Mannheim, Germany;
reference range for men: 24&#x02013;195 U/L at a measurement temperature of 37&#x02005;&#x000b0;C).</p><p>Data were analyzed using PASW Statistic 18. Delta values (&#x00394;) were calculated as post values
(at different time points) minus pre values for both the PESF application and sham setting.
Differences at baseline, changes in the course of PESF or sham treatment, and differences
between conditions (&#x00394; values for the PESF and sham treatment) were assessed by paired
Student&#x02019;s t-tests or the Wilcoxon test as appropriate. Spearman correlation analyses were
used to calculate associations between CK and CMJ changes and muscle soreness score. Data
are presented as means&#x000b1;SD. The level of significance was set at p&#x02264;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Values before the two sessions did not differ (p&#x0003c;0.05). When compared with the pre
values, the muscle soreness score was increased at all time points and under both conditions
(p&#x0003c;0.05). Jump performance was reduced immediately after the sham application (p=0.038)
and tended to be reduced immediately after the PESF application (p=0.054). <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Values for jump height, creatine kinase, and muscle soreness score in the courses

muscle soreness scores without significantly affecting CK increase and jump performance
decrease.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use a PESF after downhill running
for the prevention of muscle soreness. In the literature, different methods, including cold
or infrared therapy, massage, pharmacological intervention, etc., have been applied to
reduce muscle pain after eccentric exercise<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mechanisms causing beneficial effects
are as diverse as the methods applied. For cold application, the main beneficial effect is
thought to be the cold-related vasoconstriction, which may limit vessel permeability and
thus inflammatory processes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
mechanism by which infrared therapies might induce potential positive effects is mainly
based on the increased peripheral flow due to warmth-related vasodilatation, which could
enhance the evacuation of edema, limiting inflammation and perceived pain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mechanisms mediating the biological
benefits of nutritional interventions are not clear but may be linked to the attenuation of
oxidative stress and inflammation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. With
respect to electromagnetic field therapy, it was suggested that the treatment influences
muscle immune and inflammatory responses by an unknown mechanism, may disrupt afferent input
from free nerve endings of nociceptors, and may influence excitation-contraction coupling
processes<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
PESF application might have induced similar effects. Additionally, the improvement of
vasomotor performance might have provoked some beneficial effects<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Comparable to
the effects of infrared application, the increased blood flow might have enhanced the
removal of edema, limited the inflammatory response, and reduced perception of pain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A further mechanism might be the function
of a PESF as an ion pump moving positively charged ions, e.g., calcium and hydrogen<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The calcium concentration was shown to be
elevated in skeletal muscle cells following eccentric contractions<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increased calcium concentrations within the sarcoplasm
have the potential to activate many different molecular pathways in skeletal muscle,
including the phospholipase-prostaglandin pathway and the calpain proteolytic pathway, which
might lead to breakdown of the cell membrane and myofibrils<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, whether or not such mechanisms might be involved in
processes of recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage still needs to be determined. It
has to be mentioned that although there was a trend toward a decrease in muscle soreness
score, CK and jump performance did not seem to be affected by PESF application. In this
regard, the small sample size certainly is a main limitation of the present study and
outlines its nature as a pilot study. Nonetheless, when looking at the MSS and CK values in
<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, some beneficial effects clearly seem
to be apparent. This is supported by the finding that the highest MSS values were found
after the sham treatment. Additionally, PESF application for only 45&#x02005;min may be considered a
short exposure time, and it is not known if a longer PESF application time would have been
more effective.</p><p>In conclusion, application of a PESF might be a promising treatment to reduce muscle
soreness after exercise-induced muscle damage. However, further studies are needed to
confirm the present outcomes and to establish the mechanism by which a PESF may reduce
muscle pain.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Eston</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Mickleborough</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Baltzopoulos</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Eccentric activation and muscle damage: biomechanical and
