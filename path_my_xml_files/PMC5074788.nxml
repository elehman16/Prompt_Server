These impairments can be prevented by administering psychostimulants such as caffeine. This study used two experiments to explore the influence of caffeine administered at rest and during fatiguing physical exercise on spatial attention&#x02014;a cognitive function that is crucial for task-based visually guided behavior. In independent placebo-controlled studies, cohorts of 12 healthy participants consumed caffeine and rested or completed 180 min of stationary cycling. Covert attentional orienting was measured in both experiments using a spatial cueing paradigm. We observed no alterations in attentional facilitation toward spatial cues suggesting that covert attentional orienting is not influenced by exercise fatigue or caffeine supplementation. Response times were increased (impaired) after exercise and this deterioration was prevented by caffeine supplementation. In the resting experiment, response times across all conditions and cues were decreased (improved) with caffeine. Covert spatial attention was not influenced by caffeine. Together, the results of these experiments suggest that covert attentional orienting is robust to the effects of fatiguing exercise and not influenced by caffeine. However, exercise fatigue impairs response times, which can be prevented by caffeine, suggesting that pre-motor planning and execution of the motor responses required for performance of the cueing task are sensitive to central nervous system fatigue. Caffeine improves response time in both fatigued and fresh conditions, most likely through action on networks controlling motor function.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by The University of Auckland.

This neural component of exercise fatigue, otherwise referred to as central fatigue, is poorly understood, but may develop because of impaired synthesis and metabolism of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine and noradrenaline [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a recent study, we discovered that exercise fatigue reduces the velocity of saccadic eye movements [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and is therefore capable of influencing the neural processes that support oculomotor control. Given that the oculomotor control of saccadic eye movements is closely related to the spatial orienting of visual attention, it is plausible that exercise fatigue may also challenge the attentional processes supporting saccade control, such visuospatial attention. Interestingly, when caffeine was supplemented during exercise, impairments in saccadic eye movement velocity were absent [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We propose that this effect is most likely due to the stimulant action of caffeine on central neurotransmission via adenosine antagonism, which results in up regulation of dopamine and heightened synthesis and turnover rates of noradrenaline [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The oculomotor control of saccadic eye movements is related to the spatial orienting of attention [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a process that involves multiple stages of visual processing [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At its most basic level the oculomotor system orients the eyes to foveate information of interest and therefore contributes to overt attentional orienting. Attentional orienting can also occur without an eye movement towards the attended location; a process known as covert attentional orienting. Although the extent to which overt and covert attentional orienting are linked is uncertain [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the brain areas involved in shifting covert attention overlap considerably with those responsible for overt shifts of attention [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is therefore possible that both forms of attentional orienting are vulnerable to the central effects of fatigue. This is important because efficient shifting of attention is crucial for effective processing of visual information [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and therefore fatigue-induced deficits in attention may affect sports performance and compromise safe levels of visual surveillance. In this context, investigating the effect of exercise fatigue on covert attentional orienting is particularly important because any effect of fatigue would be independent from exercise-induced deficits in oculomotor control [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Covert spatial attentional orienting is typically investigated using a cueing paradigm [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], whereby participants are instructed to maintain stable gaze on a fixation point and respond as quickly as possible to the appearance of a peripheral target that is preceded by a cue. Crucially, the cue does not predict the target location, yet response times to targets presented in the cued location (valid cues) are typically faster than response times to targets appearing in uncued locations (invalid cues) [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165318.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This facilitation in detecting the cued target occurs because the cue reflexively attracts attention (exogenous attention), which in turn facilitates the processing of information at that location. Attention can also be oriented endogenously, and this form of attentional orienting can be measured using a similar task. Instead of non-informative peripheral cues, attention is oriented through centrally presented symbolic cues that inform participants of the likely target location. Participants are typically faster to detect targets that appear in the cued location than when they appear elsewhere, and this facilitation in detection occurs because of participants endogenously orient attention towards the cued location [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0165318.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0165318.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic illustrating the covert attention paradigm for exogenous (A) and endogenous (B) cueing conditions.</bold> Participants were presented with a fixation screen consisting of a central cross flanked by two peripheral boxes, displayed for 1000 ms (0&#x02013;1000 ms). A cue was then displayed for 200 ms, from 1000 ms after trial onset to 1200 ms after trial onset. Exogenous cues (A) were an increase peripheral box line width. Endogenous cues (B) comprised an arrow placed above the central fixation cross pointing toward the right or left peripheral box. Valid cues were congruent with the location of the subsequent peripheral target, whereas invalid cues were incongruent with the location of the peripheral target. Neutral cues provided were not indicative of the location of the peripheral target. Following cue presentation, the fixation screen was displayed for an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 200 ms (1200&#x02013;1400 ms). After this, a circular target appeared in the right or left peripheral box for 150 ms (1400&#x02013;1550 ms).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0165318.g001"/></fig><p>Two recent studies have shown that short bouts of intense exercise can affect shifts of covert attention within an exogenous cuing paradigm [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Sanabria, Morales (13) initially reported no difference in facilitation toward targets presented a short interval after cue presentation (100 ms) between exercise and resting conditions. However, after closer inspection of their data they reported in a later paper that there was in fact a reduction in the magnitude of facilitation toward validly cued targets after exercise compared to rest [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Using the same task, Llorens, Sanabria (19) replicated this finding, but only in low-fit individuals (mean VO<sub>2</sub>peak = 27.3 &#x000b1; 6.2 ml&#x02219;kg&#x02219;min<sup>-1</sup>). To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the influence of fatigue associated with prolonged exercise on covert attention. The relative contribution of central fatigue can be largely influenced by the type of exercise performed. Prolonged exercise demands a high level of muscular and cardiorespiratory work, leaving potential for factors such as hyperthermia [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], substrate depletion [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], changes in cerebral energetics [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and decreases in synthesis and turnover of brain catecholamines [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Because covert attention can be affected by short bouts of exercise, it is reasonable to predict that the neural systems supporting this cognitive process might be vulnerable to the effects of central fatigue induced by an extended period of strenuous exercise.</p><p>Caffeine is a supplement commonly used by athletes as an ergogenic aid to combat the effects of exercise fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is widely accepted that caffeine&#x02019;s beneficial effects on physical performance and cognition are accomplished via its stimulant action on the central nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The question of how caffeine may influence covert spatial attention in the context of exercise fatigue is yet to be investigated. At rest, a moderate dose of caffeine (3&#x02013;6 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass) did not influence the orienting of attention within a cueing task [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or the attention network test, which provides a measure of attentional orienting in addition to measures of alerting and executive control [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, caffeine did shorten response times across all conditions in the cueing task [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is consistent with previous reports of caffeine improving performance on basic psychomotor tasks, such as simple and choice reaction tasks [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The aim of these two experiments was to investigate the effect of caffeine on endogenous and exogenous covert attentional orienting in the context of exercise-induced fatigue (the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment) and sedentary rest (the <italic>Rest</italic> experiment). In the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment, fatigue was induced using a demanding 3 hour cycling exercise protocol that is known to challenge central nervous system function [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] while the <italic>Rest</italic> experiment consisted of 3 hours of sedentary activity. Endogenous and exogenous covert attentional orienting were measured using a cueing paradigm [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We tested multiple hypotheses. In the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment, we predicted that exercise-induced fatigue would degrade both exogenous and endogenous covert attentional orienting. The second hypothesis was that the administration of caffeine would protect against the detrimental effects of exercise-induced fatigue on covert attentional orienting. We predicted that no changes in covert spatial attention at rest with, or without caffeine would be observed in the <italic>Rest</italic> experiment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Twelve physically fit participants (5 males, Mean VO<sub>2</sub> peak 56 &#x000b1; 6 ml&#x02219;kg&#x02219;min<sup>-1</sup>) with a mean age of 25 &#x000b1; 9 (20&#x02013;48) years volunteered to participate in the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment.

This allowed for each experiment to explore the effect of a &#x02018;typical&#x02019; dose of caffeine, in rest and exercise contexts, on covert spatial attention. Doses differed between experiments because the magnitude of the caffeine dose recommended to elicit &#x02018;optimal performance&#x02019; is task dependent.

At rest lower doses are conducive to improvements in elements of cognition and mood such as visual information processing and alertness, which are desired performance benefits in sedentary settings (2&#x02013;6 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass) [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Caffeine reaches a maximum plasma concentration approximately 1 hour after ingestion and has a half-life of 4 to 6 hours [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Dose timing was selected to ensure that intervention-associated changes in mood or arousal were possible over the course of the 3 hour rest or exercise period and to attempt to coincide the peak action of caffeine with post rest or post exercise measures. The timing of the doses resulted in the lack of a within-session caffeine free baseline for each experiment, hence the use of a placebo treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Preliminary Tests</title><p>At least 1 week prior to the experimental protocol participants performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Velotron Dynafit Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) to measure peak oxygen uptake. For the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment, VO<sub>2</sub>max was estimated and used to prescribe a power output that required 60% VO<sub>2</sub>max for the experimental trials. Participants were familiarized with experimental protocols and the cueing task prior to the experimental trials. Due to a technical difficulty, a peak oxygen uptake measurement was not obtainable for one participant in the <italic>Rest</italic> experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>Participants arrived at the laboratory at 8 am following a 12 hour overnight fast. Upon arrival, body mass was measured following voiding of the bladder for participants in the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment. This was compared to a body mass measure collected post exercise in order to assess hydration status. In both experiments, participants were provided with a cereal-based breakfast, the quantity of which was self-selected on the first trial, and repeated for the remaining trials. With breakfast, participants received the first intervention dose in pill form (65 min before sedentary rest or exercise). Prior to exercise or rest (pre) participants completed the cueing task. The cueing task was performed as one task among a battery of six total visual tasks that examined the kinematics of basic eye movements, the results of which are not reported here. The visual task sequence was identical for all participants and therefore the additional tests did not introduce any systematic bias. The total time required to complete the cueing task was ~8 min, while the total test battery took ~50 min. After completion of the pre measures, participants then completed either 3 hours of sedentary rest (<italic>Rest)</italic> or cycled on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Velotron Dynafit Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) at a prescribed power output for 180 min (<italic>Exercise)</italic>. At 90 min into either protocol, participants received a second dose of the intervention in pill form. In the <italic>Rest</italic> experiment, participants were not permitted to eat during the experimental protocol, but were able to consume water as desired. In the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment a carbohydrate solution (0.7 g carbohydrate&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>) was ingested at 15 min intervals during the cycling protocol in order to prevent substrate depletion and dehydration. Heart rate was monitored continuously throughout the experimental trials and was recorded at 15 min intervals using a heart rate monitor (FS1, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). Coincident with the recording of heart rate, participants&#x02019; mood and arousal was self-rated on visual analogue scales. The scales were composed of 25 centimeter lines with a related question above the scale and opposing descriptive statements at each end. For example, for the visual analogue scale assessing mood the descriptive question was, &#x02018;how do you feel at the moment, what type of mood are you in&#x02019;, while the opposite statements at either end were &#x02018;very bad&#x02019;&#x02013;&#x02018;very good&#x02019;. Participants rated their feelings by putting a perpendicular mark across each scale. Scores were marked in centimeters from the left of the line to the mark, such that a high score signified a good mood and high sense of arousal, while a low score represented a bad mood and low arousal. After rest or exercise, participants repeated the covert attention task (post). In the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment a post measurement of body mass was obtained in order to assess fluid loss or gain as a result of the exercise trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Measures of covert spatial attention</title><p>Covert attentional orienting was assessed using a Posner cueing task [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with endogenous and exogenous cueing conditions. Visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165318.g001">Fig 1</xref>) were presented on a cathode ray tube monitor (Philips 109S2; 1280 &#x000d7; 1024 pixel resolution; 85 Hz refresh rate), positioned at a viewing distance of 660 mm. At the beginning of each trial, a central fixation cross and two peripheral boxes located &#x000b1; 10&#x000b0; laterally to the central fixation cross were displayed for 1000 ms. A visual cue was then presented for 200 ms. 200 ms after the cue was extinguished, a peripheral target (black circle, radius of 0.5&#x000b0;) appeared in the right or left peripheral box for 150 ms. Participants were instructed to maintain fixation on the central cross and to respond using a keyboard as quickly as possible when they detected a peripheral target to the left (left arrow key) or right (right arrow key) of fixation.</p><p>Endogenous cues consisted of a centrally presented arrow pointing to the right or left peripheral box. Arrows were centered 0.2&#x000b0; above the central fixation cross and subtended 0.5&#x000b0;. Exogenous cues consisted of an increase in the line width of a peripheral box from 0.15&#x000b0; to 0.20&#x000b0;. On valid trials, the target appeared in the cued location, whilst on the invalid trials it appeared in the opposite location. Neutral trials provided no cue indicating target location. In exogenous trials, the cue did not reliably predict the target location, with valid, neutral and invalid cues occurring with equal probability amongst the 90 trials. For endogenous trials, the valid cues correctly predicted target location 80% of the time thus, neutral cues were presented in 30 trials, valid cues in 48 trials, and invalid cues in 12 trials. The cue-target contingency was based on previous literature [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

This appears to result from participants responding faster to validly cued targets post rest compared to pre rest in both caffeine and placebo interventions.

A repeated measures ANOVA revealed a three-way interaction between cue type, trial and time point (F<sub>2, 22</sub> = 3.70, p &#x0003c; .05). This stems from a small decrease in response times post rest to validly cued targets in the first trial, followed by a larger magnitude decrease pre to post rest in the second trial. The presence of this task learning effect confounds our ability to interpret the influence of our interventions on endogenous spatial attention, as the most likely explanation for the greater facilitation in response time toward validly cued targets is that, by the fourth presentation of the covert attention task (Trial 2, post rest) participants improved their response speeds simply by learning.</p><fig id="pone.0165318.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0165318.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Measures of endogenous covert attention for the <italic>Exercise</italic> (left pane) and <italic>Rest</italic> (right pane) experiments.</title><p>(A) and (B) Response time pre (solid lines) and post (dashed lines) exercise or rest across cue type for Placebo (white fill) and Caffeine (black fill).

Covert attentional orienting was unaffected by exercise-induced fatigue and the administration of caffeine. However, exercise fatigue impaired response time components of the attention task, an effect that was prevented by the consumption of caffeine. This finding suggests that the processes governing the pre-motor planning and execution of behavioral responses are sensitive to the effects of exercise-induced fatigue and modulated by caffeine, while the networks controlling covert attentional orienting are robust to both challenges.</p><p>Prolonged strenuous exercise had no effect on our measures of covert spatial attention. The magnitude of the validity effect pre to post exercise was unchanged for both endogenous and exogenous cue types, suggesting that the processes governing the covert attentional orienting are robust to exercise fatigue. This is surprising because the challenge to brain homeostasis associated with this exercise protocol is substantial. Others have shown that similar protocols significantly impair cerebral energetics [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and we have recently measured a reduction in the velocity of saccadic eye movements after same the exercise protocol [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], implicating fatigue related impairments in networks controlling the oculomotor system. Consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], there were no alterations in error rates in the covert spatial attention task after exercise, suggesting that response selection was robust to exercise-induced fatigue. However, the overall error rate was low because the task was designed to detect differences in response times between cueing conditions rather than changes inaccuracy. Therefore small changes in error rates would not have been detected.</p><p>Llorens, Sanabria (19) reported detrimental effects of short duration exercise on exogenous shifts of covert attention in low-fit (mean VO<sub>2</sub>max = 41.28 &#x000b1; 6.32 ml&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>) but not high fit (mean VO<sub>2</sub>max = 58.38 &#x000b1; 2.96 ml&#x02219;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>) participants. Physical fitness may protect exogenous spatial attention during an exercise challenge, with well-trained individuals likely to show smaller exercise-induced reductions in cerebral metabolic resources [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The aerobic fitness of our cohort (mean VO<sub>2</sub> peak = 56 &#x000b1; 6 ml&#x02219;kg&#x02219;min<sup>-1</sup>) was comparable to Llorens, Sanabria (19) high-fit group. Therefore, we may have failed to observe an effect of fatiguing exercise as high fit individuals may be robust to the influence of exercise on covert spatial attention, despite other neural systems being compromised.</p><p>Although exercise fatigue did not alter the cueing effect in response to endogenous or exogenous cues, we did observe a significant slowing of response time. This effect of fatigue was most noticeable in response times to exogenous cues, where there was a significant slowing of response times post exercise across all cue types with placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165318.g004">Fig 4</xref>, left panel A). In the endogenous block, response times were significantly slower overall in placebo trials compared to the caffeine trials, but did not exhibit an interaction between intervention and time point. This suggests that exercise fatigue may have influenced the preparation and execution of motor responses (key presses). Accompanying the impairment in response times after exercise in the placebo trial were changes in self-rated arousal, particularly evident in the late stages of prolonged exercise. A general slowing of response time has been observed as a result of other forms of fatigue, such as sleep deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally, increased response time has been observed following prolonged fatiguing exercise with heat stress and dehydration [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this study we used several strategies to avoid dehydration, heat stress or hypoglycemia. Fluid balance and euglycemia were maintained with a hydration and carbohydrate supplementation strategy and participants performed a set amount of work in a controlled environmental chamber. Despite these controls it is plausible that the neurohumoral and metabolic challenge of prolonged strenuous exercise [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] exerted an influence on the speed of response time.</p><p>Caffeine prevented the slowing of response times observed after fatiguing exercise (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165318.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165318.g004">4</xref>, left panel B). Decreases in reaction time and heightened arousal at rest following the administration of caffeine have been observed across several studies [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that the improvements in reaction time with caffeine are greater in the presence of fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, but not measured here, alterations in the central levels of dopamine and noradrenaline have been linked to the development of fatigue during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and the maintenance of these central neurotransmitters through administration of caffeine or other psychostimulant drugs appears to attenuate the impact of fatigue on exercise performance [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and the central nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, caffeine may have preserved response times after exercise through its actions on central neurotransmission.</p><p>In the <italic>Rest</italic> experiment, endogenous and exogenous covert spatial attention was not differentially influenced by caffeine. There was no effect of 3 hours of rest on the magnitude of the validity effect in the exogenous cueing condition, nor by the administration of a moderate dose of caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165318.g004">Fig 4</xref>, right panel C). Interestingly, there was a global decrease in response times across all cue types in exogenous trials after 3 hours of rest with caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165318.g004">Fig 4</xref>, right panel B), while no differences between pre and post rest response times were seen with placebo. Because caffeine did not influence the validity effect, the global reduction in exogenous response times with caffeine is most likely related to an improvement in the preparation and execution of the motor response rather than an influence on the processes of covert attentional orienting. This finding adds to an already large body of literature demonstrating caffeine&#x02019;s positive influence on the performance of basic psychomotor tasks [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Caffeine&#x02019;s ability to influence psychomotor speed in this nature is most likely the result of the blockade in adenosine caused by caffeine, and a subsequent reduction in adenosine&#x02019;s ability to inhibit dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia circuits involved in voluntary skeletal motor output [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition the basal ganglia pathway involved in skeletal-motor output is functionally distinct from the parallel subcortical pathway involving the basal ganglia that is involved in oculomotor control and may contribute to orienting of visual attention [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to our observations at rest in the exogenous condition, in the endogenous condition we did observe a significant increase in the magnitude of the validity effect post rest, irrespective of intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165318.g003">Fig 3</xref>, right panel C). However, the observation of a task learning effect in the endogenous condition is the most likely explanation for the increase in the validity effect post rest across both intervention groups and limits further interpretation of these results.</p><p>Previous studies have described the presence of learning effects for several cognitive measures collected within a repeated measures experimental design [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165318.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], but the sensitivity of endogenous covert attention to task learning is not commonly reported. We observed a significant decrease in response time to endogenous valid cues within each trial, with the largest pre to post decrease occurring in the second trial. Despite the use of a familiarization session to reduce the possibility of task learning, it appears that, at rest, participants improve their ability to interpret and respond to valid endogenous cues simply due to repetition of the task as a result of the experimental design. Given this, it may not be favorable to include endogenous cueing paradigms when employing a repeated measures design with acute interventions. Interestingly, in the <italic>Exercise</italic> experiment within-task learning effects were absent. Acute hypoxia, which also represents a significant challenge to cerebral homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], appears to abolish practice effects in measures of cognition such as information processing and executive function [<xref rid="pone.0165318.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Similarly, our results suggest that fatiguing exercise may eliminate endogenous task learning.</p><p>In sum, this study revealed that the covert orienting of endogenous and exogenous spatial attention is robust to the effects of fatiguing exercise and unaffected by the administration of caffeine. However, exercise fatigue globally impairs response times, irrespective of cueing condition or cue type, an effect that was prevented by caffeine. This finding suggests that the pre-motor planning and execution of the behavioral response prescribed by the covert spatial attention task are sensitive to the effects of exercise-induced fatigue. 3 hours of sedentary rest with caffeine had no differential effects on covert attentional orienting compared to placebo, but did speed response times overall. Interestingly, a within-task learning effect was observed at rest in the endogenous condition, highlighting an additional consideration when employing spatial cueing tasks in a repeated measures fashion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165318.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Exercise experiment dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0165318.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0165318.s002"><label>S2 Dataset</label><caption><title>Rest experiment dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0165318.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the participants who volunteered their time to take part in the study and Hayden Green for assistance with data collection.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0165318.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Nybo</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>M&#x000f8;ller</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pedersen</surname><given-names>BK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Secher</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name>. <article-title>Association between fatigue and failure to preserve cerebral energy turnover during prolonged exercise</article-title>. <source>Acta Physiol Scand</source>. <year>2003</year>;<volume>179</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>67</fpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12940940</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0165318.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Nybo</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dalsgaard</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Steensberg</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>M&#x000f8;ller</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Secher</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cerebral ammonia uptake and accumulation during prolonged exercise in humans</article-title>. <source>J Physiol</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>563</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>285</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>90</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15611036</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0165318.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gandevia</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Evidence for a supraspinal contribution to human muscle fatigue</article-title>. <source>Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol</source>. <year>2006</year>;<volume>33</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>400</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>5</lpage>.
