Arrays of molecules are considered to mediate the inflammatory response at one time or another, among these is free radicals (FRs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide anion radicals, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid. All these molecules are capable of damaging either cell membranes or associated bio-molecules. Periodontal pathogens can induce ROS overproduction and thus may cause collagen and periodontal cell breakdown. When ROS are scavenged by antioxidants, there is a reduction of collagen degradation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Oxidative stress arises within tissues when the normal balance between ROS generation and antioxidant defense shifts in favor of the former, a situation arising from either an excess of ROS and/or a depletion of antioxidants.</p><p>There has been a tremendous expansion in dental research concerned with free radicals, ROS and anti-oxidant defense mechanisms. These are essential to many normal biological processes and low doses of certain radicals or radical-derived species can stimulate the growth of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in culture. A low FR/ROS often behaves as an inductor stimulus, whereas higher levels may result in injury. It may be necessary to deliver anti-oxidants selectively to specific cell types and to define the concentrations suitable for blocking inappropriate cell responses but leaving the unimpaired physiological levels of FR/ROS activity necessary for normal cell function.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Coenzyme Q10 was discovered in beef heart mitochondria at the University of Wisconsin.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] coenzyme Q10 is also known as ubiquinone because of its ubiquitous presence in nature and its quinone structure (similar to that of vitamin K).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It is also called as &#x0201c;coenzyme&#x0201d; because of its unique ability to participate in chemical reactions but remain at steady-state levels in the cell, and plays a central role in energy metabolism. It has a positive inotropic effect.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The effects and mechanisms of action of CoQ10 include stabilization of calcium-dependent channels, inhibition of intracellular phospholipases, prostaglandin metabolism, free-radical scavenging and direct membrane stabilization.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>CoQ10 is also known to play a crucial role in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and cellular respiration. It exists in two molecular forms, ubiquinone, the oxidized form, and ubiquinole, the reduced form, which are the basis for its antioxidant properties.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Co-Q10 functions as an intercellular antioxidant by acting as a primary scavenger of FRs and ROS. It serves as an endogenous antioxidant, and its increased concentration in the diseased gingiva effectively suppresses advanced periodontal inflammation.</p><p>A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 in the gingival tissue may exist independently of and/or because of periodontal disease. If a deficiency of coenzyme Q10 existed in the gingival tissue for nutritional causes and independently of periodontal disease, then the advent of periodontal disease could enhance the gingival deficiency of coenzyme Q10. In such patients, oral dental treatment and oral hygiene procedures can remove the local factors only but cannot correct the deficiency of CoQ10 due to systemic cause. Thus, mechanical periodontal therapy along with the adjunctive use of CoQ10 can be included for an overall improvement of the gingival health in periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The present study was designed with the aim to evaluate the efficacy of coenzyme Q-10 gel application in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized, controlled, clinical trial with a split-mouth design.

Healing and repair of periodontal tissue requires efficient energy production, and the metabolic functions of the periodontal tissues depend on an adequate supply of CoQ10.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Gingival biopsies revealed subnormal tissue level of CoQ10 in 60&#x02013;96% patients with periodontal disease, indicating that periodontal disease is frequently associated with CoQ10 deficiency.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Physiologically, CoQ10 plays four major roles. It has an essential role in mitochondrial energy (ATP) production through redox activity in the respiratory chain, transporting electrons between enzymes. Second, it plays a role in extra-mitochondrial redox activity in the cell membrane and endo-membranes. CoQ10 also functions as an antioxidant, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and scavenging FRs. Finally, it plays an important role in membrane stabilization and fluidity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The antioxidant nature of CoQ10 is derived from its energy carrier function. As an energy carrier, the CoQ10 molecule is continuously going through an oxidation&#x02013;reduction cycle. CoQ10 inhibits lipid peroxidation by preventing the production of lipid peroxyl radicals. In addition, the reduced form of CoQ10 effectively regenerates vitamin E from the &#x003b1;-tocopheroxyl radical. Furthermore, during oxidative stress, interaction of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> with metal ions bound to DNA generates hydroxyl radicals and CoQ10 efficiently prevents the oxidation of bases, particularly in mitochondrial DNA.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Data show that a high respiration rate is positively correlated with an increased amount of mitochondrial CoQ10, suggesting that its supplementation can play an important role in diseases related to CoQ10 deficiency. The mitochondrial respiratory chain organization plays an important role in the increase of respiratory activity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Currently, two models have been proposed: The random collision model and a super complex organization called respirasome.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the first model, electron transfer through the respiratory chain is assured by free diffusion of each component within the inner mitochondrial membrane. In this scenario, CoQ10 forms a pool used by all the CoQ-dependent respiratory complexes (mainly Complex I, II and III). On the other hand, the respirasome requires a solid state organization in which only bound CoQ10 is involved in electron transfer. This last hypothesis seems to be in contrast with a dose-dependent effect of CoQ10 addition on the respiratory rate. However, it may be possible that the bound ubiquinone should be in equilibrium with the pool. This hypothesis explains the beneficial effect of exogenous CoQ10 supplementation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Cells and tissues that play a role in immune function are highly energy dependent and therefore require an adequate supply of CoQ10 for optimal function. Several studies have demonstrated the immune-enhancing effects of CoQ10 or its analogues. These effects included the increased phagocytic activities of macrophages, increasing the proliferation of granulocytes in response to infection.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Patients with a decreased level of serum CoQ10 were at an increased risk of disease progression,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and application of CoQ10 would improve the clinical parameters.</p><p>Our study has shown a significant decrease in the plaque index, gingival index and gingival bleeding index in Groups II and III (test group) as compared with Group I (control group), thereby corroborating the added advantage of coenzyme Q10 gel. On comparison between Groups II and III, there was a more significant improvement in the plaque index, gingival index and gingival bleeding index in Group III as compared with Group II. There was a significant decrease in the probing pocket depth in Groups II and III (test groups) at the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> week as compared with Group I (control group). The <italic>P</italic>-value, 0.001, was statistically significant at the 4<sup>th</sup> week for the test groups. All the parameters as well as the clinical indices indicate that coenzyme Q10 (Perio Q gel) when used with scaling and root planning gave an added advantage as compared with sites treated with scaling and root planing alone. The results were more significant in the group treated with intra-pocket gel delivery along with scaling and root planing.</p><p>One problem encountered during the study was the substantivity of the gel, as it was neither a sustained release nor a controlled release formulation. The bioavailability of the gel was not known. During the study, some patients gave the statement of improved subjective feeling of the disease condition and less bleeding from the gums, indicating the effectiveness of the gel. No adverse reactions were reported.</p><p>Our research was focused on the adjunctive use of Q gel in patients with chronic periodontitis. On intragroup comparison, more significant results were seen in the sites treated with Scaling and root planing and Perio Q gel combination as compared with the sites treated with SRP alone. However, in this study, because of the lack of further follow-up of 3&#x02013;6 months, the long-term effect of the Perio Q gel cannot be commented upon. Thus, this study necessitates further detailed, long-term evaluation of the effect of the Perio Q gel in a bigger population with chronic periodontitis, along with follow-up of up to 3 months.</p><p>Our study has shown decreases in the clinical parameters scores, which are consistent with the earlier studies performed by Hans <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Wilkinson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Chatterjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A study conducted by Matthews <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007 showed that coenzyme Q10 with vitamin E has a beneficial effect on the periodontal tissue.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A split-mouth trial conducted by Hanioka demonstrated improved periodontal scores along with gingival scores when Co-Q10 was applied alone or as an adjunct to scaling and root planing.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] A study was conducted by Figuero (2006) to evaluate the potential oxidant/antioxidant interactions of nicotine with antioxidant coenzyme Q10 in smokers who were diagnosed with periodontitis, suggesting that the catabolic effects of nicotine could be reversed by the addition of antioxidants such as CoQ10.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>A study reported deficiency of CoQ10 in patients with periodontal disease by conducting a series of trials on succinate dehydrogenase&#x02013;CoQ10 reductase enzyme, which is found in the mitochondrial complex II of the cell.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This study was later supported by the works of Nakamura[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Matsumura.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Clinical trials showed a positive relation between Co-Q10 administration and improved periodontal health and immune response.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Other than antioxidant action, it has also been shown in the literature that CoQ10 acts as an immune enhancer and also accelerates tissue healing.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Thus, the result of our study could probably be due to the cumulative effects of Perio Q gel as an antioxidant, immune enhancer and tissue healer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Intrapocket and topical application of Perio Q gel along with mechanical debridement has improved the clinical parameters. The results of the research were encouraging and suggested the possibility to use the gel as a topical agent to support standard treatment procedures in periodontitis. In our research, the clinical parameters significantly improved in the phase of periodontal treatment, indicating that CoQ10 opens new treatment options by improving the host response to disease activity. The results were more significant and encouraging in the group treated with intrapocket gel application. Thus, this study necessitates further long-term clinical trials of Perio Q gel in larger sample sizes with long-term revaluation, along with other antioxidants agents with various doses and durations for designing a strategy for their use in routine supportive periodontal therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
