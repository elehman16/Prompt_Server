</p><p>The use of suture anchors to repair the labrum to the glenoid was introduced in the early 1990s to reduce the time and difficulty associated with creating osseous tunnels. Arthroscopic stabilization has been greatly facilitated by suture anchor techniques and has become the preferred method of treatment for most orthopaedic surgeons. However, the mid- to long-term failure rates for modern arthroscopic Bankart repair with suture anchors have been reported to be from 4% to 18% in studies published in the past decade.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> When comparing open Bankart repair techniques, Tamai et al<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> found that repair with bone tunnels has resulted in significantly lower dislocation rates compared with a repair with suture anchors. At 17-year follow-up, Hovelius et al<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> showed a difference in revision for instability of 0% for open bone tunnel Bankart repair versus 7% for open suture anchor repair.

First, we wanted to characterize the native labral footprint and then compare the footprint coverage of Bankart repairs using classic suture-through-bone tunnel fixation and suture anchor fixation. Second, we sought to compare the biomechanical behavior of the 2 repairs in a cadaveric model. We hypothesized that the bone tunnel technique provides more coverage of the native labral footprint compared with suture anchors. Additionally, we hypothesized that bone tunnel repair would result in greater load to failure and stiffness and decreased gap formation between the labrum and glenoid as compared with suture anchor repair in mechanical testing.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967115621882"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2325967115621882"><title>Specimen Preparation</title><p>This cadaveric study was exempt from institutional review board approval at our institution.

In this study, we demonstrated that tunnel repair resulted in 100% footprint coverage compared with an average of 27% footprint coverage with repair with suture anchors. The design of the bone tunnels, with the entrance and exit point for each tunnel just beyond the dimensions of the native footprint, resulted in no visible uncovered footprint between the 2 and 6 o&#x02019;clock positions. Our findings are in agreement with those of Ahmad et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> who investigated the footprint coverage of a single row versus a double row of suture anchors for Bankart repair. They found that a single-row repair resulted in 42% coverage while double-row repair resulted in 86% coverage of the native footprint. The slightly lower number found in this study may be due to fewer suture anchors being used over a smaller interval. Ahmad et al<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> utilized 4 suture anchors from the 2:30 to 5:30 positions, while the present study used 3 anchors from the 2:30 to 5 o&#x02019;clock positions. Another possible explanation for this finding is that suture anchors in this study were placed as close to the border of the articular margin as possible rather than in the center of the native footprint, which could in turn result in greater footprint coverage. Nonetheless, in both studies, less than half of the native footprint was covered.</p><p>Bone tunnel repair was found to result in significantly greater stiffness as compared with suture anchor repair. There was a slight trend toward greater load to failure for bone tunnel repair, and conversely, a trend toward decreased displacement after cyclic loading for suture anchor repair; however, neither of these results was significant. Given that this is a biomechanical study that isolates the repair between the capsulolabral complex and the glenoid and ignores other soft tissues, we cannot directly apply these values to a clinical model. Nonetheless, these data suggest that at time zero, the stiffness provided by a bone tunnel repair may be greater than that of suture anchors. However, biomechanical markers that may be more applicable to failure in a clinical model, such as ultimate load to failure and displacement with repetitive loading, showed no significant differences.</p><p>This study showed a significant portion of failures for both repair methods occurring due to bone failure. In the biomechanical analysis by Nho et al<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> of suture anchors for Bankart repair, 47% of failures occurred by anchor pull-out, which is comparable to the 50% noted in the present study&#x02019;s suture anchor group. There were slightly more failures through the bone in our bone tunnel group, resulting in an overall bone failure rate of 62.5%. This could be due to the advanced age of the specimens used for this study, which is older than the typical patient for which Bankart repairs are performed. In a clinical scenario, the high number of failures through bone tunnels could be significant, as this may result in greater bone loss than suture anchor pull-out. This could complicate a later revision procedure depending on the amount of bone loss sustained.</p><p>Fixation of the labrum occurred at 3 sites in the footprint analysis portion of the study as opposed to 2 sites for the biomechanical portion. Clinically, fewer than 3 sites of repair have been associated with recurrence of instability.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Therefore, it was considered to be most accurate to assess the footprint coverage as it would be seen clinically with a 3-point repair. Two points of repair fixation were chosen instead of 3 for the biomechanical testing because the testing apparatus applies force along a single vector line. This allows equal stresses to be applied to each point of the repair when 2 points are used; however, due to the rounded anatomy of the glenoid rim, 3 repair points would not allow for a single vector of force to equally stress each point of the repair. This would place unequally high forces on certain points of the repair, possibly causing earlier failure at these sites despite most of the repair remaining intact. Additionally, the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament is reported to be the strongest portion of the inferior glenohumeral ligament complex in preventing anterior and inferior translation of the humerus.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Its anatomic area on the clock face is between the 3 and 5 o&#x02019;clock positions.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Therefore, the 2 points of fixation were predominantly centered over the most biomechanically important part of the anteroinferior capsulolabral complex for testing. This model of using 2 repair sites for biomechanical testing of Bankart lesions has been utilized in previous literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
</p><p>This study had multiple strengths. Matched pairs were used for biomechanical comparison of the different repairs. This resulted in no differences in age or bone mineral density and likely controlled for differences in the capsular strength and laxity between different cadavers. For footprint analysis, the same specimens were used for each repair to eliminate any confounding of different footprint sizes between specimens. Additionally, the same fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon performed all repairs with anchors and tunnels in the same positions. Finally, the biomechanical protocol has been described previously and included multiple measures to assess strength of repair, including stiffness, displacement with cyclic loading, and ultimate load to failure.</p><p>This study does have certain limitations. First of all, as a cadaveric study, these results do not take into account soft tissue healing and scar generation that may help to stabilize a Bankart repair in vivo in the mid to long term, when many recurrent instability events occur. However, this study sought only to determine the initial strength provided by the repair alone, which likely applies more to failures in the immediate postoperative period. In addition, there are likely a number of suture anchor configurations that can be used for Bankart repair, and this study only addresses 1 configuration. Second, the uncovered footprint area after each repair was measured and used to infer overall footprint coverage. The study did not measure contact at points under the repair; therefore, it is possible that a portion of the footprint was covered by the labrum but without sufficient contact to induce healing in a clinical setting. Nonetheless, using a Microscribe measuring device to infer footprint coverage has been accepted.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The footprint was marked with a fine-tip marker by the same observer, which can be a subjective measurement. However, the footprint was well distinguished as the border of the thick labrum compared with the articular cartilage and the thin periosteum overlying the glenoid neck. Additionally, the differences in coverage percentage were so dramatic that a small variation in labral measurement should not have affected our results. Third, this study looked only at the strength of the repairs against 1 vector of force. We utilized an anteroinferior force vector perpendicular to the lesion and its repair sites, which has been described as a &#x0201c;worst-case scenario&#x0201d; force by Nho et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967115621882" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Fourth, the cadavers used for this study had a mean age of 61 years, which is significantly older than the typical patient treated for instability. As these specimens likely had a lower bone density than would be expected in a younger specimen, one might expect that failures through the bone might be less likely to occur in a younger, more typical patient population for Bankart repair. However, as the samples were all matched pairs with no differences in bone density, it would be unlikely that this would make the comparisons between the groups less valid.</p><p>Making clinical inferences from the cadaveric studies can be difficult, and this study certainly does not advocate abandoning suture anchor Bankart repair as it boasts a number of benefits over bone tunnel repair. In addition, it is unknown whether increased footprint coverage may improve healing or which portion of the footprint is most important to restore. However, this study does raise the question of whether increased coverage of the labral footprint could contribute to the lower failure rate reported in the literature for open repair with bone tunnels. Additional differences could include improved capsular shift and greater scar formation with an open procedure. Further studies investigating how increased footprint coverage can influence recurrence rate in Bankart repair will be important to clarify this relationship.</p><p>This study presents the first footprint and biomechanical comparison between bone tunnels and suture anchors for repair of Bankart lesions. Bankart repair with bone tunnels completely restored the footprint anatomy while suture anchor repair covered less than 30% of the native footprint. Repair using bone tunnels resulted in significantly greater stiffness than repair with suture anchors, but load to failure and gap formation were not significantly different.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-2325967115621882"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: K.P.S. has received funding for research and consulting fees from Tornier Inc.
