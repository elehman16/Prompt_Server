SSG involves excision of the epidermis and part of the dermis, leaving behind the reticular dermis in the donor site, which enables the skin to heal by secondary intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite SSG being an important modality for wound closure, the donor site becomes a second, often painful wound, which may take more time to heal than the graft site itself and holds the risk of infection and scarring.</p><p>Epidermal grafting (EG) is an emerging and promising option to overcome these challenges. Epidermal grafting is a method of autologous skin grafting that harvests only the epidermal layer of the skin from the donor site by applying gentle heat and continuous negative pressure on the normal skin to raise blisters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The roof of the blister, which is the epidermis, is then excised and transferred onto the wound. As the dermis in the donor site remains untouched, the skin regenerates itself without scarring. This procedure also causes minimum pain as the pain fibres in the dermis are unstimulated, allowing autologous skin grafting in the outpatient setting without the need for local anaesthesia.</p><p>This study evaluates the efficacy of EG using the CelluTome Epidermal Harvesting System (Acelity, San Antonio, TX, USA), an automated epidermal harvesting system that produces an array of epidermal micro-grafts. In a pilot study carried out in our centre using this system, EG was noted to be an effective method of autologous skin grafting with complete wound healing achieved in two-thirds of selected patients with minimal or no pain and a scar-free donor site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The ability to perform EG in outpatient settings eliminates the need for a theatre space and a hospital bed, with potentially better patient satisfaction. However, it is not known if EG is an effective clinical alternative to SSG.</p><p>The mechanism of wound healing by EG may be different compared to SSG. EG is postulated to promote wound healing by expressing growth factors that accelerate wound healing and encourage keratinocytes to migrate from the wound edge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We hypothesise that EG has similar wound healing rates to SSG at 6&#x000a0;weeks but with less donor site morbidity. We wish to evaluate the efficacy of EG as an alternative to SSG and to further investigate the mechanism by which each technique achieves wound healing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study is a multicentre, randomised, control trial with two parallel groups.

Before enrolment, patients will be screened for inclusion in the trial, and a patient information sheet will be given. This process will include an explanation of the aims, methods of skin grafting and subsequent wound management, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study. Patients are given sufficient time (offered a period of 24&#x000a0;hours or more if needed) to consider whether they wish to participate. Patients will then be offered participation in the study, and informed consent will be obtained (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Wound swabs will be performed to ensure no bacterial growth. During the time of wound bed preparation, the patient will be referred to the research team. When the wound bed is deemed ready for grafting, as agreed on by two treating clinicians, patients will then be screened and offered a patient information sheet for inclusion in the trial. Once the patients are ready for intervention, following review by the study team, patients will undergo informed consent and randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Epidermal graft</title><p>Prior to grafting, the wound will be cleaned using wound irrigation solution by the surgeon and debrided if necessary. The suction head of the CelluTome Epidermal Harvesting System will be applied to the donor site (thigh) for 30&#x02013;40 minutes to harvest the epidermal graft per protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The harvested epidermal grafts will then be transferred onto the wound using a non-adhering silicone dressing (Adaptic Touch, Systagenix, Airebank Mills, Skipton, UK). The wound is then dressed with gauze or NPWT, as deemed appropriate by the treating clinician based on the type of the wound. The use of iNadine (Systagenix) will also be considered over the Adaptic Touch for wounds that are more exudative or had previous infections. The dressing will be secured with a crepe bandage or a Mepore dressing (M&#x000f6;lnlycke Health, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, UK). The donor site will be dressed with Tegaderm (3M). The wound and donor site will be reviewed on day 7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2 post-grafting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Split-thickness skin graft</title><p>Patients will undergo this procedure in the operating theatre under general or local anaesthesia. The wound will be initially debrided by the treating surgeon in a similar manner to the EG group. Skin will be harvested from the thigh using an electric air dermatome, set to cut at the thickness of 8&#x02013;10/1000 inch, which will then be meshed by 1:1.5. The wound will be grafted and dressed with Adaptic Touch (Systagenix), gauze, and a Mepore or wool and crepe bandage, depending on the site of the graft. The donor site will be dressed with Kaltostat (Alginate dressing) with a 2.5-cm overlay beyond the wound margins and secured with Mefix. Per standard clinical practise, the graft will be checked at day 7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Wound exudate sampling and punch biopsy</title><p>Wound exudate sampling will be performed by applying a filter paper (Whatman&#x02122; qualitative filter paper) on the wound for 15&#x000a0;minutes until it is moist. The filter paper will then be stored in a sterile vial and transferred to the laboratory. The wound fluid sampling will be performed before grafting and at each weekly review.</p><p>Skin punch biopsies (4&#x000a0;mm) will be taken from two locations, at the centre of the wound and at the wound edge, after administering adequate local anaesthesia (2&#x000a0;% lidocaine). This procedure will be done prior to grafting and repeated at day 7 post-grafting. The specimens are then placed in a sterile vial containing 4&#x000a0;% paraformaldehyde and transferred to the laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Laboratory studies methodology summary</title><p>The methodology is summarized as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The wound exudate samples will be used to determine the type and concentration of growth factors, pre-grafting and post-grafting, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>The skin biopsies will be used to compare the expression pattern of keratinocyte proliferative markers and Connexin protein (gap junctional proteins) before and after grafting at the wound edge and the centre of the wound.

Complete wound healing is defined as 100&#x000a0;% re-epithelialisation. The assessment of wound healing will be done via wound measurement at each review. The three-dimensional photographs of the wounds and the donor sites will be taken at each weekly visit using a LifeViz 3D camera (from Quanticare or similar) to obtain high-quality, accurate, and standardised images for digital measurement of the wound surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These images will be stored in the patient&#x02019;s digital photo diary. An independent blinded analysis of the photo diary will be carried out by two plastic surgeons. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability will also be assessed. The wounds and the donor sites will be assessed using the PUSH tool, a standardised wound assessment tool, at each visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The PUSH scores for the wounds and the donor sites will be statistically analysed.</p><p>The secondary endpoints include the mean time for complete wound healing; pain score as reported by the patients using a numerical rating scale (scale of 0&#x02013;10); patient satisfaction measured using a validated patient skin graft satisfaction questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; healthcare utilisation; and cost analysis measured by the consumables used, the frequency of visits, and the incidence of adverse events. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) include mortality of any cause within the 3-month duration from the time of initial therapy, the incidence of device-related adverse events (DAEs), and the incidence of wound-related adverse events (WAEs) occurring within the study duration. The patient skin graft satisfaction questionnaire will be completed by the participants at the 6-week and 3-month visit.</p><p>Furthermore, we will determine the wound-healing mechanism of EG compared to SSG by analysing the type and concentration of growth factors expressed by the grafts, as well as the expression of Connexin proteins (gap junctional protein) and keratinocyte proliferative markers at the wound edge and the centre of the wound before and after grafting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Participant timeline</title><p>The study was opened to recruitment in October 2015 and is anticipated to close in September 2017. Each patient will be followed up weekly for 6&#x000a0;weeks or until the wound heals. The final review will be at the third month from the initiation of the treatment. If the primary intervention had failed at week 6 &#x000b1; 2, re-grafting and repeat of biopsy as per protocol will be considered after discussing with patient. Failed intervention is defined as increasing wound size or failure of 50 % reduction in wound size at week 6 &#x000b1; 2.

This signifies a need to further optimise the current wound coverage strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. EG for wound healing is not a new concept, and several case reports have reported a good wound healing outcome; however, it is not known if the healing rate is comparable to SSG, a mainstay of treatment for wounds that cannot be closed primarily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>EPIGRAAFT is designed as a randomised, controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study to investigate the efficacy of EG against SSG. Our hypothesis is that EG has the same wound healing outcome with SSG but with lower donor site morbidity. This trial design is pragmatic with scientific evaluation on the wound-healing mechanism by EG and SSG to promote further understanding and compare the mechanism of healing at the cellular level. It is postulated that EG stimulates wound healing by acting like a bioengineered skin by expressing growth factors, thereby encouraging the wound bed to regenerate, and initiates keratinocyte migration from the edges of the wound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In vitro studies showed that the migrating keratinocytes from the grafts synthesise several growth factors, namely the vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor &#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The migrating keratinocytes also deposit a variety of extracellular matrix components, such as laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The wound exudate analysis in this trial will demonstrate the expression pattern of the growth factors expressed by the grafts in vivo. The effect of the growth factors on the wound bed and the edges of the wound will be further confirmed by the punch biopsies. The punch biopsy taken from the centre of the wound will be used to identify the expression pattern of the keratinocyte proliferative markers before and after treatment, which could suggest the activation of the wound bed with treatment. The skin biopsy from the wound edge will be used to study the migratory activity of the keratinocytes by determining the expression pattern of the Connexin proteins. The Connexin proteins are gap junctional proteins which are channel-forming proteins enabling adjacent cells to communicate and play a vital role in coordinating cell proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is known that the downregulation of Connexin protein at the edges of the wound correlates with increased keratinocytes migratory activity, resulting in accelerated wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As the EG is postulated to stimulate the keratinocytes at the wound edges to proliferate and migrate onto the wound bed, downregulation of the Connexin protein is expected at the wound edges. This, in turn, indicates that the keratinocytes have increased migratory properties. This will also be correlated with the proliferation markers of keratinocytes.</p><p>This study is expected to define the efficacy of EG and further understand the mechanism of wound healing by EG compared to SSG. These results can be used to inform the current best practise for wound care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission, the trial was actively enrolling participants.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p>The results of the study will be reported and disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific journals, conference presentations, and website/online publications, as well as in internal reports.
