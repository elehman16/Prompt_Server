Three sequential cohorts were tested at 30 g/day, 50 g/day, and 30 g/day. Gemcitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle. KLTi was administered on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 of each 28 day cycle. Patients received study treatment until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the ITT population. Safety evaluation was based on patients who received any study treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00733850.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-five patients were randomized including 41 (28:13) in Cohort 1, 18 (12:6) in Cohort 2, and 26 (17:9) in Cohort 3. Due to a different dose and/or shift in patient populations in Cohort 2 and 3, efficacy data for the 30 gm dose are presented in this manuscript for Cohort 1 alone, and for the combination of Cohort 1+3. The 30 gm KLTi + gemcitabine group had a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent radiology review in the ITT population, with a median of 112 days, versus 58 days in the gemcitabine group (HR 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.92), p = 0.0240. The incidence rates of TEAEs, CTCAE Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, and SAEs were similar between the two arms. There were no deaths related to KLTi + gemcitabine treatment.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Kanglaite Injection (30 g/day) plus a standard regimen of gemcitabine demonstrated encouraging clinical evidence of anti-neoplastic activity and a well-tolerated safety profile.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Kanglaite Injection</kwd><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>coix seed</kwd><kwd>traditional Chinese medicinal herb.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and Europe, with 1 and 5 year survival rates of 28% and 7% among patients of all stages <sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.

Twenty-one US cancer centers participated in the study. All participating sites received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for all versions of the protocol and informed consent prior to enrollment of patients. Three sequential cohorts were enrolled. Cohort 1 &#x00026; 2 were planned to evaluate KLTi 30 g/day &#x00026; 50 g/day doses, respectively, plus standard doses of gemcitabine versus a standard gemcitabine regimen. After Cohort 2 was closed due to enrollment difficulties after FOLFIRINOX became available, a third cohort, Cohort 3, was added to evaluate a potential PFS benefit of Kanglaite Injection 30 g/day dose, with a goal of an additional 100 patients. Gemcitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8 and 15 for each 28 day cycle. Kanglaite Injection was administered on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 of each 28 day cycle.</p><p>Treatment continued until disease progression, or until there was unacceptable toxicity, or until patients withdrew consent. Gemcitabine-only patients could elect to receive KLTi in an open-label extension after study treatment discontinuation from the main study.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Inclusion criteria included a life expectancy &#x02265; 84 days (12 weeks), ambulatory states and either a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of &#x02265; 60 or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2, plus histologically (cytological) confirmed pancreatic cancer, either locally invasive or metastatic, and not amenable to potentially curative surgical resection. Patients must not have previously received chemotherapy for metastatic disease and must have measurable or evaluable target lesions, by RECIST 1.1 criteria.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included a history of cancer within 5 years other than pancreatic cancer (excluding resected non-melanoma skin carcinoma); active (untreated or still receiving corticosteroids) brain metastases; prior gemcitabine &#x0003c; 12 months; taking a bile acid sequestrant drug or a fibric acid derivative drug; disturbances of lipid metabolism such as pathologic hyperlipidemia (including congenital hypertriglyceridemia or cholesterolemia), lipoid nephrosis, or acute pancreatitis; or uncontrolled Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Patients were randomized between August 25, 2008 and February 7, 2014.

The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00733850.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization to one of the two treatment groups occurred in a 2:1 (KLTi + gemcitabine: gemcitabine) ratio in this open-label study. The study site obtained the patient's treatment assignment by using a centralized Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) for Cohort 1 and 2. For Cohort 3, the study site obtained the patient's treatment assignment by using a centralized IWRS (Interactive Web Response System) within DataTrak EDC maintained by Pharm-Olam International, a 3<sup>rd</sup> party CRO. Randomization was stratified by ECOG status (0/1) or KPS 80-100 vs. ECOG status 2 or KPS 60-70 in Cohort 1 and 2, and by site in Cohort 3. For the primary endpoint of PFS, radiologic tumor response was assessed in a blinded manner by a central CT reading facility, BioClinica, Inc. (Princeton, NJ), using RECIST 1.1 criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>All patients were to receive marketed gemcitabine. Whenever Kanglaite Injection was administered on the same day as gemcitabine, the KLTi was given first, with gemcitabine followed at least 30 minutes after the end of the KLTi infusion. Gemcitabine was administered intravenously, by peripheral or central line, over a minimum of 30 minutes (and a maximum of 60 minutes), on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle. Kanglaite Injection was administered via a central venous line on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 of each 28 day cycle. The total infusion time for 300 mL of KLTi (30 gm/dl) in Cohorts 1 and 3 was expected to be approximately 120 minutes. The total infusion time for 500 mL of KLTi in Cohort 2 was expected to be approximately 180 minutes.</p><p>The investigators evaluated the tumor response in patients every 8 weeks until disease progression by means of computed tomography imaging. In addition, all scans were assessed by blinded central radiologic assessment using RECIST 1.1. Patients were followed for survival until death or study closure.</p><p>Safety was monitored by means of investigators' assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, central laboratory testing and dose delays, interruptions, modifications, and premature discontinuation of the study drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Study endpoints/Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by centralized blinded radiologic assessment. Overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) were secondary endpoints. Patient reported quality of life outcome (Functional Assessment of Anorexia Cachexia Therapy (FAACT) (Cohort 1 &#x00026; 2), National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Hepatobiliary Symptom Indexes-18 (NCCN-FACT FHSI-18) (Cohort 3)) was also included as a secondary endpoint. Additional efficacy endpoints included disease stabilization rate (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease) and 1-year survival rate.</p><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0 and were coded and summarized using system organ class and preferred terms of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 15.1. The effect of Kanglaite Injection on the time to AEs commonly associated with gemcitabine monotherapy and duration of gemcitabine dosing was investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>PFS and overall survival were analyzed with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. The hazard ratio and its two-sided 95% confidence intervals using a Cox regression model were calculated. Sample size was empirically determined in Cohort 1 and 2. Cohort 3 was powered to include an additional 100 patients to provide 74 PFS events to detect a 50% reduction in the risk of PFS events in the KLTi plus gemcitabine arm, assuming a median PFS of 4 months in the KLTi plus gemcitabine arm, and a median PFS of 2 months in the gemcitabine arm, with 24 months accrual plus 12 months follow-up, 2:1 randomization ratio, a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, and 80% power.</p><p>A multivariate analysis of survival was performed with the use of a Cox proportional hazard model to evaluate treatment effect with adjustment for baseline imbalance and potential prognostic factors. The comparisons of objective response rate and disease stabilization rate were performed with the use of the Pearson's Chi-square test and exact 95% Clopper-Pearson CI for point estimate. The difference in 1-year survival was compared using normal approximation and Greenwood's formula for SE. The time to AEs commonly associated with gemcitabine monotherapy was investigated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and the corresponding hazard ratio from Cox regression model. Duration of gemcitabine dosing was explored with the use of an ANCOVA model with treatment as the main effect. T test or Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for quality of life data. All tests were two-sided. There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons, nor was there any splitting of type I error among analyses. SAS version 9.3 was used for analyses.</p><p>Efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat population. Adverse events, clinical laboratory data and study drug exposure were analyzed based on the safety population which comprised all patients who received any study drug. Supportive efficacy analyses were provided based on the Efficacy Evaluable (EE) population which consisted of all ITT patients without major protocol deviations, who received at least one dose of study medication, and for whom both baseline and at least one post-treatment tumor assessment were available.</p><p>A data monitoring committee (DMC) was established with the responsibility of safe guarding the interests of patients and the DMC reviewed safety data on a regular basis during the conduct of the study.</p><p>The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT00733850.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>This study was funded and conducted by KangLaiTe USA, Inc.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients and treatment</title><p>A total of 85 patients were randomized in this study. Fifty-three patients received KLTi plus standard doses of gemcitabine, and 27 patients received the standard gemcitabine regimen. Forty-one patients were randomized into Cohort 1 (30 g/day). After a review by the Data Monitoring Committee, an additional 18 patients were randomized into Cohort 2 (50 g/day), but due to feasibility difficulties with enrollment and retention of patients as a result of the long infusion time, Cohort 2 was terminated. A third group, Cohort 3, was added to evaluate an additional 100 patients to KLTi 30 g/day plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy. Cohort 3 was also stopped early after 26 patients were randomized due to slowed enrollment following the FDA approval of Abraxane on September 6, 2013, to treat patients with late stage pancreatic cancer.

In the ITT population, the median survival was 178 days [95% CI, 118 to 274] in the KLTi + gemcitabine group, as compared with 162 days [95% CI, 74 to 195] in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio for death in the pooled analysis was 0.68; 95% CI: 0.38, 1.21), p = 0.1830. When stratified by cohort, the hazard ratio for death in the pooled analysis was 0.73; 95% CI: 0.40, 1.31. When stratified by cohort and adjusted for imbalance in baseline prognostic factors of disease duration, total number of lesions, race, and Karnofsky Performance Status, the hazard ratio for death in the pooled analysis was 0.81; 95% CI: 0.40, 1.64. Cohort 3 patients with last known alive date post study cut-off date were censored on 13JUN2014. At one year, the survival rate in Cohort 1+3 was 24.3% in the KLTi + gemcitabine group versus 5.5% in the gemcitabine group, with a difference of 18.8% [95% CI: 1.8%, 35.8%], p = 0.0302. Results from OS sensitivity analyses that censored patients at the start of other anti-cancer therapies were consistent with the primary OS analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective Response Rate</title><p>The Objective Response Rate by independent radiologic assessment in the ITT population in Cohort 1+3 was 15.6% (7/45) in the KLTi + gemcitabine group versus 4.5% (1/22) in the gemcitabine group.

Single agent gemcitabine was the mainstay of treatment for many years with median survival of about six months. Recently, the combination therapy FOLFIRINOX has demonstrated survival benefit in select patients with excellent performance status, representing a minority of patients with advanced disease<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The addition of nab-paclitaxel to gemcitabine led to a statistically significant but clinically small improvement in overall survival, 1.8 months, in a phase 3 trial<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. New approaches are clearly needed.</p><p>KangLaiTe injection (KLTi) has been evaluated preclinically for antitumor effects. In pancreatic cell lines, KLT downregulated expression of BCL-2 protein, increased Fas gene expression and increased apoptosis<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Apoptosis may also be enhanced through stimulation of Caspase-3 induction, seen after prolonged exposure to human pancreatic cells to KLTi <sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. KLTi increases apoptosis in a variety of other tumor cell lines and animal models<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Recently KLTi was assessed in pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice using the human pancreatic cell line PANC-1<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. After establishment of subcutaneous tumor, treatment with KLTi leads to a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in tumor volume and weight, up to 85%reduction. Apoptosis measured by TUNEL assay increased in a doses dependent manner. Evaluation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway showed no change in mRNA expression level by KLTi, but a significant reduction in phosphoAKT and phosphor mTOR levels (p&#x0003c;0.05) suggesting interference with pathway activation.</p><p>KLTi has been widely used clinically in China as an adjunct to chemotherapy since 1995 when phase III trials were completed and the product was marketed. Since that time, over 1 million cancer patients have received KLTi. A meta-analysis of its use in non-small cell lung cancer was published in 2008 by the Chinese Cochrane Evidence-Based Medicine Center <sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. This analysis included 26 trials of chemotherapy with or without KLTi in 2209 patients; most studies had moderate or high risk of bias according to the quality assessment. The meta-analysis demonstrated that chemotherapy + KLTi improved response rates (relative risk 1.34 (95% Confidence Interval, 1.19-1.51) and Karnofsky Performance Status (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.60-2.64). Additionally, KLTi reduced adverse events including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea and vomiting, and hepatic dysfunction.</p><p>Clinical trials in GI cancers adding KLTi to chemotherapy have been conducted. A randomized trial with or without KLTi in sixty patients with advanced gastric cancer receiving chemotherapy was recently reported<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. KLTi was given daily at up to 100 ml/day. The reponse rate (all partial responses) was 40% in the KLTi arm compared to 16.7% in the chemotherapy alone group (p&#x0003c;0.05), and quality of life improved more in the KLTi arm as well (P&#x0003c;,0.05). Adverse events were numerically less in the experimental arm. An open-label trial of gemcitabine +/- KLTi was conducted in Chinese pancreatic cancer patients. This study demonstrated an increase of median overall survival of 2.8 months among the 40 patients received combination therapy compared to gemcitabine monotherapy alone in 18 patients <sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>We performed this multi-centered, randomized phase 2 trial to investigate the effects of adding KLTi to gemcitabine in locally advanced/metastatic pancreas cancer. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, when KLTi 30gm was administered daily x 5 intravenously on days 1-5, 8-12 and 15-19 of each cycle. KLTi in combination with gemcitabine was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to gemcitabine alone. The study enrolled patients in three cohorts over a 6 year period. Cohort 1 and 3 received 30 gm KLTi per dose while cohort 2 revealed 50 gm KLTi per dose.</p><p>In Cohort 1, superior clinical benefits of KLTi + gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone were also observed in improved median OS, higher overall response rates as well as improved quality of life including physical well-being, functional well-being, emotional well-being, anorexia and cachexia subscale, and overall quality of life.</p><p>Cohort 3 was terminated prematurely due to slowing of patient accrual. Changes in standard of care during the time course of the study may have influenced patient referral and outcomes. Patients in cohort 3 displayed substantially and significantly different baseline characteristics compared to cohort 1, likely reflecting the changing landscape of standard treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer during this time. Median survival of patients was 100 days among the 16 post-Abraxane approval patients in Cohort 3, versus 179 days observed among the 41 patients in Cohort 1 (HR=0.44 in favor of Cohort 1, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.93, p=0.0158), and 192 days among the 10 pre Abraxane patients in Cohort 3 period suggesting referral bias for perceived poorer outcome patients post- FDA approval of the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine combination.</p><p>KLTi appeared to have positive effects upon quality of life. In both cohorts, the global QOL as well as physical subscale using well established instruments suggested improvement during treatment with KLTi versus worsening with gemcitabine alone. Similar results have been seen on multiple cancer-related symptoms when KLTi has been utilized in combination with chemotherapy <sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>Adverse events were generally similar between both arms of the study across cohorts. Of special interest, the median time to occurrence of Grade 3 or greater neutropenia was 42 days in the KLTi + gemcitabine group (N=15) compared with 26 days in the gemcitabine alone group (N=7), HR=0.59. A similar trend was observed in neutropenia (all Grades) and thrombocytopenia (all Grades, and Grades 3 or above). Reduction in hematologic toxicity has also been noted when the KLTi was added to chemotherapy for NSCLC<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In summary, Kanglaite injection 30 gm added to standard dose gemcitabine improved PFS and demonstrated numerically better one year and median overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone for pancreatic cancer in this randomized phase 2 trial. No safety signals were identified with the addition of the agent and QOL was improved with the addition of KLTi. Given the lack of incremental toxicity and potential attenuation of hematologic toxicity, KLTi could also potentially be added to a combination chemotherapy regimen such as nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine. Additional trial designs have been explored and a phase 3 trial is being prepared to define the benefit of Kanglaite injection in pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM0"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><caption><p>Supplemental information.</p></caption><media xlink:href="jcav08p1872s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the patients who participated in this trial as well as their families.
