Delirium is an acute change in cognition that manifests as poor attention and illogical thinking and is associated with longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, long-lasting cognitive deterioration and increased mortality. Ketamine has been used as an anaesthetic drug for over 50&#x02005;years and has an established safety record. Recent research suggests that, in addition to preventing acute postoperative pain, a subanaesthetic dose of intraoperative ketamine could decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium as well as other neurological and psychiatric outcomes. However, these proposed benefits of ketamine have not been tested in a large clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments (PODCAST) study is an international, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. 600 cardiac and major non-cardiac surgery patients will be randomised to receive ketamine (0.5 or 1&#x02005;mg/kg) or placebo following anaesthetic induction and prior to surgical incision. For the primary outcome, blinded observers will assess delirium on the day of surgery (postoperative day 0) and twice daily from postoperative days 1&#x02013;3 using the Confusion Assessment Method or the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. For the secondary outcomes, blinded observers will estimate pain using the Behavioral Pain Scale or the Behavioral Pain Scale for Non-Intubated Patients and patient self-report.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The PODCAST trial has been approved by the ethics boards of five participating institutions; approval is ongoing at other sites.

Scale.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The diagnostic criteria for delirium have recently been updated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V). Delirium is an acute neurocognitive disorder characterised by a fluctuating level of consciousness with impairment of attention and cognition. In the postoperative context, delirium typically manifests between 0 and 96&#x02005;h following surgical intervention. It is unclear why postoperative delirium occurs so frequently. Age greater than 60, male gender, history of dementia or depression, sensory impairment and chronic medical illness are consistently described as risk factors for delirium.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> No effective prophylactic or curative treatments for postoperative delirium have been identified.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Ketamine and delirium</title><p>Ketamine is an anaesthetic agent that has been in common use for more than 50&#x02005;years. It has a wide margin of safety, and as of 2005 had been studied in over 12&#x02005;000 operative and diagnostic procedures, involving over 10&#x02005;000 patients from 105 separate studies (ketamine package insert 2005). There is a pharmacological rationale for using ketamine as a preventative measure against postoperative delirium based on its <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Normally, excitatory amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate act as agonists at NMDA receptors, and in the setting of surgery and inflammation, they might promote excitotoxic injury and apoptosis.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> As an NMDA antagonist, ketamine has the potential to protect against such neurological injury.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Ketamine has also been posited to inhibit HCN1 receptors, which mediate the hyperpolarisation-activated cation current.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Such inhibition is pertinent to delirium because HCN1 channels are important for regulating states of consciousness<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and are upregulated by inflammation.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> HCN1 receptors are also thought to play a critical role in neuropathic pain through inflammatory cascades.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>On the basis of the pharmacological rationale for neuroprotection, a 58-patient randomised controlled trial was conducted to determine whether ketamine might prevent delirium after major cardiac surgery.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> There was a significant reduction in postoperative delirium from 31% to 3% with the administration of low-dose ketamine (0.5&#x02005;mg/kg) on induction of anaesthesia. Although encouraging, this trial must be regarded as preliminary owing to its small sample size and single-centre design. Interestingly, the same investigators also found that ketamine was associated with improved cognition beyond the immediate postoperative period.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Differences between the ketamine and placebo groups were evident in tests of non-verbal memory, verbal memory and executive function. The investigators found that C reactive protein, a non-specific inflammatory marker, was similar at baseline in the ketamine and placebo groups. On the first postoperative day, C reactive protein was elevated in both groups, but was significantly higher in the placebo group. The investigators hypothesised that the neuroprotective effect of ketamine might have been, in part, attributable to its anti-inflammatory actions.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In support of the plausibility of this hypothesis, ketamine use in another cardiac surgical population was similarly shown to attenuate postoperative increases in inflammatory markers.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>An intraoperative subanaesthetic dose of ketamine is appealing as a potential preventative intervention for delirium, since it is inexpensive and has an excellent safety profile. A number of questions remain to be answered regarding postoperative delirium. Despite the fact that delirium is a common and serious postoperative complication, intraoperative factors contributing to pathogenesis have not been rigorously investigated, and only a few small trials have been conducted that examine interventions to decrease its incidence. It is also currently unknown whether postoperative delirium is preventable, particularly in patients with underlying vulnerabilities. Importantly, ketamine in higher (anaesthetic) doses has become less popular over time owing to its side effects, including hallucinations and emergence reactions, especially in younger patients.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> To ensure treatment effectiveness, the preliminary results identifying subanaesthetic doses of ketamine as a useful preventative intervention for postoperative delirium should therefore be confirmed or refuted using a large-scale, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial design prior to routine adoption of low-dose ketamine for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>Acute and persistent pain</title><p>Similar to delirium, both acute and persistent pain are common postoperative complications, with a negative impact on patients&#x02019; lives. The Joint Commission has established the prevention of severe postoperative pain as a benchmark of quality,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and adequate pain management is increasingly viewed as a fundamental human right.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Unfortunately, this standard of care has not been attained to date; it has previously been estimated that about a third of patients suffer severe acute postsurgical pain following major procedures.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Furthermore, patients who have acute postoperative pain are more likely to develop chronic pain, and the incidence of persistent postoperative pain following major surgeries remains between 5% and 30%.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> As an antagonist at NMDA and HCN1 receptors, ketamine has powerful analgesic properties. A systematic review showed that a single subanaesthetic dose of intraoperative ketamine was associated with decreased visual analogue pain scores up to 48&#x02005;h postoperatively.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> At 24&#x02005;h postoperatively, ketamine was associated with an impressive 16&#x02005;mg decrease in total morphine consumption.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Furthermore, adverse effects such as hallucinations were rarely reported when low-dose ketamine was administered during general anaesthesia.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Consistent with these findings, a Cochrane systematic review reported that subanaesthetic doses of perioperative ketamine were associated with decreased postoperative pain, decreased morphine consumption and decreased nausea and vomiting.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Adverse effects were mild or absent.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> An updated systematic review, which included 70 small studies involving 4701 patients, recently confirmed that, in a dose-dependent manner, subanaesthetic intraoperative ketamine was consistently associated with decreased postoperative pain despite decreased opioid consumption.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The more painful the surgical procedure, the greater was the analgesic benefit attributable to ketamine.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In keeping with the decreased opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting were also less frequent in patients who received ketamine. However, patients who had been randomised to ketamine reported hallucinations and nightmares more frequently.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> While efficacy data, based on numerous small studies, strongly suggest that supplementary ketamine should be used to decrease pain and opioid usage postoperatively, most practitioners have not incorporated low-dose ketamine into their routine practice. Preliminary data gathered from five institutions (see below for details) involved in the Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments (PODCAST) trial suggest that despite their knowledge regarding the analgesic and opioid-sparing effects, practitioners do not administer low-dose ketamine for pain because of concern for complications such as delirium. Thus, effectiveness data regarding the relationship of ketamine, delirium and pain are needed.</p><p>Although numerous small efficacy studies have shown that ketamine decreases acute postoperative pain, its role in preventing persistent postoperative pain has not been rigorously explored. Many causal mechanisms that are thought to be implicated in persistent pain and a single intraoperative intervention might not be sufficient to decrease its occurrence. However, there have been encouraging findings about the potential of NMDA antagonists to decrease postoperative persistent pain. In the ENIGMA trial, patients were randomised to receive intraoperative oxygen with either nitrogen or nitrous oxide, which, like ketamine, is an NMDA antagonist. The investigators found that among those patients who received nitrous oxide, there was an absolute decrease in the percentage of patients who experience persistent pain (baseline incidence=15%) at 3&#x02005;months postoperatively of 7% (95% CI 1.9% to 13.9%).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> A randomised study has examined the potential beneficial effect of intraoperative ketamine on persistent postoperative pain among patients undergoing total hip replacement.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> This trial found a reduction in the ketamine group from 21% to 8% (reduction=13%; 95% CI 1.3% to 24.9%) in patients experiencing persistent pain at 6&#x02005;months after their surgery.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The PODCAST study would demonstrate whether a subanaesthetic dose of intraoperative ketamine is effective at preventing acute postoperative pain in a real-world setting. If ketamine was shown to have a substantial effect in decreasing acute postoperative pain, a next step would be to investigate rigorously its impact on persistent pain.</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>Current utilisation of low-dose ketamine</title><p>A survey of anaesthesia clinicians was conducted at five of the institutions (Washington University in St Louis, University of Michigan, University of Manitoba, Weill Medical College of Cornell University and Medical College of Wisconsin) participating in the PODCAST clinical trial. In total, 270 clinicians responded to the surveys; 18% (range among institutions 12&#x02013;40%) of respondents currently incorporate adjunctive subanaesthetic ketamine into their practice. Interestingly, 84% of survey respondents believe that low-dose ketamine decreases acute postoperative pain, 81% feel that it decreases postoperative opioid consumption and 51% believe that it decreases chronic postoperative pain. However, the reason that a minority of practitioners are currently administering adjunctive ketamine is probably because many remain concerned about the neurological side effects of even low-dose ketamine; 68% of respondents expressed concern about hallucinations, 62% about delirium and 55% about nightmares.</p></sec><sec id="s1a5"><title>Potential impact of PODCAST</title><p>The PODCAST trial has a novel focus in that it is assessing the impact of an intervention (subanaesthetic racemic ketamine administration) on delirium and pain, two adverse and potentially linked outcomes that have not previously been jointly evaluated in a single large clinical trial. Both delirium and pain are surprisingly common acute postoperative complications with major negative consequences for patients.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Currently, there are no official guidelines to screen patients for delirium, and only a few preventive measures have been investigated, with disappointing results. Since most patients with postoperative delirium have a hypoactive phenotype, it is frequently missed in clinical practice. As noted previously, postoperative delirium is associated with increased intensive care and hospital stay, with persistent cognitive decline and with increased mortality. Thus, any intervention that could decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium would probably have major positive implications for older patients undergoing surgical procedures. Unlike delirium, acute postoperative pain is routinely assessed, and the Joint Commission has prioritised the prevention of severe postoperative pain as a universal goal. Unfortunately, this objective has not been met, and both severe acute pain and debilitating chronic pain continue to afflict many surgical patients.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Of note, both pain and its treatment with opioid analgesics can be risk factors for delirium. Opioid analgesics are the mainstay therapy for postoperative pain, but their administration is curtailed in older patients particularly for safety considerations regarding respiratory depression, but also for concerns about causing sedation and delirium.</p><p>Pragmatic trials are intended to generate evidence of effectiveness of a test, treatment, procedure or healthcare service.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> At present, there is a lack of pragmatic trials for candidate interventions to prevent important and common postoperative neurological and psychiatric complications including delirium and pain. Ketamine is a plausible prophylactic option for each of these neurological and psychiatric complications. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has published Practice Guidelines for the management of acute and chronic pain, which, based on small efficacy or observational trials, include ketamine as a treatment option.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> There are currently no guidelines for the prevention of postoperative delirium. Thus, a multicentre pragmatic trial comparing low-dose ketamine with placebo is timely. It is important to emphasise that any one of several potential results of the PODCAST trial will have important and immediate positive implications for older surgical patients. First, ketamine might decrease both delirium and pain. This result would provide clear support for a larger comparative effectiveness trial testing ketamine as a prophylactic measure for both of these outcomes. Second, ketamine might decrease pain without increasing delirium. This result would provide compelling data that encourage the use of ketamine to prevent pain without concern for cognitive side effects such as delirium. Third, ketamine might decrease delirium and have no impact on pain. Although the lack of effect on pain is unlikely, this result would also encourage further study of the use of prophylactic intraoperative ketamine. However, low-dose ketamine may be found to increase delirium, regardless of its impact on pain. This result would suggest that the incorporation of intraoperative ketamine into routine clinical practice for older surgical patients is not warranted and would negate the need for a larger pragmatic trial. Furthermore, the PODCAST trial will help determine ketamine dose-related effects by comparing two doses (0.5 and 1&#x02005;mg/kg) to placebo. As such, all of these potential results of the PODCAST trial have the potential to impact clinical practice and will be generalisable to all older surgical patients undergoing major surgical procedures because of the permissive inclusion criteria and the simplicity of intervention.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>PODCAST is a prospective randomised controlled trial that has been designed in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> and will evaluate whether a single bolus dose of racemic ketamine (0.5 or 1&#x02005;mg/kg) following induction of anaesthesia and before surgical incision decreases the incidence or severity of postoperative delirium and pain in a mixed elderly (&#x0003e;60&#x02005;years) surgical patient population.

Patients will then be assessed for delirium twice daily (from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 3) in the morning and in the afternoon/evening with at least 6&#x02005;h between assessments.

Trainees must demonstrate competence at both conducting CAM interviews and in scoring these interviews. For the initial part of training, trainees must conduct at least two satisfactory CAM interviews in the presence of a trained team member.

Based on data from a substudy of the BAG-RECALL trial that we have recently completed, the incidence of delirium among patients admitted to our cardiothoracic intensive care unit at Barnes-Jewish Hospital is 25% within three postoperative days. Hudetz <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> found that ketamine was associated with a 28% (95% CI 8% to 46%) absolute risk reduction in delirium (from a baseline incidence of 31%). A 28% reduction is likely to be an overoptimistic effect size for designing a pragmatic study; 10% is more realistic as the most optimistic effect size and remains consistent with the CI for the effect size found by Hudetz <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Assuming a two-sided type I error rate of 5%, a sample size of 600 will give greater than 80% power to detect a decrease in the incidence of delirium from 25% to 15% with ketamine. On the other hand, we consider the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) or effect size to be 2%, which corresponds to a number needed to treat 50 surgical patients to prevent one episode of delirium. The rationale for the low MCID is that delirium is a serious postoperative complication that is associated with increased mortality and the proposed intervention (low-dose ketamine) is safe, inexpensive and not likely to have adverse effects.</p><p>There are two specific issues to clarify in this study: (1) the likely effect size with ketamine and (2) the optimal ketamine dose. Ketamine might increase delirium, decrease delirium or have no impact on delirium. If ketamine increases delirium, it is more likely to increase delirium at a higher dose (1&#x02005;mg/kg). If ketamine decreases delirium, it might have a dose&#x02013;response effect&#x02014;less delirium at the higher ketamine dose (1&#x02005;mg/kg). We anticipate that ketamine will decrease pain in a dose-dependent manner&#x02014;1&#x02005;mg/kg will be superior to 0.5&#x02005;mg/kg. Accrual of 200 patients to each dose of ketamine along with a placebo arm will allow a more robust assessment of the dose&#x02013;response efficacy for postoperative analgesia than previous studies with fewer numbers. In general, the higher ketamine dose might have more side effects. As such, this trial might inform whether the higher ketamine dose can be used, in view of its possibly superior analgesia, with a potential benefit in relation to delirium and without excessive side effects. The dosage determination going forward will depend on the observed incidence of delirium with each dose, analgesia efficacy with each dose and side effect profile with each dose.

For multivariate analyses, we will apply the Cox proportional hazards model for recurrent events to investigate the effects of low doses of intraoperative ketamine on delirium by comparing its occurrence and timing across the study groups. We will also model the number of postoperative delirium incidents using a Poisson hurdle regression to find out the difference in the proportion of patients with and without delirium, and for those who experience delirium, the difference in its recurrence. Both models (Cox proportional hazards and hurdle model) will account for differences in ketamine effectiveness in cardiac versus non-cardiac surgery by including interaction terms for ketamine dose and cardiac surgery status, while adjusting for other influential variables. We will also use mixed-effects regression models to assess differences among subgroups in continuous outcome variables over time (eg, postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption). These models will likewise account for interactions between ketamine dose and cardiac surgery status. All statistical testing will be two-sided, and p values &#x0003c;0.05 will be regarded as significant. No interim analyses are planned. Appropriate adjustment will be made for multiple analyses.</p><p>The Division of Biostatistics Informatics Core at Washington University will be used as a central location for data processing and management. Washington University belongs to a consortium of institutional partners that works to maintain a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical trial data. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) data collection projects rely on a thorough study-specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by all members of the research team with planning assistance from the Division of Biostatistics Informatics Core. The iterative development and testing process results in a well-planned data collection strategy for individual studies. REDCap servers are securely housed in an on-site limited access data centre managed by the Division of Biostatistics at Washington University. All web-based information transmission is encrypted. The data are all stored on a private firewall protected network. All users are given individual user IDs and passwords and their access is restricted on a role-specific basis. REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA-Security guidelines and is implemented and maintained according to the Washington University guidelines. REDCap currently supports &#x0003e;500 academic/non-profit consortium partners on six continents and 38&#x02005;800 research end users.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Monitoring</title><p>The research team will monitor the study for adverse events. All serious adverse events will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to the IRB stipulations. The monitoring plan for this study is appropriate for the planned pragmatic trial. As an anaesthetic drug, ketamine has an excellent safety profile and record. In particular, low-dose ketamine (0.5 or 1&#x02005;mg/kg) administered prior to surgical incision is unlikely to be associated with major adverse events, and even minor side effects manifesting after induction of anaesthesia and the start of surgery are improbable.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>

There is a rare risk of breach of confidentiality. In contrast to other anaesthetics, protective reflexes such as coughing and swallowing are maintained with low-dose ketamine. The 2005 package insert for ketamine reports the induction dose for anaesthesia as follows: the initial dose of ketamine administered intravenously may range from 1 to 4.5&#x02005;mg/kg. The average amount required to produce 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;min of surgical anaesthesia has been 2&#x02005;mg/kg. The short-term side effects of ketamine at higher doses (&#x0003e;1&#x02013;2&#x02005;mg/kg) than the dosages proposed for this study (0.5 or 1&#x02005;mg/kg) include tachycardia, nystagmus, hypersalivation, euphoria, emergence reactions, hallucinations and nightmares.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> It is possible, but very unlikely, that low-dose ketamine (0.5 or 1&#x02005;mg/kg) administered just after induction of anaesthesia or administration of sedative medications will cause these side effects.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Emergence reactions, hallucinations and nightmares are more common in younger patients receiving ketamine. In published studies on low-dose ketamine (0.25&#x02013;1&#x02005;mg/kg) administered during general anaesthesia, side effects have generally not been found.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The main side effects that might occur are nightmares and hallucinations. Other neuropsychiatric side effects might occur, most likely within the first 24&#x02005;h after surgery, and will be determined from patient interviews. The incidence of these side effects in this patient population is currently unknown, and thus side effects will be reported separately and jointly. Meta-analysis suggests that ketamine might be associated with an increase in neurological and psychiatric side effects from approximately 5% to 7.5%. This study will be &#x0003e;80% powered to detect an increase in side effects from 5% to 12% and 20% powered to detect an increase in side effects from approximately 5% to 7.5%. As part of the informed consent process for this study, patients will be informed of the rare risks and will be asked about them after their surgery. In the unlikely event that serious side effects occur, they will be documented and also reported to the human research protection office and to the study's DSMB. Participants will not incur any study-related expenses, and nor will they be financially compensated for their participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s2k1"><title>Ethics approval and consent</title><p>The PODCAST trial has been approved by the IRBs of the PIs&#x02019; home institutions (Washington University, St Louis and University of Michigan, Ann Arbor).

The ageing population often requires surgery, which can be frequently complicated by postoperative pain and delirium. Delirium is defined as an acute brain dysfunction that presents as fluctuating levels of inattention and disordered thinking, and has been reported to affect up to 70% of surgical patients older than 60. Likewise, severe postoperative pain continues to affect a large proportion of surgical patients, especially the elderly, and is another major contributor to delirium. Unfortunately, opioid medications, the current standard for analgesia, can themselves lead to delirium and other adverse consequences. Clinicians therefore face the paradox that both pain and the mainstay treatment of pain can lead to delirium. Although causal relationships have not been established, postoperative delirium is associated with increased ICU and hospital stay, persistent cognitive decline and increased mortality rate. What is needed is a therapeutic intervention that can both attenuate pain and decrease the occurrence of delirium. Mounting evidence suggests that the intraoperative administration of low-dose (ie, subanaesthetic) ketamine, an anaesthetic drug that has been in common use for 50&#x02005;years, prevents delirium, lessens the severity of postoperative pain, and has an opioid-sparing effect. These multiple beneficial effects have been attributed to ketamine's anti-inflammatory and antiexcitotoxic actions. Despite these benefits, low-dose intraoperative ketamine currently does not enjoy widespread adoption, primarily because clinicians are concerned that the psychoactive properties of ketamine might compromise postoperative cognition. The PODCAST randomised controlled trial intends to address a gap in the field through an international multicentre study that tests the effectiveness of ketamine in reducing both delirium and pain in surgical patients older than 60.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e630" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005651.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e631" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005651.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>PODCAST research group: A Alexander, R Arora, J Bang, M Bottros, A Cai, BM Choi, IC Choi, ME Davis, R Downey, D Emmert, M Engoren, SD Gandhi, L Girling, N Hanson, Z Iqbal, A Jayant, E Lenze, M Maile, J McVagh, J Neal, S Oskar, KM Patterson, E Rogers, B Tellor, T Wildes, A Villafranca, H Yulico.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> SW Ku; BM Choi; IC Choi; J Bang; E Rogers; SD Gandhi; R Downey; Z Iqbal; KM Patterson; ME Davis; H Yulico; S Oskar; J Aveek; A Villafranca; R Arora; J McVagh; L Girling; M Engoren; M Maile; A Alexander; J Neal; N Hanson; D Emmert; T Wildes; M Bottros; E Lenze; B Tellor; A Cai.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MSA and GAM are the primary authors of the PODCAST protocol.
