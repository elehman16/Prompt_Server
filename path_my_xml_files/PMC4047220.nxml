electrical stimulation (NMES) on heart rate variability (HRV). [Subjects and Methods] Ten
healthy subjects participated in the study. All subjects received NMES with a pulse
duration of 300 us and frequency of 30&#x02005;Hz at the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis for
15 minutes. The stimulation intensity was adjusted in the range of 20 to 30 mA. HRV using
a pulse oximeter was measured in the sitting position before and after NMES. [Results]
After the NMES, all HRV data slightly increased, but there was no significance between
before and after data. [Conclusion] We suggest that strengthening exercises using NMES may
be undertaken safely.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Heart rate variability</kwd><kwd>Strengthening exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Muscle strengthening exercise is effective in preventing and improving musculoskeletal and
cardiovascular system problems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
increases sympathetic activity and decreases parasympathetic activity, thereby heightening
the heart rate. When the exercise is finished, the sympathetic activity decreases and the
parasympathetic activity increases, reducing the heart rate and returning it to normal<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This type of autonomic nervous system
balance plays an important role in maintaining the health of the cardiovascular system<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>High-intensity muscle contraction performed within a short time may affect the activity of
the autonomic nervous system. In particular, resistive exercise conducted for a short time

sympathetic activity and a simultaneous decrease in parasympathetic activity, causing health
problems<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A physical therapist may enhance muscle strength by triggering muscle contraction through

Muscle strengthening by NMES may affect a person&#x02019;s autonomic nervous system balance in a
similar way to resistance exercise. Current research on electrical stimulation and autonomic
nervous system balance mostly concerns transcutaneous electrical stimulation, and research
on the effects of NMES on muscle strengthening and autonomic nervous system balance is
insufficient<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given that there are many
patients who should not be exposed to cardiac stress in a physical therapy setting, the
effects of NMES on autonomic nervous system balance need to be examined. Accordingly, this
study contracted the quadriceps muscle using NMES and measured the variability in the heart
rate to examine the effects of NMES on autonomic nervous system balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 10 healthy adult males who had no history of disease related to the
cardiovascular system and autonomic nervous system (ANS) and had the same daily routines.
The average age, weight, and height of the subjects were 22&#x000b1;2&#x02005;years, 65&#x000b1;3.2&#x02005;kg, and
164.2&#x000b1;4.1&#x02005;cm, respectively. All the subjects signed an informed consent form, and the study
was approved by the institutional review board of the Catholic University of Pusan (document
number: CUPIRB-2013-012).</p><p>The temperature and humidity of the experimental room were maintained at 23&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and 65%,
respectively, outside noise was blocked, and the experimental area was enclosed with a
curtain to minimize environmental influences. The experiment was conducted only between
17:00 and 18:00 PM. From 48 hours prior to the experiment, the subjects were forbidden to
perform exercise, overeat, or drink alcohol. From 4 hours prior to the experiment, they were
required to fast and restricted from smoking or consuming drinks containing caffeine.</p><p>They were advised to wear comfortable clothes. Prior to starting the NMES stimulation, they
rested on a chair for 10 minutes. For NMES stimulation, a subject sat on a chair and flexed
the hip joint and the knee joint at 90 degrees. The electrodes were attached to the motor
points of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. Using an ES-420 low-frequency
electrotherapy unit (ITO, Tokyo, Japan), asymmetrical biphasic rectangular wave stimulation
was applied to the motor points for 15 minutes. The wave was set at a pulse width of 300 us
with an on-time of 10 sec, and an off-time of 10 sec. The intensity of the stimulation was
adjusted in the range of 20 to 30 mA when the subject&#x02019;s knee joint was fully extended.</p><p>In a sitting position, the subject&#x02019;s right hand was placed at the same height as the
subject&#x02019;s heart, and a uBplus T1 pulse oximeter (LAXTHA Inc., Daejeon, Korea) was attached
to the right index finger. The heart rate variability (HRV) was measured before and after
NMES. The following items were analyzed: heart rate (HR), high-frequency (HF) oscillation
power, low-frequency (LF) oscillation power, standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals
(SDNN), total power (TP), and the HRV index. The Wilcoxon test was conducted on the obtained
data with SPSS 18.0, and the significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the NMES stimulation, the heart rate, LF, HF, SDNN, TP, and HRV index all slightly

study attempted to apply NMES training similar to strengthening exercise to the subjects. We
used a 30&#x02005;Hz biphasic pulse, which may trigger tetanic contractions, with an on-time of 10
sec and an off-time of 10 sec. Therefore, the duty cycle was 50%. The pulse duration, which
greatly affects the formation of quadriceps strength, was set at 300 &#x000b5;sec<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The knee joint was fully extended in a sitting position. The
intensity of the stimulation was adjusted continuously to maintain full extension during the
on-time between a minimum of 25 mA and a maximum of 35 mA. Muscle fatigue was not observed
in the subjects during the experiment.</p><p>The electrical stimulation slightly increased the LF oscillations and the HF oscillations,
reflecting the activity of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nerves, respectively.
However, the increases were not significant. The rates of the subjects heart showed almost
no change. Thus, the muscle strengthening exercise using NMES did not affect the sympathetic
or parasympathetic nervous systems. After the application of NMES, the SDNN, reflecting the
ability to resist stress, and the TP, reflecting the ability to adjust the ANS, slightly
increased. However, these changes were not significant. NMES did not influence the stress
resistance ability or the ability to adjust the ANS. The HRV index also slightly increased,
but the increase was not significant. The NMES did not affect the HRV index. The above
results show that NMES can potentially be used as a safe muscle strengthening tool.</p><p>However, electrical stimulation may modulate the activity of the sympathetic and the
parasympathetic nerves. Stein et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>
asserted that 10&#x02005;Hz of electrical stimulation to the paravertebral ganglionar region may
decrease the LF and increase the HF and that 100&#x02005;Hz of electrical stimulation may increase
the LF and decrease the HF. The present study used 60&#x02005;Hz, which is a relatively high
frequency, but the results were not consistent with those of Stein et al<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In several studies, changes in sympathetic
tone have been observed as a result of spinal cord electrical stmulation<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hsin et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that electrical stimulation at the nuchal region
may increase sympathetic tone and decrease parasympathetic activity. Because the
paravertebral regions are important sites of an anatomical autonomic organization,
electrical stimulation can easily influence the autonomic nervous system<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Wong et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> applied electrical
stimulation to acupuncture points of the hand and forearm and observed increased activity of
the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic activity slightly increased in the present
study, but the increase was not significant. Although the physiological mechanism has not
yet been discovered, acupuncture points are known to affect the autonomic nervous system.
Syuu et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that electrical
stimulation of the neiguan point of the forearm flap may influence cardiovascular function.
The discord between the results of this study and the other studies is likely due to the
differences in the areas where the electrical stimulation was applied. In the previous
studies, the electrodes were attached to the paravertebral ganglionar region or the
acupuncture point, whereas they were attached to the motor points in the present study. The
quadriceps muscle strengthening exercise using NMES did not change the balance of the ANS.
This finding suggests that NMES may be safely applied to those who have diseases that affect
the ANS. Future research to examine long-term NMES in a large number of subjects with
diverse diseases who are undergoing long-term NMES is considered necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by research funds provided by the Catholic University of
