Increased mortality is associated with systemic manifestations and complications of CAP, with sepsis being the most common and challenging. The incidence of sepsis increases with age, while age is also a predictor of outcome in patients with pneumonia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Sepsis is characterised by a state of systemic immune dysregulation and coagulopathy produced by invasive microorganisms and/or their microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The initial cytokine storm and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is followed by a compensatory anti-inflammatory response which leads to a state of significant immuno-paralysis. This has been implicated in the progression of sepsis and subsequent development of acute lung injury (ALI), multi-organ dysfunction (MODS) and death
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Neutrophils constitute our main immune defence against microbial infection by rapidly migrating to sites of infection and/or inflammation. In a process known as chemotaxis, neutrophils are able to sense and subsequently respond to shallow gradients of chemoattractants formed of chemotactic peptides, including cytokines, bacterial products and complement proteins
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Once at the site of infection, neutrophils act to eliminate any foreign material in an effort to prevent widespread tissue damage and ultimately resolve infection. During the progression of sepsis, a state of neutrophil &#x02018;paralysis&#x02019; develops resulting in the impairment of neutrophil anti-microbial functions including: chemotaxis, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unable to contain the infection, widespread dissemination of pathogenic material occurs throughout the host, augmenting inflammation and leading to the development of ALI and MODS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Secondary to the development of ALI and MODS, this immune paralysis or chronic immunosuppression leads to an increased risk of secondary infections further exacerbating the increased risk of mortality.</p><p>Mechanisms underlying defective neutrophil function remain elusive although NET formation has been implicated in the immunosuppression and increased rates of sepsis seen in neonates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], while other studies suggest NETs may exaggerate endothelial damage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The term NETs refers to the formation of extracellular fibres composed of de-condensed chromatin laden with anti-microbial proteins. Although phenotypically and functionally distinct from apoptosis, &#x02018;NETosis&#x02019; does result in cell death; however, this allows neutrophils to exert their anti-microbial functions beyond their typical lifespan
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>To date, there are no studies that specifically look at NET formation in CAP-associated sepsis. There is, however, increasing evidence that statins are able to modulate neutrophil function in sepsis with a recent study demonstrating the ability of statins to reduce the neutrophil infiltrate following LPS challenge in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from patients receiving simvastatin prior to challenge
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the reduction in neutrophil counts was not associated with a decrease in pro-inflammatory mediator expression, suggesting it reflects a reduced neutrophil response or increased neutrophil apoptosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, and have been shown to exert numerous effects in addition to their lipid-lowering properties including potentially anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several systematic reviews have concluded that statins have a role in improving infection-related outcomes and mortality; however, most of this evidence is limited to retrospective and prospective observational studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, statins have also been shown to boost NET formation in healthy individuals with the consequent elimination of bacteria - an effect which could therefore be an important determinant of outcome in patients with CAP-associated sepsis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis in the elderly</title><p>Neutrophils from healthy elderly donors demonstrate features of immune-paralysis that resemble those seen in patients with sepsis: healthy elderly patients (over 60&#x000a0;years) demonstrate defective directional migration (chemotaxis) and overall accuracy (chemotactic index) whilst maintaining their speed of migration (chemokinesis) when migrating towards IL8 and the bacterial protein f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Statins and sepsis</title><p>The ASEPSIS trial, a phase II randomised controlled trial, demonstrated that acute administration of atorvastatin reduces the progression of sepsis to severe sepsis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These changes were not associated with systemic levels of cytokines or chemokines in contrast to other reported studies suggesting the cellular effects of statins may be more important than modulation of systemic mediators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Community-acquired pneumonia-associated sepsis and neutrophil extracellular traps</title><p>During the early stages of CAP-associated sepsis, NET production is suppressed with improvements occurring during resolution. In addition, NET release was significantly lower in CAP patients who meet the criteria for severe sepsis. Taken together these data suggest that neutrophil function is a feature of CAP-associated sepsis, especially in the elderly, and that statin therapy may have potential to restore the defects in these neutrophils both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>In light of these data, we hypothesise that the increased incidence and poorer outcomes observed in the elderly population in relation to pneumonia and sepsis may be due to defective neutrophil function, and that restoration of these functions may therefore improve outcome, especially in the elderly. The SNOOPI trial therefore aims to determine whether oral treatment with simvastatin optimises neutrophil anti-microbial functions in elderly patients admitted into Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB) with septic pneumonia, improving patient outcomes in the elderly. Alterations in neutrophil function will be related to clinical outcome, disease-relevant severity scores and biomarkers present in blood and urine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial approvals and conduct</title><p>The trial is approved by Yorkshire and Humber Ethics Committee (REC 12/YH/0375) and is registered on the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT Number: 2012-003343-29).

Data collected will include demographic details, as well as physiological and ventilator variables that will act as indicators of disease severity. If the subject remains in hospital at 28 or 90&#x000a0;days, survival at these time points will be recorded by research staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p>Data will be analysed with the help of a trial statistician. Data will be analysed using SPSS for windows 17.0 (IBM, NY, USA). A detailed analysis plan will be developed during the trial prior to commencement of analysis. In brief, for continuously distributed data, differences between groups will be tested using independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests with transformations of variables to normality if appropriate or non-parametric equivalents. Chi-squared tests (or Fishers Exact tests) will be used for categorical variables. A <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 will be considered as significant. We will test for significant correlations between changes in the biological markers using standard methods. The treatment effect will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. For the further examination of relationships between a binary variable and known explanatory variables, the following tests will be applied as appropriate. Logistic regression will be used to provide the estimated risk ratios for the treatment effect with associated 95% confidence intervals. Time to event outcomes such as duration of ventilation or duration of hospital stay will be analysed by survival methods and reported as hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. A single final analysis is planned at the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial organisation/oversight</title><p>Trial oversight will be provided by a Trial Steering Committee comprising investigators, clinicians and trialists. An independent data monitoring committee will monitor the safety of participants enrolled in the trial through regular review of adverse event reports. An interim analysis of efficacy is not planned.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Preliminary data on which this study is based suggests a significant role of neutrophil immune-paralysis in the development and progression of sepsis, a process that may be amenable to correction by simvastatin.
