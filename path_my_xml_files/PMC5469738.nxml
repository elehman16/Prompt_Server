We have evaluated the immunotherapeutic potential of <italic>Mycobacterium indicus pranii</italic> (<italic>MIP</italic>) as an adjunct to Anti-Tubercular Treatment (ATT) in Cat II pulmonary TB (PTB) patients in a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentric clinical trial. 890 sputum smear positive Cat II PTB patients were randomized to receive either six intra-dermal injections (2&#x02009;+&#x02009;4) of heat-killed <italic>MIP</italic> at a dose of 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> bacilli or placebo once in 2 weeks for 2 months. Sputum smear and culture examinations were performed at different time points. <italic>MIP</italic> was safe with no adverse effects. While sputum smear conversion did not show any statistically significant difference, significantly higher number of patients (67.1%) in the <italic>MIP</italic> group achieved sputum culture conversion at fourth week compared to the placebo (57%) group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0002), suggesting a role of <italic>MIP</italic> in clearance of the bacilli. Since live bacteria are the major contributors for sustained incidence of TB, the potential of <italic>MIP</italic> in clearance of the bacilli has far reaching implications in controlling the spread of the disease.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic>) remains one of the major infectious diseases despite global efforts to contain and treat the disease which includes the Anti-Tubercular Treatment (ATT) through Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) strategy. Although, most of the <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infected individuals do not get the disease due to robust immune system, a substantial number progress to full-blown disease as soon as the immune system is compromised resulting in massive bacterial replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite good cure rate through ATT in primary TB, cases of default, non-compliance &#x00026; relapse are rampant converting these patients into category II (Cat II) TB. Cat II TB includes those patients who have failed previous TB treatment, relapsed after treatment, or have defaulted during previous treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A significant number of Cat II TB patients have been reported to develop MDR-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Hence, an effective treatment for Cat II TB patients would help in containing the infection and prevent Cat II patients converting into MDR cases.</p><p>Immunotherapy as an adjunct to standard ATT could be an important strategy to treat this category of patients. In the present study, we have evaluated the immunotherapeutic potential of <italic>Mycobacterium w</italic>, renamed as <italic>Mycobacterium indicus pranii</italic> (<italic>MIP</italic>) in Cat II Pulmonary TB (Cat II PTB) patients. <italic>MIP</italic> shares antigens with both <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> and <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> and has been shown to have significant protection against TB in both BCG responder and non-responder strains of mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. <italic>MIP</italic> has been shown to have both immunotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic effects in multibacillary leprosy patients and their contacts respectively, in both hospital and population based trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It induced conversion from lepromin negativity to lepromin positivity in multibacillary leprosy patients suggesting improved immune response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. It also reduced the bacillary load, upgraded the lesions histopathologically, led to complete clearance of granuloma and reduced the duration of multi-drug therapy in leprosy patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In a large scale double blind trial for immunoprophylaxis against leprosy, involving 28,948 people in 272 villages of Ghatampur, Kanpur, India, a retrospective analysis after 13 years showed that incidence of TB was significantly reduced in the healthy contacts of leprosy patients vaccinated with <italic>MIP</italic> as compared to the placebo group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Also, in a pilot study, addition of <italic>MIP</italic> to the short course chemotherapy in PTB patients led to earlier sputum conversion by at least 30 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Based on these encouraging results, we conducted a multi-centric trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <italic>MIP</italic> as an adjunct to ATT in Cat II PTB patients registered under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme-Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (RNTCP-DOTS).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1553 Cat II PTB patients were screened of which 531 were screen failure and remaining 1022 were randomized in 1:1 ratio into the two treatment groups. However, 132 of these, later diagnosed with MDR tuberculosis (resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid with or without any other drug), were excluded from the final analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Among the 890 eligible patients (<italic>MIP</italic> Arm&#x02009;=&#x02009;449, Placebo Arm&#x02009;=&#x02009;441) that were included in the modified intent to treat (ITT), 642 (72.13%) (<italic>MIP</italic> Arm&#x02009;=&#x02009;328, Placebo Arm&#x02009;=&#x02009;314) patients completed the full course of treatment and were included in per protocol analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 121 patients in the <italic>MIP</italic> arm (26.94%) and 127 patients in the Placebo arm (28.79%) did not complete the full course of treatment. There were multiple reasons for not completing the treatment which included death, unwillingness to continue in the trial, default in taking the treatment, pregnancy, protocol violations etc. (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There was no significant difference in the baseline features of those who did not complete the treatment, in <italic>MIP</italic> and placebo group except that there were significantly higher number of cases with one drug resistance (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014) and significantly lower number of cases who had Sputum AFB smear grade of 2+ (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.036) in the <italic>MIP</italic> group compared with placebo (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). 567 (297 in <italic>MIP</italic> arm and 270 in placebo arm) of the 642 cases who completed the treatment (88.32%), were followed up for two-years and were included in the relapse analysis. 26 patients were lost to follow-up for relapse analysis. There was no significant difference between the two arms in baseline characteristics such as, age, gender, BMI, sputum AFB grade, resistance to drugs, at initiation or radiographic severity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) in the patients who completed the treatment. <italic>MIP</italic> was safe and induced self-healing local reaction at the site of injection that subsided shortly.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Flow chart of Cat II patients screened, randomized, treated and analyzed.

The median time for sputum smear conversion was 2 weeks in both the groups. 53.35% patients in <italic>MIP</italic> group and 48.72% patients in placebo group turned sputum smear negative at 2 weeks and this difference was not significant statistically (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, the median time for sputum culture conversion was 4 weeks after initiation of therapy in both the groups, suggesting that even when the cases became sputum smear negative, they were still harboring bacilli detectable in culture. Significantly higher number of patients (67.1%) in the <italic>MIP</italic> group achieved culture conversion at fourth week compared to the placebo (57%) group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0002, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.86, 95% C.I.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.31&#x02013;2.64) suggesting a role for <italic>MIP</italic> in eradication of detectable bacilli. This trend of significantly higher number of patients showing culture conversion in <italic>MIP</italic> group was observed at each subsequent visit after fourth week which indicates inability of conventional therapy to provide equivalent culture conversion (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). By the time the follow-up reached 39<sup>th</sup> week 94.2% of patients (309/328) in the <italic>MIP</italic> arm showed sputum culture conversion as compared to 89.17% (280/314) in the placebo arm. This difference was still significant even after correction of p value for multiple comparison (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.97, 95% C.I.&#x02212;1.06&#x02013;3.75) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), suggesting the sustained effect of <italic>MIP</italic> in elimination of detectable bacilli.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Sputum-smear and culture conversion time in per protocol group i.e. patients who completed the treatment.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3">Week</th><th colspan="4">Smear conversion till (in weeks)</th><th rowspan="3">P</th><th rowspan="3">Odds Ratio (95% C.I.)</th><th colspan="4">Culture conversion till (in weeks)</th><th rowspan="3">P</th><th rowspan="3">Odds Ratio (95% C.I.)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">

Similarly, 100% of the patients (54/54) who were resistant to one drug were cured in the <italic>MIP</italic> group as compared to 81.8% (36/44) in the placebo group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;25.38, 95% C.I.&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.3&#x02013;194.9).</p><p>
<italic>MIP</italic> also had significant effect on patients with high bacillary loads. 93% of the patients (107/115) with a bacillary load of AFB3+ were cured in the <italic>MIP</italic> group compared to 84.4% (108/128) in the placebo group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.035, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.47, 95% C.I.&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98&#x02013;6.77). Similarly 94.8% of the patients (235/248) with bilateral cavities were cured in the <italic>MIP</italic> group compared to 89.3% (208/233) in the placebo group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.026, OR 2.17, 95% C.I.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.04&#x02013;4.74). These results highlight the benefits of <italic>MIP</italic> immunotherapy in the advanced cases of Cat II PTB who had drug resistance / higher bacillary indices / and had bilateral cavitations. However, these p values may not remain significant when corrected for multiple comparisons as the numbers of individuals involved in sub group analysis are small, suggesting that larger cohort of patients with drug resistance, higher bacillary indices and with bilateral cavitations need to be treated with <italic>MIP</italic> and evaluated before a conclusion can be drawn for its efficacy in &#x02018;worse to treat&#x02019; Cat II TB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Immunological Parameters</title><p>PBMCs isolated from 57 blinded samples were studied for immunological parameters.

Different assays done to assess the immune responses stimulated by <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> and <italic>MIP</italic> antigens at different time points after vaccination / placebo administration did not show any significant differences between the two groups. This could be due to a very significant variance observed in all the groups studied at different time points as was evident from the scatter-graphs of all the assays (data not shown).</p><p>However, an important observation was that mean stimulation index on <italic>in vitro</italic> restimulation of PBMCs with <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> antigen was consistently higher in the <italic>MIP</italic> group as compared to placebo group from 1 month till 6 month after the start of therapy. <italic>MIP</italic> group also showed significantly higher stimulation index (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.047) as compared to healthy controls group at 3 months and 12 months (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.013) when stimulated with <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> antigen (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A subgroup analysis based on the initial bacterial index showed that patients with AFB3+ showed better proliferation indices at 1 and 3 months when given <italic>MIP</italic> as compared to placebo. Further stratification based on AFB3+ along with bilateral cavities showed higher proliferation indices at 1 month after administration of <italic>MIP</italic>.</p><p>The amount of IL-2 secreted after <italic>in vitro</italic> re stimulation with <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> antigen showed an increasing trend in the <italic>MIP</italic> group from Day 0 to 6 month in follow-up samples on <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> stimulation while no change was seen in the placebo group, however, the difference was not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Results of lymphocyte proliferation were also reflected in the IFN-&#x003b3; secretion which increased consistently from Day 0 and almost doubled in 3 months and remained high till 12 month in the <italic>MIP</italic> group while on the contrary, the amount of secreted IFN-&#x003b3; showed a decreasing trend in the placebo group from Day 0 onward till 6 month (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). However, due to small number of samples in each group and also because of heterogeneity observed in the immune response of different patients at baseline itself differences observed between study group and placebo group were not statistically significant. Both IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; showed an increase at the first month follow-up, in AFB3+ and AFB3+ along with bilateral cavities patients. Again, the difference was not statistically significant due to small number of cases in this subgroup and huge variance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In spite of the continuous efforts made in reducing the burden of tuberculosis, the global epidemic of TB is growing, both due to untreated cases and rise in MDR-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Prevalence of MDR-TB in Cat II TB patients has been reported to be high in various studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Though there are clear WHO guidelines to treat Cat II patients, treatment failure rate reported in different studies range from 4% to 35%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These facts necessitate additional strategies to boost the immune responses in Cat II patients since they have the potential to become MDR or XDR (extensively drug resistant) TB cases. Addition of immunotherapy to ATT for Cat II PTB may be one such approach as it aims to restore the Th1/Th2 balance by enhancing the Th1 response and suppressing the excessive Th2 response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Several approaches have been adopted, like use of anti-mycobacterial antibodies, use of mycobacterial antigens for boosting Th1 immune responses, administration of Th1 cytokines etc. (reviewed in detail by Uhlin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>). However, none were found suitable for large scale use.</p><p>An alternative approach is to use an immunomodulator which can induce multifaceted immune response and eliminate the tubercle bacilli with minimal side effects. Therapeutic and prophylactic effects of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>vaccae</italic> have been evaluated in a few studies. While <italic>M</italic>. <italic>vaccae</italic> was effective in preventing TB in PPD strong positive individuals, its immunotherapeutic effects were inconclusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. While several new prophylactic vaccines are being evaluated to either replace BCG and/or as booster to BCG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, there is a dearth of studies on immunotherapeutic intervention along with ATT in TB patients. Immunotherapeutic potential of whole bacteria as well as individual specific antigens like hsp65<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, Ag85B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, MPT-64, MPT-83<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, DNA-acr, DNA-sod, Ag85C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> etc. have been evaluated in animal models of tuberculosis and had shown some promise but these subunit vaccines have their limitations for mass scale use in humans. Another candidate named RUTI that consists of liposome encapsulated detoxified bacterial fragments of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, has undergone phase I and II trials on healthy participants and latently infected TB patients for safety, tolerability and antigenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, there are very few studies on immunotherapy for treatment failure or category II TB patients.</p><p>A study reported that 62% of the treatment failure TB patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) became sputum negative in one month when an oral vaccine called V-5 Immunitor (V5) was given to them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, in our study 91.3% (21/23) of the category I treatment failure patients were cured in the <italic>MIP</italic> group as compared to 72.7% (8/11) cases in placebo group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Also, there is a serious limitation of this oral immunotherapy as the pill V-5 preparation is derived from pooled blood of HBV- and HCV-positive donors with chemical and heat inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Such formulation may not be practical for large scale use and has ethical issues due to the potential risk of developing HBV or HCV infections.</p><p>Our study is the first large scale, multi-centric trial on Cat II PTB where an immunomodulator <italic>MIP</italic> was given as an adjunct therapy along with standard ATT. Significantly higher number of patients in the <italic>MIP</italic> group showing sputum culture conversion as early as 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, suggests a role for <italic>MIP</italic> in elimination of detectable bacilli which may help in shortening the duration of treatment. While sputum smear conversion was envisaged as the primary read out for cure as per RNTCP guidelines, our data suggests that culture conversion may be a better marker for cure. At four weeks, while 68.78% of the cases in placebo group showed sputum smear conversion, only 57% of them showed sputum culture conversion (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), suggesting that significantly higher number of cases (11.78%) in the placebo group were still harboring bacilli (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.66, 95% C.I.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.19&#x02013;2.3). On the other hand, in the <italic>MIP</italic> group, 71.34% of cases showed sputum smear conversion and 67.1% showed sputum culture conversion at fourth week and this difference was not significant statistically suggesting that most of the sputum smear negative cases had also become sputum culture negative in this group. Based on these data one can speculate that sputum smear conversion may actually be giving a false negative signal and one should trust sputum culture conversion to evaluate cure rate since the acid test for clearance of the detectable bacilli would be culture negativity. Support for this also comes from recent studies where sputum culture conversion has been considered as the only widely accepted marker of sterilizing activity and efficacy and used for monitoring therapy in patients with pulmonary TB which is crucial to avoid relapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Time to culture conversion which effectively shows mycobacterial elimination, has been used in several trials to evaluate the efficacies of drugs like moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin etc. in tuberculosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Perrin <italic>et al</italic>. also suggested that early or faster culture conversion could indeed be a better surrogate marker for effectiveness of new drug as compared to culture negativity at 2-month<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p>Our post-hoc analysis showed a significant difference in cure rate in difficult to treat patients (with sputum AFB smear grade of 3+ and those with bilateral cavitations) in the <italic>MIP</italic> arm, which would definitely help in lowering the burden of TB. The immunological parameters also showed higher proliferation indices, IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion in these cases given <italic>MIP</italic> compared to placebo. While calculating the sample size we had hoped to get at least 10% improvement over and above ATT, however, we saw 24% improvement in cases that were resistant to two to three drugs, where 100% of the patients were cured in the <italic>MIP</italic> group compared to only 76.2% in the placebo group. These advanced cases, otherwise, have poor prognosis and significant improvement in them provides rationale for inclusion of <italic>MIP</italic> in RNTCP. However, larger studies are needed to substantiate the findings of the present study.</p><p>
<italic>MIP</italic> has been shown to have both immunotherapeutic as well as immunoprophylactic effects in multibacillary leprosy patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. While we could not correlate the immune responses with cure due to small sample size, <italic>MIP</italic> therapy as an adjunct to the chemotherapy in guinea pig model of tuberculosis accelerated bacterial killing through an increase in early protective Th1 immune response in the lungs of guinea pigs. This was followed by a balanced inflammatory and suppressive immune response in later part of the treatment suggesting that <italic>MIP</italic> induced immunomodulation is involved in accelerated bacterial clearance and reduction in the lung pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Recent comparative genomic analysis of <italic>MIP</italic> has attributed its immunomodulatory properties to its high antigenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p>Prophylactic potential of <italic>MIP</italic> against <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> was earlier demonstrated in a retrospective population based double blind study in Ghatampur, India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, the present study shows its clinical benefit as an immunotherapeutic agent for difficult to treat tuberculosis. At the time of initiation of the present study in 2005 the success rate of Cat II treatment in India was 68% compared to the success rate of 86% in newly sputum positive patients treated with Cat I treatment regimen. The retreatment outcomes for default and failed Cat I treatment varied from 48.8% to 55.8% in different studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, in the present study, 94.2% of the cases in <italic>MIP</italic> group and 90.4% of the cases in the placebo group were cured at 39<sup>th</sup> week. Higher cure even in the placebo group could be due to lower number of subjects enrolled with treatment failure (4%), treatment after default (40%) and removal of MDR patients from the study. Thus, this may be an effect of controlled conditions which is reflected in improved success rate.</p><p>Merits of the present study are that it is a large scale, multi-centric trial done meticulously and methodically with a good sample size. It is also the first study from India that has followed up patients after completion of treatment under Cat II regimen of the RNTCP. Shortcomings of the study are high number of cases (27.86%) who did not complete the treatment due to various reasons and heterogeneity in response rate across the study centers. Further, although there was slightly higher percentage of relapse in <italic>MIP</italic> group, the difference was not statistically significant from placebo group. The other drawback is small number of cases in the post-hoc subgroup analysis, suggesting that a much larger cohort needs to be evaluated for the efficacy of <italic>MIP</italic> in different sub-groups. Although the study was designed to be double blind, the cutaneous lesions and local reaction at the site of injection could have revealed the identity of the treatment to the doctors administering <italic>MIP</italic> or placebo. However, coded samples were sent to the laboratories for sputum smear and culture conversion and the laboratory staff involved in these analyses were totally blind to the treatment given to the patients. In spite of these short comings, our study clearly demonstrates superiority of <italic>MIP-</italic> immunomodulator in inducing early culture negativity and improving the cure rate of Cat II PTB patients with parameters that would include them in &#x02018;difficult to treat&#x02019; category (like resistant to two or three drugs, and/or very high bacillary loads and/or bilateral cavitations) where current therapy is suboptimal and adjunct immunotherapy could assist in bacillary clearance. More studies in such cases would help strengthen the findings of the present study and justify inclusion of <italic>MIP</italic> in the RNTCP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study design and population</title><p>The study was a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-centric clinical trial.
