Approximately 50% of Americans with diabetes continue to have HbA<sub>1c</sub> values above 7% (53.00&#x000a0;mmol/mol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and, while a systematic review showed there to be variability with regard to attainment of an HbA<sub>1c</sub> goal of &#x0003c;7% (53.00&#x000a0;mmol/mol) among the different classes of glucose-lowering agents, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues achieved the highest percentage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There remains an ongoing need for new treatments for type 2 diabetes that improve treatment efficacy and reduce patient treatment burden.</p><p>The incretin hormone GLP-1 is secreted by intestinal L cells following food ingestion. This hormone stimulates insulin release in a glucose-dependent fashion, resulting in a low risk of hypoglycaemia. In addition, native GLP-1 inhibits prostprandial glucagon release, which in turn may lead to a reduction in glucose release from the liver. Importantly, GLP-1 has also been shown to delay gastric emptying and reduce food intake, subsequently resulting in weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The long-acting GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist albiglutide is made up of a GLP-1 dimer that is resistant to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) fused to recombinant human albumin. Its extended duration of action (half-life of approximately 5&#x000a0;days) allows for once-weekly dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Other studies within the HARMONY phase 3 programme have shown once-weekly albiglutide to be effective, generally safe and well tolerated in combination with other oral glucose-lowering medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In this 3&#x000a0;year phase 3 trial, we report the efficacy and safety results at the 52&#x000a0;week primary endpoint of once-weekly albiglutide (30&#x000a0;mg and 50&#x000a0;mg) vs placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on a regimen of diet and exercise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>HARMONY 2 was a 3&#x000a0;year, randomised, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously injected albiglutide administered as either 30&#x000a0;mg or 50&#x000a0;mg once a week. There were four study periods: screening (2&#x000a0;weeks); run-in/stabilisation (4&#x000a0;weeks); treatment (156&#x000a0;weeks, comprising 52&#x000a0;weeks for primary endpoint) and post-treatment follow-up (8&#x000a0;weeks).</p><p>Patients were recruited from 143 sites in the USA (133 sites; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;271) and Mexico (10 sites; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38).

Albiglutide and matching placebo were supplied in as a fixed-dose (30&#x000a0;mg or 50&#x000a0;mg) pen injector system designed to administer drugs via abdominal subcutaneous injection. Both albiglutide and matching placebo contained the same excipients added to either lyophilised albiglutide or matching placebo.

Standard dietary, exercise and home glucose monitoring advice for diabetic patients was provided prior to beginning randomised treatment and this was reinforced at each study centre visit through to the end-of-treatment visit. After week 2, patients who experienced persistent hyperglycaemia qualified for rescue (metformin and insulin preferred; ESM Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>Major cardiovascular events (MI, stroke [including transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic neurological deficit]) and all deaths that occurred during treatment were adjudicated by a Clinical Endpoint Committee and are part of an ongoing meta-analysis. An independent, masked Pancreatitis Adjudication Committee adjudicated adverse events of suspected pancreatitis. Safety was also monitored by an independent data monitoring committee. The presence of albiglutide antibodies was assessed with a validated ELISA and their albiglutide-neutralising capacity was determined using a cell-based assay (see ESM <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Methods</xref>). Evaluation for systemic allergic reactions (SARs) included investigator reporting and standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) queries for anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous reaction (see ESM <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline at week 52 for albiglutide vs placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) from baseline over time, time to hyperglycaemia rescue, the proportion of patients meeting HbA<sub>1c</sub> treatment goals (&#x0003c;6.5% [&#x0003c;47.53&#x000a0;mmol/mol] and &#x0003c;7.0% [&#x0003c;53.00&#x000a0;mmol/mol]) and body weight change from baseline over time.

While the analysis of overall hypoglycaemic events was pre-specified, analysis of events that occurred pre-rescue was considered post hoc at the primary endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Using a two-sided, two-sample <italic>t</italic> test and a sequential test-wise significance level of 0.05, with a minimum of 89 patients in each albiglutide group, the albiglutide vs placebo comparison had at least 91% power to reject the null hypothesis of no treatment benefit if albiglutide treatment superiority was &#x02265;0.5% and the SD for HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline was &#x02264;1.0%. To allow for a premature patient loss of up to 15%, at least 105 patients were randomly assigned to each treatment group.</p><p>The primary analysis of HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline at week 52 evaluated the intent-to-treat (ITT) population using an ANCOVA model with treatment group, region, history of MI and age (above/below 65&#x000a0;years) as factors and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a continuous covariate. The ITT population included all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, had a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> and had at least one post-baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> assessment. Imputation for missing observations was applied to efficacy endpoints evaluated at or before week 52 using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Patients rescued from hyperglycaemia or discontinued from active treatment before week 52 had their last HbA<sub>1c</sub> before the occurrence carried forward for the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a multilevel regression model of repeated measures on change from baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> through week 52 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> treatment effect was evaluated as the contrasts between the groups&#x02019; least-squares means relative to placebo.

The between-group differences in time to hyperglycaemia rescue were compared using pair-wise logrank tests within a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier model. The treatment comparison for the proportion of patients who achieved each of the clinically meaningful HbA<sub>1c</sub> response levels was analysed using non-parametric, covariance-adjusted, extended Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel tests. As supportive analysis, logistic-regression models with effects for treatment and other main effect variables (region, age category, history of prior MI and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> category) were used to quantify the observed treatment effects.</p><p>Safety analyses were applied to the safety population, which included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Safety analyses included comparative summaries of on-therapy adverse events and rates up to 52&#x000a0;weeks (defined as events that occurred on-therapy or within 56&#x000a0;days of last dose, regardless of rescue), vital sign measurements, laboratory and physical examinations and electrocardiogram assessments.</p><p>Statistical analyses were carried out with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Role of funding source</title><p>The study sponsor participated in study design, data collection, review, analysis and report writing.

Our findings showed that albiglutide 30&#x000a0;mg and 50&#x000a0;mg administered once weekly provided a rapid, clinically relevant and durable glycaemic lowering through to the primary endpoint at week 52. Results for the secondary endpoints (FPG, HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets and time to hyperglycaemic rescue) were supportive of the primary endpoint. Modest weight loss was observed in all groups, including placebo, and a low hypoglycaemic potential was demonstrated.</p><p>The placebo-subtracted reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> observed with the albiglutide 50&#x000a0;mg dose in this study was comparable with results from liraglutide and dulaglutide placebo-controlled monotherapy studies and was greater than the reduction observed with exenatide and lixisenatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Albiglutide treatment produced a rapid effect on FPG; there was a steep decline from baseline up to week 2 and the reduced levels were maintained through to week 52. These data are further supported by albiglutide&#x02019;s sustained effect, as demonstrated by the lower proportion of patients who required rescue from hyperglycaemia in the albiglutide vs placebo groups and by the proportion of patients treated with both doses of albiglutide who achieved a treatment goal of HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7% (&#x0003c;53.00&#x000a0;mmol/mol). A greater proportion of patients receiving 30&#x000a0;mg albiglutide achieved an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7%, which may have been due to the higher starting HbA<sub>1c</sub> value in patients in the group receiving the 50&#x000a0;mg dose.</p><p>Molecular size and other properties may have an impact on the effect relative to other compounds in the central nervous system. As a large albumin-based molecule, albiglutide (approximately 72&#x000a0;kDa) may not readily cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier or diffuse into the brain at the area postrema (vomiting centre) or hypothalamus (centre for the regulation of appetite and food intake) where there is a breakdown in the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and thus it may have a more restricted access to the central nervous system than the smaller GLP-1 peptides. This may explain the finding that weight loss with albiglutide did not differ significantly from that with placebo and is an area where further research is needed.</p><p>With few exceptions, the safety profile was comparable across the three treatment groups over 52&#x000a0;weeks. Consistent with the known profile of GLP-1 agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], GI events were among the most common adverse events in the albiglutide groups. However, diarrhoea and nausea were also among the most common in the placebo group. Additionally, the frequency of nausea and vomiting reported with albiglutide in this study are consistent with those reported in other albiglutide studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and were generally lower than has been reported in studies with liraglutide and exenatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, in clinical trials of albiglutide that included exenatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and liraglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] comparator arms the incidence of GI adverse events was lower with albiglutide compared with the other GLP-1R agonists. These differences in GI tolerability profiles may be due in part to differences in the time taken to reach maximum blood concentration (3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;days for albiglutide; a matter of hours for both exenatide and liraglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). Furthermore, the large molecular size of albiglutide and its likely inability to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier may also account for the difference in GI tolerability when comparing albiglutide with other members of its class. Both efficacy measurements and adverse events have been partly linked to centrally mediated effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In this current study, although ISRs occurred with both placebo and albiglutide, the incidence was higher with albiglutide. However, events were generally mild and mostly did not lead to withdrawal from the study. Since incretin-based therapies have a glucose-dependent mechanism of action, albiglutide was expected to have a low hypoglycaemic potential and this was further supported by data from this study.</p><p>When considering differences between the 30&#x000a0;mg and 50&#x000a0;mg doses of albiglutide, a dose&#x02013;response relationship was observed for glycaemic variables but the adverse event profiles were comparable with no dose-related trends. A partial explanation for the latter finding could be tolerance or tachyphylaxis to some reported adverse events. Although it is clinically important to assess differences between the 30&#x000a0;mg and 50&#x000a0;mg doses of albiglutide, this study was not powered to do so.</p><p>A limitation of this study was the omission of a clinically relevant comparator. However, the comparison against placebo provided the best data with which to test the effectiveness and tolerability of albiglutide alone. Second, the conclusions from this study are limited to the population studied and might not be applicable to the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Our findings demonstrated that albiglutide as monotherapy for 52&#x000a0;weeks had a favourable benefit&#x02013;risk profile in patients with type 2 diabetes, provided durable glycaemic control, did not promote weight gain and was generally well tolerated. The complete 3&#x000a0;year results for this study will further clarify the results reported here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec5"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="125_2015_3795_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM Methods</label><caption><p>(PDF 80 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="125_2015_3795_MOESM2_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM Table 1</label><caption><p>(PDF 34 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="125_2015_3795_MOESM3_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM Table 2</label><caption><p>(PDF 51 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM4"><media xlink:href="125_2015_3795_MOESM4_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM Table 3</label><caption><p>(PDF 49 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM5"><media xlink:href="125_2015_3795_MOESM5_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM Table 4</label><caption><p>(PDF 34 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM6"><media xlink:href="125_2015_3795_MOESM6_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM Table 5</label><caption><p>(PDF 46 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM7"><media xlink:href="125_2015_3795_MOESM7_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM Participating Study Investigators by Country</label><caption><p>(PDF 28 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>FPG</term><def><p>Fasting plasma glucose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GI</term><def><p>Gastrointestinal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLP-1</term><def><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISR</term><def><p>Injection-site reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOCF</term><def><p>Last observation carried forward</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MI</term><def><p>Myocardial infarction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAR</term><def><p>Systemic allergic reaction</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank D.
