It is estimated that VaD affects 1&#x02013;4 of every 100 individuals aged 65&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the prevalence increases to 14&#x02013;16 of every 100 people over 80&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>VaD can arise due to a number of different underlying cerebrovascular pathologies that were defined according to a consensus classification of Vascular Cognitive Impairment developed by international experts under the auspices of the International Psychogeriatric Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. VaD is very heterogeneous condition that has been a major barrier to developing and evaluating effective therapies.</p><p>Subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia (SIVD) is the most common form of VaD and results from small-vessel disease. This disease produces either cavitating lesions in white or subcortical grey matter called lacunes and diffuse damage to white matter connections often attributed to incomplete infarction due to critical stenosis of medullary arterioles and hypoperfusion. Symptoms include motor and cognitive slowing, difficulty with complex tasks (executive dysfunction), problems with memory retrieval, dysarthria, mood changes, urinary symptoms, and short-stepped gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These manifestations probably result from ischaemic interruption of parallel circuits from the prefrontal cortex to the basal ganglia and corresponding thalamocortical connections. Brain imaging [computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] has been instrumental in revealing the prevalence of subcortical lesions, rejuvenating the concept of SIVD, and provides a ready means to identify subcortical vascular disease, which is needed to reach a diagnosis of SIVD in practice.</p><p>SIVD is a priority candidate for development and evaluation of effective treatments for VaD for a number of reasons. First, SIVD is the most common form of VaD and there is a need to focus on people with more homogeneous forms of VaD to effectively develop and evaluate new therapies that could realistically be implemented in clinical practice. In addition, the strong age-correlated prevalence of subcortical lesions combined with an ageing population means that the prevalence of SIVD is increasing. Alongside the age-related rise in subcortical pathology, the relative contribution of SIVD to vascular dementia is rising. Furthermore, progress in the treatment of large-vessel vascular disease has unfortunately not been accompanied by improvements in treatment of small-vessel disease, including SIVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>A Cochrane review identified 15 studies examining the benefit conferred by calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in dementia, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), VaD and non-specific dementia types. Of these studies ten specifically examined VaD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the majority of which were very small and did not use operationalised diagnostic criteria to recruit participants. However, the review highlighted three studies that involved more than 50 people with VaD according to operationalised criteria. Of these, two studies of 12&#x000a0;weeks duration included 67 and 62 participants respectively, and showed benefits in cognitive function and global clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The largest reported study, which included 259 people over 6&#x000a0;months found no significant benefit in cognitive outcomes in the overall study population of people with VaD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, a post hoc subgroup analysis of 92 people with SIVD from this study showed significant improvement in both cognitive and functional outcome measures, contrary to the lack of effect seen in a subgroup of people with multi-infarct dementia. The authors highlighted the need for a larger a priori trial of CCBs specifically in people with SIVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study rationale</title><p>VaD is a highly significant health issue, affecting millions of people worldwide. This condition presents a substantial challenge and burden for health service provision, health economics and both informal and formal care. Despite this there are no effective pharmacological treatments. Developing new, effective treatments is therefore an urgent imperative to ensure this enormous unmet need is addressed.</p><p>SIVD is a progressive condition with many patients showing hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, in addition to other cardiovascular comorbidities. Some studies have been conducted and further ongoing studies are evaluating the prevention of post-stroke dementia. However, to date, AFFECT is the only registered pharmacological treatment trial for SIVD.</p><p>CCBs have a consistent effect on stroke reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], can alter calcium flux in a beneficial way in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and have been shown to improve memory in hypertensive patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The previous studies in VaD and in SIVD in particular, strongly suggest the need for a properly designed randomised clinical trial to investigate CCBs in SIVD.</p><p>Amlodipine is a commonly used CCB that is now available generically at doses of 5&#x000a0;mg and 10&#x000a0;mg. It is usually initiated at the 5&#x000a0;mg daily dose and titrated to 10&#x000a0;mg. In this study, the maximum tolerated dose will be used, as this is most likely to demonstrate an effect without the compromise of side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (BHSCT) is the Sponsor for this trial that will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Office for Research Ethics Committees, Northern Ireland (14/NI/0069). The trial is registered on the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Registry (ISRCTN31208535ISRCTN31208535) and with the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials database (2014-000926-39).

The trial will comply with the principles of good clinical practice (GCP) and will be carried out in accordance with applicable legislation and the standard operating procedures of the NICTU. The trial will be reported in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 guidelines.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The AFFECT trial is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel phase IIb trial of amlodipine in patients with SIVD.</p><p>Patients with SIVD fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either amlodipine or matching placebo: 5&#x000a0;mg once daily for 2&#x000a0;weeks followed by 10&#x000a0;mg once daily for 50&#x000a0;weeks.

It should also be confirmed if the patient has increased the dose of study medication to 10&#x000a0;mg daily. The most common side effects include headache, oedema, flushing, dizziness, ankle swelling, fatigue, nausea, and rash. If the patient reports any intolerable side effects, the PI should be notified who will monitor the patient and decide on the action to be taken.</p><p>If there is significant postural hypotension (drop in systolic blood pressure on standing of greater than 20&#x000a0;mmHg), and the patient is taking 10&#x000a0;mg study medication, the dose should be reduced to 5&#x000a0;mg daily.

In addition, the patient/informant will be asked about AEs at each visit following initiation of treatment.</p><p>Events associated with the patient&#x02019;s underlying medical condition should not be reported as AEs. AEs of special interest that should be reported include dizziness and falls. All adverse reactions (ARs), an AE which is related to the administration of the study drug must be reported on the AE form within the CRF. An unexpected adverse reaction (UAR) is an AE which is related to the administration of the study drug and that is unexpected, in that it has not been previously reported in the current SPC. All UARs must be reported on the AE form within the CRF.</p><p>All serious adverse events (SAEs), SAEs that are related to the administration of the study drug (SARs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported to the CTU within 24&#x000a0;hours of becoming aware of their occurrence.

Thus 588 patients overall (i.e. 294 patients per treatment group) will be recruited. This is based on a standard deviation of 8.4, and assuming a dropout rate of 20&#x000a0;%, at 90&#x000a0;% power and 5&#x000a0;% level of significance (two-sided).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The principal comparisons will be performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. Thus, after randomisation, patients will be analysed according to their allocated treatment group irrespective of what treatment they actually receive. Full follow-up data will be obtained on every patient to allow full ITT analysis, however missing data will be problematic due to withdrawal, loss to follow-up, or non-response response questionnaire items. The results from the trial will be presented as comparative summary statistics (difference in response rates or means) with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals. The study results will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Falls will be specifically evaluated as an adverse event of special interest as part of the safety comparison. An interaction between time and randomised group will be fitted to allow estimation of treatment effect at each time point. The distribution of the change from baseline will be formally assessed for evidence of departure from normality. If necessary, data will either be transformed or analysed using a non-parametric equivalent.</p><p>The nature and mechanism for the missing outcomes will be investigated, though mixed-effects models implicitly account for data missing at random mechanism. Pre-specified subgroup analysis such as use of statins at baseline will be explored. Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to examine the robustness of the results with different assumptions about departures from randomisation policies, and handling of missing data.</p><p>For secondary outcomes, the distributions of the changes in the continuous secondary outcome measures will be formally assessed for evidence of departure from normality. In instances where such changes in outcome are not normally distributed, data will be either transformed and analysed as detailed above or tested using non-parametric equivalents.</p><p>The 52-week study data will be published following the collation and analyses of this data set. The 104-week TICS-M data will be published thereafter. The 104-week TICS-M assessment will be an important long-term outcome with valuable information examining the outcomes for patients with SIVD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Stopping guidelines</title><p>In the light of the DMEC report and other evidence from relevant studies, the DMEC will inform the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) if, in its view, there is proof beyond reasonable doubt that the data indicate the trial should be terminated. It is agreed that recommendations on premature stopping of the trial are more likely to be made on the grounds of safety as there will be no interim analysis carried out for the primary outcome of effectiveness. Therefore, any interim analysis related to the effectiveness of the study will be included in the DMEC report as guidance for benefit-to-risk assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>Service utilisation patterns, carer inputs and all associated costs will be calculated for each patient, based on data collected from study drug logs and a modified version of the CSRI completed by the informant at baseline, 13, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks. Unit costs to reflect long-run marginal opportunity costs will be attached using national figures where available, or calculated anew if necessary.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) will be conducted to compare effectiveness and costs over the 52-week period, each from the perspective of (a) the NHS and social services, and (b) society as a whole (including unpaid carer costs).</p><p>The primary outcome measure will be the incremental cost of a change in VADAS-cog score from baseline to 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcome measures will be the incremental cost of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, using utility scores calculated from the DEMQOL-Proxy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and from the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L with societal weights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Further CEAs will be conducted for other key outcomes: CGIC, sMMSE, DAD, NPI-D, and TICS-M. Cost-effectiveness ratios will be compared with other studies of dementia treatment and (where appropriate) of other treatments, and with National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) thresholds when using QALYs as the effectiveness measure.</p><p>Cost comparisons will be made between intervention and control groups, with adjustments probably needed to adjust for non-normality of data (using bootstrap methods or generalized linear modelling). For each hypothesis, relevant perspective and outcome, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be computed and compared with results from other studies where appropriate. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be plotted using bootstrap analyses to address uncertainty and locate the findings of the economic evaluation in their wider decision-making context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial oversight</title><p>The Chief Investigator (CI) will have overall responsibility for the conduct of the study. The Trial Management Group (TMG) will have responsibility for the day-to-day operational management of the trial. The conduct of the trial will be overseen by a Trial Steering Committee (TSC). The TSC comprising investigators, clinicians, trialists and lay members act as the oversight body for the trial on behalf of the Sponsor/Funder. Throughout the trial, the TSC will take responsibility for monitoring and guiding overall progress, scientific standards, operational delivery and protecting the rights and safety of trial patients. An independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will be appointed with responsibility for safeguarding the interests of trial patients, they will monitor the main outcome measures including safety and efficacy and assist and advise the TSC so as to protect the validity and credibility of the trial. A Diagnostic Monitoring and Events Adjudication (DMEA) Committee will also be established to evaluate protocol compliance, safeguard diagnostic accuracy and ensure the inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. This includes a review of MRI scans for patients on cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine and patients who experience disabling stroke/vascular events. In addition, the DMEA Committee will also review a number of randomly selected MRI scans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Discussion</title><p>Vascular dementia is a very common cause of dementia syndromes. There are no treatments licensed for VaD and there is an urgent need for intervention studies in this condition. It is a heterogeneous condition and the most common subtype is subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia. This study is designed to investigate SIVD in order to maintain a homogeneity within the study group. The agent chosen for intervention is amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. There is background information that calcium channel blocking drugs can have useful effects in people with SIVD but that there is a need for improved studies in the area of VaD and SIVD . Amlodipine is a very commonly used agent in this class which has been available for many years for the treatment of hypertension. This study is designed to investigate whether amlodipine can produce benefits compared to placebo in established SIVD. The design of the study, with multiple centres, a double-blind placebo controlled protocol, and central randomization, maximises recruitment opportunities and minimises the risk of selection or allocation bias. It is estimated that the numbers of people with VaD and SIVD will increase globally in the future and the results of this study should inform important treatment decisions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment is ongoing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AD, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease; ADL, activities of daily living; AE, adverse event; ARWMC, age-related white matter changes; BHSCT, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust; CADASIL, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CCB, calcium channel blocker; CEA, cost-effectiveness analyses; CGIC, clinical global impression of change; CI, Chief Investigator; CONSORT, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; CRF, case report form; CSRI, client service receipt inventory; CT, computed tomography; CTU, clinical trials unit; DAD, disability assessment in dementia; DEMQOL, dementia quality of life; DMEA committee, Diagnostic Monitoring and Events Adjudication committee; DMEC, Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee; DSM-IV, <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</italic>; ECG, electrocardiogram; EQ-5D, EuroQol group 5 dimensions health questionnaire; GCP, good clinical practice; GHQ-12, 12-item general health questionnaire; GP, general practitioner; IMP, investigational medicinal product; ISRCTN, International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register; ITT, intention-to-treat; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NICTU, Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit; NPI-D, neuropsychiatric inventory caregiver distress; PC-CTU, Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit; PI, Principal Investigator; QALY, quality-adjusted life-years; SAE, serious adverse event; SIVD, subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia; sMMSE, standardised Mini-Mental State Examination; SPC, summary of product characteristics; SUSAR, suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction; TICS-M, modified telephone interview for cognitive status; TMG, Trial Management Group; TSC, Trial Steering Committee; UAR, unexpected adverse reaction; VaD, vascular dementia; VADAS-cog, vascular dementia assessment scale cognitive subscale</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study is funded by the British Heart Foundation and the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Society (grant number 184).
