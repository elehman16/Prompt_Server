                    randomized, multicenter trial, using standardized digital photography to
                    clinically evaluate hand burn depth and accurately determine wound area with
                    digital planimetry. <bold>Methods:</bold> Photos in each center were taken with
                    identical digital cameras with standardized settings on a custom backdrop
                    developed at Wake Forest University containing a gray, white, black, and
                    centimeter scale. The images were downloaded, transferred via the Web, and
                    stored on servers at the principal investigator's home institution.
                    Color adjustments to each photo were made using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe, San
                    Jose, Calif). In an initial pilot study, model hands marked with circles of
                    known areas were used to determine the accuracy of the planimetry technique.
                    Two-dimensional digital planimetry using SigmaScan Pro 5.0 (SPSS Science,
                    Chicago, Ill) was used to calculate wound area from the digital images.
                        <bold>Results:</bold> Digital photography is a simple and cost-effective
                    method for quantifying wound size when used in conjunction with digital
                    planimetry (SigmaScan) and photo enhancement (Adobe Photoshop) programs. The
                    accuracy of the SigmaScan program in calculating predetermined areas was within
                    4.7% (95% CI, 3.4%&#x02013;5.9%).
                    Dorsal hand burns of the initial 20 patients in a national study involving
                    several centers were evaluated with this technique. Images obtained by
                    individuals denying experience in photography proved reliable and useful for
                    clinical evaluation and quantification of wound area. <bold>Conclusion:</bold>
                    Standardized digital photography may be used quantitatively in a Web-based,
                    multicenter trial of burn care. This technique could be modified for other
                    medical studies with visual endpoints.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Modern technology, specifically the Internet and digital imaging, has made it possible to
            efficiently communicate clinical and research information between institutions. One of
            the most prominent uses has been in radiology. Digitization and Web-based diagnostic
            imaging systems have improved image capturing, data storage, and diagnostic yield, as
            well as providing significant cost savings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> Goodwin et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> described a &#x0201c;virtual craniofacial
            team&#x0201d; that utilized digital cameras and the internet. Vascular surgeons and
            ophthalmologists have also used telemedicine for classification and treatment of lower
            extremity wounds and diabetic retinopathy, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref> While these techniques
            have been used successfully for qualitative evaluation of images, these techniques do
            not provide a standardized technique that may be successfully used for quantitative
            evaluation.</p><p>To properly evaluate a new treatment of acute hand burn injury, a prospective,
            randomized, controlled, blinded, multicenter trial was designed. One of the key
            endpoints of this study was to determine the amount of burn wound progression, requiring
            accurate evaluation of the size of the burn. As the study was designed to be Web based
            for rapid data evaluation by the principal investigator, it was deemed most efficient to
            collect the photos digitally. Prior investigators verified the reliability of digital
            imaging for the diagnosis of hand burns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> As no method was found in the literature, a
            technique was developed to provide reproducible high-quality images suitable for
            quantitative evaluation, even when collected by inexperienced photographers. This
            technique uses commercially available software that can reliably determine surface area
            of wounds with digital planimetry and demonstrated a time and cost savings when compared
            with 35-mm film techniques.</p><p>This article discusses in detail the validation of the technique of digital photography
            only for the purpose of reproducibility for use in future studies. The results of the
            clinical study have been previously presented.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The techniques outlined were designed for a clinical study to evaluate a new
                technique of acute burn care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref> Since visual
                observation remains the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; to determine the size of
                the wounds, it was necessary to develop a quantitative and standardized technique of
                digital photography that would allow objective evaluation by digital planimetry.
                Before applying this technique clinically, it was necessary to validate the
                technique in the laboratory with a simulated wound model. Once this validation was
                completed, we could apply the technique in a prospective multicenter trial. To
                determine the accuracy of the planimetry technique, standard wound models of known
                size were created on a volunteer hand. The dorsa of 3 separate hands were marked
                with 3 circular templates of a predetermined area of 12.566 cm<sup>2</sup> each
                circle. Care was taken to ensure that the final diameter on the hand was 4 cm. A
                circle shape was used as this is potentially one of the most difficult shapes to
                outline accurately with the planimetry techniques used. Images were obtained using
                the same method and custom backdrop described below. The model hand was repositioned
                and images were captured 4 times for 3 separate hands, for a total of 12 images. The
                digital planimetry program, SigmaScan Pro 5.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, Ill), was then
                used to calculate the areas marked from each image (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The sum of the 3 circular areas were calculated and then
                compared with the actual predetermined areas of 37.698 cm<sup>2</sup> (=3
                &#x000d7; 12.566 cm<sup>2</sup>). The data were analyzed using a
                <italic>t</italic> test.</p><p>Seven centers participated in the study. In the clinical portion of the study, images
                were photographed at each center with a Nikon Coolpix 995 digital camera (Nikon,
                Melville, NY) with standard settings for flash, white balance, and zoom as
                instructed on our Web site (www.burnvac.org). High-resolution photos were captured
                (9 MB), downloaded onto a PC in TIFF format, and sent through the Internet to a
                secure central server at the principal investigator's institution for
                analysis and storage. Patient confidentiality was maintained by appropriate
                firewalls, encoding the data, and using a code for each patient that was in no way
                related to identifying information such as patient hospital number.</p><p>The dorsum of the hand was photographed over a reference backdrop developed by the
                Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in association with Medical
                Photography at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. The backdrop allows
                internal standardization for each photograph in both dimension and color. It is made
                of flexible posterboard, with gray, white, and black reference scales and marked
                with horizontal gradations 2 cm apart (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).
                The backdrops may be gas sterilized for use in the operating room or with acute open
                wounds.</p><p>Digital images were evaluated on a 21-in Trinitron monitor (Sony Corporation, New
                York), calibrated with OptiCAL 3.5 (Pantone, Lawrenceville, NJ). Adobe Photoshop 6.0
                (Adobe, San Jose, Calif) was used to compensate for any exposure or color
                differences found in the original digital files (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Exposure and color corrections were made by setting a white point from a
                white area on the reference backdrop (image/adjust/levels/white eyedropper). Color
                was further refined by using the gray eyedropper to color neutralize the
                18% gray portion of the reference backdrop (image/adjust/levels/gray
                eyedropper). In both cases, the eyedropper tool was set to sample a 5 &#x000d7;
                5-pixel area.</p><p>The burned hands were analyzed with 2-dimensional planimetry, using SigmaScan Pro
                5.0. To accomplish this, the program had to be calibrated for distance before the
                areas of burn could be measured. After opening the program and image,
                image/calibrate/distance and area were selected to open a separate window.
                &#x0201c;Two-point rescaling&#x0201d; was chosen and 2 points 10 cm apart, as
                determined by the gradations from the image backdrop, were selected. In the
                &#x0201c;old distance&#x0201d; box, a new value automatically appears, and in
                the &#x0201c;new distance&#x0201d; box, a value of &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; was
                entered to finish calibrating the distance. To calculate the area of the burn,
                measurement/measurement settings were selected to open a window. The
                &#x0201c;area&#x0201d; box was checked. By selecting mode/trace measurement
                mode, the mouse was used to outline the burn. After the borders were marked, right
                clicking the mouse created a Microsoft Excel type spreadsheet with the area
                calculated in square centimeters (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). With
                burns extending beyond the dorsum of the hand, the fingers were included, and the
                wrist crease or other consistent landmarks were used as the proximal boundary.
                Circumferential burns about the hand were marked to the edges of the hand on the
                dorsal view.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Planimetry estimates from the wound models were all greater than the predetermined
                area. However, analysis determined SigmaScan was accurate to within 4.7%
                (3.4%&#x02013;5.9%, 95% CI) of the actual area
                being measured (P &#x0003c; .02).</p><p>The techniques described were successfully used to evaluate an initial 20 patients in
                an international study involving 7 centers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>
                Each center was able to learn consistent use of the cameras with instructions from
                the Web site. Adobe Photoshop normalized any color and exposure differences between
                images and was able to salvage the occasional inferior image (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Individuals denying experience in photography
                have been able to obtain reliable and useful images for clinical evaluation and
                quantification of wound area.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The use of the Internet and digital imaging is not a novel technique. It has been
                used in many areas of medicine,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> but there has been
                no reported method to allow for quantitative data collection from multiple
                institutions. In the current study, we were attempting to use the visual inspection
                of images obtained by digital photography to obtain quantitative estimates of burn
                wound size in a prospective multicenter trial of a new technique of acute burn care
                necessitating the development and validation of the technique.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></p><p>Numerous studies have investigated wounds, and they often differ in how wound area is
                measured. A common technique is to use some template, acetate paper, or clear
                plastic to trace the area of the wound. The template area can be analyzed with grid
                planimetry or scanned for computer-assisted digital planimetry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref> Langemo
                et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> used plaster of paris to make
                templates of wounds and 3-dimensional stereophotogrammetry to analyze the
                    templates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref> A less precise method of
                planimetry is diameter product where the 2 maximal perpendicular dimensions of the
                wound are calculated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> Ioannovich et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> used a computer that was able to take an
                image and differentiate the color of the wound from normal skin to calculate the
                wound area. Our decision to use SigmaScan digital planimetry was due to the need for
                a program that could reliably measure surface area from a Web-based photograph.
                Using SigmaScan is also less cumbersome and time consuming than tracing templates
                and making molds.</p><p>However, SigmaScan does have some errors, most of which are operator dependent.
                Possible problems arise when calibrating the distance or tracing the outline of area
                in question. These issues can be minimized with careful attention to detail and user
                experience. Burn edges can also be difficult to interpret, as healed epidermis is
                often hypopigmented and can be confused for the wound. Magnification and image
                enhancement with Abode Photoshop helped properly identify and mark the actual wound
                edges. In this study, the same experienced burn surgeons performed the wound
                evaluations with SigmaScan in a blinded fashion to avoid bias and interobserver
                variations in measurement.</p><p>Since the hand is a 3-dimensional object, using 2-dimensional planimetry presents
                obvious problems. In the hand model used to test the quality of our analysis, the
                calculated areas were usually larger than the actual area. This was because the
                dorsum of the hand is closer to the camera than the grids used to standardize the
                measurements on SigmaScan. However, the accuracy remained 4.7% within the
                actual area because the hand's edges are curved, so this area is
                underestimated with 2-dimensional planimetry, compensating for the overall
                overestimation. In the present study, we were evaluating changes in the same hand
                over time. Since it is likely that this error is a constant with each photo
                evaluated, it would introduce no additional error to the evaluation.</p><p>Digital photography was chosen over 35-mm photography for a number of reasons. In
                this Web-based multicenter study, the images were to ultimately be archived onto a
                computer. Digital photographs can be reproduced quickly and are easy to store and
                transfer, making them more convenient and time efficient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> With a digital
                camera, an appropriate port connection or card reader is all that is required to
                transfer the images to the computer. Thirty-five-millimeter cameras require
                additional steps to archive images to the PC. The actual 35-mm film can be either
                made into slides or developed into photo prints. In either case, the slide/print
                needs to be scanned in order for digital archiving and analysis. As a general rule,
                one would prefer to scan slide film rather than print since the print is yet another
                generation removed from the original.</p><p>A full-frame 35-mm slide scanned at 2400 dpi will be about 3600 &#x000d7; 2400
                pixels (8.6 megapixels) creating an excellent image. A 6&#x02033; &#x000d7;
                4&#x02033; 35-mm photo print scanned at 200 dpi will be about 400 &#x000d7; 600
                pixels (0.240 megapixels) producing a poor image.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> The minimum resolution
                acceptable to recognize details of a patient image is 0.39 megapixels,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> so scanning photo prints results in
                suboptimal PC images.</p><p>When comparing image quality between 35-mm slides scanned at high resolution and that
                of a digital camera, the 35-mm slide has better color and resolution, but this comes
                at the expense of using more storage memory. The Nikon digital image is captured as
                an 8-bit TIFF with 2048 &#x000d7; 1536 pixels (3.1 megapixels) and is stored as 9
                    megabytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> while the 35-mm slide can be
                stored with 8.6 megapixels of resolution requiring 22 megabytes of storage. The
                improved resolution of the 35-mm film (8.6 vs 3.1 megapixels) may seem important,
                but Jones et al<sup>10</sup> demonstrated minimal difference between in-person
                evaluation of hand burns versus digital images (with resolutions of 3.1 megapixels).
                Therefore, the 8.6-megapixel resolution from the 35-mm slide is in excess of what is
                needed to evaluate hand burns properly, and the excess memory requirement to store
                these images (22 vs 9 megabytes) only makes storage and transfer of the data more
                cumbersome.</p><p>With digital photography, there is one setup cost for the digital camera and memory
                card. This allows for unlimited photographs if the images are uploaded to a PC
                periodically. A camera similar to that used in this study and memory cards may
                readily be purchased for less than $300 at many Web sites and retailers,
                at the time of submission of this article for publication, examples of well-known
                retailers include www.buy.com, www.amazon.com, www.bestbuy.com, and
                www.circuitcity.com.</p><p>Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and SigmaScan are very powerful programs that add significantly
                to the overall cost of the study. The prices of both of these programs have slightly
                changed with an expected increase in functionality and features. The newest Adobe
                    Photoshop<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> CS3 retails for
                $649 and SigmaScan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref> Pro 5.0
                retails for $999.95. As discussed earlier, SigmaScan allowed accurate
                planimetry of images transported over the Web. Adobe Photoshop also allows for
                Web-transferred data to be analyzed, and it is a commonly available program with
                optimal editing capabilities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> Of particular
                note, the newest version of Adobe Photoshop CS3 extended version, retailing for
                    $999,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> has image measurement
                and analysis features that may make SigmaScan an unnecessary adjunct. In our
                experience, it was extremely useful in making poor images interpretable (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The only difficulty in its use was adjusting
                the gray scale of each image. Because of the bending of the backdrop and angle of
                lights, the gray scale was not a uniform tone. Therefore, different areas on the
                gray backdrop had to be sampled before a satisfactory image was achieved.</p><p>In conclusion, our method of collecting images on a background with a digital camera
                and analysis of the burn area and appearance with SigmaScan and Adobe Photoshop,
                respectively, allow quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data. Currently,
                our institution and others are using these techniques in a study of burn wounds.
                Future studies monitoring the effectiveness of therapeutic treatments in Web-based
                multicenter trials with visual endpoints could potentially apply these methods.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Molnar</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Heimbach</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibran</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of subatmospheric pressure treatment of acute burn
