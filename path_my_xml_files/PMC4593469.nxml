Although switching from oral antipsychotics to the long-acting injectable formulation may improve convenience, patient satisfaction has not been studied extensively. We carried out a 21-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative study. A total of 154 patients with schizophrenia unsatisfied with current oral atypical antipsychotics were assigned randomly to either immediate or delayed switching to paliperidone palmitate, the long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone. The Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) were used to evaluate patient satisfaction with treatment, whereas the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale were used to evaluate efficacy. From baseline to the final assessment, the MSQ score increased significantly in both groups, and the increase was greatest after the first administration of paliperidone palmitate in the immediate switch group. The scores of TSQM effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction as well as the PSP total score increased significantly, whereas the PANSS total score decreased significantly in both groups. The immediate switch group showed a significant improvement in the TSQM convenience score compared with the delayed switch group on oral antipsychotics during the comparison period. Most adverse events were minor and tolerable. In short, switching from oral atypical antipsychotics to paliperidone palmitate because of poor satisfaction significantly improved patient satisfaction, with comparable efficacy and tolerability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>atypical antipsychotics</kwd><kwd>long-acting injectable antipsychotics</kwd><kwd>Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire</kwd><kwd>paliperidone palmitate</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In recent years, both the research and the practice of management of schizophrenia have focused on the influence of patients&#x02019; subjective satisfaction with treatment on the clinical outcome. This is in line with the increased recognition of the patients&#x02019; right as a consumer of medical service to participate in the decision-making process of therapy (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Awad and Voruganti, 2013</xref>) as well as reports on the association between patients&#x02019; subjective assessment and clinical outcomes of schizophrenia such as treatment adherence (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Gharabawi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Medication adherence among patients using atypical antipsychotics may be higher than that in patients using typical antipsychotics in the short term, but this difference is no longer significant in the long term (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Dolder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). It was also found that about 95% of the patients could not keep up with the daily oral dosing schedule (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Mahmoud <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). A recent study comparing medication satisfaction also found no significant difference in convenience between patients on typical antipsychotics and those on atypical antipsychotics (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Fujikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). These results indicate that the adherence to oral medications is still a challenge in the management of schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients with a high adherence to treatment generally show symptom improvement, a lower rate of readmission, and a higher chance of finding a job. In contrast, nonadherent patients have a 3.7 times higher risk of recurrence than adherent patients (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fenton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). It is noteworthy that high patient satisfaction with current oral atypical antipsychotics was reported to be associated with a lower rate of treatment discontinuation (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Gharabawi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Moreover, the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study found that an antipsychotic medication was most frequently discontinued because of the patients&#x02019; own choice (29.9%) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Lieberman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Patients&#x02019; subjective satisfaction with treatment is also associated with the efficacy of treatment and can be considered an indicator of the treatment&#x02019;s success. Patient satisfaction with antipsychotic medication positively correlates with symptomatic improvement as assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), improved community functioning (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Mohamed <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), better quality of life (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hofer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Mohamed <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), as well as adherence. There are varying factors affecting patient satisfaction with antipsychotic medications, such as their expectations of efficacy, subjective experience, and side effects (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Kalali, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Rofail <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Therefore, patient satisfaction with medication is a patient-centered indicator and an important clinical factor that influences the symptomatic effect, tolerance, efficacy, and convenience of treatment (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Kane, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Awad and Voruganti, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile, the long-acting injection is expected to improve medication convenience with lower administration frequency as opposed to daily administered oral drugs. The long-acting injection also provides a more stable blood concentration and a better tolerability profile (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Ereshefsky, 1999</xref>), ruling out gastrointestinal malabsorption or the first-pass effect through the liver. However, there are limited data on the association of long-acting injectable risperidone with improved medication satisfaction during the switch from oral antipsychotics (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Lindenmayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and the burden of receiving shots every other week may have worked as a limitation of the injectable formulation (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In contrast, paliperidone palmitate is an ester prodrug of paliperidone, an oral atypical antipsychotic with dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) receptor antagonism. Paliperidone palmitate was developed as a long-acting drug that can be administered intramuscularly once a month, without the need for an early oral supplementation (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gopal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Samtani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Randomized, double-blind clinical studies have reported the effectiveness, tolerability, and efficacy of paliperidone palmitate in patients with acute schizophrenia (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Hough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Pandina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hargarter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this light, paliperidone palmitate can be expected to overcome the limitation of existing oral atypical antipsychotics in terms of effectiveness, tolerance, efficacy, and convenience as well as to enhance patient satisfaction. So far, no well-designed studies have examined these aspects of paliperidone palmitate. In this study, schizophrenic patients unsatisfied with current oral atypical antipsychotics were randomized either to the immediate switch group or to the delayed switch group. Patients of the immediate switch group were switched immediately to paliperidone palmitate and those assigned to the delayed switch group maintained the current drug for 8 weeks before switching to paliperidone palmitate. In other words, patients of the delayed group maintained current atypical oral drugs while attempting dose adjustment or addition of another concomitant medication to enhance their satisfaction. Patients in the immediate switch group were switched to paliperidone palmitate upon enrollment. We compared the clinical outcomes between the two groups to determine the necessity of active, immediate intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This multicenter randomized open-label comparative study was carried out at 16 centers in Korea.

Randomization was performed using randomly permuted blocks, with four patients per block, to ensure balanced treatment allocation. Patients with no history of oral paliperidone or oral or injectable risperidone were recommended to use oral paliperidone (3&#x02009;mg/day) or risperidone (1&#x02009;mg/day) for at least 3 days during the screening phase for tolerability. An overview of essential study procedures is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Those assigned to the immediate switch group received paliperidone palmitate six times in 120 days. Paliperidone palmitate 150 and 100&#x02009;mg&#x02009;eq. were administered on Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 8 (Visit 3) as loading doses, respectively. Paliperidone palmitate 75&#x02009;mg&#x02009;eq. was recommended for later visits, or 25, 50, 75, 100, or 150&#x02009;mg&#x02009;eq. were administered at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion. However, those assigned to the delayed switch group maintained the current oral atypical antipsychotics from Day 1 to Day 56 and received paliperidone palmitate four times from Day 57 to Day 120. Paliperidone palmitate 150 and 100&#x02009;mg&#x02009;eq. were administered on Day 57 (Visit 5) and Day 64 (Visit 6) as loading doses, respectively.

Safety evaluation included the regular reporting of adverse events and vital signs. Results of the laboratory tests, pregnancy test, physical examination, and ECG were recorded at screening and the final visit (or at premature discontinuation).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Efficacy was analyzed in the per-protocol analysis set and the full analysis set. The full analysis set included patients who were administered with the study drug or oral atypical drug at least once, did not violate the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and underwent MSQ assessment at baseline and at least once after that. The per-protocol analysis set included patients who did not violate the inclusion/exclusion criteria among those in the full analysis set and whose MSQ score was adjusted for missing data for the primary efficacy evaluation. In addition, the group of patients who completed the study without a protocol violation was defined as the strict per-protocol set. Safety analysis and demographic data were analyzed in the safety analysis set, which included all patients who received the study drug at least once. For efficacy variables with missing values after randomization, the last-observation-carried-forward imputation method was applied.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the MSQ score from baseline to endpoint collected from all participants in two switch groups. Changes in the primary and secondary endpoints from baseline were analyzed for within-group and between-group comparisons. The paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used for within-group comparisons. Between-group comparisons including the change in scores were performed using analysis of covariance with separate terms in the model with baseline characteristics and treatment (i.e. MSQ, TSQM domain scores for effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction) included as covariates. In addition, the MSQ score per visit was divided into unsatisfied (score 1&#x02013;4, including participants who were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied) and satisfied (score 5&#x02013;7), and analyzed as a categorical variable using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The statistical significance of differences between treatment groups in demographic and baseline characteristics was assessed using analysis of variance for continuous variables and the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test for association or the nonparametric Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for discrete variables, as applicable. All statistical tests were performed at the two-sided 0.05. No adjustment was made for multiplicity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and patient disposition</title><p>One hundred and seventy participants were screened, among whom 154 were randomized.

We observed that switching from unsatisfactory oral atypical medication to paliperidone palmitate significantly increased patient satisfaction, mostly by improvement in medication convenience. The clinical efficacy and tolerability of paliperidone palmitate were comparable to those of oral medication. Taken together, these results suggest that paliperidone palmitate could provide a valuable treatment option for patients with schizophrenia who are not satisfied with their oral antipsychotic medication and in possible danger of nonadherence to treatment.</p><p>Recent studies have suggested that treatment satisfaction could be influenced by tolerability, symptomatic efficacy, effectiveness, and convenience (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Hough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gopal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Samtani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The route of administration is an important factor in the treatment of schizophrenia. In terms of medication convenience, long-acting oral antipsychotics are reported to be often favored to short-acting oral antipsychotics (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bitter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In one study comparing haloperidol depot and long-acting risperidone, patients treated with long-acting risperidone showed better results in terms of social activity and satisfaction with life (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Mihajlovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In addition, patients treated with long-acting risperidone showed improvement in the total PANSS score, clinical global impression, global assessment of functioning, and satisfaction (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Parellada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Nick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) compared with baseline. However, one limitation of long-acting risperidone is that injections are administered every other week. Paliperidone palmitate, in contrast, can be administered once a month. The results of this study showed a statistically significant improvement in the TSQM convenience score in both groups, which lends support to the expectation that paliperidone palmitate may increase patient satisfaction by enhancing the convenience of treatment.</p><p>It is noteworthy that noncompliance in schizophrenia is reported to occur in the early phase of treatment. Relapse occurs soon after treatment discontinuation (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Emsley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and the most frequent reason for relapse is treatment discontinuation (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Our results show that paliperidone palmitate would improve treatment adherence as well as patient satisfaction in the early phase, although this study did not examine the timing of switch.</p><p>Compared with other studies on patients&#x02019; subjective satisfaction, we applied the MSQ and TSQM, which are validated and more sophisticated scales (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Potkin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Canuso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and could more accurately evaluate the effects of paliperidone palmitate on patient satisfaction. Furthermore, significant improvements in PANSS and PSP scores from baseline to endpoint provided more support to the improvement in patient satisfaction with treatment.</p><p>This study has several limitations. As all patients were assigned to the treatment group without a placebo or a control group, a bias cannot be ruled out. Second, the reason for dissatisfaction of each patient was not taken into account. Further research is needed for a more accurate evaluation of the efficacy, tolerability of paliperidone palmitate and its effects on patient satisfaction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>This research was supported by grants from the Janssen Pharmaceuticals, whose role was restricted to providing assistance to the investigators in the conception, conduct, and analysis of this study.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Atkinson</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hass</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Colman</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>RN</given-names></name><name><surname>Brod</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group> (<year>2004</year>). <article-title>Validation of a general measure of treatment satisfaction, the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), using a national panel study of chronic disease</article-title>. <source>Health Qual Life Outcomes</source>
