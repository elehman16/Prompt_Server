Currently, the treatment for proteinuria is mainly limited to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, Chinese medicinals &#x02018;securing essence and tonifying the kidney&#x02019; may be appropriate for proteinuria. The most promising Chinese medicinals and formulae are introduced in the present study to form a potent formula for DN proteinuria. To make oral administration convenient, the formula will be processed in the form of granules.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A randomized, multi-center pilot trial will be conducted. Forty eight participants with DN will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups:</p><p>1. A granule group, at 10 grams, three times daily (G10 group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12);</p><p>2. A granule group, at 20 grams, three times daily (G20 group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12);</p><p>3. A decoction group (D group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12); and</p><p>4.

It stores essence and the essence transforms <italic>Qi</italic> and produces blood. In addition, the kidney is the source of genuine <italic>Yin</italic> and genuine <italic>Yang</italic>. It is called &#x02018;the prenatal base of life&#x02019; in TCM textbooks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the TCM system, there are many Chinese medicinals classified as tonifying and replenishing medicinals. Many of them have the effects of replenishing <italic>Qi</italic> of the kidney or tonifying kidney <italic>Yang</italic>.</p><p>We have known that DN is the major complication of diabetes and proteinuria is the hallmark of DN. DN is also defined by increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in the absence of other renal diseases, which is categorized into stages according to the level of UAE, that is, microalbuminuria (30 to 299 mg/24 hours) and macroalbuminuria (300 mg/24 hours or greater) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Currently, the treatment for proteinuria is largely limited to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although the clinical beneficial effects of many ACE inhibitors or ARBs have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the efforts of looking for new drugs for DN that involve reducing proteinuria never stop. For example, many researchers investigated astragalus for the treatment of DN and the results seemed intriguing. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] systematically reviewed published animal experiments that had assessed the renal protective effects of astragalus in diabetic rat models. Their results showed significant beneficial effects of astragalus involving improved fasting blood glucose levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary albumin excretion rate, and thickness of the glomerular basement membrane. Hong and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] reported that astragalus might &#x02018;play protective roles in diabetic nephropathy through multiple pathways at the gene level&#x02019;.</p><p>Is TCM really able to lower proteinuria in patients with DN? Current evidence has tried to address this issue, but the picture remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The present research looks at the DN-lowering proteinuria effect of TCM to answer this question. To evaluate the effects of TCM accurately, the most promising Chinese medicinals and formulae are used in the present study to form a potent formula for the treatment of proteinuria of DN.</p><p>Because proteinuria, in TCM theory, results from the leakage of the essence of the human body due to an insufficiency of the kidney, it is promising to look for Chinese medicinals that secure the essence and tonify the kidney for the treatment of proteinuria. A typical herb that secures essence and tonifies the kidney is used in the present study, Flastem Milkvetch Seed. A famous classical formula securing the essence and tonifying the kidney is also introduced in the present study for the treatment of proteinuria (Water-land Two Elixirs). It consists of two Chinese medicinals, Gordon Euryale Seed and Cherokee Rose Fruit. The first ingredient is grown in water and the second one is grown on land, which is the reason why it is named &#x02018;Water-land.&#x02019; This formula is very effective for treating conditions such as spermatorrhea and enuresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, only securing essence is not enough; because <italic>Yin/Yang</italic> has been damaged, it is essential to repair the balance between them.</p><p>There is a therapeutic strategy in TCM theory, namely, using &#x02018;cool&#x02019; and &#x02018;warm&#x02019; herbs together to balance <italic>Yin/Yang</italic>; this strategy is introduced in the present study. As the most conspicuous topic in the area of TCM treatment for DN, astragalus may be a very potent Chinese medicinal for proteinuria; therefore, it is also used in the present study. Both basic and clinical studies have demonstrated that astragalus could exert beneficial effects on DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An <italic>in vitro</italic> study investigated the effect of calycosin and calycosin-7-O-&#x003b2;-D-glucoside. These two major isoflavonoids in astragalus were tested with high glucose-induced rat mesangial cell proliferation and advanced glycation end product (AGE)-induced human glomerular endothelial cell apoptosis. The results suggested that both isoflavonoids had a significant therapeutic potential to modulate the development and/or progression of DN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Zhang and his co-workers studied the effects of astragalus polysaccharide (APS), an aqueous extract from the astragalus membranaceus roots, on gene expressions of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and an inhibitory protein of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) in experimental DN rats induced by streptozotocin. The results showed that APS improved proteinuria and renal function and that the mRNA level of NF-kappaB in renal cortex was decreased and IkappaB mRNA expression was raised by APS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A randomized controlled trial showed that astragalus, in combination with captopril, could significantly reduce UAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, astragalus is an herb of warm properties and has the capacity to upset the balance of <italic>Yin/Yang</italic>. Coptidis, is an herb of cool properties and is used to counteract the potential harm caused by astragalus. Coptidis is used for proteinuria because not only does it have centuries of practice-based recognition as a reliable TCM remedy for diabetes mellitus but its potential as a treatment for DN has been established in recent evidence-based supportive research. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] evaluated the effects of compound Rhizoma Coptidis capsule (CRCC) on early DN in rats induced by streptozotocin. Their results showed that CRCC could reduce the levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), proteinuria, the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and IV-C proteins, and alleviate pathological lesions in renal tissue of diabetic rats with nephropathy.</p><p>As a result, five Chinese medicinals are used in the present study for the treatment of proteinuria: astragalus, coptidis, Flastem Milkvetch Seed, Gordon Euryale Seed and Cherokee Rose Fruit (the Latin name and English name of the Chinese herbs mentioned in the article are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Traditional Chinese Medicinal Herbs used in </bold><bold><italic>Huang Qi Elixir </italic></bold><bold>formula/granule</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>PinYin name</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Latin name</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>English name</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Daily decoction dose</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Dose per 1,000 g granule</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Huangqi<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Radix Astragali</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Astragalus/Astragalus membranaceus<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">30 g<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">500g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shayuanzi<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Semen Astragali Complanati</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Flastem Milkvetch Seed<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">30 g<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">500g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Huanglian<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rhizoma Coptidis</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Golden Thread<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 g<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">167g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jinyingzi<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Fructus Rosae Laevigatae</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cherokee Rose Fruit<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">15 g<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">250g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Qianshi</td><td align="left"><italic>Semen Euryales</italic></td><td align="left">Gordon Euryale Seed</td><td align="left">15 g</td><td align="left">250g</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>One of the most obvious inconveniences of TCM is the preparation. It is very difficult to ask patients to decoct TCM several times daily for a long time and, therefore, this research group decided to make the formula in the form of granules (the ingredients are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The granules are processed using the following methods: first, <italic>coptidis</italic> is ethanol extracted; second, the other five herbs are decocted together and then aqueous extracted; third, the concentrate from the previous two steps is mixed and then spray-dried.
