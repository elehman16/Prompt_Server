These findings confirm a potent expression of the second-meal effect in people with type 2 diabetes similar to that resulting from intravenous arginine infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The importance of the present observation is that a more practical means of improving glucose tolerance could potentially be of therapeutic benefit in people with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>We observed no effect of the prior snack on insulin secretion after breakfast. The mechanism underlying the second-meal effect has been shown to be due to suppression of plasma FFA, allowing greater storage of glucose as muscle glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). We previously demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the decrease of preprandial plasma FFA levels and the postmeal glucose increment. In the present study, a significant positive correlation was found between prebreakfast plasma FFA and the rise in postprandial plasma glucose concentration. This observation is analogous to the acute effect of the antilipolytic nicotinic acid analog acipimox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The snack used in the present study was empirically designed. It will be important to optimize both the composition of the snack and the interval before breakfast to maximize the benefit of this approach. In everyday life, the gap between snack and breakfast would have to be accommodated, for instance, by delaying breakfast until mid-morning. Although the snack induced a small increase in plasma glucose, it was minimal and unlikely to contribute to the hyperglycemic burden. The sample size was dictated by prior power calculation (80% power with 10 subjects).</p><p>We have demonstrated that a high-protein, low-carbohydrate snack before breakfast attenuates postbreakfast hyperglycemia, and further studies must determine whether long-term use is associated with improvement in A1C.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
