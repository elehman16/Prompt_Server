However, a significant proportion of patients with stage I NSCLC are not suitable for surgery because of poor fitness, often related to the presence of significant medical co-morbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease. For instance, the National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA) database of lung cancer treatment in England and Wales from 2008 to 2012 showed that the resection rate for patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC was 20.8 and 21.4&#x000a0;% in those patients aged &#x0003c;65 and 65&#x02013;74, respectively; for patients aged &#x0003e;75, the rate was 13.9&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An analysis of the same database shows that 30- and 90-day mortality following surgery rise steeply with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; 90-day mortality being 6.4&#x000a0;% for 70-year-olds versus 43&#x000a0;% for 80-year-olds, a deteriorating performance status is also a factor influencing the outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>An alternative, potentially curative, treatment to surgery is conventionally fractionated radical radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the results of conventional fractionated radical radiotherapy (using 20&#x02013;33 fractions of radiation at a daily dose of 2&#x02013;2.75&#x000a0;Gy to a total dose of 55&#x02013;66&#x000a0;Gy) are poor. A meta-analysis reported OS at 2- and 5-year rates of 52 and 19&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], respectively, with a mean local recurrence rate of 40&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Though the CHART trial of hyper-fractionated radiotherapy and modelling studies have shown a steep dose&#x02013;response curve for local control of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], a trial comparing 60 with 74&#x000a0;Gy, albeit combined with concurrent chemotherapy, was stopped due to increased mortality in the high-dose arm. Thus, 60&#x02013;66&#x000a0;Gy in 2&#x000a0;Gy per fraction has been the standard of care for NSCLC in many countries; in the UK, a hypofractionated regime of 55&#x000a0;Gy in 20 fractions is also used. Concerns regarding toxicity often preclude patients with significant co-morbidity from being offered conventionally fractionated radical radiotherapy. However, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), which uses modern radiotherapeutic techniques to deliver large doses of radiation in 3&#x02013;8 fractions to a total in excess of 100&#x000a0;Gy biologically equivalent dose (BED), has shown superiority (albeit in uncontrolled series) to conventional radiotherapy in terms of local control and toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>SABR is highly accurate in its delivery and conformal with the irradiated volume (planning treatment volume&#x02014;PTV); consisting of an individually determined margin for tumour movement, a very small margin added for daily set-up error as image guidance is used during the treatment and with no margin applied for microscopic spread. Thus, the proportion of normal lung irradiated to significant dose is much lower for SABR compared with conventionally fractionated radical radiotherapy.</p><p>Hence, SABR is a low-risk treatment in the majority of patients, even those with severe pulmonary morbidity (excluding those with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis). A meta-analysis has shown a 5-year survival of 42&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and local recurrence of less than 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A study of the treatment of early stage NSCLC in a large region of the Netherlands showed that as SABR was introduced, the proportion of patients offered no specific anti-cancer treatment fell; those offered radical radiotherapy rose without affecting the number of patients receiving surgery, accompanied by an improvement in OS for early stage NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These data strongly imply that SABR is a good option for the majority of patients with medically inoperable NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient population</title><p>A meta-analysis compared SABR with surgery in cohorts of patients, with adjustment for age and medical operability, and found similar outcomes for mortality and tumour control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, no adequately powered randomised trial comparing the two modalities has been successful.</p><p>Worldwide, there have been three trials comparing surgery and SABR: ROSEL (NCT00687986), STARS (NCT00840749) and ACOSOG&#x02013;RTOG (NCT01336894), all of which closed early due to failure to recruit. In ROSEL, this was thought to be due to lack of support from the surgical community as it included medically operable patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The STARS trial was also limited to patients fit for conventional surgery (lobectomy or pneumonectomy), whilst the RTOG trial was limited to patients at high risk of lobectomy, where the planned surgery was sub-lobar (wedge or segmental) resection. An intention-to-treat pooled analysis of the ROSEL and STARS trial was recently published. In the STARS trial, of the 234 patients screened, only 36 were enrolled and randomly assigned and only 22 patients were enrolled into the ROSEL study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The results of this analysis have shown an overall advantage, in terms of 3-year survival, for SABR; however, because of the limited power of the study, this result cannot be considered definitive.</p><p>Previously, the only randomised trial of surgery versus radiotherapy for NSCLC recruited 58 patients from 1954 to 1958 and was published in 1963; this showed a 4-year survival for surgery of 23 versus 7&#x000a0;% for radiotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, bearing in mind the difficulty of carrying out a randomised trial of surgery versus radiotherapy, a multidisciplinary group was established to produce the protocol for the SABRTooth trial. This multidisciplinary group designed the protocol around the well-established referral pathway for cancer patients in the UK where all cancer patients&#x02019; cases are discussed in a multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting before a treatment decision is made. At least one representative of all clinical specialities (pathologists, surgeons, chest physicians, oncologists, cancer nurses and radiologists) involved in lung cancer diagnosis and management is present to provide a balanced treatment decision.</p><p>The aim was to produce a pragmatic protocol based on everyday practice such that SABR could be delivered using any approved technique, and the choice of surgical procedure (lobectomy, anatomical segmentectomy or wedge resection) was left to the discretion of the treating thoracic surgeon.</p><p>Subsequently, a small number of established lung cancer centres and their referral units were chosen for this feasibility trial with a trial workshop and launch meeting to help get &#x0201c;buy-in&#x0201d; from surgeons, respiratory physicians and oncologists from each centre.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial aims and objectives</title><p>The SABRTooth trial aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting an adequately powered definitive phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing surgery with SABR in patients with peripheral stage I NSCLC deemed at higher risk of complications from surgical resection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p>SABRTooth is a UK-based, multi-centre, open-label, two-group individually randomised controlled feasibility study targeted at patients with peripheral stage I NSCLC considered at higher risk from surgical resection.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient and public involvement (PPI)</title><p>Given the known difficulties in recruiting patients to RCTs where the two treatment options are very difficult, PPI has been critical in the development of the trial. We have had patient and patient&#x02019;s relatives input into the protocol design, lay summary patient information leaflets and held an initial trial workshop and trial launch meeting. In addition, we have two PPI members on the trial management group (TMG) and a further PPI member on the trial steering committee (TSC).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Trial population</title><p>Those patients considered at higher risk of complications from surgical resection are defined as &#x0201c;a level of fitness that could lead to a greater than average morbidity or mortality from surgery&#x0201d;. This includes those patients with poor lung function who are at risk of increased post-operative dyspnoea that would be sufficient to be unacceptable to them (this is subjective and will vary from patient to patient) and patients who have an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity that might lead to a perioperative complication or death.</p><p>In order to maximise recruitment, the protocol does not specify what constitutes high risk but leaves it to the judgment of the individual MDT. However, we have produced guidelines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: SABRTooth trial schema; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to ensure appropriate patients are considered for the trial.

It has been estimated that 690 patients are required for the phase III trial to have 80&#x000a0;% power to show non-inferiority (NI) of SABR to surgery, where this is defined as SABR being less than 8&#x000a0;% worse in terms of 3-year OS (derived from an in-house simulation programme which accounts for the likely excess early death rate in the surgery arm in comparison with the SABR arm). This sample size also yields &#x0003e;97&#x000a0;% power for a similar 10&#x000a0;% NI margin for difference in mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per arm and greater than 80&#x000a0;% power to show superiority.</p><p>In order to demonstrate the feasibility of recruitment within this feasibility study, we are aiming to recruit on average three patients per month from four UK large treatment centres and two smaller referral units. This equates to 36 patients per year (i.e. 9 patients from each of the 4 large treatment centres). Including these 4 established centres (and their referral units) within a subsequent phase III trial, recruiting at the same rate, 180 patients could be recruited over a 5-year period. We would also aim to include an additional 15 UK large treatment centres, plus their associated referral units. If these 15 centres recruited at 75&#x000a0;% of the rate of the centres within the feasibility study, an additional 100 patients could be recruited a year; 500 patients over a 5-year period. Thus, with approximately 19 large treatment centres and their associated referral units, a target of 690 patients over a 5-year period would be feasible, which equates to a rate of 138 patients per year.</p><p>Additionally, a number of international groups including Australia (TROG) and Europe have confirmed interest in the study and are keen to be involved. International collaboration for the phase III trial would increase the trial population considerably and reduce the recruitment period significantly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Recruitment</title><p>SABRTooth opened to recruitment in July 2015.</p><p>The recruitment period is 21&#x000a0;months, and all participants will be followed up until 6&#x000a0;months after the last patient has been randomised. Participants will be recruited from six UK hospitals in total, a mixture of tertiary treatment centres and smaller referral units. All treatment centres are established lung cancer surgical centres with established SABR programmes for lung cancer and a proven track record of recruitment into clinical trials.</p><p>We recognise the challenge of avoiding clinician bias and the need to describe equipoise between the two very different treatment interventions. To address this, the respiratory physician and research nurse will introduce the trial to avoid any bias. We have assessed existing evidence in optimising recruitment to trials and held mock patient interview scenarios and used these as a basis to develop a training guide for recruiters on how best to approach and discuss the trial with patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A careful explanation of the risks and benefits of the two treatment interventions is crucial; such risks will be clearly explained to interested patients in an unbiased and fair way, assisted by written trial-specific patient information. Potential patients for this study will be identified by expert lung cancer teams through the appropriate MDT meeting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Following confirmation of written informed consent and eligibility, patients will be randomised using a 24-hour telephone or web-based system based at the Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research (Leeds, UK). Patients will be randomised using stratified permuted blocks to either surgery or SABR (1:1), stratified for recruiting site only. Patient randomisation is to take place as close to the intervention start date as possible and, in line with National Health Service (NHS) guidelines, is aimed to be done no more than 31&#x000a0;days prior to treatment start date.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Pre-treatment investigations</title><p>Patients must have had a pathological and/or clinical and radiological diagnosis of stage I NSCLC. Pathological confirmation prior to randomisation is encouraged, but patients without histology, providing the putative tumour has demonstrated growth on serial radiological imaging (preferably, on CT, but if the lesion is clearly evaluable on chest X-ray, this will be acceptable) and is positron emission tomography (PET) avid (showing FDG avidity greater than the mediastinal blood pool), will be eligible (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>SABRTooth trial inclusion and exclusion criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Inclusion criteria</td></tr><tr><td>1.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Follow-up</title><p>The planned duration of the trial follow-up is until 6&#x000a0;months after the last participant is randomised. Follow-up frequency will be in line with current NHS practice with routine follow-up visits and data collection at 6&#x000a0;weeks, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months post-treatment. Minimal clinical data will also be recorded at 15 and 21&#x000a0;months post-treatment; patient-reported questionnaires due to be completed at these time points will be administered via post.

A core internal project team, TMG and TSC will be established, with the TSC performing a dual role and acting as the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC). Overall data and trial management will be provided by the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU) (University of Leeds, UK).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Qualitative interviews</title><p>The trial includes embedded qualitative exploration of the reasons for non-participation in the SABRTooth study. As the two treatments are very different, patients may have a strong preference for either surgery or SABR or may feel uncomfortable to have a decision between such different treatment options being taken out of their hands. What patients understand, perceive and feel about how the SABRTooth study and how it was presented to them and their expectations of study burden will be explored in qualitative feedback interviews. Participants who agree to participate in the study but subsequently do not take up their treatment allocation after being randomised will also be invited to take part in a feedback interview (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Understanding why patients choose not to participate or do not take up their treatment allocation will be crucial in assisting optimal recruitment methods and ensuring the most appropriate design of any subsequent phase III study.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Quality of life</title><p>Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline, day 1 of treatment, 6&#x000a0;weeks post-treatment and then 3 monthly until 24&#x000a0;months post-treatment or until the end of the trial follow-up period (6&#x000a0;months after the last patient has been randomised).

</p><p>Questionnaires will be completed by participants at their standard clinic visits, i.e. baseline; day 1 of treatment; 6&#x000a0;weeks post-treatment; and 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months post-treatment. Questionnaires due to be completed at 15 and 21&#x000a0;months post-treatment will be administered via post.</p><p>The frequent collection of quality of life (QoL) data within this feasibility study is necessary in order to assess the burden to patients. This will be assessed by monitoring compliance rates in terms of proportion of questionnaires returned and completed and will inform the optimal frequency of data collection for the planned subsequent phase III trial. Averaged QALYs are intended as a co-primary endpoint for the planned phase III trial, as such, determining the optimal frequency of EQ-5D data collection within this feasibility study is crucial. Utility estimates will be derived from the EQ-5D data collected within this feasibility study and used to inform the power calculations for the QALY co-primary endpoint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Health economics</title><p>As this is a feasibility study, a formal cost analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis will not be performed. The resource use and societal&#x02013;economic data will be analysed and reported using descriptive statistics of frequency and quantity of specific resources used on average by patients. The objective will be to identify the main drivers of difference in resource use and out-of-pocket expenses between the two arms. Compliance and missing data will also be described. These data will inform an efficient design of the patient questionnaires in the subsequent phase III study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical methods and analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis will be the responsibility of the SABRTooth CTRU trial statistician.

Final analysis of all other endpoint data will be carried out 6&#x000a0;months after the final participant has been randomised.</p><p>The primary endpoint analysis will be based on the population of participants recruited within the formal monitoring period. All further analysis will be carried out on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population defined as all participants randomised to the trial, regardless of adherence to the protocol, withdrawal of consent or losses to follow-up. Participants will be included within the treatment arm to which they were randomised.</p><p>An interim analysis will take place approximately midway through the study and be reported to the TSC. The aim of the interim analysis is to evaluate and monitor the key study objectives (i.e. recruitment rates, number of participants taking up their treatment allocation, feedback from the qualitative interviews), as well as expected serious complications (SCs) and unexpected serious complications (USCs) and the delivery time of surgery/SABR post-randomisation. The TSC will have the opportunity to raise any concerns with the trial progression/running allowing the trial team to improve processes going forward.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Primary endpoint analysis</title><p>

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p>To know whether SABR is a better, equivalent or inferior alternative to surgery for higher risk patients is a key question in lung cancer. The primary aim of this feasibility study is to demonstrate that, over 21&#x000a0;months, enough patients can be randomised from 6 centres to indicate that a phase III trial recruiting 690 patients over 5&#x000a0;years in 20 UK centres would be feasible. The multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints will help determine the most optimum recruitment and data collection strategies and help optimise the design of a future phase III trial where the key aims would be to show NI of SABR to surgery and determine the relative costs of the two treatments and their effects on quality of life. Other studies comparing SABR to surgery have closed early due to poor recruitment, and therefore, the SABRTooth trial is a pragmatic study based on everyday practice in hospitals managing lung cancer. Considerable effort has been made to try and maximise recruitment.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The SABRTooth feasibility study has been designed around the UK NHS cancer pathway for managing lung cancer.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Neither histological proof nor exact quantitative measurement of risk for surgery is mandated for entry into the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The protocol has been developed through national lung cancer meetings over the past 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;years to promote awareness to the UK clinical oncologists, respiratory physicians and thoracic surgeons.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A strong MDT with representatives of all concerned medical specialities involved in the management of lung cancer has developed the protocol.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A small number of centres with highly motivated clinicians have been selected.</p></list-item><list-item><p>PPI has been critical to the development of the protocol, lay summary and patient information leaflets.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mock patient interview scenarios with constructive feedback have been produced to provide a guide on how to approach and discuss the trial with patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The trial is introduced to patients by a &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; respiratory physician and then, if the patient is interested in the study, consent is obtained by a lung cancer trials nurse.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Approached patients who decline randomisation or their allocated treatment arm are offered an interview to explore their reasons for not entering the trial. Lessons learnt can then be used to try and improve recruitment.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Therefore, we believe that such a well-designed feasibility study in this clinical scenario will address very important issues of clinician and patient equipoise. We hope that, if this study is successful, we will be able to progress to a national randomised phase III study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BED</term><def><p>biologically equivalent dose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>computerised tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTRU</term><def><p>Clinical Trials Research Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPEX</term><def><p>cardio-pulmonary exercise testing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p>electrocardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECOG PS</term><def><p>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EORTC</term><def><p>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D&#x02122;</term><def><p>Euro-Quality of Life 5D utility score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-VAS&#x02122;</term><def><p>Euro-Quality of Life visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISWT</term><def><p>Incremental Shuttle Walk Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDT</term><def><p>multidisciplinary team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCDR</term><def><p>National Cancer Data Repository</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NLCA</term><def><p>National Lung Cancer Audit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NI</term><def><p>non-inferiority</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHR</term><def><p>National Institute for Health Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSCLC</term><def><p>non-small cell lung cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PET</term><def><p>positron emission tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>quality-adjusted life year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLQ-C30</term><def><p>Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLQ-LC30</term><def><p>Lung Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p>overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SABR</term><def><p>stereotactic ablative radiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p>serious complication</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOP</term><def><p>standard operating procedure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TMG</term><def><p>trial management group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSC</term><def><p>trial steering committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USC</term><def><p>unexpected serious complication</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>An erratum to this article can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40814-016-0095-6">http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40814-016-0095-6</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MS, KF, LM and AS drafted the manuscript with critical input from all other authors who reviewed, read and approved the final manuscript.
