The vector selection of a novel quadripolar LV pacing lead, which was mainly developed to overcome technical issues with stimulation thresholds and phrenic nerve capture, may affect hemodynamic response, and was therefore assessed in this study.

Optimal (worst) LVPCs per patient were identified as those with maximal (minimal) %change in LV+dP/dt<sub>max</sub> (%&#x00394;LV+dP/dt<sub>max</sub>) as compared to a preceding baseline. LV+dP/dt<sub>max</sub> significantly increased in all 145 LVPCs (p&#x0003c;0.0001 compared to baseline) with significant intraindividual differences between LVPCs (p&#x0003c;0.0001). Overall, CRT acutely augmented %&#x00394;LV+dP/dt<sub>max</sub> by 31.3% (95% CI 24%&#x02013;39%) in the optimal, by 21.3% (95% CI: 15%&#x02013;27%) in the worst and by 28.2% (95% CI: 21%&#x02013;36%) in a default distal LVPC. This resulted in an absolute additional acute increase in %&#x00394;LV+dP/dt<sub>max</sub> of 10.0% (95% CI: 7%&#x02013;13%) of the optimal when compared to the worst (p&#x0003c;0.0001), and of 3.1% (95% CI: 1%&#x02013;5%) of the optimal when compared to the default distal LVPC (p&#x0003c;0.001).

Therefore, in current guidelines <xref rid="pone.0067235-Dickstein1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, CRT is indicated for patients with depressed left ventricular (LV) function, NYHA class II&#x02013;IV heart failure and a wide QRS complex. However, in the aforementioned large clinical trials, a large proportion of patients did not respond to therapy. This failure to respond may be due to inappropriate patient selection, progressive structural damage to the heart and/or suboptimal placement of the LV lead. Especially the latter has been subject to clinical <xref rid="pone.0067235-Butter1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and experimental <xref rid="pone.0067235-Helm1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> studies, trials evaluating a multitude of endocardial pacing sites <xref rid="pone.0067235-Spragg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0067235-Padeletti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and retrospective analyses of large multicenter trials <xref rid="pone.0067235-Saxon1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067235-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Inconsistent findings suggest that the optimal pacing site may be specific to each patient and needs individual assessment.

However, hemodynamic consequences of these different LVPCs are largely unknown. Real life data has already shown that non-traditional LVPCs (i.e. LVPCs not programmable with standard bipolar leads) are used in a large number of patients, and it has been speculated that the choice is not only affected by pacing thresholds, but also by the perceived hemodynamic response <xref rid="pone.0067235-Forleo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0067235-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0067235.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Possible left ventricular pacing configurations - Nomenclature and LVPCs programmable with the quadripolar LV lead.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0067235.g001"/></fig><p>We hypothesized that the hemodynamic response differs according to which LVPC is used and therefore affects response to CRT in the individual.

Written informed consent was obtained. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Inclusion criteria included heart failure NYHA II-IV despite optimal medical therapy, LV ejection fraction &#x02264; 35%, left bundle branch block with QRS width &#x0003e;130 ms and sinus rhythm at the time of implantation. The study is registered at the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00000573).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Device Implantation</title><p>Device implantation was performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory following a standard procedure. Briefly, after pocket preparation, the subclavian vein was used for vascular access. The ICD shock lead was screwed in the right ventricular (RV) apex in all patients. Subsequently, after an angiogram of the coronary sinus (CS) and its tributaries was performed, a lateral or posterolateral vein was accessed with a guide wire, over which the quadripolar LV lead (Quartet&#x02122;, St. Jude Medical) was advanced until a stable wedge position was achieved. The atrial lead was screwed into the area of the right atrial appendage. All leads were sutured to the sleeve and attached to the CRT device (Promote Quadra&#x02122;, St. Jude Medical), which was placed into the prepared pocket. Device interrogation had to confirm stable and adequate lead measurements before the wound was closed. The device was programmed to VVI-40 back-up pacing until optimization.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Optimization</title><p>Invasive optimization was scheduled for the working day following device implantation. In the catheterization laboratory, the Pressure Wire&#x000ae; Certus (St. Jude Medical) was placed in the left ventricle via a 5F femoral sheath and a guiding catheter, and then connected to the electronic control unit (RADI Analyzer&#x000ae; Xpress, St. Jude Medical) and a personal computer for real-time assessment and storage of LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> (PhysioMon&#x000a9; software version 2.02, Radi Medical Systems).</p><p>First, the optimal AV delay was assessed by measurement of LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> with the CRT-ICD programmed to a functional VDD modus with AV delays gradually increased from 40 to 300 ms (or appearance of intrinsic conduction) in 20&#x02013;25 ms steps. These measurements were conducted with the LV lead programmed to a distal (D1M2) and proximal (P4M2) LVPC to exclude interdependence of AV delay and LVPCs. Subsequent biventricular pacing measurements were conducted at the individual optimal AV delay with simultaneous biventricular pacing. No VV-optimization was performed. All measurements started with a 120 s baseline period, followed by 120 s of VDD RV pacing. To minimize confounding effects, all possible LV lead configurations were assessed in random order as outlined below, each active for 120 s and each preceded by a 120 s baseline reference period without pacing to account for potential hemodynamic alterations over time. The optimal and worst pacing sites were defined as the sites which yielded the highest (lowest) value for mean LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> expressed as percent of the mean LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> in the preceding baseline period without pacing (%&#x00394;LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub>). Optimal versus worst and optimal versus default distal (D1M2) LVPC were compared per patient. The latter will be referred to as &#x0201c;distal&#x0201d; in the text and was chosen because it is the default programming of the device.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>After informed consent, the sequence of biventricular pacing configurations was assigned from a computer-generated randomization list by staff otherwise uninvolved, to guarantee treatment concealment. A Williams design was planned to exclude order effects, so that each pairwise sequence of pacing configurations would occur exactly twice in the 20 patients.</p><p>For each patient, absolute LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> measurements in all different LVPCs over the respective 120 s measuring periods were compared to the preceding baseline and to RV only pacing periods using the unpaired t-test. The distributions of %&#x00394;LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> measurements in all LVPCs were compared by intra-individual ANOVA for each patient. Here, a) differences between all interventions were investigated using the F-test for the overall effect of intervention and b) differences between pairs of interventions were investigated via application of the Bonferroni-correction to all possible pairwise comparisons. Test results are reported for optimal versus worst and optimal versus default distal (D1M2) LVPC per patient. Analyses in the entire sample of patients comprised the following. Stability of mean baseline LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> over time was investigated in a mixed model for repeated measures. Mean values for %&#x00394;LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> per LVPC were compared using the paired t-test. Contingency tables were analysed by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. All tests were two-sided with significance level &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5%. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism, version 5.0c, &#x000a9;GraphPad Software, Inc., and the Statistical Analysis System version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Implantation and Optimization</title><p>In all 20 patients, the device was implanted without acute surgical complications. In all patients, a posterolateral position of the quadripolar LV lead could be achieved.

An additional patient had to be excluded because of frequent ventricular extrasystole precluding invasive testing. The remaining 16 patients constituted the study group and were invasively optimized on the working day following CRT device implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067235-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

This concept, however, has recently been challenged by animal studies in failing heart showing that lateral, but more anterior and apical pacing sites produced best CRT effect <xref rid="pone.0067235-Helm1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, studies in humans involving evaluation of multiple endocardial pacing sites in patients with ischemic <xref rid="pone.0067235-Spragg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067235-Padeletti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy <xref rid="pone.0067235-Derval1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067235-Padeletti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, as well as retrospective analyses of large multicenter trials <xref rid="pone.0067235-Saxon1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067235-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Therefore, it is easily conceivable that studies that evaluated CRT response at different sites within single CS tributaries did not find systematic, but substantial intraindividual differences with respect to the optimal pacing site <xref rid="pone.0067235-Gold1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067235-Shetty2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Nowadays, epicardial LV stimulation via the CS is standard of care, even though, in the individual patient, sites not accessible via the CS may yield better response. This was specifically demonstrated by accessing the LV endocardium in 35 patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy <xref rid="pone.0067235-Derval1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and 11 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy <xref rid="pone.0067235-Spragg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Derval et al. <xref rid="pone.0067235-Derval1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> found that (LV-only) pacing from within the CS augmented LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> by 15&#x000b1;23% to a significantly lower extent than the best endocardial site (31&#x000b1;26%). Spragg et al. <xref rid="pone.0067235-Spragg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> found an increase in LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> by CS pacing of 13% versus an average 36% increase with endocardial LV pacing in 7 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The optimal pacing site here was often found in the extreme base of the LV. This site in most cases could not be stimulated with proximal vectors in our study, since, for stability reasons, the LV electrode was advanced until a distal wedge position was achieved. Possibly, further developments of LV multipolar electrodes might overcome this issue by adding some or increasing the distance between electrodes. However, as we now could show that individually programming a quadripolar lead adds an additional absolute 10% of %&#x00394;LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> increase, this might already help to overcome some of the restraints linked to pacing in distal CS tributaries. It must also be acknowledged, that it is a complex and time-consuming procedure to individually assess a multitude of pacing sites from the endocardium, there is limited experience with permanently pacing the LV from the endocardial side <xref rid="pone.0067235-Bordachar1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067235-Whinnett1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and optimal pacing sites may vary over time with changing activation patterns and/or cardiac geometry. The latter might at least in part be overcome by simple reprogramming of a multipolar electrode rather than by revision of an implanted endocardial lead.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strategies to Define Optimal LV Pacing Site</title><p>As outlined above, results from many trials performed have shown that the location of the optimal pacing site shows significant interindividual variability and with a resulting need for individual assessment. Acute response to CRT as measured by LV +dP/dt<sub>max</sub> has been shown to be predictive of long-term response <xref rid="pone.0067235-Duckett1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, however, this issue is still matter of debate <xref rid="pone.0067235-Prinzen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and, in fact, there is also evidence against this assumption <xref rid="pone.0067235-Bogaard1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Echocardiographically tailored stimulation of the LV seems to be able to increase the effect of CRT <xref rid="pone.0067235-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The TARGET Study <xref rid="pone.0067235-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> revealed that, as defined by echocardiography, about one third of optimal stimulation sites are located basally. In line with this, in our population 25% of patients exhibited best response when programmed to a more basally located LVPC, a proportion that might even increase if only patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy are regarded <xref rid="pone.0067235-Spragg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Stable lead position at these sites is hard to reach with standard, non-active fixation leads and may thus be more efficiently treated with proximal electrodes of a multipolar lead. A multipolar lead may also be reprogrammed with respect to stimulation site if the optimal pacing spot changes over time <xref rid="pone.0067235-Cuoco1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067235-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>The study is limited by the small number and the heterogeneity of the included patients, therefore, measures, such as randomization of pacing sequence and multiple and lengthy baseline periods have been taken to control confounding effects. This extensive protocol might not be suitable for routine implementation in clinical practice. It must also be acknowledged that additional confounding effects, such as the severity of mitral regurgitation <xref rid="pone.0067235-Auricchio1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and the amount of myocardial scar <xref rid="pone.0067235-Delgado1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> affect CRT response and where not systematically assessed in this study.
