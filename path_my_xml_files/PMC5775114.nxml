Although clinically different, the pathogenic pathways leading to this type of hair loss are thought to be similar in both sexes.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Minoxidil, which was originally synthesized as a potassium channel opener<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and initially prescribed for hypertension, is an FDA-approved topical medication for curing male pattern baldness.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Recently, finasteride, which is a type II 5<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-reductase inhibitor and was initially used for curing prostatic hypertrophy,<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> has been approved by the FDA as an oral drug for male hair loss therapy.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Nevertheless, side effects have been reported for both agents,<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref></sup> thereby considerably limiting their clinical use.</p><p>In this perspective, the pharmaceutical and medical attention has recently focused on the discovery of new and safer remedies. Particularly, in search of biological products that possess hair growing activity, great interest has been attracted by oligomeric procyanidins, extracted from grape seeds, able to promote hair epithelial cell growth as well as to induce anagen phase, at almost the same intensity of minoxidil.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Specifically, procyanidin B2 has demonstrated to be one of the most effective and safest natural compounds in promoting hair growth, both <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and in humans by topical applications.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> During hair growth and keratinization process along the hair fiber, several keratins arrange into filaments to contribute to the production of the hair shaft.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These multigene proteins are members of the intermediate filament (IF) family, including &#x0201c;soft keratins&#x0201d; expressed preferentially in epithelial tissues and &#x0201c;hard keratins&#x0201d; involved in the formation of hard keratinized structures such as hairs and nails.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Epithelial cells express cytokeratins assembled in IFs by the polymerization of heterodimers consisting of one type I (acidic) and one type II (basic to neutral) protein.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Currently, more than 50 different IF proteins have been identified and classified into six groups based on their amino acid sequence.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>By evaluating the polyphenolic content of different apple varieties, we have recently found in the apple fruits of cv Annurca (AFA), native of Southern Italy, one of the highest contents of oligomeric procyanidins, and, specifically, of procyanidin B2, with respect to more common apple samples, such as Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Pink Lady, Fuji, and Golden Delicious.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Encouraged by these results, the first aim of the present work was to explore the bioactivity of AFA polyphenolic extract, highlighting the effects of its supplementation on cellular keratin expression by targeted bioscreen <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this reason, we focused on a well-characterized human experimental model of adult skin based on normal human keratinocyte (HaCaT cells).<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This cell line retains a capacity for differentiation similar to normal human epidermal keratinocytes and hence offers a suitable model for the study of keratinization as well as of epidermal homeostasis.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Then, the second goal was to evaluate the effects of AFA extract supplementation as a nutraceutical, on hair growth and tropism in healthy subjects. In this regard, according to our previous knowledge about the effects of salivary and gastric digestion on the bioaccessibility of active components, we used a specific formulation consisting of gastro-protected capsules.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>The present study shows, for the first time, the impact of procyanidin B2, contained in apple natural extract, on keratin biosynthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, and represents the first attempt of its oral administration to humans as a potential hair growing nutraceutical agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Apple collection</title><p>Annurca (<italic>M. pumila</italic> Miller cv Annurca) apple fruits (each, about 100&#x02009;g) were collected in Valle di Maddaloni (Caserta, Italy) in October when fruits had just been harvested (green peel).

Then, the solution has been spray-dried in combination with maltodextrins, obtaining a fine powder named AppleMetS (AMS). With regard to the clinical trial, the AFA supplements used in this study consisted of two different types of gastric-resistant capsules containing (1) AFA polyphenolic extract microencapsulated with maltodextrins (400&#x02009;mg) (AMS) and (2) AFA polyphenolic extract microencapsulated with maltodextrins (400&#x02009;mg), biotin (0.20&#x02009;mg), selenomethionine (80.0&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g), and zinc acetate (21.0&#x02009;mg), named AppleMetS Hair (AMSbzs).

Biochemical and toxicological investigations were thereby performed to explore AMS bioactivity in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line) <italic>in vitro</italic>, focusing on the evaluation of cell viability as well as on cell growth and proliferation following exposure up to 48&#x02009;h to various AMS concentrations. As follows, optimal experimental conditions of cell growth and protein biosynthesis, relative to both extract concentration and incubation times, were set up by means of targeted bioscreens. In detail, the experimental procedure involved the estimation of a &#x0201c;cell survival index,&#x0201d; arising from the combination of cell viability evaluation with cell counting.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> HaCaT cells were inoculated in 96-microwell culture plates at a density of 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well and allowed to grow for 24&#x02009;h. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium and cells were treated for further 48&#x02009;h with a range of concentrations (0.009, 0.09, 0.23, 0.46, 0.92, 1.68, and 2.3&#x02009;mg/mL) of extract.</p><p>Using the same experimental procedure, cell cultures were also incubated with cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum [<italic>c</italic>DDP]), as a positive control for cytotoxic effects. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay procedure, which measures the level of mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity using the yellow 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) as substrate. The assay is based on the redox ability of living mitochondria to convert dissolved MTT into insoluble purple formazan. Briefly, after the treatments, the medium was removed and the cells were incubated with 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L/well of MTT solution (5&#x02009;mg/mL) for 1&#x02009;h in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C. The incubation was stopped by removing the MTT solution and by adding 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L/well of DMSO to solubilize the obtained formazan. Finally, the absorbance was monitored at 550&#x02009;nm using a microplate reader (iMark microplate reader; Bio-Rad). Cell number was determined by the TC10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad), providing an accurate and reproducible total count of cells and a live/dead ratio in one step by a specific dye (trypan blue) exclusion assay. Bio-Rad's TC10 automated cell counter uses disposable slides, TC10 trypan blue dye (0.49 g/100 mL trypan blue dye in 0.81 g/100 mL sodium chloride and 0.06 g/100 mL potassium phosphate dibasic solution), and a CCD camera to count cells based on the analyses of captured images. Once the loaded slide is inserted into the slide port, the TC10 automatically focuses on the cells, detects the presence of trypan blue dye, and provides the count. When cells are damaged or dead, trypan blue can enter the cell allowing living cells to be counted. Operationally, after treatments in 96-microwell culture plates, the medium was removed and the cells were collected. Ten microliters of cell suspension, mixed with 0.4 g/100 mL trypan blue solution at 1:1 ratio, was loaded into the chambers of disposable slides. The results are displayed as total cell count (number of cells per milliliter). If trypan blue is detected, the instrument also accounts for the dilution and shows live cell count and percent viability. Total counts and live/dead ratio from random samples for each cell line were subjected to comparisons with manual hemocytometers in control experiments. The calculation of the concentration required to inhibit the net increase in the cell number and viability by 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) is based on plots of data (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 for each experiment) and repeated five times (total <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30). IC<sub>50</sub> values were obtained by means of a dose/response curve by nonlinear regression using a curve fitting program, GraphPad Prism 5.0, and are expressed as mean value&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard error of the mean (SEM) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) of five independent experiments.</p><p>The evaluation of the relative number of live and dead cells was performed by a MultiTox-Fluor Multiplex Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, cells were plated into 96-well plates (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup>/well) and, after the treatments with AMS as before described, the solution containing the fluorogenic substrates for the measurements of live-cell and dead-cell protease activities was added to the cells. Following 30&#x02009;min at 37&#x000b0;C, the fluorescence was determined in a Perkin Elmer microplate reader (Perkin Elmer LS 55 Luminescence Spectrometer, Beaconsfield, United Kingdom) using a filter combination with an excitation wavelength of 400/485&#x02009;nm and an emission wavelength of 505/520&#x02009;nm (slits 5&#x02009;nm).

In particular, these interviews reminded patients to complete their intake-checking table for the intervention study and to record any discontinuation or adverse events they might have experienced in the meantime (which were also documented regularly on the case report forms during each telephone and clinic visit). All patients underwent a standardized physical examination, assessment of medical history (for up to 5 years before enrollment), laboratory examination, measurement of blood pressure and heart rate, and evaluation of BMI. At each clinic visit, patients had to complete three self-administered questionnaires on quality-of-life aspects, and their diaries were checked for data completeness and quality of documentation to ensure patient comprehension of the diary items.</p></sec><sec id="s011"><title>Randomization, concealment, and blinding</title><p>A total of 250 eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups to receive AMS or AMSbzs supplements. Supplements and placebo were coded with different colors and given in random order. The code was not broken until all analyses were completed and the results were analyzed statistically. If a patient dropped out before receiving supplement, he or she was replaced by the next eligible patient enrolled at the same center. The concealed allocation was performed by an Internet-based randomization schedule, stratified by study site. The random number list was generated by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. Patients, clinicians, core laboratories, and trial staff (data analysts, statisticians) were blind to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s012"><title>Study treatments</title><p>The group of 250 patients (116 men and 134 women, 30&#x02013;83 years of age) was randomly divided into two subgroups (each one of 125 subjects, 58 men and 67 women). The two subgroups were instructed to take two capsules of AMS or AMSbzs per day (one capsule in the morning and one capsule in the evening). Noteworthy, the daily dose of AFA polyphenolic extract, adopted for the clinical trial, was in full accordance with the maximum polyphenolic extract daily intake (1000&#x02009;mg), through food supplements and novel foods, indicated by the revised form (January 2015) of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 258/1997 as the safe polyphenolic daily amount compatible with a good health state. Moreover, the quantities of biotin, selenium, and zinc have been calculated on the basis established by the Italian Ministry of Health (DM Revision June 2016) with regard to the maximum levels of vitamins and minerals allowed in food supplements, in accordance with that reported by the current European regulation about the minimum daily requirement (nutrient reference values [NRVs]) of vitamins and minerals (Reg.

Specifically, the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 258/1997 established 1000&#x02009;mg as maximum polyphenolic extract daily intake in humans. Accordingly, the AFA polyphenolic extract dose adopted for the trial was an amount reasonably lower than that regarded as safe in humans. Moreover, the daily quantities of biotin, selenium, and zinc administered to patients were in compliance with the guidelines from the Italian Ministry of Health (DM Revision June 2016) regarding the maximum levels of vitamins and minerals allowed in food supplements, in accordance with what has been established by the current European regulation about the minimum daily requirement (NRVs) of vitamins and minerals (Reg. UE 1169/2011). Nevertheless, we assessed safety from reports of adverse events as well as laboratory parameters concerning hepatic and renal function, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, and BMI), and physical or neurological examinations. Safety was assessed over the entire treatment period at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16, including adverse events occurring in the first 3 weeks after cessation of treatments. During the test, all subjects underwent a clinical diagnosis by a dermatologist, focusing on any adverse dermatological reaction such as inflammation, erythema, or eczema.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s016"><title>Statistics</title><sec id="s017"><title>Methodology</title><p>All the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have been repeated four times.

As well, we even report a slight increase of cell viability in the presence of low micromolar concentrations of the extract. In line with this outcome, inversely correlated fluorescent measurements for the estimation of the live/dead cell ratio showed that AMS, for all the screened concentrations and times, does not interfere with HaCaT keratinocyte viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition and to support, we monitored cellular morphology throughout the <italic>in vitro</italic> trials. Endpoint imaging by light microscopy was taken from cells to assess potential cellular monolayer modifications induced by incubation with different concentrations of the polyphenolic extract. The occurrence of changes in cell morphology as well as in monolayer appearance is generally suggestive of distinctive hallmarks of cell death pathway activation. Accordingly, with the cell survival index analysis, AMS proves to be very biocompatible, also at high final concentrations and after 48&#x02009;h of incubation, so that no significant modifications of keratinocyte subconfluent monolayers were evidenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).

After incubations, the total cellular levels of keratins were evaluated by Western blot analysis using broad-spectrum anti-pan-keratin antibodies, as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s002">Materials and Methods</xref> section. Cytokeratin band identification was achieved by molecular-weight marker position. As clearly shown, <italic>in vitro</italic> treatments for 48&#x02009;h resulted in a remarkable increase of keratin expression and this also occurs with a similar extent using a serum-free culture medium to exclude unspecific stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The cellular content of cytokeratins was clearly enhanced in all the examined conditions, reaching a notable maximum increase of about threefold with respect to untreated control cells following 48&#x02009;h of exposure to extracts at 0.46&#x02009;mg/mL. This effect was concentration and time dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), definitely due to the presence of AMS, as further suggested by the concurrent analysis of GAPDH protein, herein used as housekeeping gene.

Despite the small number of subjects and the short period over which the trial was carried out, we observed a clear trend and significant results for both supplements in each subgroup, which were revealed by some statistical analyses toward increased hair growth and density (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Some clinical trials have extensively demonstrated the positive hair-growing effects of procyanidin B2, a major dimeric procyanidin occurring in apples.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Actually, these studies have exclusively investigated the potential benefits of topical applications of procyanidin B2 under the form of alcoholic solutions in mixture with other bioactive components. Kamimura and Takahashi have reported the effects of 1% procyanidin B2 tonic on human hair growth after sequential use for 6 months.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A double-blind clinical test involving a total of 29 male subjects was performed. It was observed an increase of 6.7 total hairs/0.25&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> after 6 months of procyanidin therapy. The same effects have been reported with minoxidil<sup><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;42</xref></sup> and finasteride (an inhibitor of type II 5<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-reductase, Merck)<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> therapy for androgenetic alopecia. In 2% minoxidil treatment, an increase of 250 total hairs/5.1&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> (calculated as 12.3 total hairs/0.25&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>) after 12-month therapy was reported.<sup><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> In finasteride treatment (1&#x02009;mg/day, oral administration), an increase of 86 total hairs/5.1&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> (calculated as 4.22 total hairs/0.25&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>) after 12-month therapy was reported.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The level of efficacy of 1% procyanidin B2 is concluded to compare favorably with minoxidil and finasteride therapy.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> As far as the procyanidins are concerned, it has been demonstrated that in murine epithelial cells, both procyanidins B2 and B3 are capable of increasing the anagen growth phase within hair cycle by means of their protective action on cellular apoptosis induced by the androgen-inducible cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF) <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2, which normally cause a cell cycle block in favor of differentiation processes and are thereby supposed to trigger catagen induction in hair follicle.<sup><xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> In the same way, procyanidins exhibited intensive biological effects in promoting hair epithelial cell growth in murine models <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to increased hair density and terminal hair formation.<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Indeed, the addition of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 or TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2 to cultured murine hair epithelial cells dose dependently decreased cell growth by increasing apoptosis <italic>via</italic> the intrinsic caspase network, whereas the concurrent addition of procyanidin B2 to the culture medium counteracted both TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 and TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2 effects, protecting cells from apoptotic pathway activation. Interestingly, Kamimura <italic>et al.</italic> also showed that procyanidin B2 upregulates the expression of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK-1/2) in the hair epithelial cells, as well as their activation.<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> MEK is a member of the MAPK signaling cascade that is generally activated by mitogens, so that when MEK is inhibited, cell proliferation is blocked and apoptosis is induced.<sup><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, components of the MAPK/ERK pathway mainly discovered in cancer cells,<sup><xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> in which drugs able to reverse the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; switch, are currently being investigated as cancer chemotherapeutics.<sup><xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> However, it is still unclear whether these two suggestions are correlated and especially if procyanidins are able to interact with distinct cell membrane receptors involved in MAPK/ERK signaling pathways and/or to directly interfere with this cascade of intracellular proteins.</p><p>During hair growth and proliferation, several cytokeratins expressed by epithelial cells orchestrate the assembly of typical IFs, which contribute in common with keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) in the production of the hair shaft within the keratinization process of the hair fiber.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> All the well-known 54 human keratins belonging to the IF proteins share common structural and functional features. In addition, evidently bundled as tonofilaments in epidermal tissue, keratin filaments are endowed with a key functional role in the integrity and mechanical stability of both the single epithelial and hair cells and, <italic>via</italic> cell contacts, of the whole epithelial tissue.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> As well, the central function of epidermis-type keratins is demonstrated by knockout mouse models and also throughout different human hereditary keratin diseases affecting skin and hair.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Therefore, since keratins are fundamental in epidermal and hair development and homeostasis, the regulation of keratin expression appears to be a central event for rapid proliferating epidermal cells, as well as in hair follicle growth and maturation. To date, despite the use of dietary nutraceuticals and functional food supplements being greatly increased, studies concerning their biological effects on hair loss have produced conflicting results.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Conversely, by targeted bioscreens we have herein demonstrated that AMS supplementation <italic>in vitro</italic> is able to promote a remarkable upregulation of keratin expression in human keratinocytes, resulting in keratin accumulation within cells. These data are fully consistent with those arising from our clinical trial&#x02014;indicating an important increase of the keratin hair content, of about 35% more than in the untreated group&#x02014;thereby validating the biological effects of AMS on hair growing and proliferation. To the best of our knowledge, no correlation between the administration of nutraceuticals and actual increased expression of keratin in human skin cells had been reported so far. As well, this is the first study demonstrating the effectiveness of a natural procyanidin B2-containing gastro-protected apple extract as hair growth stimulant <italic>via</italic> oral administration. For these reasons, we believe that the reported findings concerning the use of AMS as oral nutraceutical supplement are of great interest, as they reveal an efficacy in promoting hair growth fully comparable with or even higher than those obtained from trials performed with pharmaceutical therapies nowadays regarded as leading treatments for pattern baldness. In addition, our proposed therapy, apart from not giving any sign of hirsutism in all of the enrolled subjects, would allow avoiding the possible inconvenience deriving from topical application of a generic alcoholic solution (skin burning, reddening, and cracking), or, more importantly, specific side effects, which are typical of finasteride, such as sexual dysfunctions,<sup><xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> or of minoxidil, such as cardiovascular,<sup><xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49&#x02013;51</xref></sup> immunologic,<sup><xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> and endocrine disorders.<sup><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> In fact, no evidences of cytotoxic effect nor morphological changes on cultured human keratinocytes were hitherto observed after exposure to AMS under different experimental conditions. Similarly, with the exception of antiproliferative effects on cancer cells and antibacterial activities, any type of cytotoxicity induced by apple bioactive components has never been reported in scientific literature.<sup><xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55&#x02013;58</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, male and female pattern baldness is a highly common condition affecting &#x0223c;50% of the adult population, and potentially causing a significant negative impact on the quality of life. The results of this clinical trial, in combination with <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence of increased cellular keratin content, provide strong support that a dietary supplement acting as a nutraceutical and based on a procyanidin B2-containing AFA natural extract can effectively promote hair growth and improve skin quality, at once increasing hair density, weight, and keratin content. Further studies are ongoing to better clarify the molecular basis of the procyanidin-induced growth promotional effects at the skin level, focusing on both the regulation of cell homeostasis and the functional role played by keratins selectively induced <italic>via</italic> nutraceutical supplementation.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s029"><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>All authors have contributed significantly and all authors are in agreement with the content of the article.
