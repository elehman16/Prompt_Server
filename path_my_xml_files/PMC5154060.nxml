Psychotic symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, negative symptoms such as affective flattening and cognitive disturbances. Recent estimates suggest that four in every 1000 people in the United Kingdom (UK) have a diagnosis of a psychotic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Alongside medication, current treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] recommend psychological intervention using either cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) or family interventions. Recent meta-analyses have shown some efficacy for CBTp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; however, prominent theorists and clinicians have called for further treatment innovations and understanding of the most efficacious treatment components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One such approach is the &#x02018;the causal-interventionalist&#x02019; approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], whereby a single hypothesised maintenance factor is targeted with CBT in order to reduce both this problem (e.g. worry, insomnia) with the secondary gain of improving psychotic, and other emotional, symptoms. Dissociation, and depersonalisation in particular, may be one such maintenance factor.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Defining dissociation and depersonalisation</title><p>Dissociation is defined as &#x02018;a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control and behaviour&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As such, it is an umbrella term that incorporates a spectrum of phenomena ranging from normal, everyday experiences such as absorption and divided attention to more distressing and functionally impairing experiences of clinical significance such as the psychiatric condition of depersonalisation disorder (DPD).</p><p>Historically, all types of dissociative phenomena have been viewed as part of a continuum, from &#x02018;normative&#x02019; experiences to more pathological experiences. However, more recent theoretical reviews have suggested that dissociation may be best considered as comprising of two categories of phenomena: detachment and compartmentalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], although these are not necessarily mutually exclusive. &#x02018;Detachment&#x02019; concerns a person&#x02019;s sense of separation from experience, including from their sense of self (i.e. depersonalisation) or from the external world (i.e. derealisation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. &#x02018;Compartmentalisation&#x02019;, on the other hand, is defined as a disruption in normally integrated functions that is not accessible to conscious control and includes dissociative amnesia and somatoform dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This study is primarily interested in the &#x02018;detachment&#x02019; experiences of depersonalisation and derealisation (referred to as depersonalisation henceforth) in those with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Prevalence estimates of depersonalisation</title><p>Depersonalisation symptoms are common in non-clinical and clinical populations, particularly amongst those with anxiety disorders where it is amongst the diagnostic criteria of panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Epidemiological studies suggest lifetime prevalence rates of transient depersonalisation symptoms in the general population of between 26 and 74&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Community surveys examining the prevalence of DPD specifically, using standardised diagnostic criteria, suggest 1&#x000a0;month prevalence rates of between 1.2 and 2.4&#x000a0;%, and rates as high as 82.6&#x000a0;% have been reported comorbid with other psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dissociation and psychosis&#x02014;common factors or pathway?</title><p>There has been an increasing interest in the presence of dissociative experiences in psychotic disorders, in part due to common aetiological factors of trauma and anxiety, and the potential for dissociation to play a mediating role in psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Dissociation has long been considered a psychological defence mechanism to protect the individual against intolerable events such as trauma (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). It is also now well established that rates of trauma are high in psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recent population-based studies in both the UK and the United States of America (USA) show high rates of lifetime experiences of sexual and physical abuse in those diagnosed with a psychotic disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Further, in a critical review of studies examining trauma in those with severe mental illnesses, rates of trauma exposure were between 49 and 100&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Considering the well-established link between trauma and dissociation and the high rates of trauma experiences in psychosis, it is therefore not surprising that dissociation is also common in psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, the cognitive model of DPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] has emphasised the role of anxiety and cognitive processes common to anxiety disorders, in the development and maintenance of DPD. Experimental research provides support for the influence of cognitive processes of attention, catastrophic appraisals and attribution biases in DPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Further, a longitudinal study of over 3000 participants in the UK found that childhood anxiety was a significant predictor of adult depersonalisation experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Likewise, cognitive models of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] emphasise the role of emotional processes, particularly anxiety, in the onset and maintenance cycle of psychotic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Considering the commonalities in maintenance processes of dissociation and psychosis, it is understandable that dissociation is also common in psychosis, and indeed, some authors have speculated that some psychotic symptoms, in particular auditory hallucinations, may actually be better understood as dissociative in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Rates of depersonalisation in psychosis</title><p>Eleven studies were identified by a review of research investigating dissociation in psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The reviewers concluded that there was &#x02018;solid empirical evidence&#x02019; that individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia have more frequent, and severe, dissociative experiences than non-clinical populations but less frequent and severe than those diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, PTSD, or dissociative identity disorder. Furthermore, they found a consistent association between experiences of dissociation and severity of delusions and hallucinations. However, there have been methodological flaws in many of these studies as they used a general measure of dissociation that includes aspects of amnesia, detachment and more &#x02018;normative&#x02019; dissociation such as absorption in the same overall score. In this context, it is unclear precisely what aspects of dissociative experience were associated with psychosis.</p><p>More recently, a few studies have specifically investigated depersonalisation experiences in psychosis. For example, in a study of 147 inpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 17&#x000a0;% were found to meet threshold criteria for DPD. Similarly, studies examining depersonalisation symptoms in schizophrenia suggest that depersonalisation may be more common in those experiencing hallucinations, compared to those with delusions only, and when present are associated with more severe psychotic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, this is still an emerging field of enquiry perhaps in part due to the &#x02018;diagnostic overshadowing&#x02019; of psychosis. In this context, there is only a limited understanding of both the rates of DPD and the phenomenology of depersonalisation in psychosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Depersonalisation&#x02014;an anomalous experience in psychosis?</title><p>One potential understanding of depersonalisation in psychosis is of depersonalisation symptoms as an anomalous experience that is interpreted in a distressing manner. In the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) model of DPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], catastrophic appraisals of transient depersonalisation experiences (such as of having damaged one&#x02019;s brain or of incipient &#x02018;madness&#x02019;) serve to exacerbate and maintain symptoms. Similarly, in cognitive models of psychosis (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), appraisals of <italic>anomalous experiences</italic> as personally relevant, threatening and/or attributed to an external cause are proposed to contribute to the development of psychotic symptoms. Depersonalisation symptoms could be considered a type of anomalous experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and although to the authors&#x02019; knowledge there are no empirical studies which have explored the appraisals of depersonalisation symptoms in those with psychosis, and in particular whether these symptoms might give rise to psychotic explanations in the absence of any alternative explanation for these phenomena, it may be that this could be a factor that precipitates, and/or maintains, psychosis.</p><p>A study of CBT for DPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] focused on generating less threatening explanations for the depersonalisation symptoms and reducing symptom-focused attention, avoidance and safety behaviours that were identified as maintaining factors. This study showed significant improvements in the experience of depersonalisation symptoms, depression and anxiety, with a third of participants no longer meeting threshold for DPD at the end of therapy. It is proposed that a similar approach to depersonalisation symptoms in psychosis might be effective in reducing the distress associated depersonalisation and may have a secondary impact of psychotic symptoms. This approach is in line with the &#x02018;causal-interventionist&#x02019; approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] which has been proposed as the way forward for CBT for psychosis. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, there are no published studies or trials of interventions for depersonalisation symptoms in psychosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Summary and research questions</title><p>Depersonalisation symptoms appear to be prevalent in people diagnosed with psychotic disorders and when present, depersonalisation symptoms are linked with more severe psychotic symptoms. It is likely that negative appraisals of these anomalous experiences might act to precipitate, maintain and exacerbate psychotic symptoms. CBT has been found to be beneficial in patients with chronic DPD, and it would be valuable to ascertain if similar approaches to target depersonalisation symptoms in psychosis would be effective. This study aims to establish the feasibility of a brief CBT-based intervention for depersonalisation symptoms in people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. The aim of the intervention would be to alter negative attributions and distress associated with depersonalisation experiences through psycho-education, learning coping strategies such as &#x02018;grounding&#x02019;, changing attentional biases and cognitive restructuring techniques to modify appraisals. It is proposed that through reducing distress, in particular, the maintenance cycle associated with depersonalisation will be altered and thus overall depersonalisation experiences reduced, with a possibility of reducing psychotic phenomena in addition.</p><p>In this context there are two main research questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Will it be feasible to deliver a brief intervention for depersonalisation symptoms in individuals with current psychotic symptoms?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Will such an intervention be acceptable to individuals who experience current psychotic symptoms?</p></list-item></list>

</p><p>The secondary aim is to establish estimates of standard deviations for outcomes of depersonalisation symptoms to inform sample size calculations for a future trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participants</title><p>We will seek to recruit 30 adults aged 18&#x02013;70 with current psychotic symptoms and whose depersonalisation symptoms meet threshold for DPD (i.e. over 75 on the Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale (CDS)). We will exclude those with insufficient capacity to provide informed consent; insufficient proficiency in English (spoken and written) to engage in CBT; a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability, head injury, substance misuse or organic cause for psychosis; and those currently engaging in CBT or other psychotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Power calculation</title><p>As this is a feasibility study and the aim is to provide estimates of key parameters for a future trial rather than to power the current study to detect statistically significant differences, an a priori power calculation was not conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Instead, we aim to recruit sufficient participants to provide reasonable estimates of study parameters. Based on the feasibility of recruitment, we aim to recruit 30 participants. Two pieces of work enable estimation of the number of patients we would need to screen in order to obtain 30 participants. Published research with a similar sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] suggests that approximately 94&#x000a0;% of individuals diagnosed with a current psychotic disorder will report at least one depersonalisation symptom, and 60&#x000a0;% will experience at least 10 depersonalisation symptoms often. A recently completed research study (Emma Davies, unpublished thesis, 2015) recruiting people with psychosis from the same pools as proposed for this trial suggests that approximately 50&#x000a0;% of participants reporting depersonalisation symptoms met criteria for DPD. In this context, we are likely to need to screen 60 participants (assuming most individuals will report at least one symptom and 50&#x000a0;% will score above our threshold) to obtain our target sample. As it is unlikely that all those contacted via initial letter will respond and/or agree to be screened, we anticipate attempting to contact approximately 100 individuals to be able to screen 60.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention is based on the protocol developed for CBT for DPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The intervention aims to reduce distress associated with depersonalisation symptoms by altering catastrophic attributions through psycho-education, developing a shared understanding linking depersonalisation symptoms to anxiety and/or past traumas, enhancing coping strategies (including grounding) and cognitive restructuring techniques to modify unhelpful appraisals. It is hypothesised that through reducing distress, in particular, the maintenance cycle associated with depersonalisation will be altered and thus overall depersonalisation symptoms reduced.</p><p>The intervention will be delivered, in addition to treatment as usual (see below) over six, 60-min sessions, covering the areas outlined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, as appropriate and determined by the individual needs of the participant.

</p><p>To establish the acceptability of the intervention, in addition to the data above, attrition rates (number of treatment sessions completed by participants, number of therapy drop outs (i.e. completing two or fewer sessions) and percent of homework tasks completed) will be collected throughout the intervention.</p><p>After the follow-up interview is completed and scored, researchers will be unblinded and all intervention participants will be interviewed about their impressions of the intervention. The interview will collect data on their impressions of and satisfaction with the intervention using questions based on the Satisfaction of Therapy Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], altered to capture aspects of improvement/satisfaction related to depersonalisation symptoms.

</p><p>There will be four additional open questions to determine the aspects of the intervention the participants found most and least helpful, their views on whether the intervention met their expectations overall and an opportunity to make any other comments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Clinical data</title><p>Clinical and demographic data will be collected at baseline interview and will include sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, education, employment status, medication use, age of onset of both DP/DR and psychotic symptoms, current clinical diagnosis and past experience of cognitive behavioural therapy or other psychotherapeutic approaches. Data will be collected at baseline assessment and at an outcome interview at 10&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Secondary, clinical outcome data will be collected to estimate key parameters to inform future trial design. Outcomes include depersonalisation, psychotic, depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as screening for post-traumatic stress disorder.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale (CDS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]). The CDS is a 29-item scale that measures the severity of trait depersonalisation symptoms over the preceding 6&#x000a0;months. For each item, frequency (Likert scale 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;never to 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;all the time) and duration (Likert scale 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;few seconds to 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;more than a week) are collected; each item maximum is therefore 10. A total scale score is the sum of each item, with a maximum of 290. Scores greater than 70 have been shown to reliably predict a clinical diagnosis of DPD using DSM criteria. In order to measure change, the wording of the trait CDS will be changed to measure the severity of DP/DR symptoms <italic>over the preceding month</italic>. The level of distress, preoccupation, impairment and understanding of depersonalisation symptoms will also be collected.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). The PSYRATS will be used to monitor changes in psychotic symptomatology between baseline assessment and outcome interview. The PSYRATS consists of two subscales measuring the presence and typology, beliefs/conviction, distress and disruption associated with auditory hallucinations and delusions. The auditory hallucination (AH) subscale has 11 items and the delusions (DELs) subscale has six items. All items are scored between 0 and 4. For example, for item 1 in the AH scale, 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;voices are not present to 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;voices are present continuously&#x02026; The maximum score for the AH and DELs subscales are 44 and 24, respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report scale, rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;symptom not present to 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;symptom present with significant distress/impairment) measuring common symptoms of depression. Total scores range from 0 to 63. Total scores of less than 13 indicate minimal depression, scores 14&#x02013;19 indicate mild depression, scores 20&#x02013;28 indicated moderate depression and scores above 29 indicate severe depression.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]). The BAI is a 21-item self-report scale with the same scoring. Total scores are interpreted as follows: 0&#x02013;9 indicates minimal anxiety; 10&#x02013;16 indicates mild anxiety; 17&#x02013;29 indicates moderate anxiety; and 30&#x02013;63 indicates severe anxiety.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Post-traumatic Diagnosis Scale (PDS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The PDS has 49 items including a checklist of potentially traumatising events and an indication of the distress, intrusive thoughts, avoidance and hyperarousal in the last month. There is a total score ranging from 0 to 51 with 1&#x02013;10 considered &#x02018;mild&#x02019;, 11&#x02013;20 &#x02018;moderate&#x02019;, 21&#x02013;35 moderate to severe and greater than 36 severe.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV dissociative disorders (SCID-D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].
