temporomandibular joint on correction of scoliosis. [Subjects and Methods] This study
examined 31 male and female participants in their 20s and 30s with a spinal curve degree
of 10&#x000b0; or greater. The subjects performed therapeutic exercise based on the pilates
exercise system, which is known to be effective in mitigating the spinal curve for
patients with scoliosis. All participants completed an 8-week therapeutic exercise regimen
to alleviate the scoliosis in which exercise was performed, the exercise was done three
times a week for 8 weeks and each session lasted 60 minutes. Among them, 19 participants
were selected as an experiment group, whose symptoms were mitigated significantly, and 12
participants who did not undergo the exercise were identified as a control group. All
subject was assessed for spinal curve degree, apparent leg length discrepancy, and
deviation and range of motion of the temporomandibular joint before and after the study.
[Results] In the experimental group, the apparent leg length discrepancy and the deviation
of the temporomandibular joint were significantly decreased after the exercise, and the
ROM in the temporomandibular joint was significantly increased. In intergroup comparisons,
all variables showed a significant difference. [Conclusion] The findings suggest that as
the spinal curve degree decreases significantly, the range of motion and deviation in the
temporomandibular joint showed a significant change, indicating that mild scoliosis may be
a negative factor affecting the deviation and range of motion of the temporomandibular
joint.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Scoliosis</kwd><kwd>Temporomandibular joint</kwd><kwd>TMJ ROM</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The spine is critical in maintaining a correct posture, meaning an efficient, natural,
good-looking posture that does not put pressure on internal organs, and helps the human body
to move in a harmonious way with minimal fatigue. In comparison, a poor posture indicates
deformity of the spinal cord, thoracic parts, or arms and legs<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A poor posture is related to asymmetrical use of the body for
functional activities, and if prolonged, one&#x02019;s posture is altered due to musculoskeletal
imbalance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also causes abnormality
in vital dynamics and may cause related problems. Among orthopedic disorders, spinal
postural change is the most frequently observed<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, the occurrence of scoliosis is a growing cause of
spinal deformity and posture alteration, and it is defined as spinal deformity with a spinal
curve 10 degree<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Scoliosis is classified by the degree of curvature as mild (&#x0003c;
20&#x000b0;), moderate (20&#x02013;45&#x000b0;) and sever (&#x0003e; 45&#x000b0;)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mild scoliosis is very common, with the prevalence rate of
idiopathic scoliosis of more being 1.5&#x02013;1.7% and that for 20 degree or more being 0.2%
10<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regarding treatment of scoliosis,
mild scoliosis is treated with physical exercise therapy, moderate scoliosis is treated with
a brace and/or cast and physical exercise therapy, and severe scoliosis is treat with
surgery<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In adulthood, the majority of patients with scoliosis suffer from back pain, and if the
curve progresses to be very large, even pulmonary dysfunction and psychological distress can
occur<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of mild scoliosis
treatment is to prevent the aggravation of the deformity and pain and pulmonary dysfunction
over the course of a lifetime<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Scoliosis can be largely divided into a structural and nonstructural type. The former
indicates a curved spine with a rotated vertebra, while the latter shows a symptom of a flat
back in trunk flexion and no rotation of the vertebra. Nonstructural scoliosis may accompany
pain and muscle spasm may be caused by leg length discrepancy<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it might cause abnormal vital dynamics in the
musculoskeletal system around the spine and muscle imbalance in the area, and possibly
aggravate the scoliosis. Accordingly, it might affect temporomandibular joint mobility, in
addition to lumbar and thoracic parts, which is influenced by cervical movement. With this
as the background, this study examined the change in the range of motion (ROM) of the
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) resulting from a decreased degree of mild scoliosis
curvanture.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHOD</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study examined 31 male and female participants in their 20s and 30s with a spinal
curve of 10&#x000b0; or more. The inclusion criteria for subjects were no experience of spinal
surgery or other special therapy including exercises. The degree of spinal curvature,
apparent leg lengths, and deviation and ROM of the temporomandibular joint mobility were
measured for all participants. The subjects were randomly divided into an experimental
group and control group. The experimental group consisted of 19 participants performed an
8-week exercise regimen to alleviate scoliosis. The 12 participants in the control group
who did not perform the exercise. After the exercise regimen, the apparent leg lengths
and, deviation and ROM of the temporomandibular joint mobility were measured again to
analyze the impact of the spinal curve degree on the temporomandibular joint.</p><p>The subjects were selected from among those who understood the purpose of this study and
were capable of understanding and complying with the tester&#x02019;s instructions. All subjects
understood the purpose of this study, agreed to participate in this research, and signed
an informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Weight and height of all subjects were measured. Then, each subject was assessed for
degree of spinal curvanture, apparent leg length discrepancy and deviation and ROM of the
TMJ. To measure the degree of spinal curvanture, a landmark was checked on the spinous
processes of the subjects&#x02019; C7, T7, T12, and L5 vertebrae, and photos were taken with a
digital camera. To measure the deviation of the temporomandibular joint, the subjects
opened their mouths to the maximum and were then photographed with a digital camera.
Analysis of the images was performed using the Global Posture System (GPS, Chinesport,
Udine, Italy), a body alignment analysis program. For the degree of spinal curvanture, the
angle of a line that connecting the landmarks on the aforementioned spinous processes was
measured. The deviation of the angle connecting the median clefts of the upper and lower
teeth was measured in degrees. As for the leg length discrepancy, the distance between the
navel and the medial malleolus was measured for both legs<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The range of joint motion with maximal opening of the TMJ was
measured in millimeters as the distance between the median clefts of the upper and lower
teeth using a goniometer.</p><p>The subjects in the experimental group performed therapeutic exercise that is known to be
effective in mitigating the spinal curve in patients with scoliosis. Specifically, the
exercise was performed three times a week for a total of 8 weeks, and each session lasted
60 minutes. Each set consisted of three steps: 10 minutes of warming up, 40 minutes of
therapeutic exercise, and 10 minutes of cooling down. The warm-up and cool-down exercise
included walking and stretching of various body parts. For therapeutic exercise, the
subjects used a Swiss ball or other adequate equipment for stretching exercise. Stretching
exercise was performed to increase lateral trunk flexibility on the concave side.
Strengthing was performed to strengthen the lateral trunk muscle on the convex side. In
the beginning, each exercise was performed with 10 repetitions, and the number of
repetitions was increased according to the subject&#x02019;s physical strength (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Correlective exercise for scoliosis</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exercise program</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stretch the spine<break/>The subjects pushed their hands against the

Scoliosis has a higher prevalence in female<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study had more female subjects than male subjects. Ideally,
in the human body, the spine should be perpendicular to the frontal plane to maintain a
normal posture. The alignment of the pelvic and lumbar bones influences the thoracic bone,
which in turn, affects the location of the neck and the head. Thus, if the thoracic spine
curves to one side, it is hard to maintan a balance in the pelvic bone<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The balance of the pelvic bone can be checked with the
apparent leg length. The result of the present study show that the scoliosis patients&#x02019; leg
length discrepancy decreased significantly when their spinal curve was mitigated, suggesting
that the pelvic balance could affect the nonstructural scoliosis.</p><p>The maximum mouth opening distance is a generally accepted measurement of temporomandibular
joint mobility and function<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it was
used for this study. When the mouth is open, the normal range of motion should be
40&#x02013;60&#x02005;mm<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, The same range was 39&#x02013;42&#x02005;mm before the exercise period but
increased to 48&#x02005;mm after the exercise preiod, indicating that scoliosis reduced the range of
mobility. The temporomandibular joint is surrounded by ligaments, muscles, nerves, and blood
vessels<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The masticatory muscles
enable mouth opening and closing, lateral movement, and forward and backward movement of the
mouth<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and excessive tension or
imbalance of muscles can limit the joint movements, possibly resulting in limited ROM. Thus,
it can be surmised that the imbalance in the spinal muscles caused the imbalance in the
temporomandibular muscles and limited TMJ mobility.</p><p>Himiko et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that 27% of
patients with jaw deformity (lateral displacement) experienced the scoliosis with a Cobb
angle of 10&#x000b0; and more. The lateral displacement of the mandible is an indicator of the
functioning of the masticatory muscles<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, imbalance of the masticatory muscles of the TMJ may occure if activities are continues
when the mandible is displaced, resulting in problem with movement. The deviation of the TMJ
has been suggested to be the result of imbalance in the jaw-opening muscles or spasm of the
jaw-opening muscles on the side opposite to the deviations<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The imbalance in the masticatory muscle damages the functioning of
mastification, and possibly expands the range of malocclusion-related disorders<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it can be said that scoliosis
affects the deviation of the temporomandibular joint. The findings of the present study are
consistent with previous studies that showed a correlation between scoliosis and TMJ
dysfunction, and that interaction could be found between orthopedic deformities of the spine
and the orthodontic deformities.</p><p>The present study shows that scoliosis could be a factor that restricts the ROM of the TMJ
and increases its deviation such that it affects the mobility of the TMJ by causing an
imbalance in the masticatory muscle of the mandibular, in addition to causing imbalance in
the muscles around the spine. Therefore, mild scoliosis may be a negative factor affecting
deviation and ROM of the TMJ. The limitations of the this study were that the subjects were
not limited with respect to activities daily of living and that the subjects selected mild
scoliosis and nonstructrural scoliosis. Consequently, follow-up studies are called for to
examine cases of structural scoliosis for a broader application of the research results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Gachon University research fund of 2013 (CGU-2013-M069).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Kisner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Colby</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name></person-group>: Therapeutic exercise, 5th ed: Foundation and techniques.
