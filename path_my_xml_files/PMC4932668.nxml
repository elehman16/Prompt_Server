A core component of the campaign is to improve implementation and systematic delivery of ABCS treatment guidelines: (A) aspirin in high-risk individuals; (B) blood pressure control; (C) cholesterol management through guideline-recommended use of lipid lowering medications (i.e., statins); and (S) smoking cessation. In order to accelerate adoption of Million Hearts guidelines in primary care practices as well as build capacity for their ongoing implementation and dissemination, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) launched EvidenceNOW&#x02014;a national initiative that aims to transform health care delivery in small primary care practices by building critical infrastructure to integrate the most up-to-date research into practice to improve the heart health of their patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">There is a strong rationale for targeting small practices (i.e., fewer than 10 providers). First, small practices continue to provide primary care for a significant proportion of the population. More than half of primary care office visits occur in small practice settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Second, small practices face daunting challenges in redesigning their system and care processes to meet regulatory requirements for practice transformation. Most small practices lack the resources and staff expertise related to information systems, goal setting, data analysis, and practice redesign to coordinate a complex set of multilevel system changes without external assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One implementation strategy that may effectively overcome these barriers is practice facilitation (PF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">PF provides external expertise to help organizations make meaningful practice changes that are tailored to local context and in accord with current practice transformation models like the chronic care model (CCM) and patient-centered medical home (PCMH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Implementation science literature suggests that PF&#x02019;s emphasis on building organization capacity to adapt clinical evidence to the specific circumstances of the practice environment may be more effective in achieving sustainable improvements in guideline-concordant care and patient outcomes in primary care settings compared to single component (e.g., audit and feedback alone) and other multicomponent guideline implementation strategies (e.g., learning collaborative) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent systematic review of PF interventions demonstrated that primary care practices with the support of a facilitator are almost three times more likely to implement evidence-based guidelines compared with usual care practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite this evidence, the effectiveness of PF remains largely untested in small primary care practices, especially those that serve vulnerable and underserved minority populations.</p><p id="Par8">HealthyHearts NYC (HHNYC), one of seven cooperatives funded through the EvidenceNOW initiative, is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of PF compared to usual practice on implementation of the Million Hearts ABCS treatment guidelines in 250 small primary care practices, where a significant proportion of vulnerable populations in NYC receive care.</p><p id="Par9">The specific aims of the HealthyHearts NYC project are to (1) compare the effect of PF versus usual care on ABCS outcome measures; (2) identify baseline organizational characteristics (e.g., site level adaptive reserve, organizational change capacity) that are associated with intervention outcomes; (3) use qualitative methods to assess barriers and facilitators to implementing practice change and achieving ABCS outcomes among high- and low-performing practices in the study; and (4) evaluate the intervention-specific costs per patient and per site.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par10">HHNYC is a partnership between New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM) and the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) Primary Care Information Project (PCIP), which has over 1300 small- to medium-sized primary care practices in its regional extension center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The study is being conducted in small practices in NYC that are part of PCIP&#x02019;s practice network. NYC has the largest (8.5 million) and most diverse population of any city in the US (26&#x000a0;% Hispanic, 26&#x000a0;% black, and 13&#x000a0;% Asian) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although NYC has achieved substantial decline in CVD-related deaths, heart disease still remains the number one cause of death and significant disparities by income and race/ethnicity persist. Residents of NYC&#x02019;s poorest neighborhoods, where many of the study small practice sites are located, consistently have higher mortality rates from almost all diseases, including CVD, compared with residents in its wealthiest neighborhoods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For example, hypertension-related death rates among black New Yorkers are four times higher than among white New Yorkers (35 vs. 9 per 100,000 adults). Additionally, patients in PCIP network practices with a greater proportion of low income and minority patients in their panels are less likely to achieve target measures for blood pressure control and smoking cessation measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par11">HHNYC is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial that is designed to evaluate the implementation process and the impact of PF (intervention) compared to usual practice (control), on implementation of the Million Hearts ABCS treatment guidelines in 250 primary care practices. All practice sites begin as part of the control condition and are block-randomized into four waves with each wave beginning 3&#x000a0;months after the start of the prior wave and lasting for 12&#x000a0;months (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All clusters eventually receive the intervention, and outcomes will be measured every 3&#x000a0;months in all clusters.

This network includes over 1300 small- to medium-sized practices with significant numbers of Medicaid or uninsured patients. To be eligible, practice sites were required to have <underline>&#x0003c;</underline>10 full-time equivalent (FTE) healthcare providers (physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant); have implemented an electronic health record (EHR) for at least 1&#x000a0;year; sign an agreement with PCIP to participate in PCIP&#x02019;s Hub Population Health System, an EHR query architecture; have no immediate future plans to participate in a CVD-related quality improvement initiative; have no plans to change EHRs in the next 18&#x000a0;months; be willing to identify a site coordinator to work with study staff on all aspects of the intervention; and be located in NYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We will recruit 40 of the sites that are enrolled in the study to participate in the qualitative assessment described below. For the qualitative interviews, sites will be chosen to ensure representation across different geographic locations in NYC and practice size.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Patient eligibility</title><p id="Par13">Data is being abstracted for patients who: (a) have at least one of the ABCS risk factors (i.e., eligible for aspirin, has a diagnosis of hypertension, meets criteria for blood cholesterol management, and/or is a current smoker); (b) have received care at the site in the last 12&#x000a0;months; and (c) are age <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>18&#x000a0;years. Patients eligible for aspirin are those with a documented ICD (ICD-9/10) code for ischemic vascular disease in the last 12&#x000a0;months. Similarly, patients with a diagnosis of hypertension must have a documented ICD code for the targeted risk factor. Patients with hyperlipidemia based on an ICD code or who otherwise meet criteria for cholesterol management are identified by laboratory results for LDL cholesterol as well as ICD codes. Smokers are identified by documentation of current smoking status in the EHR (e.g., meaningful use measure) during the past 24&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Site recruitment</title><p id="Par14">PCIP focused recruitment on small practices in their network, which comprises over 1300 independent primary care sites in NYC. After a preliminary assessment of eligibility, the sample was reduced to a pool of 547 practices that are focused solely or primarily on adult primary care and currently using an EHR with data sharing capacity. Recruitment started with targeted invitation letters to an initial group of practices via post and email, which included a link to a recorded informational webinar. Simultaneously, PCIP conducted telephone outreach to determine practice site interest, to conduct a more detailed eligibility screening survey, and to secure a verbal commitment to participate. Once practices agreed to participate, PCIP and NYU co-hosted multiple in-person &#x0201c;kickoff&#x0201d; events to educate sites about program details. At these events, eligible practices were asked to sign the study participation agreement. In order to eliminate the risk of contamination between multiple sites in the same practice, only one site per target practice was permitted to join the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conceptual framework</title><p id="Par15">The study draws on Damshroeder&#x02019;s Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Solberg&#x02019;s framework for improving medical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our model posits that improvements in provider adherence to guideline-recommended care and ABCS-related clinical outcomes are a function of baseline external context (e.g., external policies and incentives), the baseline organizational/site characteristics, including change process capability and adaptive reserve, the intervention strategies (i.e., practice facilitation), and the multilevel changes in care processes and systems (e.g., EHR enhancements) that are employed as a result of the intervention strategies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The model postulates that PF, and the resulting system changes, will enhance ABCS outcomes through changes they produce in adaptive reserve and change process capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual framework</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2016_450_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention components</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Practice facilitation protocol</title><p id="Par16">The duration of the intervention is 12&#x000a0;months for each wave, and it is being implemented at the site level. PF comprises the following components: (1) onsite visits by the practice facilitator with the medical director and/or staff twice in the first month and then monthly thereafter; (2) expert consultation (i.e., quarterly webinars and &#x0201c;ask the expert&#x0201d; email consultant service); and (3) facilitated opportunities for shared learning across intervention sites (e.g., peer-to-peer collaborative calls) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The practice facilitator&#x02019;s main role is to coordinate and facilitate meetings with study sites and to assist primary care practices in setting practice change and performance goals and in developing strategies for implementing evidence-based components of the models for practice transformation, including CCM, PCMH, and Bodenheimer&#x02019;s 10 building blocks of primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For this purpose, a quality improvement (QI) manual informed by these models was developed by PCIP to drive delivery of the intervention. PFs also share best practices across sites, train practice staff on QI processes and methods to help them develop robust QI capacity (e.g., workflow mapping, generating performance reports), assist teams in testing system changes and interpreting outcomes, and assist with generating data for performance feedback and Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. The practice facilitator conducts phone and email exchanges with the sites as needed between site visits during the 12-month intervention period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Practice facilitator training and supervision</title><p id="Par17">All practice facilitators received training at the State University of New York at Buffalo Practice Facilitator Certificate Program, a 92-h course with 13 weekly 1.5-h live online classes plus a 40-h fieldwork practicum and 26&#x000a0;h of reflective learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Twenty-one modules, based on AHRQ&#x02019;s Practice Facilitation Handbook, cover the full range of topics for trainees to achieve the four core competencies for practice facilitation: data use to drive improvement; interpersonal skills; Health IT optimization; and QI and change management methods (e.g., Plan-Do-Study-Act) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. PCIP supplemented the Buffalo program with an additional 20&#x000a0;h of training that focused on increasing knowledge of the ABCS practice guidelines and optimizing the use of the EHR, including creating registries and dashboards, activating clinical decision support systems and other practice change components that correspond to the PF activities in the PCIP QI manual. ABCS toolkits were developed for the practice facilitators to follow that correspond directly to the training content. Three PF managers meet weekly with up to five facilitators each to provide oversight and opportunities for problem solving, identify additional training needs or site specific resources, and review the structured weekly activity reports and monthly narrative reports.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Evaluation</title><p id="Par18">Using a mixed methods approach, we will conduct a process and outcomes evaluation of five interrelated domains: (1) primary outcome (reaching clinical goals for ABCS measures); (2) secondary outcome (change in practice capacity); (3) internal context; (4) external context; and (5) implementation fidelity (PF activities, practice change). We will also assess the cost of the intervention.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcome measures and data source</title><p id="Par19">The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who reach clinical goals for hypertension, blood cholesterol management, aspirin use, and smoking cessation assistance (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The measures were defined by AHRQ EvidenceNOW and finalized through a collaborative process across all the seven funded groups. We will collect data for the 12-month period prior to implementing the intervention, during the 12-month intervention period, and then 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention. These data will be extracted from the EHRs of all 250 participating sites using PCIP&#x02019;s Hub, a query architecture that enables execution of queries in independent EHRs of the participating practices with data subsequently transmitted to a secure centralized clinical data repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The Hub provides a platform for HHNYC to extract numerator and denominator data for the ABCS measures.

Second, it is likely that we will observe variation in implementation fidelity. We have defined the core elements of the intervention; however, based on our previous experience and review of the current implementation literature, we acknowledge that adaptations to the unique practice context will be necessary. This is an inherent component of practice facilitation and is meant to enhance adoption and sustainability. We will use rigorous methods to measure implementation fidelity of core elements and will also document adaptations to enhance external validity. Finally, unforeseen changes in the external context of health care delivery may affect implementation outcomes (e.g., changes in Medicaid reimbursement). The practice context in NYC is similar to that nationally, with simultaneous implementation of numerous practice transformation programs and projects. Notable statewide activities include the Medicaid PCMH incentive program to expand primary care capacity and improve care coordination, especially for patients with chronic disease; support of two state-designated regional extension centers to promote adoption of electronic health records (EHRs); the Medicaid and Medicare meaningful use incentive programs; and, recently, the $6 billion Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program (DSRIP), which creates new regional collaborations to reduce avoidable hospitalizations among Medicaid patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

<sub arrange="stack"><italic>d</italic></sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup>), and patient eligibility levels (<italic>E</italic>). The current baseline compliance rates for the four measures are 49&#x000a0;% (blood pressure control), 33&#x000a0;% (LDL control for cholesterol), 35&#x000a0;%, (aspirin recommendation), and 20&#x000a0;% (smoking cessation referral). The number of patients that will be eligible in each 3-month period is based on an average physician roster of approximately 1,000 patients. Currently, 30&#x000a0;% of those patients have hypertension, 30&#x000a0;% have hyperlipidemia, and 20&#x000a0;% smoke. If we make a conservative estimate that 25&#x000a0;% of the patients will have an office visit per 3-month period, each eligible category will range from 50 to 75 patients. In Table 4, we use the lowest (most conservative) assumption of 50 patients, which reflects the likely size of the smoking group. At this level of eligible patients, we will have over 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a 2.2&#x000a0;% change, assuming a starting compliance rate of 20&#x000a0;% (increasing from 20.0 to 22.2&#x000a0;%) and between-site variance of 0.10 on the log scale.</p><p id="Par51">As the number of eligible patients <italic>E</italic> increases, power to detect the same size change increases; for example, with the same effect (a 2.2&#x000a0;% change) there is 92&#x000a0;% power when 70 patients per period have an office visit. This means that we will have increased power for the hypertension, cholesterol, and aspirin measures compared to smoking cessation. In addition, power increases as the baseline compliance rate increases; for example, there is 91&#x000a0;% power to detect a 2.7&#x000a0;% change when the baseline compliance rate is 25&#x000a0;%. Finally, we have little information to estimate the current levels of variation between sites (<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>
<sub arrange="stack"><italic>d</italic></sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup>). However, the simulations suggest that power does not decrease when the assumed variance is increased from 0.10 to 0.25 on the log scale. If in fact the variance is lower, closer to 0.05, power is increased substantially.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13012_2016_450_Figa_HTML.gif" id="MO2"/>
