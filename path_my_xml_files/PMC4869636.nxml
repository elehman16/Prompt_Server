This study was specifically designed to support these findings by assessing health-related quality of life and symptomatic outcomes in a similar population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily UMEC/VI 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g (via ELLIPTA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> dry powder inhaler) or PBO for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at day 84. Secondary efficacy endpoints included rescue albuterol use (puffs/day) over weeks 1&#x02013;12 and trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second on day 84. Adverse events were also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 496 patients were included in the intent-to-treat population in the UMEC/VI (n=248) and PBO (n=248) treatment groups.

Patients treated with UMEC/VI 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g also had significantly higher odds of being an SGRQ responder (versus a nonresponder) than patients receiving PBO, at all study visits. This treatment benefit was seen despite a large increase in the proportion of responders receiving PBO between weeks 4 and 8 (29%&#x02013;40%).</p><p>These results were corroborated by the reduction in rescue medication use observed over weeks 1&#x02013;12 for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g versus PBO. The improvements observed in the SGRQ, which is a subjective patient-reported outcome, were supported by marked increases in objectively measured airway function (FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC) at all clinic visits with UMEC/VI 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g versus PBO. Patients receiving UMEC/VI 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g demonstrated a similar incidence of AEs compared with patients in the PBO group. These findings were consistent with the previously described safety profile of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g.<xref rid="b8-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The results of this 12-week study support the findings of the 24-week study by Donohue et al,<xref rid="b10-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which also demonstrated that UMEC/VI 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in SGRQ versus PBO (5.51 units), as well as statistically significant reductions in rescue use versus PBO. In two randomized trials, the combination tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 &#x003bc;g significantly improved SGRQ versus PBO.<xref rid="b15-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These improvements exceeded the MCID and were similar to the changes versus PBO observed in the current study.<xref rid="b15-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Improvements in SGRQ total score have also been reported for other once-daily fixed-dose LAMA/LABA combinations versus PBO, though these were smaller than the MCID of 4.0 units.<xref rid="b16-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In addition, a network meta-analysis of 24 randomized trials by Ismaila et al<xref rid="b18-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> found that on average the LAMA monotherapies tiotropium (2.43 units) and glycopyrronium (3.14 units), both, resulted in improvements versus PBO well below the 4.0-unit MCID for SGRQ at 24 weeks. Similarly, in another network meta-analysis, Cope et al<xref rid="b19-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported that twice-daily LABA monotherapy, including formoterol (2.58 unit change) and salmeterol (1.31 unit change), on average resulted in nonclinically relevant improvements in SGRQ versus PBO. The improvements in SGRQ reported here were approximately at or above the MCID. This, combined with the clinically relevant results reported by Donohue et al,<xref rid="b10-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> suggest that dual bronchodilator therapy with LABA/LAMA combinations such as UMEC/VI could result in more consistently improved HRQoL in patients with symptomatic COPD compared with bronchodilator monotherapy.</p><p>A limitation of the current study is that UMEC/VI was not compared with other active bronchodilator monotherapy, so comparisons with other active therapies can only be made using historical data and inferences should be made with caution. Additionally, patients in the PBO arm were only permitted to take short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, even though they had GOLD B or GOLD D COPD. A potential additional limitation of the study was that all patients included were selected to have moderate-to-very-severe breathlessness at study entry, in accordance with guideline recommendations. Although this patient population is the most likely to benefit most from dual therapy, there remains limited data available in less symptomatic patient subgroups with dual bronchodilator therapy. Finally, the current study was of insufficient duration to fully assess the risk of COPD exacerbations, which were assessed only as part of the safety evaluation. Any apparent treatment differences would require confirmation in further studies of a longer duration.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that treatment with the dual bronchodilator UMEC/VI 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g was well tolerated and provided statistically significant and clinically important improvements in HRQoL versus PBO in patients with symptomatic moderate-to-very-severe COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size calculation used an estimate of residual standard deviation (SD) of 12.63 units, which was the value observed in a previous study evaluating umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) 62.5/25 &#x003bc;g and placebo (PBO).<xref rid="b20-copd-11-971" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> With &#x0003e;211 patients per treatment arm, there was &#x0003e;99% power to detect a difference of 100 mL between treatments in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second with an estimate of residual SD of 220 mL.
