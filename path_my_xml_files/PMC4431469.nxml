Among them, interferon (IFN) beta remains a valid treatment approach because of its good benefit/risk profile. Due to the need for frequent administration (weekly, at a minimum), the use of IFN beta is limited by uncomfortable side effects that could reduce adherence to and persistence with the treatment. The use of subcutaneous polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated interferon beta-1a (PEG-IFN) has been proposed to offer a better combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and therapy-related side effects. A 125 &#x003bc;g dose of PEG-IFN given every 2 or 4 weeks was tested in two Phase I studies and shown to be as safe and efficient as IFN beta-1a but with a longer half-life. A Phase III trial (ADVANCE) comparing 125 &#x003bc;g of PEG-IFN given every 2 or 4 weeks with placebo in 1,512 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis showed significant reductions in both the annualized relapse rate (ARR) and the occurrence of new or newly enlarged T2 brain lesions in both experimental groups versus placebo after the first year. Moreover, 38% fewer patients showed progression of disability (<italic>P</italic>=0.04) in the PEG-IFN groups. During the second year, the ARR was further reduced in the PEG-IFN 2-week treatment group (0.230 at 1 year versus 0.178 at 2 years) and was maintained in the 4-week treatment group. Patients who received immediate PEG-IFN treatment showed improved clinical efficacy (ARR, risk of relapse, 12-week disability progression) and magnetic resonance imaging parameters (new T2 and newly enlarging lesions, gadolinium-positive lesions) compared with those with delayed treatment. The effects were more evident with the 2-week dose for all endpoints considered. Furthermore, PEG-IFN was well tolerated, and no new safety concerns arose. In conclusion, PEG-IFN has good efficacy and a good safety profile. The available data support the use of PEG-IFN as a suitable therapeutic option in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>PEGylated interferon beta</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>disease-modifying drug</kwd><kwd>relapses</kwd><kwd>magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Interferon beta and multiple sclerosis</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that can potentially cause permanent disability in young adults.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although the pathogenesis is unknown, MS is considered autoimmune in nature.

This situation is exciting for MS specialists because, to date, the response to available drugs has been suboptimal due to the heterogeneity of the disease. An enriched armament will bring new opportunities for individualized treatment but will also generate new challenges regarding efficacy and safety issues in the long term, and detailed discussions with patients about the risk/benefit balance before treatment decisions will become more and more important. Some drugs, such as fingolimod, natalizumab, and mitoxantrone, considered as second-line therapies, potentially offer greater efficacy but are burdened by an increased risk of serious adverse events. While the first-line therapies, ie, IFN beta and glatiramer acetate, have well-established efficacy and good long-term safety profiles, they come with disturbing and uncomfortable side effects in addition to the need for frequent administration via an unpleasant route. Considering that these aspects could lead MS patients to reduce their adherence to and persistence with treatment, optimization of treatment with IFN beta by PEGylation has recently been proposed. PEGylation of IFN beta molecules improves the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile by increasing the half-life while also maintaining efficacy. The addition of a PEG molecule to IFN beta increases the size of the molecule, thereby increasing the persistence of the drug in the circulation by decreasing the rate of kidney clearance or reducing proteolysis and opsonization and leading to an increased half-life and drug efficacy.<xref rid="b29-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Recently, PEG-IFN beta-1a, administered by two injections every 2 weeks, has been recommended for use in patients with relapsing-remitting MS by international authorities, including the US Food and Drug Administration in the USA and the European Medicines Agency in Europe. PEG-IFN beta-1a at a dose of 125 &#x003bc;g taken every 2 or 4 weeks was tested in two Phase I studies in healthy subjects and shown to be at least as safe and effective as the current IFN beta-1a administered intramuscularly.<xref rid="b29-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The effect of treating relapsing-remitting MS patients with 125 &#x003bc;g PEG-IFN every 2 or 4 weeks (subcutaneously) was tested in the Phase III ADVANCE study, showing in the first year a reduction of the ARR by approximately one-third compared with placebo, and slight but significant reductions in sustained disability progression and in several MRI activity measures were also shown.<xref rid="b31-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>The efficacy data<xref rid="b31-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> seem to be similar to those observed in the pivotal trials of IFN beta,<xref rid="b3-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> suggesting a similar effect of PEG-IFN. However, it should be kept in mind that &#x0201c;head to head&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not inferiority&#x0201d; trials comparing PEG-IFN with IFN beta directly have not been performed yet. Moreover, the comparison of trials performed in different decades could be misleading because the clinical and diagnostic characteristics of the MS patients included in the studies have changed over time.<xref rid="b37-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Additionally, a post hoc analysis performed during the first 48 weeks of ADVANCE showed that significantly more patients with relapsing-remitting MS receiving PEG-IFN every 2 weeks had no evidence of disease activity.<xref rid="b33-tcrm-11-759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Further, results from the second year of ADVANCE showed a greater reduction in all endpoints with dosing every 2 weeks versus every 4 weeks.
