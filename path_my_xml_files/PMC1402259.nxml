Recent reviews of published literature suggest that the prevalence of pain in advanced cancer is about 70% with ample variations according to the cancer type and disease stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Despite the existence of published and well-known guidelines for cancer pain management recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and effective treatments are available for 70&#x02013;90% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], under treatment is well documented and large proportions of cancer patients (reaching in some evaluations 40%) remain intentionally under-treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] for several reasons, often conceptualized in terms of barriers related to health care provider, patient, family, institution and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The most frequent cause of under-treatment is usually considered misconceptions about opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Evidence about pain prevalence, drug utilization and treatments effectiveness in cancer patients are scanty, most deriving from placebo trials, with very few comparative studies in large and well characterized cohorts of cancer patients. Furthermore, it is not available in medical literature any large parallel randomized controlled trial conducted in advanced cancer patients suffering from severe pain (step 3 in the WHO's pain ladder), comparing any alternative opioids to oral morphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The general picture that derives from the analysis of experiences carried out in international settings does apply to Italy also, with some peculiarities: <italic>a</italic>) Opioids consumption is ranked among the lowest in Europe until 2000, with some improvements at least in terms DDD/100,000 people after the introduction of new opiods in the list of reimbursable drugs (transdermal fentanyl and morphine syrup) in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>b</italic>) Until January 2005, when a new bill was introduced at national level, no WHO-step II analgesic products were available in the list of reimbursable drugs in most of Italian regions, as well as some "strong" WHO-step III opioids, making it difficult for physicians the appropriate prescription of drugs and creating variability in drugs utilization across different Italian regions. <italic>c</italic>) A non appropriate use of transdermal fentanyl can be suspected, as too many patients received it as first option, although recommended only when oral morphine is inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>A multidisciplinary Advisory Board of experts in the field of cancer and pain treatments from Industry, Scientific Societies and Patients Associations was convened by the Mario Negri Institute on November 2003 to discuss the quality of pain management in cancer patients in Italy and, eventually, to recommend possible ameliorative educational and research strategies. Member of the Boards highlighted the lack of and the need for new empirical evidence about the epidemiology and the effectiveness of available therapeutic strategies, and called for a prospective program of research aimed at making available to treating physicians, patients and families valid information about pain management in cancer. Two main lines of activities were identified as necessary: information and education activities addressed to physicians, care givers and patients/citizens, and prospective data collection to document patterns of care and outcomes.</p><p>Operationally, some working groups met several times during 2004, identified a selected sample of about 100 centers treating cancer patients with advanced/metastatic disease and pain that could be potentially eligible for a prospective study, and planned 3 types of activities to be implemented during the following 3 years (2005&#x02013;2007): a) information and education: a prototype of educational course for professionals (physicians and nurses) has been assembled and tested on a sample of participants (through a residential course approved by the Italian Committee for Medical Continuing Education with 26 and 33 credits for physicians and nurses, respectively); a critical appraisal of information available in the web (Internet) was also carried out with the preparation and publication of a meta-site that facilitates the use of selected (internet) resources for people interested and/or involved in issues related to cancer pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; b) drug utilization and appropriateness: an evaluation of the volume and quality of prescriptions of analgesic drugs in a large administrative data base in collaboration with local Italian Health Authorities has been started to test the feasibility of the approach in a wider context (regional); c) a prospective, multicenter, nationwide effectiveness study to test the effect of different and alternatives analgesic strategies (such as oral morphine, fentanyl and buprenorphine patches, etc) on patient-reported-outcomes.</p><p>The above initiatives are fully described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the present paper we provide details about the prospective multicenter study, involving more than 100 Italian centers that has the objective to assess the epidemiology and quality of different and alternatives analgesic strategies (such as oral morphine, fentanyl and buprenorphine patches, etc) and their effect on patient-reported-outcomes. Results are expected by the end of 2006.</p><sec><title>Study rationale</title><p>Evidence of the relative effectiveness of current options for treating cancer pain from comparative randomized studies is scanty. This study will investigate the epidemiology of cancer pain and of its treatments, the quality of analgesic-drug therapy and the effect of alternative analgesic strategies in a large, prospective, unselected cohort of cancer patients using the state-of-the art of patient-reported-outcomes. Later, Later, after the launch of the observational study and on the basis of results, in specific subsamples of patients, in select centers, a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will be carried out to formally compare the efficacy of alternative analgesic strategies, with particular emphasis on oral morphine as comparator and buprenorphine patch as experimental arm. Results from the outcome and experimental studies will ensure both the external and internal validity. This kind of approach - a comprehensive cohort design study where all participants are followed up regardless of their randomization status, and outcomes of people who participated in the RCT can be compared with those who participated in the cohort study to assess their similarities and differences - is ideal for trials in which large proportions of eligible individuals are likely to be not entered in the RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>Primary objective</title><p>- To describe the characteristics of a large sample of cancer patients in terms of case mix (patients characteristics), pattern of care (pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments) and relevant efficacy (analgesic and other patient-reported outcomes (PRO) outcomes such satisfaction, quality of life measures) and safety outcomes (generic, disease and treatments specific).</p><p>- To assess the quality of analgesic treatments in terms of congruence between patients' reported level of pain (intensity) and the potency of the prescribed analgesic drug (according to the WHO analgesic ladder) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>The database will be used to evaluate the effects of various therapeutic analgesic options administered by physicians to patients.

The reference group will be those patients treated with oral morphine. The propensity analyses will be carried out:</p><p>- To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens on pain intensity and patient-reported quality of life</p><p>- To evaluate the effect of treatment regimens on patient-reported satisfaction</p><p>- To evaluate the safety profile (adverse and side effects) of alternative treatment regimens</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study will be designed as a multi-center, open-label, observational non-interventional trial in at least 100 centers, in Italy. Approximately 25 subjects will be enrolled in each center. Subjects will be treated by physicians according to the usual practice (standard of care) and followed over time using standardized methods and forms to make possible a valid and reliable description of case-mix, pattern of care and outcomes.

Most (60%) of the remaining 1250 will eventually need a WHO-Step III analgesic drug (750) during the longitudinal evaluation period.</p><p>Overall, considering the inception and the longitudinal evaluation, the entire duration of the study is estimated around 5 months. At the moment, more than 160 centers accepted to participate and 130 have successfully carried out a pilot phase of the study to test the study feasibility (Appendix 2 [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>According to the first main objective of the study (i.e., to describe the characteristics of cancer patients in terms of patients characteristics, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and relevant analgesic and other PRO outcomes such as satisfaction, quality of life, generic, disease and treatments specific side effects), all patients enrolled in the study and eligible will be included in the statistical descriptive analyses. To avoid and minimize the impact of missing data, a bias that may be present in the case of using patient-reported measures as principal outcomes/endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], particularly when patients discontinue study treatment, specific procedures to treat missing items will be used, such as the last observation carried forward -LOCF. Data will be analyzed using either parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. When appropriate, for example for the weekly pain ratings scales, scores will be analyzed using repeated analyses of variance to analyze and separate the effects of treatments and time and test the interaction between the two, as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>As to the assessment of the quality of analgesic care, the adequacy of pain management will be assessed firstly using the IPM, an index assembled by grouping with explicit and pre-planned rules patient with different intensity of pain and level of analgesic therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although IPM is not accurate for prescribing drug to an individual, it provides a rough estimate of how pain is treated in the population. According to the literature, each patient will be classified into one of seven mutually exclusive levels of care (from -3 to +3) and appropriate univariate and multivariate analyses will be carried out on the whole sample and on relevant sub-groups to screen predictors of poor analgesic care and to identify patients at greater risk of under-medication. Data collected over time will be used to develop and test new methods to assess quality of analgesic care that may be used at individual (single case) level.</p><p>As to the secondary objective of the study (i.e., to evaluate the effects of various therapeutic analgesic options administered by physicians to patients), given the non-randomized design the propensity score approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] will be used to balance the covariates in the groups and thus reduce the bias produced by the lack of randomization. Briefly, in all 3 comparisons planned by protocol (oral morphine vs fentanyl patch, oral morphine vs buprenorphine patch, fentanyl vs buprenorphine), a comparison specific propensity scores will be estimated. The propensity score method implies a comprehensive collection of information known to be causally associated with the choice of the treatments, then the production of a propensity score (the conditional probability of exposure to a treatment given the observed covariates) using standard statistical models such as logistic regressions to predict the treatment (for example, the choice of morphine in eligible patients), eventually the comparison of outcomes (for example, pian intensity) by matching or stratifing patients according to the value of the propensity scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The Study will collect, describe and assess a vast array of outcomes measures related to pain and to its impact on patients' life. Some of these measures will be collected and reported by physicians and other directly by patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Pain related outcomes</title><p>The predefined primary outcome measurement is the pain intensity over the first weeks, assessed with four questions from the BPI, that will be used either individually or after the computation of their mean, as indicated by developers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

The patients' consent to participate in the studies should be obtained after a full explanation has been given. Particular attention should be given to explaining the purposes, manner of the management and use of the patients' data from questionnaires and diaries. The right of the patient to withdraw from the studies in any time, without giving reasons, must be respected.</p><p>The responsibility for drafting the manuscripts related to the analyses described in this protocol will lie with the WPC whose members will be the primary Authors. At least one representative from high-recruiting centers will be included among the co-authors, and all participants will be acknowledged in the Appendices. All authors should review and approve the manuscript before submission. At least two papers are expected: the first reporting on the results of the "epidemiological" part of the study, including a description of patients' characteristics in terms of baseline socio-demographic and clinical variables, pattern of care and main outcomes, and a discussion of the feasibility of this kind of approaches in the specific setting, the second about the effects (effectiveness) of treatments on patients (and physicians) reported outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional File 1</title><p>Appendix 1.
