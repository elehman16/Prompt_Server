We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women&#x02019;s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women&#x02019;s groups from 2001&#x02013;2003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women&#x02019;s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women&#x02019;s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency. Household agency may be a prerequisite for actualising the benefits of PLA groups rather than a consequence.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>085417/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costello</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Child Health Research Charitable Incorporated Organisation</institution></funding-source><award-id>521297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3905-0465</contrib-id><name><surname>Gram</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G81174H</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3905-0465</contrib-id><name><surname>Gram</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by a Wellcome Trust strategic award [Ref: 085417/Z/08/Z, website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">https://wellcome.ac.uk/</ext-link>].

Inspired by the philosophy of &#x0201c;popular education&#x0201d; by Paulo Freire [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], PLA interventions employ a trained facilitator to hold regular community meetings in which groups of local women are led through a cycle of problem identification, prioritisation, action planning, strategy implementation and outcome evaluation. The implementation and scale-up of PLA strategies to improve newborn mortality and health is explicitly endorsed in a recommendation by the World Health Organisation [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite strong evidence to support efficacy, the pathways from intervention to impact remain unclear and the evidence on how community-level exposure to PLA women&#x02019;s groups achieves its impact is evolving [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Victora [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] commented on the long causal chain from &#x02018;critical consciousness to mortality&#x02019; and compared the relative lack of theory on how PLA women&#x02019;s groups currently work to the situation of 19th century epidemiologists before the discovery of germ theory&#x02014;These had clear evidence for an association between poor sanitation and incidence of infectious disease, but a poor understanding of the biological mechanism.</p><p>Intermediary effects have been explored through qualitative studies, which have reported that women and men participating in the groups engaged in several collective action strategies from setting up mother and child health funds to producing and selling their own clean delivery kits. Women&#x02019;s group members ascribed to attendance increased self-confidence and self-esteem and improved social support from the community [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, almost no qualitative or quantitative evidence exists on the impact of PLA groups on women&#x02019;s agency in the household.</p><p>Yet, agency in the household may be a key barrier to improved maternal, child and reproductive health. The United Nations Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health 2016&#x02013;2030 recognises that &#x0201c;women, children and adolescents are potentially the most powerful agents for improving their own health and achieving prosperous and sustainable societies&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. At the same time, the 5th Sustainable Development Goal explicitly sets out to achieve gender equality and empower women and girls by 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Although no consensus currently exists regarding a single definition of empowerment and agency [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a considerable body of literature discusses the range of possible meanings [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We follow Ibrahim and Alkire [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in defining empowerment as &#x0201c;the expansion of agency&#x0201d; and Sen [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in defining a person&#x02019;s agency as &#x0201c;what the person is free to do and achieve in pursuit of whatever goals or values he or she regards as important&#x0201d; (p.203). Agency relates here to the extent to which individuals are able to provide reasons for their actions that accord with their own goals or values [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. &#x0201c;Household agency&#x0201d; refers to individuals&#x02019; ability to pursue and achieve valued goals within the context of their personal relationships with members of their own household.</p><p>PLA groups might enable women to tackle structural obstacles to health such as low status in their own family, or household restrictions on the freedom of women to move and speak as they please [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In turn, lack of household agency has been linked to poorer fertility [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], child nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], health-seeking [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], an maternal and child health [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] outcomes in multiple contexts. One before-and-after analysis of a PLA intervention in rural Bangladesh found evidence for increased participation in household decision-making on women&#x02019;s own healthcare [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Another evaluation of a cluster-randomised controlled trial of a PLA intervention to reduce low birth weight in Nepal found no evidence for an impact on household agency across a wide range of different indicators [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>We followed up a closed cohort of surviving mother-infant dyads from the first trial of PLA women&#x02019;s groups in Makwanpur District, Nepal from 2001&#x02013;2003 [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

In particular, remittance income from foreign labour migration has increased dramatically from 2% in 2000 to 32% of GDP in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Locally, agriculture constitutes 73% of total national employment [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Access to technology has improved markedly.

After the election of a Constituent Assembly in 2008, a protracted period of negotiation followed ending in the adoption of a new constitution for Nepal in 2015.

The distribution of caste, household occupation, assets, education, maternal age and gender of the household head among respondents with missing data closely tracked the distribution of corresponding variables among women who were interviewed. Tests of interaction between availability for interview at endline and intervention/control status revealed no evidence for differential loss to follow-up with respect to caste group, asset score, maternal age, education or baseline number of deliveries by trial allocation (<italic>p</italic>-values all &#x0003e;0.05).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197426.t002">Table 2</xref> displays characteristics of women collected at follow-up, which provide key context for our findings. Nearly all women worked outside the home (99%), while about half were the main person responsible for cooking, cleaning and laundry in the house (54%), and about a third were responsible for money management and shopping for the household (36%).

On measures of agency freedom, most women scored in the high range. The mean overall agency freedom score for all women, irrespective of trial arm, was 9.6 (standard deviation 2.2). 75% of women achieved the maximum score in the employment domain and 82% achieved the maximum score in the domestic work domain, while 37% and 47% achieved the maximum in health-seeking and group participation domains, respectively (not shown in table). 19% of women achieved the maximum score on overall agency freedom. Similarly, 89% of women reported being involved in decisions on major expenditures in the household, with 70% of women reporting making decisions jointly with their husband.

However, we found evidence for modelling of higher levels of subsequent exposure to PLA groups being associated with reduced agency in the sub-domain of group participation, This was evident when modelling of subsequent exposure to PLA groups was driven more by pregnancy associated time in Model 3 (IMPEXP(0.5): <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.002) and in Model 4 (IMPEXP(1.0), <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.015).

Long-term evaluation of participatory women&#x02019;s groups is important, because &#x0201c;[depending] on the dimension of empowerment, the context, and the type of social, economic, or policy catalyst, women may become empowered in some aspects of their lives in a relatively short period of time (say 1&#x02013;3 years) while other changes may evolve over decades&#x0201d; (p.80) [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The ability of our study to exploit a rare opportunity for long-term follow-up of women potentially exposed to participatory women&#x02019;s groups is an important strength.</p><p>We found little convincing evidence for a positive relation between exposure to the original trial intervention and women&#x02019;s household agency, either overall or disaggregated by subdomain. Similarly, we did not find consistent evidence of an association between subsequent exposure to PLA groups and overall household agency. There was some evidence that measures of subsequent exposure to PLA groups driven largely by subsequent time spent being pregnant were associated with reduced agency in the sub-domain of group participation. Further, in some sensitivity analyses, exposure to the original trial intervention and measures of subsequent potential exposure driven by pregnancy-related time were associated with reduced household agency in the Ladder Question. However, these later findings should be interpreted with caution as they emerged as part of sensitivity testing and robustness checking rather than due to the primary analysis.</p><p>Adjusting for trial allocation, socio-economic factors and subsequent exposure to PLA groups, the baseline number of deliveries was negatively correlated with agency freedom on average 11.5 years after enrolment into the original cRCT (irrespective of intervention allocation), but the effect size was small. The report of one additional previous pregnancy at baseline was associated with a reduction of overall agency freedom of 0.03 points (score range -12 to +12). The baseline number of deliveries was also negatively associated with perceived power as measured with the ladder question.</p><p>Our negative findings could reflect an absence of long-term impact of PLA groups on household agency with several potentially co-existing explanations. First, the original PLA intervention may not have impacted household agency at all and thus the benefits of PLA groups might be mediated through other factors&#x02013;such as psychological wellbeing and/or agency outside the household. Second, PLA groups could have had a short-term impact on household agency that was not sustained after the original intervention ended. However, a cluster-randomised controlled evaluation of the impact of PLA women&#x02019;s groups on resident pregnant women in Nepal found no evidence for a short-term impact on a wide range of indicators of household agency [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Third, the cohort at baseline may have already had levels of household agency and thus the PLA model may not have additionally improved household agency in this population. Ethnographic accounts have noted how gender norms in the Hills of Nepal are considerably less conservative than the Plains [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our descriptive data suggest these women might already have had considerable agency in the family when the original intervention was trialled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197426.t002">Table 2</xref>). Qualitative studies of the original Makwanpur intervention also found that community readiness for change was a key contextual element affecting the success of the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, our findings could be a false negative. First, it is possible that our measure of household agency&#x02013;the RAI&#x02014;was unable to correctly identify household agency, either because the original tool is inadequate overall or specifically in our Nepali Hill population and/or because our adaptation and translation of that tool to this setting was flawed. However, the RAI has been validated in Nepal previously [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and sensitivity analyses with alternative measures did not reveal a positive impact on agency either. Second, large-scale secular changes in the gendered national context may have confounded intervention effects over time. However, since trial clusters were randomly assigned to intervention and control, we have no reason to believe that such national trends would have affected the local context in the Makwanpur district differently between intervention and control. It is theoretically possible that secular changes in the national context interacted with the long-term effect of the intervention by eliminating short-term gains in women&#x02019;s agency in intervention compared to control after the end of the original trial. However, such an interaction would be the very definition of a lack of sustained impact and so would constitute an explanation for a lack of effect rather than a confounder.</p><p>Third, any existing differences might have become less obvious over time due to confounding by subsequent exposure to PLA groups not adequately accounted for in our models. Unlike secular trends in the national context, such exposure cannot be expected to be randomly distributed between intervention and control areas, because UCL/MIRA consciously chose to implement subsequent interventions based on their knowledge of which clusters had already previously received a PLA intervention. However, our modelling of subsequent exposure have been carefully designed, taking into account neonatal surveillance data over almost the entire post-trial period, to adjust for subsequent exposure to PLA groups arising from UCL/MIRA collaboration. In particular, our results for the main agency score did not change materially when we varied our weightings on pregnancy-related exposure, even though the proportion of pregnant women in our closed cohort decreased from 100% in the original trial period to less than a third afterwards. In our analysis of a restricted sample in which none of the women delivered again or became mothers-in-law themselves, we also found no evidence for an impact on the main agency score, even though we effectively compared a sample where 100% of women were pregnant during an intervention period with a sample where 0% of women were pregnant. The women&#x02019;s groups were open to all community members, but group discussion topics revolved exclusively around perinatal health issues (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197426.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Even among pregnant women, the participation rate never exceeded 40% [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The robustness of our results to different weights on pregnancy-related exposure shows that our null result is not an artefact of how we measure subsequent exposure. Furthermore, to our knowledge there were no other governmental or non-governmental PLA group health interventions running in the area during this time period.</p><p>Finally, the finding that increased number of deliveries at baseline was associated with reduced household agency at end-line is plausible given that higher fertility has been associated with poorer socio-economic status and agency in the past [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This has important implications for implementation of such interventions in the future that may need to take into account baseline fertility rate in targeting beneficiaries or tailoring implementation strategies.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitations of this study are 1) a lack of comparative and alternative measures of agency over time&#x02013;both during intervention and subsequent years 2) a lack of concurrent qualitative data on perceived impact on empowerment at the community and the household level 3) low study power. Our measure of agency was limited to the household and did not address other domains&#x02013;such as that related to child-care or community agency. For women, such as those in this cohort, with few demonstrable restrictions on social activities outside the household, agency in the community might be more relevant. Measures of social support [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], social capital [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] or community mobilisation [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] could be gainfully used to assess the extent to which PLA women&#x02019;s groups empower women at a community level as opposed to a household level. In particular, the ability of PLA women&#x02019;s groups to lower transaction costs to women&#x02019;s collective action and enhance their capacity to manage communal resources is arguably a key social outcome of the participatory approach [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, subjective measures are frequently criticised for being subject to cognitive and social biases, easily influenced by the framing of questions, and unable to reveal causal factors that are not accessible to introspection [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Over the 11.5 years from baseline to end-line, life aspirations and preferences may have changed and could lead to women feeling disempowered due to higher aspirations rather than lower &#x02018;objective conditions&#x02019;. The Power Ladder question likely measures relative power, since it requires respondents to anchor the 10-point scale using the perceived agency of other women &#x02018;in their community&#x02019;. Higher levels of agency among community women in general may lead to feelings of low agency when women compare themselves with each other rather than their past selves. However, we should note that more &#x02018;objective&#x02019; measures of social constructs based on observed behaviour in the field or in the lab often imply equally, if not more, challenging interpretive difficulties due to the need to decode the meaning of ambiguous human behaviour. We recommend using both behavioural and subjective measures of empowerment in future research.</p><p>Finally, the precision of our effect estimates is limited. This was a post-hoc study and the original study sample size calculations, in particular determining the number of clusters, was not powered with this outcome in mind. A post-hoc power analysis based on an observed ICC of 0.36 for overall agency, 24 clusters in total and 256 individuals per cluster suggested we had 80% power to detect an absolute 0.23 standard deviation difference in mean overall household agency between intervention and control at 5% significance level [<xref rid="pone.0197426.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. As stated previously, the mean overall agency freedom score for all women, irrespective of trial arm, was 9.6 with astandard deviation of 2.2.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We investigated the long-term impacts of a perinatal PLA women&#x02019;s group intervention on women&#x02019;s household agency approximately 11.5 years after individuals&#x02019; original exposure to the intervention. There was no robust evidence to support a long-term impact of the original intervention on women&#x02019;s agency in the family according to a wide range of model specifications. Without in-depth qualitative evidence and/or interim measures of household agency and other measures of agency, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the reasons for our lack of observed impact. Our study does, however, highlight important methodological considerations that should be taken into account when addressing the question of unpicking potential pathways to impact&#x02013;at the individual, family and community level of community-based mobilisation interventions to improve maternal and child health. Future work should collect qualitative and quantitative process and implementation data over time in order to better understand the mechanisms through which women&#x02019;s groups and similar participatory and community based interventions improve health outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197426.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Activity schedule for all participatory women&#x02019;s group meetings 2001&#x02013;2014.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197426.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0197426.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Statements for the main survey module.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0197426.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>First and foremost, we thank the families, mothers and children and young people of the Makwanpur women&#x02019;s group study who gave their time generously and without complaint both during the initial trial and the subsequent follow-up study.
