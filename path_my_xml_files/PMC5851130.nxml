In specialist palliative care settings, feedback with patients&#x02019; reports of their own health and well-being with standardized and validated questionnaires is widely used. A systematic review of Etkind et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> reported audit and feedback to be an effective tool to improve care processes such as better symptom recognition, improved patient-physician communication, and improved caregiver outcomes. The literature assumes audit and feedback to be more effective when accompanied by interventions, whether active or passive (such as educational outreach or publication of performance), but more research that compares different feedback strategies is needed.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In the nursing home context, Castle<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and Vandenberg et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> reported about the usefulness of reporting care performance outcomes to health professionals for care quality improvement. These studies were not about dying with dementia; they employed a passive feedback strategy, and the study design was based on within-group comparisons. To our best knowledge, the effectiveness of feedback to improve end-of-life outcomes for nursing home residents dying with dementia has not been studied.</p><p>The aim of the Feedback on End-of-Life care in dementia (FOLlow-up) project was to test the effects of two active feedback strategies on perceived quality of end-of-life care and quality of dying (comfort) in nursing home residents dying with dementia: one strategy used generic feedback based on bereaved family caregivers&#x02019; mean ratings and the other strategy used patient-specific feedback with ratings of individual family caregivers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section7-0269216317750071"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section8-0269216317750071"><title>Study design</title><p>The effects of the feedback strategies were tested and compared in Dutch nursing homes in a three-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT; Netherlands Trial Registration, NTR3942).

The triplets were randomly assigned to the three groups: (1) the group testing the generic feedback strategy, (2) the group testing the patient-specific feedback strategy, and (3) the control group. After three nursing homes were matched, three papers with the name of the intervention group were folded and put in a blinded bag. Subsequently, a project group member, witnessed by two other project group members, drew folded papers with the group names that each of the three matched nursing homes would be assigned to. Not all nursing homes started to collect data at the same time. The pre-intervention phase started in January 2012 with the first nursing home triplets, and the intervention phase started in November 2012. In July 2014, all nursing homes concluded data collection.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0269216317750071"><title>Setting and study population</title><p>In total, 18 nursing homes participated in the study. The study population comprised family caregivers of nursing home residents with dementia who died on a psychogeriatric ward (almost all dementia, and residents generally stay until death). We included family caregivers who could read Dutch and whose relative had stayed in the nursing home at least 16&#x02009;days in the last month of life and who had a dementia diagnosis recorded in their medical file. Around 6&#x02009;weeks after death, the nursing home invited the family member who had been most involved in care during the last month of life (usually the same person since admission) to provide feedback by sending them a questionnaire along with an information letter.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0269216317750071"><title>The intervention</title><p>We explicitly aimed to implement feedback strategies that were &#x0201c;sustainable with limited external support,&#x0201d; as reported in the protocol article.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The feedback strategies were implemented in Dutch nursing homes that participated in the intervention groups.

Examples of items are &#x0201c;I felt fully involved in all decision making&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;The health care team was sensitive to my needs and feelings.&#x0201d; The 14-item EOLD-CAD instrument evaluates resident&#x02019;s quality of dying and comprises the subscales Physical distress, Dying symptoms, Emotional distress, and Well-being.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Higher scores (range: 14&#x02013;42) indicate higher levels of quality of dying. We referred to the last week of life.</p><p>For both strategies (the generic and the patient-specific feedback strategy), we developed a document with suggestions for improvement that included evidence-based suggestions from the latest national and international literature and care guidelines in the field of end of life and palliative care&#x02014;when available, we used those specific to dementia.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="bibr20-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr21-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr22-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> We also developed practical suggestions based on the non-scientific national literature such as national health care guidelines. In the generic feedback strategy, nursing homes entered the family caregiver scores in a digital import program. Feedback of a minimum of 10 family caregiver questionnaires was required to generate EOLD-total and EOLD item mean scores, which were compared with a norm based on combined mean total and item scores of 372 nursing home and residential care residents with dementia collected nationwide between 2005 and 2010 in three previous Dutch studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Subsequently, the digital import program compared the norm with the mean scores of a minimum of 10 family caregivers per participating nursing home using <italic>t</italic>-tests and generated a feedback report. A <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was chosen to define statistically significant differences between the norm and the mean scores of a nursing home.

The lower scores were linked to the relevant suggestions, to prompt quality improvements actions by the health professionals. In cases where none of the mean EOLD item or total scores was below the norm, the feedback report included only the means, without improvement suggestions. The nursing homes were instructed to discuss the feedback reports in multi-disciplinary team meetings and to choose improvement actions from the provided suggestions or to formulate their own improvement actions. The multi-disciplinary team meetings were usually attended by elderly care physicians and nurses, and in some nursing homes also by para-medical disciplines such as physiotherapists or psychologists.

In sum, our cluster-randomized RCT showed little effects. The generic feedback intervention slightly lowered family perceptions of the quality of end-of-life care (satisfaction with care). The effect was statistically significant in adjusted and unadjusted analyses, and in adjusted analyses (&#x02212;2.4), it was close to what we had considered clinically relevant when calculating power.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Quality of dying was unchanged with generic feedback compared with any change over time in the control group. With the patient-specific feedback intervention, quality of dying improved, but the effect was not significant after adjustment for differences in patients&#x02019; and family caregivers&#x02019; characteristics compared to the control group. The quality of care was unchanged with the patient-specific intervention. The significant changes referred to coefficients of about 2 points. This represents a modest change. Relative to this, the improvement in the subscale score for &#x0201c;Dying symptoms&#x0201d; of about 1 point was larger.</p><p>Several explanations for these results could be provided. First, the effect of feedback on performance of professionals is more effective when baseline results are low.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Only the nursing homes in the generic feedback group received a feedback report including baseline item and total scores that were flagged (green or bold and underscored) if the nursing home scored higher or lower than the norm.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The baseline EOLD-total mean scores of both end-of-life outcomes applied in our study were relatively high compared to the norm we used, which was based on data from three earlier studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These high baseline scores could be explained by an ongoing trend of more satisfied families as noted in the 2005&#x02013;2010 dataset that was used to set the norm. The norm was not adjusted for a trend, but the distribution was skewed toward more recent evaluations (the median month of death was January 2009). Indeed, most items in these feedback reports were flagged green resulting in no improvement suggestions for these items. In total, 31 EOLD-SWC item mean scores and 8 EOLD-CAD item mean scores were flagged green in the generic feedback and only 1 EOLD-SWC item mean score and 9 EOLD-CAD item mean scores were flagged bold and underscored. Furthermore, 5 (out of 6) nursing homes actually discussed the feedback reports (each nursing home generated one feedback report after the pre-intervention phase), and 4 nursing homes formulated in total 10 improvement actions; a smaller number than the number of improvement actions formulated in the patient-specific feedback strategy (33 improvement actions). According to the control theory of Carver and Scheier,<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> professionals are prompted to change behavior when they observe a discrepancy between their current performance and a goal. Feedback reports may be more effective when performance is compared to a clear performance goal. Perhaps, a feedback report that informed nursing home professionals that for the majority of the items the performance goal was accomplished, without clear instructions to further improve or motivation to excel (the result were not made public), may have resulted in the health care team to neglect those items or focus on other issues at the expense of sustained effort in areas relevant to these items. This may have served as a reassurance which may not have motivated nursing home professionals to further improve the quality of care at the end of life. In addition, since nursing homes were not asked to record actual implementation of the improvement actions, it may be that nursing homes, despite their intentions, did not, or were not successful in implementing improvement actions.</p><p>A second explanation for our results may relate to the nursing home context. Even though we targeted the behavior of the whole team,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> we only actively instructed physicians and in some cases the quality coordinator, potentially resulting in suboptimal implementation of the feedback strategies among the whole team. Indeed, according to Grol and Grimshaw,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> achieving behavioral change in care professionals requires the involvement of different levels, such as the individual caregiver and the care team, and Ivers et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> found that interventions directed at physicians are more likely to be successful if the feedback is given by a supervisor or colleague and when there are specific targets for improvement. Also organizational characteristics, such as staff composition, staff&#x02013;patient ratios, and high staff turnover, were reported to function as barriers for the implementation of nursing home interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Third, we found that quality of dying decreased in the control group (change in mean pre-intervention and intervention phase: &#x02212;1.5 points), while earlier studies suggested a possible increase in the quality of dying over time.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> It is possible that lower quality of dying is due to nursing home residents being sicker as a result of policies encouraging people to stay at home as long as possible;<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> although mean length of stay in our study was not longer than in the previous study in 2007&#x02013;2010.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Last, improving family perceptions of the quality of care may be more difficult for nursing homes professionals than improving quality of dying, especially for the physicians who were mostly in charge of the interventions to improve the end-of-life outcomes. The physicians may also have focused on alleviating symptoms typical for the brief dying phase.</p></sec><sec id="section17-0269216317750071"><title>Recommendations for practice and future research</title><p>First, when feedback is provided for internal use with generic scores that are compared to a norm, flagging scores as higher than the norm should be considered cautiously for possible effects. Nursing homes should be encouraged to formulate specific performance targets, to record these and ensure follow-up, and to continue quality improvement even if they performed better than the performance norm. Second, the full multi-disciplinary team should be actively involved in all stages of implementing the intervention. Third, in general, feedback effects were found to be larger when feedback is provided more than once using verbal and non-verbal formats.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269216317750071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Therefore, feedback intervention studies should use short and frequent follow-up timeframes (such as with the patient-specific intervention in our study) and organize more frequent team meetings, both multi-disciplinary and mono-disciplinary, to discuss feedback and to reach consensus about the appropriate actions that need to be taken for quality improvements. The FOLlow-up study results provide insufficient basis to encourage the providing of generic or recommend the use of patient-specific feedback. Future studies, also replication studies in other cultures, are needed to increase the evidence base on audit and feedback with family caregiver evaluations of the end of life with dementia in nursing homes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the Fonds NutsOhra, The Netherlands (project number 0904-020) and The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw, project number 11150.0003.1).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0269216317750071"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
