Some 8.8% of adults worldwide are estimated to currently have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes constituting 95% of the burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of diabetes is currently highest in Saudi Arabia (17.6%), Egypt (16.7%), Bahrain (15.6%), UAE (14.6%), and Kuwait (14.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. By 2040, the prevalence of diabetes is forecast to increase such that it will affect 10% of the global population, placing growing pressure on healthcare resources and imposing a large economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The aim of type 2 diabetes management is to minimize long-term complications, including micro- and macrovascular diseases, while avoiding any unwanted effects of treatment, such as hypoglycemia and weight gain. Current guidelines, supported by data from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, recommend intensive blood glucose (BG) control to lower HbA1c below a target of 7.0% in most patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease that requires continuous intensification and optimization of treatment to achieve and maintain HbA1c targets. Intensification strategies depend on an individual&#x02019;s characteristics, needs, and preferences, but most patients will eventually require insulin therapy due to the loss of beta-cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Basal insulin, such as long-acting insulin analogs or intermediate-acting neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, are commonly used as initial insulin therapies. When basal insulin fails to provide adequate glycemic control, the addition of rapid-acting mealtime insulin can be considered (basal&#x02013;bolus), with progressive escalation in the number of injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A premixed insulin regimen, providing both rapid-acting and intermediate-acting components in one formulation, can also be used to initiate or intensify insulin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and is widely used as the initial insulin therapy in African, Middle Eastern, and South-East Asian regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30: NovoMix 30) is a premix of insulin aspart (IAsp) in which 30% is soluble short-acting IAsp and the remaining 70% is an intermediate-acting protamine cocrystallized IAsp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. BIAsp 30 provides prandial insulin coverage while also offering adequate basal coverage, and can improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes previously inadequately controlled with basal insulins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Despite detailed guidelines on the use of insulin therapies, for many patients, achieving and maintaining HbA1c targets in routine clinical care represents a major challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Regional data indicate that only 16.4% of patients with type 2 diabetes in Egypt, 26.8% of patients in Morocco, 27.0% of patients in Saudi Arabia, and 32.2% of patients in Indonesia achieve HbA1c targets &#x0003c;7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There are many patient and physician barriers to insulin initiation and intensification, including a lack of education and awareness, and concerns about hypoglycemia and weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additional regional and cultural barriers exist in developing countries. In the Middle East, Africa, and South-East Asia in particular, there is often a gap between guideline-driven and actual diabetes care practices, and access to healthcare can be limited due to limited insurance coverage, low physician:population ratios, rural and inaccessible communities, and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The titration of insulin doses over time is needed to achieve and maintain glycemic targets. Currently, many patients with type 2 diabetes have their insulin doses adjusted by physicians in a primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Dose adjustment is a time-consuming process, and additional barriers include the need for regular visits to clinics, the cost of glucose-testing strips, and the lack of education and experience of primary healthcare providers in titration.</p><p id="Par13">Self-monitoring of BG and self-titration of insulin dose based on predefined algorithms (with clinical oversight) is well established in type 1 diabetes, and similar therapeutic self-management of various insulin regimens has been shown to be feasible in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A therapy protocol that is easily taught and self-titrated may allow more patients to initiate and optimize insulin therapy, thus reducing follow-up clinic visits and telephone calls. Premixed insulin analogs such as BIAsp 30 are simple and convenient to use, require fewer injections than basal&#x02013;bolus treatment, and have relatively predictable time&#x02013;action profiles that offer the potential for patients to effectively adjust their daily dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The aim of this study was to confirm the efficacy of patient-driven titration of BIAsp 30 in terms of glycemic control, by comparing it to physician-driven titration of BIAsp 30, in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with NPH insulin in North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East using a noninferiority approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par15">Patients were enrolled at 18 sites across Egypt, Indonesia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam between May 2012 and July 2015.

All patients discontinued their previous NPH insulin and OADs, except for their pre-trial metformin. The dose and regimen of metformin was not changed throughout the trial period.

It is important to note that a key limitation of this study was the low number of randomized patients. Recruitment of patients was prematurely terminated due to the small number of eligible patients receiving treatment with NPH insulin at the study sites. However, the results of this study are in line with previous RCTs that have reported self-titration of insulin to be effective in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

However, after 12&#x000a0;weeks, the reduction in HbA1c was comparable between the arms. In addition, the uptitration of insulin dose was more aggressive in the physician-driven arm in the first 4&#x000a0;weeks of the study. This observation indicates that, initially, patients were learning how to titrate using the algorithm and, when comfortable, were able to achieve expected glycemic control. Other outcomes of efficacy (FPG, PG increments, and SMPG profiles) appear to be comparable between titration arms, further suggesting that patient-driven titration can be as successful as physician-driven titration. Patient satisfaction, as measured by TRIM-D scores, was also similar in both titration arms.</p><p id="Par52">The numerically greater reduction in HbA1c from baseline to week&#x000a0;20 in the patient-driven arm may be due to the more aggressive titration of the insulin dose by patients compared to that by physicians in the maintenance period of the study. However, the higher end of the treatment insulin dose and the reduction in HbA1c were not achieved at the expense of increased hypoglycemic episodes, indicating that, with adequate training, patient-driven titration of BIAsp 30 does not raise additional safety concerns.</p><p id="Par53">This is the first RCT to demonstrate that patient-driven titration was as effective as physician-driven titration in achieving recommended HbA1c targets in patients switching from NPH insulin to BIAsp 30 in non-Western countries. A small real-world study in a Dutch clinical practice has shown that patients with type 2 diabetes who switch from previous insulin regimens, including NPH insulin, to BIAsp 30 and are willing to self-titrate can improve glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Previous RCTs have demonstrated noninferiority of patient-driven versus physician-drive titration of BIAsp 30 but in patient populations different from the current study.

Additionally, premixed insulin analogs offer the benefit of being simple to use, with fewer injections, and being similarly efficacious and safe to a basal&#x02013;bolus regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">With increasing numbers of patients with diabetes and limited healthcare resources, especially in non-Western countries, there will be a greater need for patients to self-manage their disease. In this study, fewer clinic visits were made per person in the patient-driven than in the physician-driven arm, suggesting that self-titration reduces healthcare utilization. In a similar trial in a Chinese population, patient-driven titration of BIAsp 30 was associated with less healthcare utilization and lower direct and nondirect costs compared to physician-driven titration, without compromising glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Key issues when deciding whether the patient or a physician should titrate insulin and in the success of patient-driven titration are the patients&#x02019; ability and motivation to manage their disease. This is influenced by factors such as age, socioeconomic status, health literacy and numeracy, and cultural aspects of healthcare in different countries. Poor health literacy and numeracy are associated with a low level of disease knowledge, fewer self-management behaviors, difficulty understanding titration instructions, and poorer diabetes outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Disease empowerment and education play significant roles in improving self-care behavior, quality of life, and outcomes in diabetes patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This study demonstrates that, after a 4-week training period, patients in non-Western countries are able to effectively and safely self-titrate BIAsp 30 using a predefined algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par58">This was the first randomized study to demonstrate that patient-driven titration of BIAsp 30 BID can be at least as effective and safe as physician-driven titration of BIAsp 30 BID in non-Western patients with type 2 diabetes that is no longer controlled with NPH insulin.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/D848F060741D0377">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/D848F060741D0377</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn><p>An erratum to this article is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-017-0275-2">https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-017-0275-2</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was funded by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark.
